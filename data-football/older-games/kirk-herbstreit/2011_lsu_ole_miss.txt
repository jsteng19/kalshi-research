============================================================

it is senior day here at Ole Miss and the number one team in the country comes to visit houston nutt rebels the Mad Hatter's is in town as Louisiana State University comes calling welcome to the SEC on ESPN and welcome to fought Hemingway Stadium it is rockin number one LSU taking on Ole Miss packing everyone I'm Bob with shoes and rod Gilmore and Janine Edwards will join us in just a moment and the reason rod is here tonight is because Bob Davie is not it's a night for congratulations and prayers going out to coach JV first of all the congratulations he was named the head coach of New Mexico this past week so coach Congrats on your new job he also is dealing with the illness of his father and he is at his bedside so coach not only our congratulations but also our prayers go out to you and your family hopefully coach Davy is able to watch right now also we know there will be a new coach here at Ole Miss next year Houston Nutt still has control of his team though as he has suspended Randall Mackey his quarterback and Jeff Scott arguably the best playmaker on offense for tonight's game a violation of team rules we welcome in rod Gilmore and rod not the best way to start for Ole Miss sitting down two offensive starters against arguably the best defense in the nation today yeah and a great secondary that's where the defense begins because they have to lock down corners and worth a burn and Tyrone Tyrone Matthew they make it possible for the rest of the defense to shut down the running attack here come the Tigers feels like soccer stadium here at the corner there are a lot of LSU fans at Oxford and they will find out shortly the Jordan Jefferson will be their quarterback today yeah my sense is that LSU is thinking down the line they need more offense in a better quarterback play and Jerry struggled against Alabama Jefferson gives them a little bit more athleticism and they're going to need scoring when they get to or Arkansas and Georgia you need Edwards was down on the field with the head coach let's mock what factor into your decision to shorten Jefferson tonight well we just think he's earned it and we're going to look to get Lee involved early situations a game we call under what circumstances will we see lakum and I think as early as the third series now you don't look last night you're now a believer in this rebel Tigers rivalry so closely I'm not saying that at all I believe that this football team is challenged by this approach that the rebels have taken to this game so yeah we're ready for rivalry play epithet game coach thank you all right Janine thanks very much moments ago on senior night the rebels the emotions I would assume rod as a former player if you were in that locker room your head coach has already been dismissed you know that but it's senior night you're playing against the number one team in the country what went on you think the moment ago inside there well it's pretty emotional I mean this is your last time with your teammates as a senior it's the last time you come out of that locker room at your home stadium you're feeling all of that you want to play well and you're on national television you want to play well for family and friends so it's a very emotional night for these guys and for Ole Miss with the suspension of Randall Mackey's they have a quarterback change of their own tonight so Zac stout welcome to the number one defense arguably in the nation yeah there's an easier way to play and it's not coming against this defense stout will be a more of a dropback passer you'll have less running from the quarterback position tonight that of Ole Miss normally gives you an Janine is standing by with you Stephanie from Jess you've taken the pulse of your team this week how would you assess them in light of the distractions over the last 10 days or so I think it's much better than last week for sure I thought they gave us a tremendous effort this week good focus on I'm hoping we take it to the field now was Iowa State's upset Ibaka home estate brought up at all today had a few guys pitching it to me they did they wanted a last night they watched it and it encouraged them a little bit now as you arrived here at the stadium today what were your emotions as you prepare for your final home game I'll tell you what we love this place we've done a lot of good things here and I tell you it's going to be a memorable win though we enjoy that last walk to the Grove have a great game coach thank you all right Janine thanks very much LSU won the toss they'll take the football to start the second half so they'll be kicking off to Ole Miss and as we said this is a team that travels pretty well as there was purple and yellow everywhere we looked all through Oxford over the past couple that incredible environment here tonight this stadium is packed their colors red and blue on one side purple gold other areas it is really fantastic James Hairston will kick it off for LSU Philander Morris back deep to receive for the rebels and it is a rebel scene invincibly that has struggled mightily so far this season finds his semen gets to the a good return by more close to the 40 yard line before he's bumped out cosplay born man to stop on special teams so the challenge for Zack stout last year at Iowa Western through 18 touchdown passes but this is far from a junior coming dimensional tonight this is if not Iowa Western this is the most confident defense in college football on the field before the game that defense those secondary players are intimidating and cocky a field position though to start Stout a bubble screen and it's trapped the under through Brassell will be second down at 10:00 exactly a confidence boost to start for the junior starting quarterback yeah you want to give your quarterback something easy to get the confidence going in and that's about as easy as you can get it and that one didn't work so expect there to be nerves for him early on here until he gets hit a little bit Brandon Bolden in motion out on second down at 10:00 outside the Bolden and he dropped the ball to Nate and Owen stick to your guns those are the kind of plays that are made if we take a look at today's defects chickfila young team and a young receiver outside Donte Moncrief really good for touchdown receptions this season he's going to have to make big plays since the running again attack is not what it used to be tonight Brandon Bolton will have to try and pick up some of the running attack because they don't have Jeff Scott in there he's suspended and you know about the honey badger on demons talk about impact player he had the knack for getting to the foot for LSU they intercepted books down the sideline you know defense scores the game's first boys they were able to get into their nipple packets they bring Brooks in and a young quarterback in experience puts one over the middle and you see Brooks coming from the left to the right taking it off that's just illadvised they had to wonder what he was looking at Ron Brooks season both pick sixes and Anshu ethylene welcome back to Oxford already 7nothing LSU is Ron Gilmore the Bayou Bango score on defense yeah third down long situation nickel package you'll see Brooks right here he's just going to take advantage of the fact that there is an overthrow over the middle instinctive as he comes back in he's just playing soft tone in there a poor pass by stout over the middle and Brooks to the house after that escorted by the honey badger that's the 15th interception by the LSU defense so far this season offensively they've only thrown three they are now on the season plus 16 in the turnover ratio well yeah and with a new quarterback and a new running back you can't afford to give up points that way last night though you were in Ames you would be the time killer again if it happened what a crazy sight that was last night Kaos has been tossed into the BCS based on last night's result this time he wanted to make it out to the 15yard line so terrible feeling position for Ole Miss Russell Shepard was downfield to make the stop for LSU on special teams for the problem for Ole Miss right now is that nothing went well forced out that opening drive so he's not any more confident now than he was before the game as a matter of fact he probably feels worse right now because of that opening series down inside the 15 they trying to keep it on the ground opposing he may have picked up a half yard Brandon Bolden was supposed to start the season as the goto back for Ole Miss and in the opener against BYU he suffered a fractured foot and has been in and out of the lineup all year and now he is down again on senior night Brandon Bolden injured in the opener and possibly injured in his senior year finale here in Oxford knievel omniauth courthouse in the heart of downtown Oxford terrific scene and it's rivet seen tonight heard vaughthemingway Stadium but it's been that kind of a year for Ole Miss only six in the SEC Andy on the season and Brandon Bolden their senior running back taking off of an ankle injury a moment ago and now it's second down intense down out of the shotgun the unprotected fires one of the sidelines that's a gain of maybe four yards this is verby Allen makes the reception and Bolden being worked on over on the sidelines ices ankle got caught underneath Kendrick Adams in San Montgomery yeah if you take a look at the way he goes down here with a couple of guys on and including Montgomery and Adams you can see it was that left ankle left leg third down and six hold this trying to keep the drive a lot fourman rush stout of the sideline to make the catch is Vincent Sanders and there was a pretty confident row not only a confidence throw a confident play and Brooks thought he had another pick and misjudgment now watch as you see this row here he hangs in here rose and grooving firmly but Brooks comes in thought he was going to have a shot at it sorry that snapped Brooks is actually Taylor who came in but they have to make plays down the field because LSU is really jumping all the short routes and wreak a davis up the middle and he might have fallen forward for about a yard and a half maybe two there's a flag down on the play as well Kevin intervenes first there for LSU oh boy that was a huge third down conversion though for old miss to turn it over on their first possession of the game for a pick six and then get that kind of the third down conversion that's a confidence boost asking the facemask 46 on the I think they get enter for a face mask as we check in with Ginny well Bob you know Les Miles says who can kind of relate to the situation as any cause it's an impossible situation the state when they only want four games on the year he said the most important piece is how do you want to be remembered it's personal he said that's the most difficult piece because without the view of a bowl game it becomes very difficult to motivate a team well Jane one thing we expected a motivation is tonight on national television against the top team in America and Enrique Davis goes on the middle for about a yard and half to make it second down and long round that was the point you made before the game well yeah I mean it's exactly what you want to do you want to find a way to motivate your players typically when you're losing your head coach I think the Houston Nutt situation is kind of hot you know you think about a guy who went to backtoback cotton bolls just a couple years ago to losing seasons and they're done with them that it just seems like there's got to be more to the story five wide on second down in a long eight close to nine for Ole Miss five man rushed out tries to beat it hot wrap to the right incomplete intended for Donte Moncrief that was a pretty good throw though from stout we've got his hands on it couldn't hold on now it's third down and couldn't throw better coverage by Simon out there Simon was all over Moncrief there's not much of a window that's what you get with this secondary I mean that's the key to this LSU defense they are so good on the back end it covers up for any mistakes or issues they may have in the front seven only a threeman front on third down and nine it's a fourman rush stop wanted to set up the screen now he tries to buy some time and he goes down at midfield he'll lose a couple of yards Brandon Chandler will get credit for the sample now it's all down to 12 a memory chain used to Knutson a bunion and is doubts problem is that this secondary doesn't respect the deep ball they believe that now has to throw the ball short to get confident and they aren't working everything right now ahran Matthew is back deep in about the 12 yard line to receive the punt Pantani Campbell it's a wobbly kick their catch ball four and bottled Matthew holds on just inside the 15 yard line so LSU has a seven nothing lead will see their offense and Jordan Jefferson and quarterback for the first time when we come back to Ole Miss our score LSU seven old Miss nothing as we continue dr. peppers road to the championships and it might be a road right through Baton Rouge and right down the road from New Orleans who knows for LSU as their offense takes the field for the first time tonight inside their own 15 yard line Jordan Jefferson bootleg on his first play whips it up the sidelines he's got first down and more breaking tackles his Rueben Randle and he's all the way up close to the 35 yard line Jordan Jefferson gives you that ability talk about a guy's big quarterback sixfive really run the football almost a thousand yards and he's mobile he gives you a little bit more than Lee does in that part of the game and I think that's the reason why they're getting him more time to get him ready for the postseason Jefferson lost the snap at about the 35 yard line these are the types of breaks that Ole Miss will have to have tonight if they recover a fumble but it will stay with LSU for the recipe rod for a possible upset would be breaks like that but LSU does well to get it back this Jarrett Lee looks up last night we saw Iowa State blow opportunities in the first quarter but hung around long enough to stay in the game that was a blown opportunity by Ole Miss they'll have to overcome that you saw that number only six giveaways all year on offense for LSU tied with Wisconsin for fewest in the nation Spencer we're right up the middle and he picks up about five it'll be fine let's take a look at her impact players for LSU brought to you by chickfila on the outside its random he's having a really productive season out there he touchdown passes he'll get chances tonight because there'll be a lot of blitzing done tonight where one of three running backs they use back there he's really been strong sharing time up there and then Charles Sawyer score free safety for Ole Miss is going to have his hands full dealing with the passing attack of the Blitz third down and five for LSU Jefferson blitz coming somehow gets away there goes Jordan Jefferson first down and more how did old Miss nut get the sack all the way down to the rebel 40yard line trying to wrap up a quarterback 65 225 230 and his athletic and can change direction you'll see the Blitz come from over here they have a chance to get there from that side got to wrap them up boy Tyrone Nix the defensive coordinator for old miss dial up the perfect blitz brought Siderius Bryant off the edge and Brian overruns Jordan Jefferson back to the ground and sirwhere moves the pile for five yards second down and five at the old Miss 35 Jordan Jefferson is the best in scrambling quarterback that LSU has ever had you talking about a guy who missed a lot of this season also think of the numbers he would have put up had he been the starting quarterback from day one instead of being suspended suspended at the start of the season for his involvement in a bar fight and late August his first start last week in the win over Western Kentucky now the toss wide before and Thor gets to the end still on his feet inside the 20 yard line to about the old miss 19 goes Michael Ford voting through and eventually spun them down this is an Ole Miss defense that believes it has to pressure has to blitz in order to make things happen and LSU is planning on taking advantage of getting to the outside and using the mobility of Jefferson to work the outside whether it's running or throwing and now it's Alfred blue the sophomore in at tailback behind Jordan Jefferson play action Jefferson rolling out buying time flips it to Beckham he's inside the ten down to about the six yard line Odell Beckham got loose it's another first down first and goal for LSU and let's take a look now at how LSU is doing in the red zone this year brought to you by Verizon and when you're 35 for 46 touchdown ratio that's pretty good pretty well yeah that's about 76 percent excellent is 80 percent so they are really really close to on the edge there and it's about touchdowns it's not fill goes you've got to get 80% or so touchdowns Spencer we're back in is the tailback first and goal at the 6 we're right up the middle to the oneyard line will be second down and goal when they get into a two back set I think that's when LSU is at their best Copelan at fullback makes a big difference a great lead blocker helps where helps for health glue whenever they change running back I think that's their best formation with Jefferson in there because of his ability to play action out of that now it's Kenny Hillier the true freshman checking in a quarterback or at running back pardon me but now LSU will take a timeout will step away for 60 seconds and come right back to Oxford ooh as they ran Kenny Hilliard true freshman tailback in and now have decided to go with Michael Ford and Kenny Hilliard in the I formation behind Jefferson second down and goal just inside the one and it's Hilliard leaping up over the top second effort across the goal line and he's in for the touchdown a nine Flay 86 yard touchdown drive rod that could have shortcircuited a couple of times if all misters could have made a play on defense yeah you know talking to coaches for LSU before the game they said you didn't think we were aware what happened last night 14 to nothing and Kenny Hilliard's with his fifth rushing touchdown of the season unless you making it look easier a terrific college football scene and it's college football primetime presented by Hampton hotels here in Oxford but it's been LSU and their contingent that's had the most cheer about so far 14 to nothing the Tigers on top Kenny Hilliard scoring that last touchdown he now has five rushing touchdowns Alfred blue Michael Ford Spencer where each had six rushing touchdowns a piece and oh by the way Jordan Jefferson can run one in from time to time it's a lot of different weapons for a team to have on the versatility and a powerful running attack now they've got to balance it out with throwing the football Lander more from the ten bounds at about the 26 a little extra after he goes out of bounds let's head back to reach Davis Bob Hughes in time for Taco Bell studio update Notre Dame in Boston College chase reading finding Bobby Swigert touchdown Eagles cutting to 1614 got to try the onside kick now that didn't go very well but BC has an opportunity a long way away probably too far away to get in for a David Gordon esque winner against the Fighting Irish is 1614 eight seconds left all right thanks a lot Reese well Tyrann Mathieu got an earful from Les Miles as that extra shove out of bounds just before we went back to the studio for the update did draw a personal foul flag so Ron Gilmour out to the 42 yard line for Ole Miss he's not the biggest guy on the field but he may be the most aggressive guy he doesn't back down from anyone Scout whips one of the sidelines it's incomplete and Matthew out there in coverage knocked it away from Vincennes Sanders it'll be second down and 10 if you watch Matthew before the game on the field pregame he is active he is confident he tries to impose his personality on the other team during warmups he's an aggressive player love his style no problem with that love his style talking to Les Miles about him though he kind of has that alter ego that he embraced when he was nicknamed the honey badger flips that switch there's no question second down at 10 wrassle motions into the backfield they'll flip it to him and the true freshman cut down a loss of five yards Brandon Taylor read it perfectly and brought him down and an injury update with Chitti old is back out on the field after rolling his left ankle they taped over what was already taped they even some ibuprofen but I can tell you he's going to take a heck of a lot more than a sprained ankle to keep him off the field not only is he a senior playing in his final home game here tonight but he's from Baton Rouge and was passed over by LSU that's great stuff Jeanine he's back in the game now Enrique Davis out there as well on third down and 15 low snap stout wants to set up the screen here comes the rush he lost the football and about the 27 yard line Ron Brooks already with a pick six now gets the strip sack and comes up with the fumble recovery Hayes already had a big night and the problem again for Ole Miss they're trying to do things to make stout comfortable short passes LSU knows it I mean they got the pressure that bring in the Blitz Brooks is coming in they're sitting on the short routes there's nowhere to go with the football and there's another turnover two more takeaways for the LSU defense on the season they are now plus 17 as a team in the turnover ratio Jefferson up the middle hurdles over to tackler and gets to the 22 yard line that's a pickup a four will be second down and six you know I'm wondering at the LSU defense has gained more yards than the Ole Miss office can close I think that young man right there has gained more yards in the game than anyone this pick sex was good for ya most of 50 yards on the return Jefferson pulls it back takes a shot at the end zone that's an LSU touchdown Russell Shepard his third touchdown catch of the season and the number one team in the country looking very much like it how good was that I mean he had a blitz coming right in his face he stared it down and threw a dart into the end zone to Shepard did not care about the pressure you start talking about how good this team can be they get quarterback play like that look out 21 to nothing still 5 11 to go in the first quarter I want you to take a look at the pressure that will come right here and watch what Jefferson does he rose off stairs it down doesn't flinch and throws a dart that's bigtime when they bring the Blitz right from the right place free shot at the quarterback Jefferson did not panic what does it say to you that he has now become the starting quarterback the past couple of weeks I mean is he now there guy I think so I think once you saw the Alabama game then watch his toughness you know he hangs in there that probably should have been flagged they got the face their turn that turn that head around Texas hey you got the whistle use it use the whistle that's what he's saying to him but I think the big point is they're thinking about Arkansas next Friday and Georgia in the SEC championship game and a national championship game and they can't afford to have a game where quarterback play is like it was against Alabama and they need his athleticism Hairston sends a D and this is best kick off so far more from inside the five this time he's been busy Philander more out to the 21 yard line on you can join host rece Davis analyst Kirk Herbstreit Craig James for pcs countdown Sunday night he'll unveil the latest BCS standings and allies who D contenders and pretenders are BCS countdown presented by Vizio on ESPN tomorrow at 8:15 Eastern and that show and the year goes on is going to start to look like selection sunday in college basketball where the poll now and it's going to be back and forth who we're going to be the one seats who's going to make it to the tournament who's going to be left out all these oneloss teams will be wondering that as exactly right as we take a look at here at Reid who's getting up off the field now I'm waiting to see what are the arguments and what are the tests that people will use to argue for a team that's that's going to be the interesting thing how do you justify Oregon Oklahoma or whoever Alabama and a quarterback change for old myths as Zack stout has turned it over twice so Barry brunetti the sophomore from right up the road Memphis was at West Virginia last year comes on and Enrique Davis and brunetti Burnett he started the first game of the season he was supposed to be their guy when Randall Mackey was suspended to open the year and he was pulled against BYU exact stout took over that game he's only played in three games this season and hasn't played much well he he fits the offenses dialed a little better than stout debts he's a little bit more mobile he gives them a little bit of a threat to run the football so that LSU will not know where the quarterback will be every single play lags down there should be a false start odds are 79 on the offense 25yard the right tackle Bobby Massey called for a fiveyard penalty so that will back up old miss and if you're houston nutt you felt like you had to make a quarterback change because style was back there things were not getting better and LSU just teeing off on berry Brunetti won backtoback state titles at Memphis University school back in oh wait no nine they were perfect both years his mom wanted him to stay close to home he chose Mississippi State but then switched and instead went to West Virginia mom was ill Bo's we got a release to come back home Brandon Bolden busts into the secondary and gets tripped up but that's a first down for all this now they've got the zones read that we've seen so much of in college football back in the office you get a chance to make sure that you just bring him inside read that defensive end open it up inside and Bolden gets a big hole that threat wasn't there with stop slow development Randolph on the end around the Brussels and he is brought down for over eight skin yard loss back inside a 25 yard line as we take a look at this week's BCS standings brought to you by Vizio this is not going to be what this looks like tomorrow got to change you're going to hear a lot of discussion about who's better who deserves to be number two between Alabama and Oregon assuming Oregon beats UFC tonight Oklahoma was hurt by the Oklahoma State loss because they needed Oklahoma State to be undefeated for Oklahoma to beat them and have an argument for jumping over the other one loft team Clemson gets walloped at NC State today looks like another false start will be called against Ole Miss Lockhart 75 on the offense 35 yard second down Ole Miss is just killing themselves with penalties and also trying misdirection plays again I have resulted in big losses against Patti Davis yeah yeah that's really not going to work not with the defense that is fast and disciplined these guys stay at home on the backside so it's hard to get them out of their responsibilities why wouldn't you you know the guy on the other side of the fields an allamerican that's going to be a pro to Sunday second and 25 those Brunetti to about the 30yard line gets them into at least a possible conversion distance it'll be third down and long third down in 14 well it's a good change you know this gives them the threat a threat they didn't have before they had no running attack the first two series now with brunetti in there there's something they can bring now the adjustment though you're going to see LSU play for that and bring more go to more man coverage now you got to have to throw the ball you have to complete passes here comes the Blitz on third and 14 quarterback draw there goes Brunetti he's got a first down Derrick Bryant trimmed among what none before bearing Brunetti scrambles for a first down when your quarterback runs you actually have one more blocker because you haven't handed the ball off to anybody and when you get man coverage now you're you're rocking a man on a man and if Fornetti can find a hole he's got something going you know we have to get Ally us on the phone right now how many times you think LSU's defense has given up a first down after they had someone at second and 25 this year that's next level stats down Boldin a half yard game to the 46 on the very penetration as a flag gets dropped in the secondary Ryan Baker made the stop but the flag dropped out well after the play was over unless you might have had 12 men on the field and they might have realized it late I think it was after the play was over that the back judge dropped the flag but it might have been too many men on the field nope chop block on Oh miss so again that is going to put old miss behind the chains there's Jarrett Lee we expect it to see him early in the ballgame third series was what used to not toge anine we could expect and that would be coming up their side number 16 on the offense penalty 15yard first down Les Miles not used to none so a 15yard penalty now it's first down in 25 as Jordan Jefferson might get a series or two often see how long Les Miles stays with Jared Lee if indeed Jared Lee does come in for the next series but talking before the game unless Miles said last week the reason that Jordan Jefferson started the game against Western Kentucky was it was practice reps practice performance and whatnot it was drugged us we're talking about practice yet okay that's the media answer what do you think the real answer is I think it's what we've been talking about all along and they're getting ready for the next couple of weeks and they want to have Jefferson ready and he's got to have reps in game time and have that experience of starting getting started all year and he was going to be the starter to start the season so they got him out there and they have him out there tonight as a starter they're getting him ready for the big games Boldin it's outside to the 38yard line before he is bumped out Derek Bryan on the stop so it will be second down in a mile I didn't think about you you made the point as we're talking earlier how do you take a guy who has started every game for you and then take him out of the starting lineup based on a couple of practices and that doesn't make sense clearly you would think the message is being sent but as you said for the bigger games and probably having to do with the performance of both quarterbacks in the Alabama game they think their road to the national championship goes mostly to Jefferson as Brunetti scrambles for two it'll be third down in a long 15 at the 40yard line for Ole Miss you know when if I take us to the end of the first quarter yeah but when you watch this defense on tape it really jumps out at you that the secondary dominates things and that if you're going to have any success against this defense you have to be a physical run oriented team to challenge that front seven if you expect to make your money on the back end it's not going to happen well the back end started it for LSU they lead 21 2008 was Ron Brooks his second fixings of the year that got LSU on the board at first then the run game did it and the passing game as well as Jefferson it is a college football night in the SEC here in Oxford and the first quarter dominated by LSU table shoes and Rob Gilmour Janine Edwards watching the second quarter open up with Barry brunetti on third and 15 checking down to Brandon Bolden that will be an Ole Miss punch the defense for LSU it is as advertised well it begins there I mean they play so aggressively on defense they start getting things for the offense they make it happen they are so attacking on the back end and a very confident group I don't think you get the sense of how confident they play unless you're in the state Stadium and down on the field with them they are really something out there talking to their defensive coordinator John Chavis as this punt will come down at about the 12 yard line of Matthew when he breaks a tackle makes another tackle runs into his own man at the 30yard line and that's where LSU will begin after we check in again with Reese all right Bob when th uptodate on what's going on in the pac12 UCLA still in the mix and that mess it is to pac12 South UCLA against Colorado Kevin Prince to Jack Evans for the touchdown Jonathan Franklin's added another 114 nothing Bruins on top it's 21 nothing Reese LSU on top of Ole Miss and what has been a nightmare season for the rebels and a dream season so far for LSU a big reason why the young man at quarterback now Jarrett Lee he'll hand one off to Alfred blue on first down and blue will pick up about five yards as we check our numbers rod Gilmore from the first quarter and takeaways turning into points the bread and butter for LSU defensively and that was a major factor in the person by the way today's game they converted everything I mean we talked about Brooks and what he did he made two big plays quick hitch to Odell Beckham and he is very close to an LSU first down looks to be about a half yard shy will be third down and a foot but a tough position you have to think for Jarett lee and they've made the commitment it seems to play him in these games he didn't get into the Western Kentucky game until the fourth quarter steps it in place of Jordan Jefferson to start the year is the unexpected starter and he plays beautifully 14 touchdowns three interceptions gets them all the way to the Alabama game undefeated starts off shakily and then it becomes a changing to the garden the toss to the outside of Michael Ford on third down and he's bumped out short II Pruitt comes up to make the stop it'll be fourth down in the yard no one goes for it on fourth down more than less files when he do that inside his own 40yard line you know he probably feels like he could could get a get away with it but no need to do it here his defense is playing great but how about Pruitt I mean that was great anticipation I'm surprised that LSU went outside considering the success they've had inside but Pruitt anticipated made a great play the conversation between miles and Jared Lee almost makes it looks like the quarterback might have eaten Jim Steyer made a mistake as Philander more fields it inside the 15yard line and goes down right there Brooks is everywhere he makes the stop on special teams will step aside rod Gilmore that's basically the story of the first quarter here's the Ron Brooks show he got the pig sticks got a sack and a strip to set up the offense for LSU early in the second quarter now the fifth possession of the game for Ole Miss berry brunetti under pressure stings towards the goal line and get thrown down you cannot hold the football back young quarterback didn't recognize that you gotta get rid of the football second sack of the season for Michael brokers and he gets them at the oneyard line well now count this just counted way too much time your line can't fold up for three and a half seconds that's a 13 yard loss they lose the ball in the end zone on a track handoff and it looks like LSU half recovered for a touchdown the lander Moore couldn't get the exchange and it looks like Kevin Minter comes up with the fumble recovery for a touchdown already three turnovers some of them leading directly to defensive touchdowns for LSU yeah I don't understand that why would you do so much ball handling deep in your own end zone when you really haven't had much offense you need to try and wedge that ball out of there is it me or did Philander more not even look like he was supposed to be given the ball by brunettes must look like brunette he was surprised that he was there has run of that fly sweet thing I don't know if he anticipated it or not but that's that's a difficult play to run deep in your own endzone can't imagine it would have called for a jet motion handoff three yards deep in the end zone but it's another LSU touchdown ESPN college football primetime brought you by Expedia the best travel tools are all in one place where you book matters Expedia and Dunkin Donuts America runs on Dunkin there is nothing better than clogging your arteries at Enders grocery and restaurant some of the best catfish just outside consider nine o'clock after today this is the best by the way they were closed Sunday to watch Eli beat the Patriots and you can see Eli's signature up at the top that's from the Super Bowl it's awesome where the Giants ended the perfect season of the New England Patriots a few years ago and Archie Manning by the way is heading up the fiveman committee he is one of the cochairs of the committee that is going to pick the next head coach here at Ole Miss rise up from the fiveyard line we'll bring this one back he's got LSU chemistry slips and falls at the 36 but back to the touchdown run we were right the play was not designed the way we anticipated it was yes his mistimed watched more 22 come into your picture the timing is off he gets in the way of what was supposed to be a handoff to Davis that was simply going trying to wedge the ball out but because of the timing miscue there Moore got in the way of the handoff and that caused the fumble in the end zone it seems like a strange play to run in your ends absolutely well the last time LSU recovered a fumble in an end zone for a touchdown against Alabama 1997 Chuck Wiley did it cocaine on first down before moving in Bouldin so already three takeaways by the LSU defense two of them directly four defensive touchdowns and old miss averaging about a yard man it is a young Ole Miss team probably going to be pretty good for the next coach but playing this defense with your third string quarterback your second string running back that's not a good deal young receivers on the outside fourman rush on second and 10 in Brunetti crying for his life picks up about three yards it will be third down and seven after we check in with Geneva well guys if you've been looking for Tiger Safety Eric Reid out there he is done for the night they actually took him to the locker room about 10 minutes ago complaining of pain in his right quadricep they say they're not sure exactly what is wrong with him but he had some sort of a thigh bruise but since they're up 28 to nothing they said you know what they're just going to rest him and call it a night you know they certainly want him back they've got that Arkansas passing attack next week when any on third and seven fires a strike over the middle that's good for a first down for all this to the 46 yard line of LSU again it's Vincent Sanders on the resumption with Sanders beat the man coverage that's what you're going to have to do you see him find a man a man would Simon he gets inside he beats the man coverage in the balls on time notice that they're staying away from working against Claiborne or Matthew they're working against the the leastexperienced guy over there Simon one deep safety for LSU and now false start looks like fur BIA Allen the tight end give off hard 83 on the offense 25yard first down you mentioned that one deep safety you see that one deep safety and you see play Bourne and Matthew up in the face of the receivers they are challenging and daring you they're telling you right off the bat we're playing man coverage we don't think you can beat us and we've got a center fielder back there to help if we need it but we don't think we need the help for penalties now for 29 yards for old myths and now it's first and 15 by Action Brunetti awesome time and he could take off and he will gets about half the yardage he needs seven yard game love the Heisman doctors we bring you our Aflac trivia question for tonight 2007 who defeated number one LSU and who was the head coach that's a good one I like that question any question it makes me think it's a really good number we want the folks back in Baton Rouge watching us to think about it I didn't pick the question I know they're probably ranging back there they don't about that I'm gonna have to apologize it's just a question tries to find a cutback spot can't do and run down for a loss so about a half yard as we check in the fries all right Bob diver SportsCenter right now presented by Discover card Eagles and giant Sunday Michael Vick and Jeremy Maclin out for that Sunday night game ribs for Vick shoulder and hammy for Macklin could be Vince Young situation maybe Mike calf out of Northwestern Georgia took care of the SEC East dogs were pretty tight knowing they could clinch against Kentucky they hang on to win the SEC but leaving the cats 19 to 10 well Reese LSU has been anything but tight tonight they lead 28 to nothing third down and long and brunetti on a keeper crawls for about three yards actually he'll be worn down at the 42 fourth down and six and here comes the button they want to get after you they're not afraid to bring the pressure right inside and mentors guy that can do it they come right in a hurry that you just disrupt this way and when you've got guys that can play man coverage you can really come after folks with glitches with your linebackers our math you need to receive the fun from Campbell Amba will send a line drive bouncer down inside the ten yard line and it goes out of bounds at the five ugly but effective Gilmore for iron that goes out of bounds of the five LSU to 28 on the lead back at Ole Miss 28 to nothing number one LSU leading the rebels midway through the second quarter and Jordan Jefferson back in a quarterback for the Tigers of their own 5yard line boss dispenser where close to the eight yard line a gain of three cartons market made the stop for all this and place election so far the interesting what is led to a twenty eight to nothing lead for the most part LSU it's been their defense scoring in their ground attack or they've been efficient and they haven't had to throw an awful lot but Jefferson threw a touchdown pass in that first quarter this offense hasn't had to open it up tonight because the defense has done so much Aaron Lee back on the sideline Spencer we're now in at tailback for LSU Jefferson from the goal line will throw looks a wide open flame off the sideline his plane loss got a first down about the 19 yard line it's time now to answer our Aflac trivia question back in 2008 LSU and who was the head coach when they were number one used to nut and a thriller when coach not was at Arkansas with the Razorbacks triple overtime a twopoint win he knew the LSU fans knew that the sidelines close to another first down fighting his way for a gain of 11 s D'Angelo Petersen they mention Houston now they ain't dealing with 12 straight SEC losses and after his first couple of seasons cotton bolls both both years two very subpar years he's out the door and you got to think the next coach who comes in is going to like the talent gun like the freshman class that they have here and the facilities in life but rebuilding town jeferson to throw again on first end well protected find some more time then let's take off down the sideline and step out of bounds at the 32 yard line for a gain of a couple ins we check in with Jim Bob you and rod have been talking about the coaching search for Houston s replacement and you mentioned Archie Manning well the group the search committee has met physically one time last Saturday but since then they've not given any update other than our PSA he's done about 25 emails from fans wanting his son 80 managed to take over at the head cochair of the rebels and he passed it on to Peyton and Peyton said they might want to rethink that because so far I'm Owen 10 as an assistant it's a good point second and six of the middle goes Kenny Hilliard about a yard shy the first down it'll be third down and one and if there was ever the definition of an MVP but if you could ever give an MVP to a player who doesn't play who is there a better than a study to point to the Peyton Manning truly being the MVP of any team in any sport then this year they go from being at perennial 10 11 12 one team to not wanting a game this year without but marks Lera our marks Laird forever set without Peyton Manning that's a three and thirteen team he's clearly wrong there are winless team but toss to the truth respite and he moves the pile for an LSU first down plenty of good quarterbacks to watch on Monday Night Football over the next couple of weeks Super Bowl MVP quarterbacks abound not warm in place for the Chiefs mind you but Tom Brady plays for the Patriots that's coming up on Monday and then elion Drew Brees square off giant Saints that should be a good one yeah November 28th nice matchup and quarterbacks tere liye staking his claim to being a top tier quarterback Jefferson now runs the option that picks wide to Michael's for he hammers his way to mid field you notice the difference in the offense when Jefferson is in versus lead it's a little bit more dynamic they're willing to run option they're willing to do zone read they're willing to remove the pocket and let Jefferson get outside that's not the case with wait now Lee did well up into the Alabama game and there are things he can do well he can sit in the pocket he can throw the ball there just a bit more dynamic offensively when they have Jefferson and I think you can make the argument they're a lot more dynamic when they've got him in there now he's in the gun on second down at two looks it to a wideopen for the open field and forged up to the plus territory gets bumped out but he's got a first down to 47 whole messaging checking again Patrice all right Bob Tennessee in Vanderbilt and state rivalry on ESPNU and the volunteers have Tyler brave back listen James with a hand injury finds Derrick Rodgers Vanderbilt try to become bowl eligible Tennessee has to win out order to finish at 500 well if LSU wins a breeze we know where they'll be and that'll be right down the road in New Orleans to play for the whole thing next week the game Arkansas LSU they've got two big games left the SEC championship game since behind Arkansas trap had gone to Alfred blue about seven more yards to the 40yard line about this time now for our SEC conference update brought to you by Dr Pepper ten and closer look at the SEC scoreboard from earlier today I'm not Florida they were down at one point twenty two to seven in the swamp right there Arkansas you just dissed Arkansas by putting LSU in the championship game against Georgia Arkansas sill still has something to say about that Jefferson bullets one to the sidelines that looks like a completion Odell Beckham he's got it at the 35 yard line what a year he's had he came in true freshman and did a great job right from the start never had any moment being too big for him he's just a young player with a lot of poise has no trouble being aggressive against a defensive back and finding a way to get open that's a good hard physical route against a good hard defensive back Jefferson is perfect seven for seven for 88 yards and a touchdown and now is zero blitz jump by Ole Miss no deep safety and right up the middle of no team safeties go Spencer where well if you bring your own defense up to the line of scrimmage there's no one home if you find a crease no second line of defense you get through that initial line and that's all she wrote and Spencer where took it to the house Spencer we're with a seventh rushing touchdown of the season take a look at this that is all wide open why because the safeties are there and if that's what you have you've got a problem especially if your linemen don't get off the blocks in that LSU backfield there touchdown totals looks like the race for the NASCAR Sprint Cup you wonder who's going to win at the end of the year that Spencer where now takes the lead he's got seven touchdowns on the season Ford at six Blue has six Hillier even has five a lot of weapons on that LSU often which football primetime on ESPN presented by Hampton hotels Bobbo shoes and rod Gilmore Janine Edwards back in Oxford where old miss has had tonight's game go much like the rest of their season has gone taking on number one LSU and Jordan Jefferson and the LSU offense has been just as good as the defensive has been and they have built a 5 touchdown lead as we come down to the last three minutes before halftime rod Gilmore was in Ames last night and didn't bring any of that upset magic down south no magic deaths for you not even a little bit but if you had knocked off number two and number one in backtoback nights though Vasil picks up the drop ball about the 12 yard line and escapes to the 22 just three points separate Carl Edwards Tony Stewart heading into the final race for the championship and now they'll go head to head for NASCAR's ultimate prize the chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup concludes with these four 400 at homesteadmiami coverage begins tomorrow at 2:00 Eastern p.m. and rod Gilmore before the game expertly was breaking down this matchup for us because I had a problem I don't like the way the story goes Stewart has won four times you know you win for time this thing should already be over it's all like women's tennis how can you be number one without winning a major doesn't make sense and involved in looking for some Running Room it finds in down the sidewalk that's out of balance at about the 32 yard line it's my duty to fix all the improper scouring in all of sports and I'm not going to take on the BCS I'm just wondering yet where you're going to be two Sundays from now and I'm going to fuel those one long when they get left out what they have to say you know we need we need to develop a test a standard for looking at these oneloss teams that everyone can agree on at least everyone has an opinion well obviously the desk arm you don't understand the system but the human poles love Carl Edwards Tony Stewart is huge in the computer stuff on first down to maybe a half yard for Bolden is to take a look at the remaining oneloss teams yeah and since Oklahoma State lost most recently although I do believe the extenuating circumstances for that loss for them they will probably fall somewhat significantly Alabama Oregon the best argument so far Oklahoma hoping to have one everyone else have it they have issues in trying to argue to be in that title game Stanford lost Oregon Virginia Tech really tough loss to Clemson and Arkansas as you mentioned number six stumbling away from centers Brunetti and he goes down selfimposed stack back to the 26yard line as we check in again Makris alright Bob coming up on the Wendy's halftime report some division clenches his team's work their way to their conference championship games USC and Oregon squaring off ducks to move into the pac12 championship game and also keep their national title hopes alive very early announcing we'll keep you uptodate there and also the oneloss scramble you guys were just talking about mark and Lou will be here we'll sift our way through that one of those oneloss teams fell by the wayside today and last night if you count now as a oneloss team Oklahoma State falling by the wayside but here's the question that I would throw to use Don Gilmore as LSU by the way call the timeout so that's why we have stopped play with 144 to go before halftime we have earned the argument from multiple sides as to whether or not we should see if Peters in the phone's warranted a rematch would you want to see Alabama LSU again and my point is no one ever says anything about what would be in Oregon LSU rematch LSU is already beaten both of those teams how come Oregon should have a right to a rematch of Alabama dela that's why I made the point that we need to talk about what are the factors drones third and 16 in Brunetti gets loose it makes a big play very brunetti villainous be let her run inside the thirty all the way down to the 27 yard line that is some effort from the backup quarterback for Ole Miss and wakes up the crowd come with Miss tangos in there but again brunetti this is the element he brings to the office you see him break off this draw play which they've run about three or four times tonight but it's great change of direction that's the running skill he has that helps this offense now if they can mesh that with some passing they have a chance to score some points right now the passing attack hasn't been been he's been the offense with his feet and that offense hasn't generated any points hold this now will spend the time out as Barron Brunetti is up 266 yards rushing here in the first half a 44 yard run there so actually LSU trying to call timeout to preserve some time before third down to give them a chance to score before halftime did Ole Miss a favor in the end helped the rebels have a little bit of extra clock here as they are now inside the 30yard line well and you want to go into halftime on a positive note if your home is you're looking for small victories you're not talking about you know can we get 14 points in hurry can we get 35 how do we catch up you're looking for first downs and you're looking for the first score anything positive to take into the locker room is something you might be able to build on you don't worry about the scoreboard right ready to the outside our game for Vincent Sanders and stop the blockages we bump down on the 22 by Matthew plenty of time from home is to get something on the board just to finish the point on the oneloss teams we didn't mention Arkansas I mean everything changes it Arkansas eyes on LSU inflation everything it comes up in the air almost the same level of shock waves that would be sent through the BCS as last night's game no gang it'll be third and five and we'll see if all misfits another time out here to talk about the third down play and they will he's done involved that time out for the sidelines we will step aside for 30 seconds and come back with third down and five for Ole Miss at a moment moment with a minute 16 to go before halftime a little bit of momentum for Ole Miss third down and five at the LSU 22 they could go draw play again couple down to play with the net he wants to put this one up he'll throw it towards that back right corner of the end zone through the hands of Vincent Sanders he almost had over the top of Matthew so now it's fourth down and five and it looks like Houston Nutt will try to at least get 3 as Bryson Rose will come out to attempt a field goal well if you can put points on the board at least helps someone on your office helps you kicker gives you something to go into the locker room and talk about and build on and not worry about the score that's the important thing for used to Nutt how you play the game right now just under a 40yard attempt for roles is 7 per night on the season he's got it all this gets on the board just over a minute to go here in the first half is in encouraging his players that that's a win he counts that as a win you had a drive from your own territory you brought it down the gap points he wants to use that to build on going into halftime 56 yards on the last Drive for Ole Miss they had 60 yards of total offense the first half before that dry it's almost double their number yeah well we talked about it early on too if you're going to make a shot it up at a number one team you can't turn the ball over you can't make kind of mistakes that they made right off the bat they put themselves in such a big hole in the first two minutes of the first quarter let it senior day here at Ole Miss and so before the game Brandon Bolden a handshake for Houston Nutt honored with his family on the field one of the more inspirational players on this team Kentrell Lockett who was granted a sixth year by the NCAA after tearing his ACL in week four last year and he has at a very disappointing senior season no sacs this year for Kentrell Lockett as he had ten tackles for loss two years ago eleven and a half tackles for loss in 2008 but it's hard when you're playing against a D on a defense that has struggled the way they have this year to stop the run he's never really in pass rushing situation but you know the thing is when you're done and the game's over your teammates those will be the people you remember five 10 15 years from now this moment still is really important regardless of the kind of season these guys have had Morris Playboy returns out to the 15 where he's brought down 58 seconds to go on the first set and let's check in with Janine well Bob Kentrell Lockett was one of the seniors who took Houston nuts firing especially hard and he said the team has had a lot of trouble focusing this last week or so because of the coaching staff change he said it's been a tough pill to swallow well I think Ginny you're right this is an unusual situation when I when a head coach is fired normally he leads he's replaced he's not around continuing happy to explain to it's our we're for about two yards and a little bit of pushing and shoving after the whistle is Damien Jackson gets into it with Jason Copeland you've got a head coach that the players have access to every day to talk to and you have assistant coaches or looking for their next job and so all that creates a lot of uncertainty Dean's as we write about what Lockett had to say that's the impact that they have on a daily basis all two team the last week lost 27 to 7 at home to Louisiana Tech and it was amidst all of what any was talking about the uncertainty they had no idea who their coach was going to be dispenser where about the 27yard line and that should end the first half so a field goal before halftime for Ole Miss gets them on the board but the scoreboard certainly tells the story LSU with a couple of touchdowns defensively and they will get the ball to start the third quarter a basically flawless first half for Jordan Jefferson you saw Ron Brooks there as well he had a pick six in a strip sack a lot went wrong for Euston nuts team and he's with Geneva hotel important wanted to put some points on the board here before half really important you couldn't have started any worse than the way we started had a good team seven points how do you keep your team motivated now it's got to go in here talk to them tell me let's finish you think they're motivated right now oh it's hard to summer say by the school right now but lotta more playing horn thanks coach all right Janine thanks very much it's halftime here in Oxford let's go back to Rhys smart and Lou in the studio with the halftime report start up the third quarter here in Oxford and Les Miles LSU Tigers in the first half thirty five to three their defense scoring twice the takeaways the biggest early momentum changer as jared lee and jordan jefferson both played in the first half but jefferson the far more productive quarterback he was basically perfect seven four seven with a touchdown and rod Gilmore takeaways creating three touchdowns for LSU well clearly the LSU defense set the tone early on in the ball game of pick six and the like they had things going talked about setting that zone it was the turnovers it started with Brooks Brooks got this right off the bat there's your pick stick to start the game he had a fantastic first quarter he gets to sack a strip and recover and that's followed by a touchdown pass and Shepherd from Jefferson and in the most bizarre play on the missed watched in the endzone resulted in a touchdown a defensive touchdown to LSU let's start the third quarter with the football muscle Shepherd back teeth to receive the kick that's a good one drop from three yards deep about bringing it out but he'll take a knee with Radha baba shoes Janine Edwards is with us here as well in Oxford you saw magic happened last night at Ames didn't quite bring that same magic down to Oxford and lunch to this may a bonus rebel fans but I think we knew there was a chance that Oklahoma State might be a little vulnerable they aren't the best defense in the world it's hard to find holes in this LSU team particularly the way they're starting to come on offensively the quarterback spot Jefferson playing great tonight dearly playing well if that keeps up this team's going to be really hard to be because they are sound defensively Jefferson to start the second half a quarterback as well hands it off to Alfred blue about five yards not on LSU offensively about the passing attempt the inability to make intermediate and deep broke and that's what they have to get squared away for dealing with Arkansas and Georgia down the line assuming they get to Georgia it's the blue turns on the chips he's down the sidewalk breaks a tackle does he stay inbounds the officials don't mark him out he's all the way down to the 18 yard line of all this before he's taken down he might be shaken up what a job he did to stay in bounds and the trainer's ought to come out and take a look at our glute again it's that option play to the outside they will use him read the defensive end and there he is blue great blocking down the field by their wide receivers getting a nice job done out there which opens up the hole and it did look like he stayed about stepped out there looks that way but that's that right the white shoe near the white endzone but from the other angle it's clear he was still in bounds man officials right on top of it and they might have to go to replay review just to see if there is an angle that might show definitively whether or not he stayed inbounds because you're right about 15 yards were so further up the field from where he was tackled it looks like you might have touched the sideline but more importantly it looks like the training staff was working on the inside of that left knee Alfred blue had a terrific game last week against Western Kentucky 119 yards two touchdowns and talking to the coaching staff is past week you're looking to see that one's hard to tell you can't tell this foot is mush or if there's a little bit of space now this angle is not as clear an angle from this spark point of view but it does look there from that angle like he's out of bounds but if the you want to overturn it it has to be indisputable video evidence it's hard to say that either of those looks were indisputable looks like the playlist and a 57yard game for blue they were the option before episode of pizza it's up about the yard map brought down by Justin Smith as we check in with Jenny well Bob left miles told me that they only had about 20 offensive snaps in the first half and he said our plan for the night plan is that he said what we want to be more balanced on offense with more running and he said we will see some younger players including a third quarterback but mostly he said I want this team to finish with the same angry attitude they started with engineid we might even see Zach Mettenberger before the nights over they set up the plan went as fall for you might see the third string quarterback was this time Jordan Jefferson gets shut down behind the line lost about two yards so it'll be third down and 11 you know what I'd like to see LSU I'd like to see them throw the football field and know there are 35 degrees but I think Johnson needs the work of being in the pocket he's going to have to do next week against Arkansas I think he needs that doing that against live competition the passing down here third down and 11 and the pigeons stand to Michael for for inside the 10 touchdown LSU you but he should go find Rueben Randle and thank Ruben random the his wide receiver gave them a great brought down the field that opened up that sideline for him and the inside Alomar with the extra point and it is forty two to three LSU on top of all of this this doesn't count as a touchdown fast I guess but it did the job hey how about that block right there by random that is the thing that opened it up for the touchdown run for four we're in for both with a rushing touchdown tonight along with the true freshman Kenny Hilliard he has a rushing touchdown Jordan Jefferson has a touchdown hookup with Russell Shepherd and LSU's defense to score twice all part of a 42 to three lead over Ole Miss those three bags are all soft young productive running backs and they can interchange remainder of the season Lander Borg from about the six stops can't get restarted brought down at the 23yard line as we check in with Chitti guys you just talking about the great running backs for the Tigers well they'll be without Alfred blue for the rest of tonight because on that play where he was down there on the sideline looks like he pulled a hamstring a little bit but they're going to hold him out for the rest of the evening back don't smile is a good sign though and it's still a pretty good stable to be able to go to without Alfred blue but talking to Gregg's to draw loose the offensive coordinator for LSU he said he's never been a part of a team where he didn't really care who carried the ball before he came down less you every other team he's been a part of as Bouldin looks for yardage and doesn't find much every the team is coached for he was always going into a gameplan saying here's the guy that we have to make sure we get carries well he said not only does he have these three but he also has Kenny Hilliard he also has another true freshman in Terence McGee's he basically said I've got five guys that I feel absolutely fine putting in the game and giving the football well you want production from the spot and in this day and age with the kind of pounding that backs take if you can have more than one that's a luxury that's what you need that's what you need when you have injuries guys nicked up so that depth is important many outside the Jamal Moseley for about six maybe seven yards will be third down and short you know watching this LSU team you know it's clear it's a really good team but mentally emotionally it's a tough team think about all the things they've overcome suspensions injuries cracked North having market is going from the coordinator to the quarterback coach linked into duties this team has dealt with an awful lot that's cracked off right there Brunetti on a keeper gets to the edge and the first time you add all those offthefield issues to going to West Virginia getting a win playing Oregon's getting away going to Tuscaloosa getting a win that toughen a team all those things hardens a team now in your opinion is Les Miles going to have to settle on one quarterback I think he is settling on one quarterback I think he's moved into the Jordan Jefferson camp and I think Lee is now his doctor in spite of what he's saying yes because that's not what he's saying publicly it's certainly not what he said after the Western Kentuckian game last week brunetti bubble screen to catch the ball coming up to break it up his fat dude he's looking for an opportunity to get himself a pic since why do you think that in spite of the fact that Les Miles is saying that both quarterbacks deserve to play that they're both a big part of why they're here and both are going to get the opportunity why do you think at some point the Jordan Jefferson is going to be a 60minute gun they started him last week they started him this week he got the quality snaps to begin the game almost all the snaps last week I think they're getting him ready and he will be the starter in a big game like Arkansas now he is effective her nanny it is he throws unloads to Jamal mostly and he was unloaded upon my Brandon Taylor Taylor came on a safety blitz from the edge and buried brunetti hybridity stood in there been a good truck they did I mean there's the blitz from the outside on the corner once again Taylor coming in I like that play by Brandon Taylor that was a clean hit yeah that was not designed to try and blow the quarterback up that to me that's not as classy a play as a safety can make on an untouched black board coaches are teaching guys to hit from the numbers down and not at the head and they should third down and one Davis falls right to the first down marker is right on our first down line this might happen by the nose the football yeah just to finish the point on Jefferson the other thing we talked about that you noted they are more diverse when Jefferson's the quarterback and is explosive yeah I think they're going to need that next week and I think I think that coaching staff believes that they need that and the other thing they know Jared Lee can come in and throw the football and play well they know that he's done that for them before well don't you also think that the style of quarterback that Lee is as they are about six inches short so it'll be fourth down in inches and maybe used to not goes for it down 42 to 3 but the style of quarterback that Jared Lee is is kind of a managed the game guy get it to your running backs be efficient and lends itself to being more of a backup quarterback that can coming off the bench and maybe Thea's productive yet as he would have been had he started where's Jefferson I think that's a guy that needs to start and play I play his best he also give Arkansas nightmare defensively they are going to go forward on 4th down and inches sneak by brunetti and he definitely has the first half so Ole Miss converts on fourth down and they move the chains I'm just really impressed with the metal this LSU team on the field before the game again some of their coaches remarked they were aware of last night's game they watched that game and is that their team took that to heart they would be prepared tonight there would be no letup and there wasn't from the very start baby maybe 1/2 yard when no matter how skinny you are running backs might be you cannot beat the speed of the LSU defense to the edge that's on levar Edwards was there to force Bolden back up inside Logan another play as well I do like the young talent on his Ole Miss team they've played a lot of freshmen they've got freshmen wide receivers you can see that they are athletic they're just having trouble getting the ball down the field protecting the quarterback and throwing the football or Brunetti tricycle underneath that's incomplete intended for Enrique Davis only third down and nine got pretension that time and her nanny had time but couldn't find anyone down the field nobody open and then misfired when he came to his outlet receiver but when you get protection against his LSU team you have to convert down tenth play of the drive coming up and they still have yet to reach midfield it's hard to do sir down at nine and now they have to call timeout with the play clock winding down timeout on the field will step aside as well you're an Oxford official partner of the Heisman Trophy and the new Citi simplicity card get started at Citi simplicity calm some of the legends of Ole Miss football obviously a couple of guys named Manning play Porter back here also you saw pictures of Jake Gibbs an allamerican quarterback went on to play for the Yankees and of course John fought on three national championships here and has his name on the stadium brunetti running for his life trying to get back to the line of scrimmage on third down and long and couldn't do it and so now it's fourth down and about 12 our key vyas Mingo done by Sam Montgomery got in the backfield and brunetti had nowhere to go notice that they bring pressure including Tyrann Mathieu from the left side they use him in that spot when they line him up as a Nickelback inside they're not afraid to blitz him on the quarterback so he can make a big play six sacks now for maybe my favorite game in college football Barkevious Mingo you love it up line drive kick down the far sideline again Tyler Campbell defective picked up by Matthew Jitterbugs out to about the 25yard line and a reminder Sunday NFL countdown has returned this season with a new start time of three hours net of the best in the business all the guys boomer Keyshawn coach Ditka Tom Jackson Chris Carter Chris Mortensen Adam Schefter they're all there tomorrow morning to bring you the latest updates from stadiums around the league right up until kickoff Sunday NFL countdown presented by IBM ESPN Sunday at 10 a.m. Eastern guys do a great job that's a great show fantastic we've got Jared Lee back in at quarterback Les Miles heard our conversation Spencer where about the 29yard line for a gain of three said quest Colson came on to make the stop I was interested talking to Gregg the draw of the offensive coordinator about Jarrett Lee he said he's been here with him the whole way such a great story this is a young man that has a redshirt freshman when he wasn't ready to play quarterback back in 2008 had to play because Ryan Parra Lou was kicked off the team so he throws 16 interceptions that year and gets a lot of flack from the fans and now having an opportunity to play this year has been terrific trap handoff and he Hillier to midfield as we check in with rece I want to keep your finger on the primetime pulse many watching USC in Oregon on ABC Matt Barclays thrown two touchdown passes and the Trojan defense is stifled the Ducks so far 14 nothing USC on espn2 Virginia and Florida State tied at 7 Virginia if it wins have an opportunity to play Virginia Tech winner that game would go to the ACC title game in Vanderbilt in Tennessee on ESPNU now 10 7 Florida State by the way obviously we'll keep our eyes on that Oregon score as well they're one of the teams fighting to play against LSU Michael Ford for about four more yards but runs to draw has said that if he were Jared Lee he might have thought about transfer yeah but all that he went through I might have thought that maybe the best move for me after that freshman year that I really got a lot of heat from the media the fans might be let me go someplace else and get a fresh start a new slate quarterbacks do any hung in yeah most quarterbacks rewarded this year well you know he's a son of a coach he's a guy who's disciplined he he believes in finishing things you know that's just his character but a lot of karate guys leave and move on when it gets tough six yard line five yards on first down brings up third down Golson on the stop again let me ask you this where would LSU be if Jefferson had been suspended and Lee had not been here well they wouldn't be where they are exact obviously exactly and maybe less miles feel some obligation to Jared Lee to make sure he continues to be a part of it well I mean what deal that to your football team that's a difficult situation well I think it's also a little bit of a trust issue third down and five we're right up the middle and he's got a first down lost the ball but down before the ball popped out how some trusted the trust issue they've had problems with Jefferson I mean he was suspended because of our filter issues and you'd like to think it wouldn't happen again but you may have a little bit of doubt and then secondly you run him a lot he's a running quarterback you might getting banged up and if that's the case if that happens you have to have Jared Lee ready to step in and do a good job for you as he's done before four hops back to the left stays on his feet what a run before as he puts up eight of the hardest yards we scheme a running back come up with this year Charles Sawyer eventually helped bring them down but Ryan Bennett look like might've had him at the line this is a heck of a run yeah and if you're Ole Miss you want to see guys play hard and finish then his place make good clean tackles hang in there and the you're not wrapping up there bouncing off guys may where just bounced off a couple of guys who didn't wrap up and we see way too much of guys trying to knock folks down with their shoulders instead of wrapping up now it's Kenny Hilliard in and tailback on second down and three why down that might be delay of game it is linglong one hop and fiveyard penalty second down I guess my question with the quarterbacks is this if you last mile do you feel obligated to keep Lee as a part of things because of what he meant to your team while Jefferson was out knowing that you're not going to be in this position without them conversely isn't there to your football team to have the guy on the bench at any point that you think really is the quarterback that makes your team it's best I don't know if it's obligation I think he feels my dear Lee has earned the right to have some playing time and I think secondly it's practical he needs him ready he still needs early wide open the flip that's a great read by playing as he finds D'Angelo Petersen pretty easy first down the version for a young defense a lot of freshmen software's out there oh this and they're just hanging on they're just trying to hang on and find a way you can see there's not erotic energy they're not getting a lot of crowd support and like they got to generate their own and there's no way to generate it when L is he's pounding the first completion for lis right up the middle shaking down to about the 10yard line goes Terrance McGee mine's not fair that's running back number five tonight that's another true freshman and it's first a goal for LSU for these guys bonus they're catching it's gonna pin II watch the way that this run is finished watch how you have defenders falling on their backs catching and not hitting adds a sign that they're not their energy levels that highlight the game right up the middle out of the oneyard line let's go down to Janine hey guys you're exactly right talking about Ole Miss in the energy level and what I see on there Benjamin is to look like this interest at this point and meanwhile on the other side of the LSU side guys almost look bored and you may call it disinterest but for a different reason they're organized though they're hanging in there but on the other side the Ole Miss side it's just more like distracted Janine's second down and goal to possibly add to the lead down to about the half yard line goes James Stanley and rod mentioned a moment ago was that the defense is not getting a lot of crowd support to get crowd support and would require a crap but it's they really don't have here and he was a it's a bad deal it's abandoned you know you you fire the coach it's the last home game you're down by 39 points and folks are leaving going to enroll the student sections in the grove yeah Nagi's di back third down and goal that it Stanley he might have been brought down just a hair short LS you thought he got in but the officials say down at about the one foot line so now it's fourth down a goal now there was some energy you see guys flying in diving into the pile trying to keep LSU out of the ends of that that's playing with some pride that's playing with some energy in seven years under les miles LSU has gone forward on fourth down 89 times about 65% on the success rate the three for three this year and they'll go for it on fourth and door money exchange and still there for for for on fourth down as scantly gets into the end zone with a touchdown hard to believe ventilated drew it up when Stanley took off without the ball and so oh well wait a minute I forgot something I think I need the football to get watch this he's buying oh wait you got I got it okay and then he almost off to the second time 49 to 354 seconds to go in the third quarter less miles it's been that kind of year for his Tigers welcome back to Oxford unless you on top of Ole Miss 49 two threes we continue dr pepper's road to the championships and the Bayou Bengals somebody needs to loosen this group up they are really way too tense that's that's how you finish the job though you know if you play tight in November you lose you saw it last night yep Oklahoma State play tight they played typer ticularly in the second half their defense really played tight Nick Brassell back deep to receive the kick this has been the busiest group of the night for all best to kick off return unit wrassle from the 15 about the 23 as we take a look at the BCS countdown tomorrow night you can hope join Humphreys Davis analysis Kirk Herbstreit and Craig games BCS countdown Sunday night they unveil the latest BCS standings and smoothie contenders and pretenders rpcs countdown presented by Vizio on ESPN tomorrow night at 8:15 Eastern sorry physio BCS standings shaken up considerably when the new there may be more cop Oklahoma State boss last night Oregon in trouble with USC right now and Oklahoma down by a touchdown to Baylor as well so plenty of oneloss teams why only on the verge of becoming to loss teams sweep to Bouldin it's got a leg out to be 36 yard line as we go back to raise the rod want to show you how that USC Oregon games going Oregon finally found some offensive rhythm Darren Thomason De'Anthony comets as you probably know the Anthony Thomas a longtime USC commit before changing at the last minute mark Easley is having a great half returned to kickoff close to midfield then Matt Barkley at Robert Woods second time they've hooked up four touchdowns tonight 21 7 Trojans up on number 4 that is anything but the problems that LSU has had tonight races Brandon Bolden takes off to the edge he has a first down and that should take us down to the end of the third quarter here in Oxford and Bolden looks like he might be shaken up again I'm able to get up and he's okay but rod right now Oklahoma in a bit of trouble or again in some trouble Oklahoma State lost last night LSU and Les Miles they have not even remotely fallen victim to any of those problems now they've been solid I find it funny that Robert Woods was out all week for USC and shows up and catches a couple touchdown passes against Oregon fourth quarter coming up 49 to 3 LSU Vashon but a multitude of weapons out for glue with a long run Michael's for a touchdown scamper lovely the team simply got him only he were available you know you're going to do that you got to set the Wayback Machine to about 1970 otherwise he might have a problem himself even our cheetahs a man I want to go up against this LSU defense competing Davis turns the corner picks up about nine yards but 49 to 3 LSU on top we've seen both quarterbacks they have yet to have an incomplete pass we've seen five different running backs in the game and we've also seen their defense look pretty good at defense seven SEC games right a total of 50 points allowed that's amazing seven games unreal and now you see the often starting to come together as hell as you team is bucking the trend they're getting better in November where we've seen other teams in the top ten kind of struggle what's even scarier is statistically Alabama's defense is better Brunetti ghazal to the bubble screen heading in the wrong direction trying to turn the corner is done he ran a long way to lose about four or five yards we'll take a look at our game summary through the first three quarters and 142 yards rushing for LSU part of a big night or check that 276 part of a big night they have yet to have an incomplete pass yeah then they got the turnover the defense did their part particularly early in the ball game Brooks in particular had a sack and a stripped to set up a touchdown pass and had a pick six unless you had 142 yards rushing in the third quarter alone Brunetti on 3rd and about 6 gets a yard and a half so now it'll be fourth down on the lawn for close to 5 but I like this move here they're going for it you got a young team get them some confidence you're not going to win the football try and win a series win it down I agree with with Houston not here at this time manufactures and energy fourth down about five Boldin the option halfback pass thrown up for grabs and knocked away tended for Collins more he wanted a flag he's not going to get it the officials were staring out of mic on that wounded duck I'm not gonna bail you guys out they had him out there but both didn't get it out there far enough for all this turns it over on downs near the fort LSU with a 49 to 3 lead we are about two minutes gone by here in the hold for quarterback number three tonight Zach Mettenberger gets a chance to play the sophomore transfer from Butler Community College's minute your inch or two before their back to the brown spinning phrase turns the day cranking tackles the inside the 25 about the 21 yard line inside in the guard center gap got good blocking inside coming right out you watch a little bit of help up there by Copeland good job clearing the outside and the good cutback inside in that guard center gap McKee with a nice run but a nice block by Copeland sin quest Golson took a ride for about 12 yards or so before he finally got Magee down at the 21 yard line again it's time for two yards you know that LSU has now the longest winning streak in college football with Oklahoma State having lost last night and Stanford that loss last weekend well this season for them has been beyond dominant and they're about to be seven and on the SEC for the first time in school history if they hold on and win which I think there's pretty good chance they will they'll be 11 and O to start a season for the first time since they won a championship back in 1958 at the middle goes hanger another true freshman he's just shy of the 10 yard line and I'll mention the numbers that they put up in Sec games especially with their defense it's just not as perfect as a season could be so far yeah yeah 50 points in seven games is ridiculous as was that last run by Hilliard at offensive line typically the guards and Center doing a great job of front time milliard picks up about two yards just inside the 10 down to the nine up to 323 yards rushing tonight in the relative feeling defensively is when a team just lines up and runs the ball right down your throat and no one knows that on LSU but if four touchdowns allowed seven SEC game for touchdown total of 50 points allowed in seven games unbelievable they've played 40 quarters on defense they've only allowed nine constant San yard line goes Maggie might have lost a half yard so out of 40 Porter's in nine of those forty hordes as an opponent scored a touchdown against their defense that's coming into tonight then go John tack on to Morphin john chavis has a very very dominant e we know that it's clear Mettenberger in here to get some time because he is the presumptive quarterback next season for LSU third down and ten from just outside the tail keep it on the ground with McGee lost a yard to half Justin Smith first in the backfield parole this so less miles for the first time tonight we'll send out a skilled butcher so through Alabama from just inside the 20 yard line 29 yard yard attempts try tack on three more and a Lamaze good from 29 yards out fifty two to three with nine and a half minutes to go on the fourth quarter here in Oxford ESPN's college football primetime is presented by Hampton hotels at Hampton we love having you here and in part by the US Postal Service it's all in the mail it's a great scene this is nine o'clock last night that's when they release the hounds and you're allowed to run into the grove and set up your tent for the next day you want to get your spot because this is the scene on Saturday this is the payoff Wow they got your real estate and then you're all set to tailgate on a Saturday afternoon leading up to a whole game and remoteness it's an incredible scene in the grove first time here for me going through there it is really something one of the great traditions in college football and the kids all get dressed up the girls are in their dresses the guys as the weather gets a little colder like it is now there were their jackets and ties and it is it's just a great scene razzle gets loose too about the 28yard lines we take a look at today's good hands play brought to you by Allstate and this is the first set of downs today offensively for all this again early for that defense for us yeah Ron Brooks with a pig 6 set the tone and removed all the damage after how that defense was going to play tonight that pick six that's what LSU up 7nothing he would go on to get a sack the fumble recovery you Brandon Bolden shoved into the backfield and lost about five or six yards levar Edwards does it again as we check in with rece Bob time for a sports center right now presented by Discover card Baylor in Oklahoma many CNN on ABC Robert Griffin the third to Tevin Rhee 69 yards in what is going on this weekend number five Oklahoma's down 1710 in the second quarter Georgia struggled all day against previously hapless Kentucky but they went it to clinch the SEC 19 to 10 the final sports centers on ESPN news all right Reese thanks very much so we know where Georgia will be for the SEC championship game who will they play Asbury brunetti throws it out of bounds would be third down and long for Ole Miss and it comes down Ron Gilbert the matchup and that is on deck for LSU as they will take on Arkansas and that'll be next week LSU and Arkansas will settle the West Georgia has the east and congratulations to Mark Richt after that Owen to start they wanted to hang it they wanted to run him out of Athens and now he's got his team in the SEC championship game and waiting on the winner of LSU Arkansas third down and fourteen coral death and Brunetti doing all he can to pick up about five yards that sets up fourth down and long and used enough will kick it away Josh downs made the stop on defense for LSU the other part of the good news for LSU is that the two injuries that they had tonight to read in the secondary and blue on the offense it appear to be very serious looks like there will be a full strip and they take on Arkansas history heck of a punt by Tyler example back in about the 20yard line big deal before he's finally pumped out of Bounce step aside fifty two to three number one out of a year has it been for old miss it has been this kind of a year Terrell brown defensive tackle six foot ten 377 pounds I mean Terrell oh man I don't make a chair that folds bad bad decisionmaking you got to have a baggage of that you're you're just a couple of bites of catfish short of four hundred pounds that little plastic chair is not going to hold you that is a big man right there 610 377 in the little chair that's a bad combination Danny Hillier 11 more yards on the ground for LSU first down 738 to go aren't paid me this picture Arkansas beats LSU next week and then is there a chance just a chance if things broke right we could have an Arkansas Alabama BCS championship game you're getting ahead is I guess that's possible well maybe but you're getting ahead of yourself oh you would you would have to have Arkansas beat LSU right and then beat Georgia correct in the champion game and you'd have to have Alabama wind up in the Dempsey spot would be yeah which i think is possible but a voter's might have a problem with it LSU team with one loss and an Alabama team wins one loss and putting Alabama high head of LSU went out when LSU would Alabama and beat the head to head I I wouldn't do that so I don't think it's that likely I think most voters would say you know what if we're going to put a 1 loss team and err that didn't win their division it's going to be able to see what's not gonna be Alabama but everybody's talking about a a possible rematch between LSU and Alabama now so they're already but matches with Alabama into the number twos but that assumes Arkansas not in the myths get down about four we're three and a half so it'll be third down and short for LSU and coming up over the next couple of weeks we will have Super Bowl quarterback MVPs Monday Night Football Tyler Falco not part of that group but Tom Brady is they'll square off on this Monday night and then a week from Monday Giants Saints Eli Manning and Drew Brees big game in the NFC playoff race especially when you start to think about who may not only win divisions but get firstround byes and home playoff games and homefield advantage throughout obviously the Green Bay Packers right now look like they're going to run away the home field throughout Aaron's cookie its Mettenberger he gets to the edge dives for the pylon is he in to be firsta bill well did he step out because if he didn't step out that football broke the flight it got inside the flag that's what you're looking for Dusty's step out he actually lost the foot I yeah yeah so I don't know that he stepped out either he broke the plane or he fumbled the football I don't think he stepped up back that ball goes out of bounds that could be old this ball out of their own 20yard line yeah he's that out he's that out he too broke the plane and it's a touchdown where he fumbled the ball he didn't have control of it before he crossed a lot either way he's not down at the oneyard line I don't know how they get that and now they are going to go to the replay booth for five ten to go to see whether or not Mettenberger will begin give it a touchdown or whether or not it could conceivably even be Ole Miss football step aside for just a moment Mardi Gras here it is Mardi Gras every you're undefeated rolling towards SEC title game assuming you get my Arkansas I guess you can dress any way you want to it is first and goal down at about the oneyard line it almost looks like LSU is lining up rather than run up the score to take a knee but five minutes to go they're going to give the ball back that's the Ole Miss but it looks like they're simply going to I guess as classically as possible attack on seven more points if that would be and I'm playing for Ole Miss that would tick me off that would kick me off that you're saying well we're just going to roll it in on you guys so we're not even going to try anymore I would be ticked off you know the funny part is if they jump in and score another touchdown here you're going to get writers around the country that will write the next day about how unclassy LSU was to roll to run up the score well I think you run the ball I don't think you take a knee and you run the ball now well that's also they've done the second half and their way to go three whatever happens happens but taking a knee it kind of rubs it in a little bit I don't think Les Miles is intending to do that I think he's trying to keep from putting points on the board but as indeed one somewhere I'd be offended line up and come after me now oh this could have done something about it themselves before and stopped them but they happen they wouldn't be in the spot I've never seen a team sit on the football with five minutes take a day ever victory formation with five minutes to go to give the ball back to the opposition if you're doing if you don't want to score then don't run the naked boot you know when you're upset but I just drive it inside be done with it all LSU has done for the most part here in the second half outside of the bootleg they just ran with Mettenberger has basically been run the ball up the middle except for the bootleg that got them down there and then after the bootleg that got them down there Les Miles decides to take a knee I now get this they're gonna keep taking a knee so that they don't even try a fill gun they're gonna keep backing up and give the ball to own this I've never seen this before and Parker takes authority Ole Miss will take over on downs reasons to go Wow so from the oneyard line they take Annie back to the 13 yard line now it's funny to hear a competitor who's been on the field before and you played quarterback you were a teenager using Harden potentially in the defense maybe can put yourself in the shoes of all this I would have been aggressively going after guys we'll talk more about it we come back with rod Gilmore 52 to 3 game but other than seeing a Bayou Bengal leap over some hedges we just saw a team at the oneyard line the five minutes to go take a knee and hand the ball back over on downs to their opponent here's Enrique Davis picking up about seven yards on first down just three points separate Carl Edwards and Tony Stewart from heading into the final race for the championship now they'll go head to head for NASCAR's ultimate prize the chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup concludes with a four 400 homesteadmiami coverage begins tomorrow Eastern on ESPN those guys going to take a knee tomorrow they were talking about wrecking each other's mothers if they were driving cars and maybe Houston none ought to think about that strong run by Enrique Davis out to the 26 yard line it gets it away my point before was Les Miles is kind of damned if you do damned if you don't there will be people around the country that if you run it in there will say well look at was fifty two to three and you scored again at the same time you're saying it's almost an a less classy move to take a knee I kind of rubbed it into the defense's face even more I understand what he's trying to do I'm not saying he's trying to be twice list about it I think he gets no criticism if he just runs the football I think every coach out there and every player would expect that's what you do it's a competition five minutes gone the game you don't start taking a knee I think when you start taking a knee now you start inviting people you know like me to question it and if I'm Houston Nutt I mean I I'm not feeling too good about it right now but you got to believe less miles is thinking we're not going to put 60 on these guys let's not go there we don't want to do that Rek Davis picks up a yard will be third down or one and that'll take us inside of a minute to go well if the score holds as it is and it should 52 to 3 is the largest margin of victory for either team in the history of this series and this is the 100th meeting between the two teams 13th straight SEC loss for home miss and Houston Nutt I think that's the longest losing streak of any team in a major conference college football inside their own conference active right now bird out of the yard stopped about a yard stylist Davis so now it will be fourth down at about a half yard I'm going to give Ole Miss a first down this is the last home game for Houston that it's a tough senior night for the 14 seniors that are a part of this Ole Miss team he will get a hefty buyout he might be a candidate elsewhere or he might take a little time off name is for about three yards and that will do it so LSU does exactly what they were supposed to do and what Oklahoma State could not do last night and that is take an inferior opponent out Les Miles against an underwater Gaza Walker with a handshake at the end 52 2 3 is your final LSU wins it going away state soon for even more college football on ESPN coming up now we'll take on number 9 Stanford in a game the rod Gilmore won't be paying any attention to trying to make sure my daughter isn't in the stands in the student section with paint on it's the big game and it's coming up soon right now we'll head back to our Bristol studios and refinish
