THIS ONE 40 YARDS. &gt;&gt; Todd: YOU KNOW, I MADE THE &gt;&gt; Todd: YOU KNOW, I MADE THE POINT EARLIER IN THE GAME ABOUT POINT EARLIER IN THE GAME ABOUT BRAXTON MILLER THAT WHEN HE BRAXTON MILLER THAT WHEN HE SCRAMBLES, HE KEEPS HIS EYES SCRAMBLES, HE KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNFIELD. HE DOESN'T JUST TAKE OFF AND RUN AUTOMATICALLY. HE LOOKS DOWNFIELD TO MAKE THE HE LOOKS DOWNFIELD TO MAKE THE THROW. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID HERE. I THINK THAT WHAT THEY MAY BE I THINK THAT WHAT THEY MAY BE REVIEWING IS TO SEE IF BRAXTON REVIEWING IS TO SEE IF BRAXTON MILLER CROSSED THE LINE OF MILLER CROSSED THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BEFORE HE THREW THE SCRIMMAGE BEFORE HE THREW THE FOOTBALL. WHAT A BRILLIANT JOB BY A WHAT A BRILLIANT JOB BY A FRESHMAN QUARTERBACK. BALL IS ON THE 40 YARD LINE, AND WATCH AS HE LEAVES THE POCKET. HE KEEPS THE EYES DOWNFIELD.
