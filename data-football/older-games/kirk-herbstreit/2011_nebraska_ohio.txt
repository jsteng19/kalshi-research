============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC it is Homecoming weekend on the campus of the University of Nebraska and the usual sellout crowd is filing into Memorial Stadium hoping the Huskers can bounce back from an ugly loss to Wisconsin last week in Nebraska's first Big Ten game it's been a long week for the Huskers filled with physical practices and plenty of criticism directed at quarterback Taylor Martinez who threw three interceptions against the Badgers their opponent tonight Ohio State making its first trip to Lincoln Luke fickle when the Buckeyes are still dealing with the aftereffects of scandals that have rocked the program and are fighting to keep their season together welcome everyone to ABC Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines on a historic night in Lincoln Nebraska as the Cornhuskers extend college football record streak 315 consecutive home sellouts here now dating back to 1962 and Nebraska tonight hosting its first big game welcome the Ohio State Buckeyes good evening everybody I'm Sean McDonough along with Matt Millen we'll be joined in a moment by Janine Edwards delighted to have you with us as we get a look at two of the top five alltime winningest programs in the history of college football and Matt Nebraska's four and one they're ranked number 14 in the country you'd think there'd be general happiness in these parts but there's a lot of angst here in Lincoln after that blowout loss at Wisconsin last week and a lot of it directed at Taylor Martinez yeah it is and it's kind of unfair but Sean there's even going to be more angst after there was after they watched the tape because they had many opportunities against Wisconsin now I don't know if they'd have won that football game but Taylor Martinez has to be able to play better than he did a week ago he left a lot of plays on the table there were guys open he needs to see them a lot will be on his shoulders they practiced it it's correctable he's fired up for tonight the 31 point loss to Wisconsin the worst for Nebraska since 2008 Ohio State had a rough outing last Saturday as well they lost at home ten seven to Michigan State a woeful offensive performance only 178 yards of offense they gave up nine sacks they thought they'd be getting some key offensive players back this week a couple of players who were suspended for the first five games for the year of big playmakers on offense Tevere Posey but would be there leading returning receiver from last year and Dan Haren their leading rusher a year ago but because of a different scandal they have now been suspended for additional games including a very hefty punishment five games for Posey so that's a big blow Matt to an Ohio solution looking for some good news trying to find some traction trying to find some play makers particularly on offense and I think the one there is really gonna hurt him is to be rosy because the receiving car is young and Shawn they don't really get off pump coverage very well Posey was going to be the guy who could do that now having said that there were other problems their protection last week was well it was a visible and it it wasn't just on the young freshman Braxton Miller that was just part of it Braxton Miller has to see things but it falls more on the shoulders of the center Mike Brewster Brewster is the veteran he's the guy who has to see all the protections make the right calls a week ago that did not happen and frankly they fell apart this will be just the third meeting alltime between Ohio State and Nebraska and the first since 1956 we could be in for a wild nights a night here in Lincoln all right Scott Jessie thank you welcome back everybody to Lincoln Nebraska the sea of red ready to welcome the Nebraska Cornhuskers Nebraska went onto the field by Bo Pelini head coach of Nebraska and a graduate of Ohio State class of 1990 the crowds ready we'll have the kickoff in a moment this has been the Nissan pregame shift kickoff coming up from Lincoln after this look into Nissan's Heisman House tonight in Lincoln Nebraska two of the greatest programs in the history of college football go head to head they are fourth and fifth alltime and wins 12 combined national championships 10 Heisman Trophy winners only Michigan Texas and Notre Dame have won more games than these two programs and since it was announced that Nebraska was heading to the big ten there's been great anticipation for this game against Ohio State in the home opener is a member of the big ten for Nebraska Nebraska won the toss and deferred these two teams among the best in the country in kickoff returns back deep with a kick from Brent modern six yards deep in the end zone and Hall did not run an item out and we are pleased to welcome Jeannine Edwards so quickly told these guys look I'm gonna cite the great John Wooden don't complain don't make excuses they big plays the question is do they have playmakers Braxton Miller the true freshman with a flag down hands it off on first down to Jordan Hall straight ahead it's a delay of game penalty going against the Buckeyes that's a rough way to strike and yeah you'd think they'd be ready to go with the first play from scrimmage shouldn't take long to figure that one out yet all week to do it actually coming from the sideline John O'Neil is the referee tonight leading this Big Ten Pro so first and 15 the Ohio State offense 108 in the country out of 120 in total offense all again spins off the original hit gets three Damien Stafford made the tackle time for tonight's impact players Jordan Hall is their leading rusher just 72 yards per game Jake stone burner is the leading receiver with ten catches on the year when your leading receiver averages two catches per game it's not good and they do welcome back Mike Adams he was among the players they were hoping to get back tonight we were suspended as a result of the original stand all that rocked this program the memorabilia for tattoos and cash scandal Miller with time throws a knuckleball but it's caught for a first down a more Corey Brown across the 35 dragged out from behind by Austin Cassidy at the 39 yard line it wasn't a pretty looking ball but it was on target to brown a sophomore who's just returned from injury this week and Shawn it was well protected because it gave him an area to be able to step up and getting Brown back helps because he's one of the guys down the field who can actually beat press coverage out of a very young receiver group without severe posing Miller completing 51 percent of his passes for the year was not the start at the beginning the year played behind Gil Baz Luhrmann and dragged down at the line of scrimmage by one of the best linebackers in the country Levante David certainly an impact player on that Nebraska defense along with jarred Creek upfront give us a chance to be a threetime firstteam allconference selection if he wins that honor in the big 10 this year David set the school record for tackles last year with 152 leads them again this year and their defense should be better in recent weeks with the return of Alfonso Kennard they believe is one of the best quarterbacks in the country second and 10 Nebraska brought a blitz Miller dumps it off on the Platte the fullback sac pouran has a first down it already met a much better start offensively for Ohio State than what we saw last week very little sustained offense last week against MSU but Sean this is smart this is Jim Bollman the offensive coordinator using what he's got and what pardon what he does have is a mobile quarterback so you use it to your advantage and not in terms of running all over the place but you can use and rollouts and that type of thing to buy some time and take more pressure off your offensive line it was an ultraconservative game plan last week against the blitzing bunch from East Lansing flag down it looked like Nebraska was offside spun out of bounds by Alfonso Dennard gain of about six maybe seven but if it is against the brass do you think they'd probably take the penalty at first and five instead of second and four based on where they're marking it might be second and three if they take the play this is the kite this is the type 5 stars events on 5 yards to the previous pot repeat second down a week ago Ohio State offensively was I mean you just you can't put up enough bad adjectives the only 178 total yards 39 yards rushing in part because the sack yardage comes off the rushing total and they punted 10 times they didn't take the penalty welcome in back toward the middle they'll give him the 40yard line he comes up a yard short of the first down Jim Bollman has taken plenty of criticism as the play caller but in fairness to Bollman particularly when you look at the wide receiver position the quarterback lots of youth and inexperience and very few proven playmakers and so to me that's falls on the offensive line and and and in order to play inside there you have to be able to identify things in it communicate it and that falls on the center Mike Brewster second down a short two fighting toward that first down yardage he's gonna get a good spot from the official on the fire side of the field Levante David Damien Stafford the tackle but is a first down for Ohio State Sean last week this Ohio State team you mentioned at nine sacks and they basically fell apart now you get your left tackle back Adams they reconfigure the offensive line but I mentioned Mike Brewster if you can't see you can't play in the offensive line you see him right there he's identifying and now he has to communicate it to the rest of the line so everyone's on the same page all again hit behind the line and chopped down by Labonte David is off to a great start Carl Pelini the defeat defensive coordinator says that David is as instinctive the football players he's ever been around well you can see him inside not only is the instinctive Sean he's got great great speed now ynx instincts part of that you have to read your keys and then then you have to play football defense is about discipline first and then making a play he does that well he's from Miami Florida eighth play of the drive for Ohio State second and ten Miller wellprotected Stein cooler got taken down on the rush Miller got back to the line gang tackled by a group led by will Compton inside linebacker there's will Compton and what will Compton does is a very patient player and he's a good reader and for him to play well the guy who's got to play well is Jared Creek Creek inside has the skills to be an allamerican but last week he did not play well with a lot of balance right there he has to bring his agame every week and a week ago he did not this is a big this is big for him this week dinged up in that game against Washington three weeks ago really hasn't been the same since Miller when a trying to run for a good decision first down down inside the 30 by Lance Tyrell who comes in and nickel and dime situations and a part of the maturation mat of Miller's knowing when's the right time to pull it down and uses good running skill there's no question in Sean they gave him coverage which is a departure from a week ago we saw Michigan State we called that game they brought blitz after blitz and they just forced him to the middle of the pocket with numbers this time they just come with four and gave him coverage he saw the hole and took him there are those hide in a tailback now behind Miller nice opening timeconsuming drive for Ohio State Hyde's first carry off the right tackle he gets down inside the 23 getting the left tackle Mike Adams back is big he was first team allconference last year they've reconfigured the line a little bit Jack Newport moved from left guard to right guard Andrew Norwell it was a tackle moves in the guard they should be better with this configuration well just first glimpse in this first drive this is they are much more physical right here than they were all of last week they are winning the battle at the line of scrimmage coming off the ball against Nebraska I didn't Hall on the field together Miller faked it to halt being pursued by cam and Meredith they got walloped about two yards short of the first down by Levante david and shawn fisher but instead of last week when it looked like runs of desperation from Braxton Miller when he looks confident on the scrambles tonight and he has to pull it down as you saw right there there was good coverage down the field and then he pulled it down and used his feet he's he's a talented young player it's just going to be experience every rep he takes is another knots towards getting better he's rushed for 16 yards he's 2 for 2 passing big third down and 2 flag down to stop the play it doesn't count illegal procedure against the Buckeyes third and seven young mistake get to the line of scrimmage you got to be under control all the time and then your cadence has to be the same all the time and you have to have be in rhythm with your offensive line and then when you get up there you just huh just you can't you got to be consistent all the way across the board look at four first downs on this drive they had just 12 in the entire game last week they had virtually no offense until their last offensive possession when they scored their only points of the game 10 seconds to go on 3rd and 7 they are in field goal range Miller zips one incomplete looking for the tight end take stolen burner there are many including the two of us who have wondered why they haven't tried to use him more because he is a proven playmaker and that would be the guy you'd like to get the ball to now not they don't do a really good job of separating their receivers but I got to tell you Sean there's another instance wellprotected had time to be able to see now it's going to be on his receivers to be able to get separation through basil attending a 41yard field goal from the right hash mark and it is good well done by basil is now 6 out of 8 for the year they took up more than half the first quarter clock with a 56 yard drive that ends with three nice opening try for Ohio State last week they did not score in the game until 10 seconds remain in the fourth quarter they had 178 yards total matter of fact Matt I remember at the beginning of the fourth quarter we were speculating about whether or not they'd have a hundred yards of offense for the game 61 on that opening drive that was impressive especially by the freshman Braxton Miller using his feet to buy not only time but gaining yards on the ground the leading kickoff return man in the country is back deep for Nebraska the freshman Ameer Abdullah averaging 35 per return brought one back 100 for a touchdown earlier this season here against Fresno State through Basil's pick on down to Abdullah at the 11th and he's proving that these kickoff return skills are not a fluke he's already had the top to kick off return games in the history of the Nebraska program he's playing in just his sixth game as a Husker Dominic Clarke took him down at the 46 yard line Sean not not as electric as Johnny Rodgers but maybe just as effective there's Taylor Martinez 50.5% for the year he's had only one game out of five this season when he completed more than 50% of his passes tosses it back to their leading rusher Rex Burkhead was averaging 103 yards per game rushing there was a flag on the last play Birkhead is second in the big 10 in rushing 26 in the country tonight only Denard Robinson of Michigan in the big 10 the mall Turner is a true freshman emerging as their leading receiver and we've already seen the impact Abdullah can have right on his average of 35 yards per return facemask was the call against Travis Howard attacking on to the end of the play in the balls at the Ohio State 36 already Burkett again running left in banged out of bounds by Bradley Roby redshirt freshman quarterback Ohio State traditionally one of the best defenses in the country and they've been solid again this year with John Simon the veteran leader up front and Andrew sweat the team's leading tackler e at a careerhigh 10 stops last week against Michigan State couple of veterans on an otherwise young defense catch is made by the tight end been cocky short gain to the 35 yard line tackled there by Tyler Mulder John this is what Nebraska really wants to stay out of his third and long situations killer Martinez is not very effective throwing the ball probably past the 15yard mark the better short and intermediate thriller will work in progress with his mechanics dumps it off short to Burkett and easily wrapped up immediately and tackled out of bounds by JT more defensive end the Bo Pelini with the decision to make from here would be about a where they gonna market it still placing the ball down at the 33 yard lines will be about a 50yard field goal maher has the leg to do it so they're going to try it he is 9 for 11 for the year both of his misses have been from 50 yards he's also kicked a 50yarder junior from Kearney Nebraska in his first year as their face picker and punter and that is right down the center he is good take me over to the allamerican Alex Henry now will the Philadelphia Eagles each team's hand at one each team with three points on the board gear Memorial Stadium in Lincoln you Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines find our fares online only at southwest.com chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich and Nissan proud partner the Heisman trophy Homecoming weekend here in Lincoln Nebraska last night the homecoming parade rolling down 16th Street festive scene here with the first points on the board for Nebraska the release of the balloons you can see the wind blowing from right to left as we look down on it behind brett maher who just picked the 50yard field goal we've had some light off and on rain here and it's falling still 70 degrees at kickoff has been uncharacteristically warm in these parts the last few days by Jamal Barry let's check in the studio here's Robert Flores hey Shan Taco Bell studio update Michigan five and Oh for the second consecutive season they lost in their last meeting with Northwestern back in 2008 and here Adonis Smith gives northwestern a 2114 lead they added a field goal so now they lead by 10 at the half Auburn and Arkansas tied at 14 less than five to play in that one in the first half Robert thank you here were tied at three solid opening drive for Ohio State engineered by Braxton Miller missed the third freshman ever to start at quarterback for Ohio State waited to Jordan Hall and a five yard gain on first down archly ster terrelle pryor the only other freshman start under center as an Ohio State Buckeye well I think Shawn that we watched him Braxton Miller he has all the requisite skills mentioned it earlier it's just going to be a matter of experience with him and seeing different looks week in and week out he can throw the ball well he makes good decisions he's got a chance coaches praise him for his poise and his humility much appreciated he's on targeted Evan Smith Alfonso Dennard swung him down immediately just short of the first down here's Janine well guys just as you were talking about Braxton Miller just needs some experience and when they took to the bench after the first series it seemed like the entire offense was trying to help him out he had running backs bright receivers tight ends all coming over giving him little bits of advice and actually tight end Jake stone burner was called back into his own tight ends meeting Casillas he would rather spend time trying to give a little suggestion there the Backson Miller third down and one four minutes to go 1st quarter Miller with 20 and away from austin cassidy damian stafford managed to trip him up and Braxton Miller's been telling the coaches you can put more on my shoulders and it seems they're willing to do that with him tonight because he's putting more in his eyes and so they're they're drawing that thing up to go to the right he just he draws everybody with the first two steps his eyes take him back to her no one is into big first down rain getting harder now first and ten Buckeyes from their own 41 talented four bags at Goran near the 45 yard line they her stein cooler made the tackle son of the former Husker great Dean Stein cooler who won the Lombardi and album trophies it is living in the area Syracuse Nebraska yet all this yesterday you were happy when you heard that when I met Syracuse New York it's just the hub of the universe your universe there's in the construction business just down the road what a great player Dean was second and seven Miller is deep in the coverage and almost intercepted by Austin Cassidy was intended for read Fraggle it was the back up tight end better known as a blocker they'll be third and seven Shawn this is the same mistake we saw him make just a week ago against Michigan State he just he doesn't set himself and just kind of floats the ball bare Cassidy wants that one back because that was a that was an interception going the other way the one thing we've seen in these two weeks we've seen a louse team person Braxton Miller throws a lot of balls that do not resemble spirals Motors not much breeze in the stadium here it has picked up just a bit as the rains gotten heavier timeout call by the Buckeyes with third and seven upcoming 3 3 game late in the first quarter Audi's the defensive coordinator in Nebraska we talked to them yesterday said we are not a big blitz team but Maddie's surprised they haven't come after this Ohio State offense more given the problems they had with blitzes against Michigan State tion I'm shocked because in all of sport it's a copycat league and when you see a team can't handle something you go for it right away I have not seen one blitz to go run blitz or against the pass to this point they're down and set here they come this they do come after Miller and it gets away all the way to the 31yard line they'll mark it at the 32 when we spoke with Luc Bickle during the week he said that he hoped if the other team does blitz that Miller can make them pay by busting a run and he did there will they come with the blitz and what they also come with his man coverage and when you have man coverage you see LeMond T David going right up to Hall he's blitzing his coverage everybody's locked in backs are turned Miller sees that takes advantage big first down 24yard run longest at his brief collegiate career for Braxton Miller Huber Heights Ohio near Dayton Jordan Hall as the tailback Miller faked it to him he swings it out for stone burner running room down the far sideline he will score patience John was the key to that throw and it was on the freshman Braxton Miller well Pelini livid than a Nebraska defense it's been nowhere near the standards set by the Blackshirts under the pelini brothers over the previous three seasons Nebraska's giving up 27 points per game they they're going to review it to make sure stone burner got into the end zone it stands it's a 32yard touchdown his fifth touchdown of the year on just 11 receptions yeah he's that's a touchdown yes the balls inside the Highland touchdown and he's launching himself from the field of play austan Cassidy the man who's trying to deny him stone burner jr. from Dublin Ohio right down the road from the Ohio State campus in Columbus two big first downs secured by the running of Braxton Miller on that drive with rushes of 12 and 24 yards Sean all of a sudden Jim Bollman the offensive coordinator looks like he's blown the dust off that playbook when in reality what he's done has gotten himself a more mobile quarterback and a little more confident than a week ago maybe he wanted to be more creative last week and they just didn't have the ability to do it because they were under seats they couldn't block anything certainly having Adam's back helps but I'm sure there are a lot of Buckeye fans watching this right now saying where were some of these plays last week when you can't block it's tough to run the replay official Steve Newman great patience by the freshmen and more frustration from Carl Pelini he took some of the blame for their subpar play when we visited with him yesterday three days we'll fix the extra point he said I think maybe we've over coached the defense and we've created robots he said guys are thinking too much about what they're supposed to be doing rather than just making plays what a difference a week makes for the Ohio State offense the Buckeyes lead 10 to 3 Ohio State leads Braxton Miller the 32 yard touchdown pass Jake stone Bernhard they're fine tight end the ADR drive in seven plays drew basil will kick off will they kick it to Ameer Abdullah man in the country yes they will started from the 8th this time and better coverage by the bunch and there is a flag down in the middle of the field Nate Oliver made the tackle back number 1 return team 10 now he was caught in the fall first now we take a look at tonight's Southwest Airlines playbook well you heard me talk about patience and this is an inherent thing it's all about field and it's on the quarterback Braxton Miller this play he's going to come back and he needs to draw the defense to him and it's just a matter of timing and feel and right there it is just that little bit it draws everybody over stone burner gets it over and allows Brewster the center to be able to get out there make a block on the edge and then stone burner takes it in for six whereas to running just it's v play from scrimmage Rex Burkhead the head for a yard meanwhile the Ohio State offense is run 19 place the place from scrimmage 19 to 5 right now with a minute half to go in the first quarter nice job by Mike Brewster we said at the top of the telecast that it was going to be on his shoulders for seeing everything and you have to be able to identify and communicate he's done a great job so far through this quarter I just got a lot easier for them because Nebraska haven't got anywhere near the pressure the Michigan State get when they came after the Buckeyes relentlessly last week Burkett out of bounds short of a first down here's Robert Flores hey Sean last year Arkansas had a sixpoint lead in the fourth quarter against Auburn before the Tigers closed the game on a 28 nothing run they lead again this year Tyler Wilson to Jarius right 21 14 Arkansas all right Robert thank you under a minute to go here first quarter right anus on third and for NASA's man Burkett out of the backfield first down to the 35 dragged down by Bette Tien Sabino and Andrew sweat couple the linebackers we're playing for the most part with two linebackers and five DBS tonight well done by Martinez I think the lesson that he learned this week was don't try to push the ball down the field all the time he had a lot of plays in underneath coverage against Wisconsin last week that he looked past tonight he seems to be taking advantage of late pitch to Amira running bag it tackle by CJ Barnett the safety after a gain to the 39 a gain of five it'll be second and five that's likely the last play of the first quarter and that is the end of the first quarter Ohio State had 178 yards of offense for the game last week against the blitzing Spartans they had 141 yards in the first quarter tonight and they lead 10 to 3 in Lincoln and we welcome you back to ABC's Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines from Memorial Stadium in Lincoln Nebraska 85,000 426 here tonight after a quarter 10 3 Ohio State here's a mirror now to the 50 taken down from behind by storm Cline here's our civic life game summary well the first quarter it was for the Buckeyes after rushing for 39 yards last week they had 73 in the first quarter tonight at 141 total yards they dominated the first 15 minutes not only did they help their confidence offensively but they helped their defense by keeping them off the field pistol and that's the standard formation for Nebraska Rick's Birkhead took the handoff got stacked up we talked about this defense of Ohio State Madden in year in and year out it has been among the best in the country and right now entering tonight's game their 13th in the nation in total defense and 11th in points allowed and you think of what they've been put up against by the lack of performance of the offense that's particularly impressive what's even more impressive Sean as they are young they are hugging across the board they got a lot of underclassmen plan tightend excellent receiver was a wide receiver in high school ate about 200 pounds when he got here he's beefed up to 30 and he's near a first down at the 42 about two yards short with a junior from Kansas City you know we at the start all week long this quarterback Martinez has been taking a lot of heat and I'm impressed with what he's done so far here tonight Tim Beck the offensive coordinator it's called the right type of game for him to score before passing to get at the prayer tag for no gain on third down and one Martinez gesturing that he wants to go for it Adam Bellamy helped blow that play up and Bo Pelini is going to go for it I love Bo Pelini Bo Pelini is what he's he is exactly you see what you get and and you get what you see he's one of those guys he's black and white he believes his team is tough that you should go ahead and get this first down you don't care just go get it now yet need your team to respond he's Martina is out flanked line up in the Wildcat with Burkett he faked the handoff and he got rocked at the line of scrimmage Ohio State holds it will take over on downs good defensive front they just whipped the Nebraska offensive line at the point why do you need to go to the Wildcat when you have one of the best runners in the country a quarterback in Taylor Martinez that one I don't understand but a nice job out there by sweat 42 he's going to come down get a shot in the outside really well done by Roby 25 the redshirt freshman corner held his ground held it back inside so a huge play by the defense and there is an injured corn Husker the left guard Andrew Rodriguez being helped off sophomore Bo Pelini raves about his tremendous athletic ability thinks he has a chance to have an NFL future so they went for them fourth down hoping for a spark we talked about all the angst in this area the criticism directed this week at Bo Pelini and Taylor Martinez and it was a very tense week here Martinez now being evaluated for the way he responds to questions all start fiveyard penalty still first down JB's shoe guards they right tackle it's gotten to the point now where the media is evaluating the way Taylor Martinez responds to questions III enjoyed him yesterday he had a great sitdown with them he was confident he knew he has work to do he knows what his shortcomings are he's willing to work on him I was impressed with him he seems to understand it comes with the territory and in a program like this with so much attention Pylos Hyde off to the races and they will not catch him touchdown Ohio State 63 yards the whole key is get your defense going one way and then you have to secure the edge on the backside and that's what Reed Fraggle right there number 88 does they're going to start everything this way watch the defense run use their speed against them but you have to be able to secure that corner and Freegal does just that and then it's off to the races the longest run from scrimmage by an Ohio State player this season and this crowd is stunned carlos hyde takes it all the way for a touchdown the last two snaps from scrimmage for the Buckeyes a 32yard touchdown pass with a 63yard touchdown run Ohio State's had three possessions to kick the field goal and score two touchdowns they've already surpassed by 26 yards their yardage total for the entire game last week against Michigan State in time out what a long week it was here in Lincoln after the loss to Wisconsin but obviously the Buckeyes had to deal with that loss at home and then the news early in the week that they weren't going to get the beer Posey and Dan Haren back tonight they're only going to have Posey for the last two games of the regular season they would have had reason to perhaps be hanging their heads but Luke fickle said he liked the attitude and practice all week they just needed to make plays and they have basil's kickoff brought back by Abdullah he got chopped down at the 22 by Jamie wood this week on ESPN's Monday Night Football the Detroit Lions off to their first formal start since 1980 hosted a longtime division rival Chicago the Bears and the Lions on Monday Night Football on ESPN 8:30 Eastern Time and coverage starting at 7:00 Monday night countdown served by Applebee's we could also watch the game streaming live on watch ESPN dotcom gamma can sue the former Nebraska star near tonight's watching his old school will be offensive line for the Lions on Monday night Rex Burkhead carries out to the 25yard line a gain of two on first down for Nebraska they need to take the in Dominator and put them on offense right now because this offensive line has been getting whipped at the line of scrimmage Suh has brought an attitude change in Detroit along with his teammate from Nebraska Kyle vandenBosch Birkhead after the short pass from Martinez danced out to the 28 in every yard hard earned for Nebraska right now it'll be third down and five for the Cornhuskers 12 minutes to go first half now we've talked about Tino Martinez and not pushing the ball down the field and that makes you eminently more defensible and so if you're not at one point Shawn they're gonna have to push the ball down the field to stretch it or you start defending a smaller and smaller field learn and five they gave him time he throws short and a good move the cats by Birkhead yields the first down michael bennet the true freshman made the tackle at the 36 there's a kid in Rex Burkhead who's goes who's played for a while and at the next level he'll be one of those guys who plays for a long time he'll play special teams he'll make critical third down conversions he's a tough kid he's a smart kid he's a core player that you should have on your team near Abdullah took his spot for a moment go to the far sideline Kenny Bell gets to and that's it again quick reaction by the Ohio State defense from CJ Barnett all coming out quick again from Martinez Martinez mechanically is not great he's best in the short intermediate like you said earlier Sean and that looks like what they are they've tailored this game plan to tear tonight 7 for 7 but just 42 yards short throws and the tackles are being made now he's sacked by Jonathan henkins big hankins is another young one just a sophomore but Martinez wanted to push the ball down the field that time but great coverage underneath by Andrew sweat right there and then Sabino also and it forces him to pull it down not a great scrambler Sean more of just a pure straightline runner third down and nine in that awkward throwing motion he got it to Brandon Kenny and with his work after the catch he gets a first down tackled by Christian Brian's because this is an awkward thrown as a quarterback sometimes you have to make these type of throws and boy that was that was a great job by Kenny get into first Travis Howard whiffed on the tackle that would have prevented the first down Mankins Sabino and sweat combined to take town burke hit after a gain of a yard here's Robert Flores thanks Sean update from that Michigan dearth Western game Denard Robinson short touchdown run to get the Wolverines now just a threepoint deficit in the third quarter meantime k1 ALCS Rangers have scored twice they lead to nothing on Justin Verlander and the Tigers you know while we got the update Rex Burkhead dropped for a loss it'll be third down in ten good work by John Simon the defensive front shot and again this goes back to staying out of third Long's we've mentioned that Martinez has not pushed the ball past really 10 yards and so this is one of those areas that's that's tough for them just 10 yards rushing for Burkett on 10 carries Martinez would stand sack Michael Bennett again freshman out of Centerville Ohio true freshman who chose Ohio State because he wants to pursue a career in medicine wants to be a doctor he's a biology major they brought five and they came with his twist stunts inside was not well protected at all but Bennett comes up with a big sack again keep in mind Martinez not a scrambler Sean he if he doesn't cease it's not like he creates anything he'll pull it down and he'll take off the run which seems odd given that he is such a good runner buddy you said he's more of a straight line hunts with help on the bounce for Brett Maher daily jeanbaptiste founded at the 6 yard line 17300 high o state middle of the second quarter Southwest Airlines find our fares online only at southwest.com dr1 and Universal Pictures the thing in theaters Friday you know Brutus enjoined the action so far Ohio State's first trip ever to Lincoln Nebraska 17 to 3 at the crowd trying to make it difficult for the freshman Braxton Miller in this young offense which begins with its worst field position of the night Buckeyes from their own six Tim Stein cooler and Evans the tacklers Jeanine well Sean when the Husker defense was on the sideline they weren't sitting on the bench they were all standing around in a circle screaming at one another and Carl pelini was right in the middle he's the defensive coordinator he's like guys I don't know what to tell you anymore this keeps happening over and over are your eyes in the right place do you think you're bringing pressure because you're not and then will Compton screams guys we got to start playing or we are going to lose this game second and six Paul it's away from Meredith to the line of scrimmage and is taken down by will copped in a yard short of the first down third and one upcoming as we tick down to the midway point of the second quarter well it's been a difficult season defensively for Nebraska last year they were ninth in the country and scoring defense in the year before that they led the nation in scoring defense but their 73rd this year as you saw Paul looks like he was stopped short of the first down and it looks like that's where they're going to mark it as well Compton and Eric Martin that's on call about six inches shy John that is a huge play for the defense the defense has been getting their rear end kick through this whole game this whole first half they need it to stop them right there which they did no surprise they're not going to measure this referee signals fourth down and look fickle sends the punt team out then buchanan a punt we can't have a delay a game and the play clock on the screen was incorrect not in sync with the stadium played by Ben Buchanan's Ponton a fair catch made by Ameer Abdullah at the 43 Korean out created by the Nebraska defense Ken Martinez and the offense capitalized on good field position Sean McDonough McMillan Janine Edwards back in Lincoln Nebraska hi Oh state leading 17 to 3 Taylor Martinez 8 for 8 passing tonight for Nebraska vote for just 53 yards yeah Sean at one point you're gonna have to push the ball down the field because it starts to make it a lot easier to defend with the short field there has to at least be the threat of something down the field and they come out with three wide receivers to the left the Martinez out of the pistol he gave a direct spark head who is stuffed again John Simon in the middle of that defensive front sweat also number 42 Simon and sweater the T they're the two key to this defense you talked about him at the start of the show but John Simon is just a relentless player and sweat is one of the better tacklers in the NCAA a good reader gets to the ball always around the football good instincts no game second and ten the option from Martinez stock at the 49 yard line by CJ Barnett quality gain of six third down and four of coming forward nebraska their three out of six on third down tonight Janet I'm just watching that play I reflect back to that fourth and one when they split him out wide and didn't it take advantage of his speed and his ability to be able to get to an edge this 42% for the year on third down that's not a good number middle of the pack an FBS football he has been checking down most all his throws Birkhead has been big in this situation mr. fourman rush they give him time he fell short Kenny fell out of bounds at the 42 of the first down the market at the 41 yard line on the completion of the redshirt freshman from Boulder Colorado good for a 10yard game Shawn there's a lot of ways to use your speed Kenny Bell certainly has it why does it go straight down the field and streak and the other one is to run away from your coverage across the field and Bell does just that bills dad Ken played for the Denver Broncos Marlo going across the formation and took the ball Tim stopped at the 39 yard line after a gain of two four and a half minutes to go first half Shawn the one thing that this Ohio State defense has done pretty well here tonight is their corners have forced things and have tackled pretty well what you're trying to do is you're trying to get the corners who aren't necessarily the best tacklers make the tackle but they've done it here tonight Teta is down the field for the few times tonight it's caught by Reed Cooper the junior from Shreveport Louisiana with his first catch of the season watch the mechanics they're not they're not pretty but it's effective here nice right on the money to Cooper and a big first down and the problem with the mechanics there Matt the footwork the footwork and then he gets out of balance Sean with his shoulders doesn't drive that front shoulder that foot tends to come open walk'n takes off running inside the to the 17 rattled by storm climb after 17 yard pass Martinez bottles with a 5 yard run smarm looks like storms hurt a little bit now is that a great name for a football player storm or a weatherman meteorologist fine as it will stay storm flying sounds like a good linebacker and he is one of them out of Newark Ohio 240 pounder just a junior first year starter backed up a terrific player Brian roll in the middle of that line backing core last year 2nd and 5 Nebraska on the move down 17 to 3 see everybody looking to the sideline there's three signals over there they're all getting their direction from the sideline I do not like that let the players play at the players make the decision and move back into the pistol Birkhead stayed in the block in the past and Martinez is his first incompletion of the night looking for Kenny Bell is a little bit behind him but yeah you can hiss here here's all the signaling that's going on and this is what's happened in the last probably decade maybe a little longer than that in football everything is the game has gone more to the sidelines and in the coaches hand I understand it but I do like having the players having the power to be able to make their adjustments and make the calls on the field third down and five big play here with under three minutes to go in the half and Nebraska in the red zone down by two touchdowns five receivers spread the formation Martinez given time against the fourman rush and it is incomplete we own in a traffic for the true freshman Jamal Turner glory and Johnson broke it up that was a tiny window that he tried to get it into Sean and III got it he was right there he was right on this watch Orion Johnson numbers set number 19 down here he's gonna close on that ball really fast because it hung just a tag 34 yard field goal try now from Maher who connected earlier from 50 it's good Nebraska gets three after its defense held for the first time tonight 17 six as we approach halftime Ohio State on top as a light rain continues to fall good weather for the duck here in Lincoln we take a look at the athletic question we want to know prior to Bo Pelini who was the last former Ohio State team football captain to face the Buckeyes as a head coach Bo Pelini cocaptain a senior year under John Cooper was a safety in the late 80s under Earl Bruce and John Cooper for year letterwinner academic allbig ten we know the answer so we're not even gonna speculate they saw it at our meeting this morning that monitor kicks off Jordan Hall the returns will high estate he's dangerous we had chopped down at the 29 yard line by Harvey Jackson was Shaun the one thing that Ohio State fans are waiting to see is how this will high along Ohio State offense would respond specifically how it Braxton Miller respond and they've got to be extremely pleased because he's beaten them with good throws when his head time and he's also been able to use his eyes to take off and run when he's had that good patience in the pocket he's played extremely Ronen only six times one of those the 32yard touchdown the jake stone burner with a lot of run after the catch first and ten 63yard touchdown run for their other score he got to the 34 here's Robert Hart Shawn give you a taste of what's going on on the ESPN networks it is all about the SEC on ESPN you as a Alabama has opened up a twenty seven nothing lead on Vanderbilt going into the fourth Arkansas continues to lead Auburn on ESPN and also on your computer on ESPN 3 ESPN to Georgia leading Tennessee late in the third Mark Richt looking for his 100th win there give Brickton the Bulldogs credit they've rallied after a no one to start second and five under two minutes to go first half right again you'd expect them to be conservative would you not with still the young and inexperienced offense and they'd be happy to have an 11point lead at the half yeah absolutely and that but I think right here Sean this is a big third down again for Nebraska with an ability with three timeouts left to be able to get the ball back and maybe have the opportunity to put more points on the board so it's on this Husker defense to get the stop here but imagine if karl polanyi's defense can hold here for the second the last eight possession in a row they would use a timeout Miller's winning the play clock run down like a veteran drop the snap then falls on it no timeout yet from Nebraska and now they get it using their first 103 left in the half that was going to be a lead with the quarterback the answer to tonight's Aflac trivia question prior to Bo Pelini the last Ohio State captain to face the Buckeyes is a head coach and the answer is Gary Moeller was the captain of the Ohio State Buckeyes in 1962 and later faced his alma mater as the head coach at their archrival Michigan and had a great run at the Michigan head coach when Bo Pelini wasn't particularly nostalgic he has great affection for Ohio State so he had a great experience there he's coached against them before a couple of times as an assistant at Iowa and at LSU LSU was a national championship game college teammates Oh coax Peterson over there where's a punt from Ben Buchanan they come after him and he got it off in a good kick Abdulla a momentary difficulty didn't get very far brought it back just to the 16 yard line we'll see how the Cornhuskers play at with poor field position coming up at the half Scott Van Pelt Jesse Palmer and the Northwestern Mutual halftime report all the scores and highlights from today's college football action including Oklahoma's annihilation of Texas in the Red River Rivalry good talent Trump's scheme every time you know Nebraska leans heavily on the run they are a big play offense and get big chunks from the running game including to mightiness tackled well in the open field by Travis Howard they'll come quickly back to the line scrimmage the 22 second and 4 got to be quick if they're intending to score this isn't quick enough too much time understand with this poor field position now he watches what a man over the head of Pilar read and picked off by orient Johnson and Birkhead tackles him at the nebraska 47 so 15 seconds left for Ohio State Sean this is exactly what you were talking about earlier watched the mechanics Taylor Martinez when he wants to go down the field look at his feet his feet are completely wrong he steps left to throw straight and then he's out of Bounce does not drive that front shoulder he opens up his hips and his shoulders consequently the ball lollipops down the field there's not enough zip on it and he's got to get that thing straightened out but Orion Johnson's happy that he hasn't first interception in the air for Johnson who was a starter at the beginning of the year now plays an extra defensive back situations will they be aggressive here with good field position Cranston Miller run him down they tackle him at the 18 with four seconds to go boo birds out in force now here in Lincoln it looked like after that interception when Martinez was being booed we had the shot of Bo Pelini kind of waving and disgust at the fans well I gotta tell you Braxton Miller just broke off somebody's ankles down there on a move that was unbelievable I didn't get the sea oats that's will Compton will gotta pick his jockstrap up it's laying out there on the 35 yard line so the 29 yard run gets them into field goal range that's impressive coaches say he's a talented guy and you're starting to see some of those talents on display from Braxton Miller no Bo Pelini said he was embarrassed after the thirtyone point loss last week at Wisconsin he apologized to the fans then during the week he mentioned he thinks these fans have been a little harsh particularly on Taylor Martinez and the fans aren't happy with what they've seen in this first half hasn't been a good performance on either side of the ball from Nebraska what every storybook character you ever knew or thought you knew was real from the writers of lost series unlike anything you've ever seen on television and the ultimate battle between good and evil ABC's once upon a time premiering Sunday October 23rd at 8/7 central on ABC well Sean once upon a time this did Nebraska defense had two straight three and outs to be able to help their offense and then they came back were they giving up that big play by Braxton Miller where's drew basil 35yard field goal attempt from the right hash mark Derrick Irwin the holder George macrinus the snapper the operation is solid and the kick is good as the half ends Ohio State at 178 yards of total offense for the game last week they rushed for exactly 178 in the first half and at 246 total in a 226 lead to the delight of the folks who've made the trip from Ohio here's Janine Edwards oh not the way you want to go into halftime off a turnover like this what's the message you want your team to receive from you in the locker room we gotta figure i mean we gotta execute or we're missing missing tackles where you know we're not below you're not playing our type of football well you know we're it's we need to fix us really quick we got to come out we got a lot of we got a plenty of time to take care of our business we just got to play better football it seems Ohio State has shored up their quarterback protection since since last week how can you create a little bit more the football weird we have them in tackle I mean he hasn't nothing about protection they're running job and we're not making the tackle well it seems he's searching for answers both with his team then in the interview 2006 the score at the half let's send you to Scott Van Pelt Jesse Palmer the Northwestern Mutual halftime report and welcome back everyone to ABC Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines Braxton Miller and the Ohio State Buckeyes leading Taylor Martinez on the Nebraska Cornhuskers Huskers they're having trouble and so alive 22 6 is the score at halftime welcome back to Lincoln Sean McDonough and Matt Millen unbelievable the difference from last week to this week for Ohio State yeah a tale of two different teams and keep in mind a week ago the Ohio State team with just Maul nine sacks had 178 yards of total offense tonight they have a hundred seventy eight yards rushing in the first half no sacks they're handling everything Braxton Miller has been the difference in this first half good decisions both in the passing and in the running game and so that is huge for Ohio State for Nebraska they've got to be able to get pressure here in the second half Sean and they've got to be able to generate more than a 10 yard pass in their passing game at Ohio State offense under siege by the blitzing Michigan State defense all of last week's game never faced anywhere near the same kind of pressure from the Nebraska defense here tonight drue basil kicks off for the putt guys down to Emir Abdullah at the goal line there's a flag down might have been an illegal block on the return with like Harvey Jackson came flying by it might have been guilty block in the back like a block in the back number one return team after dishes from the spot of the foul first time it was Jackson that'll take him back inside the 10 yard line as we look at the Pacific Life game summary Braxton Miller is a dual threat and he was able to put those skills on display in the first half well his patient Shawn is patience in the pocket and his ability to run and make a big play that's loose that was a difference in that half on first down from the fiveyard line Rex Burkhead bottled up at the 7 the gain of two and he hasn't found any Running Room Birkhead now 12 carries for 13 yards the other thing that we've seen is this Ohio State defensive line is whippin the the offensive line of the Nebraska Cornhuskers toss it to Burke head trying to turn the corner got a block from the tight end been cotton chased out of bounds by Andrew sweat short of the first down Baldy marked at the 14 yard line just beyond the 13 they need to get just beyond the 15 so about a yard and half to go on third down for Bo Pelini in the offense make the toss and then Martina slipped as he threw and threw incomplete to Ben cotton they've had intermittent rain most of it light and the field might be just a little bit slippery to cause that well they've also had intermittent offence and maybe it was the field maybe not but Sean that was a that trip to me right there that was a big third down they needed to convert that they needed to come out here in the second half and establish something and in fact they established nothing in Ohio state should have excellent field position after the punt by Brett Maher off the side of his foot thank you very much and doesn't get any kind of bounce either about five yards on the bounce and roll and plus field position for their first possession the second half for Ohio State after a 34yard punt they'll begin at the Nebraska 47 so did karl polanyi and brother beau come up with some answers defensively vocally knees been saying all week it's about us we need to fix us and that's what he said to Janine Edwards on his way off the field at half time Jordan Hall I go by see on day Evans the quarterback was up close to the line of scrimmage Dana for John we talked about the defensive line of the Ohio State Buckeyes as you look at Terrance Moore number 90s down with an injury controlling that offensive line this offensive line of Ohio State is whipping the defensive front of Nebraska as well so to me this game that right now is being controlled by the by the offensive defensive lines of the Buckeyes and some substitutes in there including Terrence Moore who was injured on the play Jared Crick has not been much of a factor one of the highlighted matchups coming into this game was creek and stein cooler in the interior that defensive line particularly against the outstanding center michael brewster more being helped off he's a senior from new orleans looks to be a little more comfortable as he goes here's jeanine edwards and sean will get a check on him and find out what the update is but in the meantime i had a chance to speak to luke fickle coming back after half and he is so pleased with the play of his quarterback Braxton Miller he said it he's showing signs of confidence tonight for the first time and he said the offensive line is doing a tremendous job they've run the ball 478 yards in the first half that's the total offensive yards they had the entire game last week line up in a power i formation and another swift this time Jordan Hall and it cost him a loss of a couple back to the 45 yard line it'll bring up third down and 7 Janene talking about head coach Luke fickle talking about that offensive line and how proud he is now defensively now what you've got to do you've got to make it personal you've got to turn this into a fight inside you cannot accept anything except the win if you're playing one of those down four positions again the I Miller fake to nobody in particular grade too much time rose a walk it'll be ruled a catch for Chris fields inside the 10yard line defenders still maintaining it wasn't a catch but they are gonna market at the 8th Sean he can get back here and read Tolstoy he had so much time it was ridiculous that is a deep in and that is takes a long time to develop the crime he's off in the plays of first time the was it a catch they showed the replay on the scoreboard here the fans thought he lost it oh they're right that hit the ground in between that should be an incompletion he has it he hits and then he loses it right there right there he lost he lost control that should not be a catch great effort but no cats the ruling on the field a completed pass of 37 yards to Chris field sophomore from Painesville Ohio his longest reception of the season if it stands and this is a very big replay review there was a penalty against Nebraska that was declined so they could go back and revisit that if the call on the completion he is overturned Bo Pelini you can read his lips he dropped the ball said the official on the far sideline defensive holding was the call so if the play is overturned they'll go back and accept the penalty and again no pressure watch the film of the game last week between Michigan State and Ohio State when Ohio State couldn't block anybody against relentless pressure and then come out here and provides so little pressure from your defense if you're in Nebraska tonight and if you're sitting at home and you're thinking well you know you want to be stuck in man you don't have to play man behind it you can play zone you can play zone blitzes you can play anything behind but you need to bring some numbers and they struggled mightily with the pass was incomplete holding 17 defense ten yards from the previous spot automatic first down Deonte Evans the sophomore cornered took over as a starter this year for the first round NFL draft choice New York Giants Prince Amukamara so it's a big panel laid the ball goes to the 35 yard line in its first in 10 Ohio State on the edge of field goal range now at the very least for drew basil they're hoping for more they bring Evans off the corner and he's in on the tackle helping will Compton stopping hall for a two yard gain and Bo Pelini and Karl Pollini have welldeserved reputation for being defensive gurus I mean everywhere bo Pelini went as an assistant coach including one year he was here as a defensive coordinator the defenses were outstanding his defenses have been terrific here the last three years but not this year when he took over in 2008 they inherited a defense that was giving up 38 points per game in the last year under Bill Callahan 116 in the nation in scoring defense fix that problem immediately Miller's throws out to the fake and Fields was open but it was just a little bit too high where that sophomore Chris fields got on top of the coverage fast and he had time this is just an errant throw by Braxton Miller washy on T Evans number 17 well he's like he didn't get with another hold right there mm he he got on top of him just had a little bit of move on pop I think see on T Evans is an example of one of those players and Carlin he didn't mention him by name of a guy he's been coached so much now that he just seems unsure of himself more than anything else that happens that happens a lot and you heard Luke fickle when they talked about Luke think about how much confidence they're playing with conversely that's playing with no confidence they bring pressure here and it's another wobbler with a flag down it's caught Corey Brown inside the 10 flag thrown to the secondary that's Andrew Green number 11 glory Brown they have to Cory Browns on the team he's known as Philly defense number 11 penalty is declined he's off to the plays of first down was Andrew Green guilty the hole they turned it down 27 yard completion it's a glory brown from the Philadelphia area Upper Darby Pennsylvania John you could just watch yeah you can see the hold at the top you could just see Braxton Miller gaining confidence as this game is going on he saw he had one oneonone outside he went right to it you're Nihal inside the five and down at the oneyard line tackled by austin cassidy an ohio state is one yard away from a three touchdown lead here in the third quarter this is just now but whitman by the ohio state offensive line they are just driving people off the ball hat on a hat everything's moving forward now they've been bringing the big bruiser Carlos Hyde in a tailback at 238 pounds he gets the call puts his head down drives the legs no signal yet looked like he crossed the goal line and he did touchdown Buckeyes for all you high school kids at home I want you to watch his watch his legs in the Drive watch how he never stops driving it's like hitting those sleds and practice every day just drive drive until you complete it and he did it for his second touchdown to the game through Basel for the extra point stunned silence here at Memorial Stadium 276 oh hi Oh state early in the third quarter tomorrow morning on ESPN don't miss sunday NFL countdown joined boomer and the crew for three hours of insights and analysis get you ready for all of Sunday's NFL action Sunday NFL countdown presented by IBM tomorrow morning 10:00 a.m. Eastern on ESPN Sean this will be a critical position possession for Nebraska they have to score sixyear new basil kicks off Ameer Abdullah from the one he's taken down at the 30yard line Kenny Guiton made the tackle for the Ohio State Buckeyes this is the position they wanted to get this Nebraska offense in you wanted to have be in a position where you want Taylor Martinez to have to throw the ball consistently that is not his strength do they have to do that now though I mean there's still 10 46 to go in the third quarter no no they can still be balanced but this is the position that they want them in inevitably he's going to have to throw runs the option and keeps it haven't seen a ton of option tonight from Nebraska Martina started out ten for ten passing with a steady dose of short passes he missed on his last four including an interception 10 out of 14 480 yards for the larger problem right now for Nebraska they haven't run the football 45 yards rushing and 200 yards rushing has been the magic number under Bo Pelini they are olan five the last few seasons when Nebraska's been held under 200 yards rushing 14 in all with 200 plus Martinez throws incomplete flagged down to the play at the line of scrimmage Kenny Bell the intended receiver with Christian Bryan and coverage against Nebraska for illegal procedure decline it illegal formation offence five men lined up in the backfield a penalty is declined they're down third and five again this is the position the teams are going to play Nebraska this way they're going to load the box and take the run game away and force Mark Taylor Martinez's arm to have to win the game form and teams are just going to bet that it's just it's not a good enough arm when some of his suggesting he should be replaced as quarterback they don't have a lot of options behind him Martinez takes off running and he paid the price he got buried at the 38 yard line the Andrews sweat their Jonathon Hankins nearby and they will punt on fourth down and two Christian Bryant just came out of the secondary it's the N Sabino there as well he did a great job of closing on that that was great team defensive speed getting to the football maher putts better effort this time fair catch signal he made by Jordan Hall and a timeout on the field 915 to go third quarter Ohio State with the ball on

tackle of Shawn Fisher the line of spinach he's agitated with himself and it winds up being a three yard gain for hide these Ohio State Buckeyes are just going back to just good oldfashioned football just letting that offensive line kind of control the temple of the game right now they bar their best performance in the six games this season under Luke fickle mile state came in at 3 &amp; 2 they were 11 point underdogs tonight according to the local paper they hadn't been a double figure underdog in a big 10 game since 1999 and this is a big surprise to many I'd driven back by several tacklers including will Compton jarred Creek in on the play as well 17 yard line is where they'll spot it and a third down and 5 to come Compton not getting up he he's right in the middle of that thing from bond Terre Missouri told us a couple of weeks ago when we were here a small town of about 30 860 miles from st. Louis wants to be a coach someday brother Cody's a wrestler here at Nebraska and as they tend to Compton we referenced a moment ago the Pro Football Hall of Fame and I know both of us want to extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Al Davis who passed away at his home in Oakland at the age of 82 legendary leader of the Oakland Raiders one of the great figures in the history of professional football Shaun we just lost one two great really icons of the game he excelled at every level of football as a coach he was a commissioner he was he was everything general manager owner you name it he did it he will be greatly missed you know a great friend to you and your playing days back there with the Raiders popped it off the field now third down in five Miller after the fake great move behind the line of scrimmage and he has the first down the falls out it looks like Ohio State no they say David got the football Muslim wrestled it away because you could see a couple of his teammates seem agitated they didn't recover the fumble but all of a sudden david emerged and a huge turnover by the Buckeyes at their own 23 their first of the night watch Braxton Miller make a miss missed tackle right there and then Levante David just sittin right out of his hands and that's a legitimate play he's knocked down he just pulls it out it's a great play by Levante David Hill they take it back at the 23 Birkhead straight ahead baldie game got six on first down with the offense sputtering all night long the defense trying to provide a spark the last three possessions for Nebraska on offense have been an interception in two three and outs they have to get six points here it cannot settle for a field goal they have to get six exactly midway through the third quarter after first touchdown of the night for Nebraska eighteen yard run by Taylor mightiness an old thing is set up by a great great play by Levante David rip them all the way from Braxton Miller this score would put a little game pressure you would think on the Ohio State offense next time they're on the field the extra point good by Bret Maher the 9th rushing touchdown of the season for Taylor Martinez and the Cornhuskers are back in it down by two touchdowns midway through the third Levante David the take away in this to place later Taylor Martinez at 18 yard touchdown run Nebraska baguette in 14 mom whose kickoffs short to Jordan Hall a stop at the 22 yard line GM F key leading the kickoff coverage let's go back to the Nebraska touchdown run this is all about numbers please what you do you come to my a scrimmage you split that thing in half you look one two three but now you have four five and six because you don't account for the runner against four defenders so you come down and you split that thing it happened now you have two guys out in front they chase nice seal by Rodriguez Yoshi Hardwick inside and here's the lane very well done it's all about numbers and it was perfection right there for the Nebraska Cornhuskers standing fake by Martinez of a handoff to Aaron green crowd back in notice Jordan Hall he got banged down after a gain of three out to the 26 yard line for the second and seven Jared Crick in on the tackle for the black shirt defense which would not really hurt his name here tonight in Shauna I believe what you said earlier is right with Jared Crick we had him against Washington he got hurt he's not been the same Claire since then and they need they need a big time effort out of Creek to anchor that defensive front braxton miller true freshman quarterback has had a terrific effort tonight in just a fourman rush and they get nowhere near him and he takes off again the mont de david tripped him up but the stumble forward gets a first down for Ohio State this is just got Braxton Miller he has playing again we talked about confidence but he has done a great job here tonight of pulling it down and using his feet again you don't ever account for the quarterback as a runner and he's been the difference in this game for Ohio State what a difference for him after the relentless pressures of last week than Michigan State he's at all kinds of time tonight against this Nebraska wonder if the snap was late because Jack Newport wasn't the only offensive player moving ahead of the snap they mentioned his number but there were others moving as well braxton miller nine rushes for 93 yards tonight he's thrown for 95 all the tail bank it's away from Compton David and Cassidy combined on the stop would look like they're gonna stuff it for no gain instead he reached the 37 yard line line to make the 43 six more for a first down for Ohio State well you heard Bo Pelini talking to Jeanine at halftime saying they're missing a lot of tackles they've got to make him there's another example but credit Jordan Hall for finishing that run little Compton who was shaken up earlier back on the field for Nebraska second and six in the eye playaction fake item in a design run for Miller in there there for him this time Sean Fisher the linebacker junior from Omaha dropped the play for a loss back to the 35 that's a heck of a play by Sean Fisher we have a Buckeye down the Shawn Fisher gets cut right there at the line of scrimmage by Justin Boren 44 and he gets right back up and Braxton Miller is down and that is a huge blow and he's in considerable pain Joe bosserman is now the backup quarterback he was the starter at the beginning of the season for Ohio State but struggled against Miami in particular in their third game of the season at Miami in the next game against Colorado Miller became the starter he's starting for the third straight game tonight and really came in last night in relief of Braxton Miller when he struggled and did not do well until the end of the game Sean when Michigan State went into a prevent defense and then he was able to make a big throw and they got their seven points but the way Braxton Miller was playing here tonight I mean it was night and day from me from a week ago and boy I hope I hope that's not what I think it is that does not look good right leg injury well Janine Edwards said Luke fickle talked about the difference in the confidence level tonight and certainly they've had much more time to execute so Baz Luhrmann is in as they take Miller to the bench I would pressure Baumann right off the start third down and eight really no time to warm up hit as he throws and complete again he had time but couldn't find anybody open he threw it over the head of the tight end Jake stone burner he'll punt with four and a half to go in the third quarter did get a little pressure on the outside from Meredith 34 able to get a hit on him at the end but Bowser man struggles when eres pressure in his face John we saw it last week he almost looked like he panicked at times where's ben buchanan to punt to the dangerous Ameer Abdullah they're setting up for return it's a good punt by Buchanan a junior from Westerville Ohio is taken down immediately well covered by zach da McKown the special teams stand out for the Buckeyes time now for tonight's big ten update brought to you by dr. pepper of course with the expansion to 12 teams of the addition of Nebraska for the first year they're divided into two divisions the legends and the leaders Michigan with the win at Northwestern now setting the pace in the legends which seems to be wide open and you'd have to think Wisconsin's the big favorite on the other side although Illinois he is proving that its success is not a fluke back to the 14 yard line loss of six their Goble John Simon Andrew sweat all there they have to turn her to loss the grip okay so you see Braxton Miller go off you kind of get a little bit deflated but I got to tell you this Nebraska offense has done very little against the Ohio State defense this defensive front has been playing well all night long they have under 200 yards of offense Martinez takes off and then the ball bounces out that he was down just across the 20 CJ Barnett nearest and the clock runs down to three and a half minutes left in the third quarter this is where Ohio State wants to keep this Nebraska offense third and long and force Martinez to have to use his arm to beat him Miller was on his feet and trying to walk it off so perhaps that's good news on the Ohio State sideline third down and nine there four out of ten on third down tonight no rush first down Tyler Reed taken down by Orion Johnson but it's a gain of the 33 and a first down Nebraska nicely done by Taylor Martinez this time look you see the feet the feet were better step and throw he drove the shoulder a little bit better and it was an accurate throw all kinds of time again and I'm tired at the teddy bear across midfield and he steps out of bounds at the 47 yard line of Ohio State 20 yard game and a nice crossing route which needed a wellthrown ball Martinez delivers again he's pretty accurate in that 10 to 15 yard range pass there he struggled this is a formation they're three backs around a Martina's the handoff went to Aaron green true freshman he's out of bounds inside the 41 yard line it will be second down and three Sean you can feel you can see the sense of urgency by this Nebraska offense and you can also feel it in the crowd and they're feeding off each other right now we'll Avante david with the take away that has turned momentum in this game at least for the moment mightiness where Ken was pushed back into him so he decided to take it down in Romany as a first down out of bounds at the 36 yard line big jonathan Hankins came in and took Birkhead and just threw him backwards and of course Taylor Martinez used those feet again and got himself with that speed out of trouble Hankins just played himself a pretty good game here tonight he's a big fella 335 pounds jonathan Hankins number 52 once he was about 365 one time the end the three backs in the triangle around Martinez another good fair candidate two elements to that score Shawn the first one is a great play fake and the second one is a tremendous thrown by Taylor Martinez right on the money and yes it's over 20 yards 36 yards first catch of the night for a nun one sophomore from Moreno Valley California the extra point from mocker to make it a seven point game and again the interesting formation with those backs surrounding Taylor Martinez and another very good thing that's 30 personnel free backs in here here's the key right there see Christian Bryant his eyes are in the backfield he's looking at the run coming this way and when that happens here comes the receiver and gets right by him nicely done on the top of that receiver in the stem and what a great throw right on right word has to be that is really well done the nun one doesn't shrink chop the top of his rock throws all night long the element of surprise helps as well Martinez on target and a nun whoa he's also made an impact on this program is a physical blocker with the score 80 yards and seven plays that took just two minutes and 37 seconds completions from our tina's on that drive of 12 20 and then 36 for the touchdown they're taping up the right ankle of Braxton Miller so perhaps he's going to return to the game monitor the kickoff Jordan Hall started it before brought it back to the 31yard line here's Janine Edwards and yes on your right they are taping up the right ankle of Braxton Miller he came off the field earlier he had tears running down his face he wasn't a lot of pain but the trainers have been evaluating him he just has gotten his shoe back on they taped up his ankle heavily they gave him some medication to take us for an antiinflammatory what have you he is now gingerly walking his shoes back on and grimacing a good as he does it doesn't look comfortable right now so it still Jill Baz Luhrmann hands it off to Carlos hi only to their war hi let's go back and take a look at the injury to Braxton Miller well there's a there it is right there and when he's making that cut on the turf his chute grabs you can see right there he he felt it right away the right ankle injury looks like a lateral lateral deal on the outside part and walking better now perhaps too as he adjusts to the tight tape job so it's blossoming 5th year senior 25 years old spent 3 years playing minor league baseball a pitcher in the Pirates organization he throws incomplete and almost intercepted in the direction of Corey Brown and momentum has swung in this game and your guy Jean Baptiste almost had himself will play right there it was a wide receiver until three weeks ago Pelini said I've been begging for him on defense since spring practice he was a DB n wide receiver in high school Annie just the sophomore Karl Polanyi thinks he has a chance to be a great one real Longhorns and he uses them well he's 63 as a cornerback looks like they're going to bring a little pressure and they do get there and Baz Luhrmann throws for a first down and then a flag thrown at the end of the play john baptiste in on the tackle and Corey Brown you wonder if he led with the helmet because the flag was thrown as the contact was made he was down it was over here's the big deal in this play okay they're going to bring pressure and they mess it up they mess it up because they show it first and then they get out of it and then they come from too far away you can't get there from five five yards past the line of scrimmage you have to time that so at the snap of the ball you're getting there that didn't work 13 yard gain 15 yard penalty and out high has them into field goal range and that's huge would make it a 2 score game and they have an excellent kicker and the difference between the blitzing we saw at Michigan State last week against Ohio State when they were blitzing they were coming like their hair was on fire these Nebraska players are very tentative as they come rushing when they do rush there it's not in synch Sean last week we saw Michigan State team that was bringing pressure and they were hitting it at the snap they were anticipating well we haven't seen that here tonight and what's gonna be the end of the third quarter nebraska led a rather ohio state led by 14 of the half they built it to 21 but to Scoresby nebraska has them back in the game as we head to the fourth after finishing 1st and 2nd last weekend at Dover Kurt Busch and Jimmie Johnson reemerged championship contenders now they set their sights on the points leader Kevin Harvick and Carl Edwards the chase heads to the heartland the chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup continues tomorrow at Kansas one o'clock Eastern the NASCAR countdown to get to started presented by nap race telecast brought to you by Chrysler second in three Ohio State as we go to the fourth quarter Carlos Hyde spins forward both to a first down got hit near the line of scrimmage but spun ahead it looks like he has the first down they're going to measure it that was all on Carlos Hyde all 240 pounds of him because Lamont a David had him in a backfield and he took the blow and spun off of it great effort finished the run looks like he got the first Carlos from Naples Florida we went to Fort Union Military Academy in Virginia it is a first down he's a big man the big man he's young just a sophomore I believe and you are correct sir a 240 pounds he's got good speed to Sean these rush 490 Braxton Miller his rush 491 at 35 yards rushing last week they have 229 tonight on the ground Bosman hands it off behind the puck take David reduce amount of miles behind this village what a night he's had remember we talked about him with his great instinct in his and just a just overall great playing speed and here you just see it he just runs him right down inside out not a real big kid and he's about 225 230 pounds but he can flatout run at the next level he'll be a will linebacker you got to be able to hide him a little bit so you don't get the big guys on him but boy he's a playmaker started playing football mid age six in Miami well clearly said he has tremendous love for the game great student again and great instincts as we mentioned earlier Baz Luhrmann after couple of cakes washed it into the end zone incomplete well covered by Damien Stafford intended for Corey Brown Stafford does a nice job at the end of this thing there's the pump again there's time for him to be able to throw drown wants an offense and could have been pass interference call as they see the replay I know that's okay they let him play it's football this is right on the edge of field goal range now would be 49 yards from here Basil's long is 47 there's the matchup down below it's Man Man we're also going into the wind fourman rush rosin and throws incomplete tenebra devin Smith Alfonso Dennard in coverage and not what Luke fickle do Basil's career Long's 47 this would be 49 into the wind Eric Martin got a little bit of pressure that time good coverage outside by Dennard where they finally got back a week ago their best cover guy looks like they're going to go for it basil was standing there it looked fickle well here comes I would try and hurt him whoohoo interesting I would try the field goal here and trust my defense I think basil has the leg he hasn't kicked one longer than 47 but he has the leg to do it the last year he tried just a couple of long field goals and I'm both blocked 50plus the flag delay a game I would decline it yeah because now it gives the punter a little more room with which to work Braxton Miller after going to the dressing rooms back on the field ankle injury moments ago Nebraska didn't have anybody on the field they had about six men and they just did get a timeout he didn't set the ball said Bo Pelini with a couple of other words mixed in he has an explosive temper Sean McDonough Matt Millen Janine Edwards back in Lincoln Nebraska Bo Pelini upset they had to use a timeout they didn't have anywhere near enough men on the field as Ohio State was about to punt we're gonna punt again fourth and 18 you cannon wanted the best in the country so far this year dropping it inside the 2013 putts coming in inside the 20 almost twice as many as anybody else in the big 10 Bo Pelini was upset at the officials but he shouldn't have been no you're gonna watch through the umpires job is to get the ball set and then he goes back and waits for the referee to put it in play he'll do that by pointing at him there's the ball down now he looked seemed going back right there right here see Greg Bears will play now it's ready for played now the umpire would come back he should raise his hand and it's ready there it is but nebraska wasn't ready that could be a costly timeout from the nine wives down at the 20yard line boy he does that a lot i know they don't have much behind him and he doesn't want to get hit but he wonders sometimes he leads leaves yards on the field yeah that time he did fact he was short of that first down nine yard game they marked him down just shy of the nineteen about a half yard to go as the clock runs down to 13 minutes left Ohio State once led 27 six Birkhead weaves his way across the 25 Tyler molar the tackle first down Nebraska they're the great duo in the Nebraska ground game both Martinez and Burke had ran for over 900 yards last year Tina's cheap gets near the 30 they've combined for a hundred and ninetynine yards per game as a duo this year rushing one of the best tandems in the nation you know Shawn one of the things I think we forget because Taylor Martinez had such a big year a year ago is that he's just a sophomore and then his best football is coming he's he's getting better as we go he's gotten better from a week ago to now takes two Birkhead Rose a seeker too low for been caught in the tight end at the 42 with Etienne Sabino and coverage it will be third down and six his greatest area to get better will be in his mechanics of throwing and he knows it they stepped with the wrong foot there I mean he's stepping forward his right foot as he threw the ball seemed third and six pistol formation jesus' big families the oldest seven children five boys he has a younger brother Drake who's already been offered a scholarship you know Beach High School in California he knew they might anus in trouble almost went down stays on his feet washed it up by Kenny short of the first down Bradley Roby made the stop about three yards shy of the marker and they'll half the punt with under 12 minutes to go no forces punt but the one other point I'd like to make you gonna watch Martinez he keeps his balance he's only been playing quarterback for three and a half years this is the fourth so it's three years in so many games so there's a running back and safety until his junior year in high school he played quarterback for a lot of his redshirt season here he's a wide receiver on the scout team not a great cut by Maher had a couple go off the right side of his foot tonight they'll mark that at the 27 yard line Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines find our fares online only at southwest.com and john hancock mutual funds visit JH buns dotcom homecoming in Lincoln Nebraska non award first Big Ten home game for Nebraska taking on Ohio State the Buckeyes lead 27 20 go BA sermon beginning a second full series at quarterback he got hit as he threw after a moment's hesitation LaVon take David in there again Sean this is the first time that we have seen the blitzing like there was a week ago a week ago Michigan State this Ohio State offensive line struggled with a gap blitzes this time they walked up and they were successful because they struggled again on the inside David got the hit Wasserman hands it off to hardhitting in the other direction he gets to to the 29 will be a big third down in eighth with 11 10 on the clock running remaining they have to first down since bosserman came into the ballgame he is considered the better pure thrower of the two and it doesn't look like Braxton Miller is going to be able to return tonight right now if I am Nebraska I would tighten my coverage on the outside because they their receivers struggle with getting off pump not bring some pressure Basel is one out of six throwing and no pressure deep throw by Bosman way over the head of devin Smith and Shawn they did tighten up their pressure they jump there underneath coverage on the top side they did a good job going to man a man up top you watch coming out down here here's the nice tight coverage here and now he's playing off down below he got away with one but that ball just wasn't even close there's Ben Buchanan the punt again right now Shawn this crowd feels Abdullah they know he has big playing him cannon punting into the breeze then dildo caught it at the 29 and got hit immediately Ryan Shay sir the backup linebacker with excellent coverage of that planet let's take a look now at another Pacific Life game summary it was twenty seven six in the third quarter Ohio State Braxton Miller had a nice night going when he injured his ankle late in the third quarter Hyde rush for 88 including a 63yard touchdown that Ohio State defense to be what they're supposed to be night eNOS design role he was about to slide and Christian Bryant just ran right through him Sean watch him slow up at the end of this run you have got to be more decisive than this keep running don't stop it's almost like you decide okay maybe I won't slide this time but just stopping it was not the good alternative to the slide gain of nine Birkhead the quick hitter down drives to the 45yard line and her sweat lay the tackle I like that Birkhead kid I think he's I think he's an underrated player they've done a nice job bottling him up tonight just 33 yards on 16 carries it is pouring rain now harder than it has all night long Burkett again gets a block from the gate the flip back gets shut down after he picked up a first down by Christian Bryant ball marked at the 41 of Ohio State a 14 yard run for Burkett Spencer long also does himself another nice job getting out there on the edge and legate like you said that was the main block and movement prior to the swamp on the offense fiveyard penalty still first down Marcel Jones me and Marcel Jones you can't do that do that and by the way from now on the big man Marcel Jones that's just a momentum killer though six seven three twenty first and fifteen mightiness turns the corner he gets Restless back at the end Sabino at the top of the pile garrett Goble at the bottom of the pile the penalties a problem for Nebraska last year they set the school record for penalties and penalty yards bo Pelini made fixing that a priority this year but they had nine penalties last week at Wisconsin six tonight on second and 12 Martinez is caught by Kyla Reed he lunges down to the 34 yard line it'll bring up a third down and three with under eight and a half minutes to go on Ohio State now playing to a sevenpoint lead a gain of nine Sean I really like with Tim Beck the offensive coordinator for Nebraska one he's done tonight with his game plan he's taken a couple of shots we said he had to do that one resulted in a big touchdown but the intermediate game he's tailored things to Taylor Martinez that before down territory here agreed as a result they go to the run Martina says the first down just beyond the marker near the 30yard line this might be the best game that I've seen Taylor Martinez play and in a big game under pressure he's thrown for a hundred and sixty one he's rushed for 75 Martina's with Simon after two elements on that one Shawn the first one is Taylor Martinez and Memorial Stadium rocking Nebraska 21 unanswered points we're tied at 27 stay tuned after the game for your late local news on most of these ABC stations and over on ESPN you can catch SportsCenter post game analysis of this game in all today's scores and highlights Hurra kicks off with the wind down to the goal line to Jordan Hall that is driven back the staff Tariq crossed the 20 let's go back and look at the touchdown by Birkhead that is knotted up this game well we gave there were two elements in this anatomy of this touchdown and the first one is right here is going to be Taylor Martinez buying time Luke's down the field comes back the other way and his ability to buy that little bit of time and then Birkhead is point number two he just makes him miss like we talked about Christian Bryant he uses his speed against them and then takes it in to the end zone underrated that Birkhead kid why Kim Martinez ran for 16 on that drive and passed for 39 including the 30 yard touchdown of the junior from Plano Texas Rex Burkhead Vaz him in a quarter bag first down for Ohio State chopped down at the 33 yard line by Stanley jeanbaptiste all night long Ohio State has been using Nebraska's speed against them they'll start one way and then redirect and Carlos Hyde has his own speed he's a big man like we said 240 pounds he's up to exactly 100 yards rushing now hi powers ahead for five more Jared Creek on the stop and lost a helmet we're just going to good oldfashioned Ohio State football here shame for them that Braxton Miller got hurt because his dual threat skills were causing problems they really lose the running element from the quarterback position without Miller in the game you know Sean you mentioned jerod creek and losing his helmet there but you and I watched him a few weeks ago and he does not look to be the same player as we saw just a few weeks ago he's not as decisive as he's been he's not disengaging off the blocks like he had been there's something something's not quite right with him it took a hit in the head in that game against Washington Minh was in a lot of distress after that game didn't play the following week at Wyoming second and six plasmon drying tape he's only been on defense for three weeks the converted wide receiver with his first career interception looking just like a wide receiver Sean and remember we talked about this great length and this is where it's an advantage watch some track eyes are where they have to be now the balls in the air that long reach of his is Abe that's the difference in the plane he's a rare he's hurting that he's so long he's six foot three inches he's running stride for stride and a great play brought found with his with his big reach second turnover by Ohio State the first one was the play that turn the ballgame around in luck Levante david just ripped the ball away for Nebraska Martinez late pitch a onehanded catch piper can't even trouble and swung down for loss back of the 17 flagged down near the line of scrimmage Etienne Sabino made the tackle for Ohio State offside number 50 defense lined up in the neutral zone repeat for County team or the defensive end redshirt freshman from Boardman Ohio everything going against Luke pickle and I think he'll have a question the answer if it continues to go this way why didn't he kick the field goal and it was going to be a 49 yarder could have given them a tenpoint lead my tennis across the 40 they grabbed this facemask as well flag down he's down two late flags are thrown after Martinez hit the turf at the 45 yard line Taylor Martinez has taken this game over in the second half AJ Barnett they'll attack 15 onto the end of an 18 yard run the first part of this is watched the mesh point now watch his eyes that's his key whatever he does he's going to do opposite and he does a great job of riding that thing making the defender come up the field and then he takes it back inside really well done toss back to Brereton Willig 8 the fullback throws another inside the 20 they're going to mark it out at the 18 CJ Barnett another tackle 22 yard run for Nebraska did I mention that I like Rex Burkhead this kid is strong he's got good speed he's our heck of a good player they're in field goal position Birkett again nothing there that time travis howard the corner held his ground now it's time for this Ohio State defense which is not played poor and second half they'd not played as well as they did in the first half but it's time for their players and their best player in this defense is John Simon 54 steady dose of her pet finds a save inside so on this whole second half it's been a different look at the gate another block outside on the top by the receiver number 80 Kenny Bell Brandon Kinney also does a good job but watch him finish Rex Burkhead they're going to check to see Shawn he left the field in bounds and you have to see if the ball crosses the plane and look from that angle like he did but they'll check it Steve Newman as the replay official there's the push he launches himself he's inside but a great effort a guy who gives you an effort on every play the fans here love Rex Burkhead and what's not to like terrific young man good student well respected citizen you need Edwards will tell us the story by the relationship he's for him with a sixyearold boy here is battling cancer and that was the first thing that Rex talked to us about yesterday and he has hadlen AK as Birkhead this year particularly of performing in the second half after further review the ruling on the field of touchdown is confirmed Kayla Martinez and Rex Burkhead have been the difference in the second half and also Sean this offensive line is picked it up they've been getting a hat on a hat and they've been able to get on the edge and that's good the difference first lead of the night for nebraska maher trying to make it a sevenpoint edge than it is 17 yards for perk head that complete a 78 yard drive in just four plays he's rushed for 83 yards in the second half Martinez has rushed for 84 we mentioned earlier the magic number for Nebraska's 200 yards rushing the last two years Owen five when they don't get there and it didn't look like they were going to get there tonight they're up to 204 yards rushing now here's Janine Edwards will shine you just mentioned a little boy is up in Boston watching this game tonight his name is Jack Hoffman and Breck's Birkhead is wearing a red bracelet that says team Jack pray Jack Hoffman is six years old he has a green tour the day after tomorrow Monday in Boston he'll be having yet another brain surgery rex met jack recently and was so moved by his story little jack is a huge Birkhead fan and rex said as soon as he's out of surgery on Monday at some point he will be giving little jack up all he has to be enjoying what he's seeing here tonight hey Jack you picked a good guy to watch a little prayer for your homes my hurt kicks off Ohio State so impressive on offense for two and a half quarters can they refine it mentor in this game has swung dramatically against them Berni Osborn made the tack on the return by brought to you by Sony the Red River Rivalry the featured game of the day two unbeatens and Oklahoma number one in one poll number three in the other made a case for number one as good LSU 24 unanswered points out of the gate they win at home over Florida and Illinois iran's up six in all their best start in sixty years good for Rimes oh that's a good football coach he's got that team playing really position coach will Bo Pelini look was an assistant at Ohio State Khomeini was a defensive back bill Baz Luhrmann with five minutes to go has to pull it down they got there with four and it'll be a loss of the yard on the play they got there with four because they had good coverage all the way around that's a coverage sack Rome's able to get there but there's no place to go look in the topside safety sitting on the inside well done by Austin and then here's the top it's a cut coverage everywhere you look there was coverage viciously the first sack of the night allowed by Ohio State after they yielded nine the Michigan State for 25 to go on second and 11 again Bosman can't find anybody open throws it up for grabs and we'll Compton had great coverage John they try to wheel route down the right side again good coverage they cannot get separation Baz Luhrmann has to roll to his right we tries to make that throw Compton's right on top of him we could see from high atop Memorial Stadium just blanket coverage all the way around you can't blame Baz Luhrmann there nobody opened he's 1 for 9 in relief of Braxton Miller we have to think the veer Posey would have made a difference but suspended and not able to play again tonight they're leading returning wide receiver third and 11 Wasserman deep wobbly no chance for devin Smith and even had it been a good throw Dennard was right on top these receivers we sent it early they struggled getting separation and this route is no different Dennard was waiting on the throw all the underneath stuff same thing you're right Sean Devere Posey they need him and they're not going to get him for another four games Ohio State with lots of time left relatively speaking three timeouts came out winging it three straight past attempts sack a two incomplete passes and here's Buchanan the puck fair catch signal by Rex Burkhead his sure hands back there he caught it at the 33 402 to go the ball on a sevenpoint lead for Nebraska this week on ESPN's Monday Night Football the Detroit Lions off to their first floor it will start since 1980 host Chicago the bears and lions Monday Night Football on ESPN at 8:30 with coverage starting at 7:00 Monday night countdown served by Applebee's you can watch the game streaming live on watch ESPN dotcom I've actually won eight straight games dating back to last year Rex Burkhead out to the 38 yard line and he got five on first down Nebraska just trying to kill the clock now all three timeouts left for Ohio State under four minutes to go and all of a sudden this offensive line has been providing some room for Rex Burkhead remember the first half they couldn't they couldn't get anything and now Caputo inside Rodriguez you can see all the Marcel Jones Spencer long 61 hardrick 50 they are getting on hat on a hat as you like to say assignment football and allowing Birkhead to pick his spots Latinas what's the play clock run down to three Burt head in trouble behind the line of scrimmage and buried by Michael Bennett good penetration there as well by John Simon don't blow up the play good time timeout called by Luke tipple and that's that's a good timeout and that was a nice job coming off the edge they brought a little pressure off the top side Sean it was 27 to 6 and Ohio State had the ball in the 3rd quarter the crowd was totally out of it and then Levante David with the takeaway just ripped it away from Braxton Miller they capitalized and scored a quick touchdown the first of four unanswered touchdowns scored by Nebraska 28 the scoring run for the Cornhuskers we're looking at an O and two conference start for just the second time since 1968 if it continued to go the way it was they still haven't put this in the win column yet but before that play midway through the third quarter they had just 133 yards of offense they've just about doubled that total on the time since I've always thought that this game of football is so fun the one play can make a difference in a series which can make a difference in a game losing Braxton Miller also hurt Martinez got very close to the marker and then a flag thrown look like they're gonna mark them almost right on the edge of that yellow line I also think they're gonna tack some onto the end personal foul defense number 26 automatic first down Tyler molar and hate the defensive coordinator there was next to Luke fickle very upset about this development as well he should be oh yeah leading with the helmet although it's number two Christian Bryant who comes in with the helmet not twenty six Mulder against him they announced it you know that's that's a tough call there sunny because yeah he's now he's a runner right there so if that was Rex Burkhead they wouldn't throw that flag seventyfive yards and penalties tonight they're in Ohio State Territory Birkhead we got walloped again yeah right in the head at the 39 yard line and Ohio State uses its second timeout with 234 to go one timeout left for the Buckeyes tomorrow night on ESPN join rece Davis Kurt Herbstreit Craig James and Robert Smith for BCS countdown as they project them who will top the first BCS poll to season before it's unveiled next Sunday BCS countdown presented by Allstate tomorrow night 8:15 Eastern on ESPN continuing on ESPNU at 9:00 Eastern well you can make a case for a number of teams it's LSU Alabama and Oklahoma foremost in the conversation who do you think should be number one at this Junction yeah we'll see I oklahoma's started at the top and there's a lot that goes with being the number one team and then performing they have not done anything to change my mind LSU and Alabama are playing good football they're gonna play themselves Oklahoma is going to be in the middle of this thing right at the very end so who should be number one to be I take Oklahoma they're number three in the coaches poll they're number one in the coaches poll rather number three in the AP poll Dan you just saw historically that's a unusual difference between the two poles backhand is another first down it appears and if that is where they mark it and they do well beyond the line that is a huge step towards salting it away for the Cornhuskers a fresh set of downs and only one timeout left for the Buckeyes Shawn two guys put this team on their shoulders in the second half Taylor Martinez and Rex Burkhead and I would add Levante David and Levante David changed the whole scenario yeah he David played a heck of a football game a lot of pressure was on Taylor Martinez all week long employee he really responded dead this wants to make sure now that he doesn't turn the ball over 152 the clock stops the Buckeyes are out of timeouts as they use their third and final of the second half stay tuned after our game tonight for the Ford wrap up show with Robert Flores Rex Burkhead had just ten yards rushing at the half well what was so impressive about Birkhead is the way he finished his runs number one and then he's got such great versatility he made a big play catching the ball he made big plays running inside running outside but it's just the consistency not an overly fast guy not an overly powerful guy just a great combination of everything five receptions are a careerhigh and he's up to 101 yards rushing his third 100yard game of the season 78 yards rushing in the fourth quarter for Birkhead and a 30 yard TD reception and here he comes again for Nebraska done you don't think he's that fast and then you see them just running away from people and look it has great vision they have it the fullback spot this time look at just the nice quick movements inside and he's a quality player 119 yards after the 18 yard run and for a long time tonight you would have imagined that both Polly knees team would be in a victory formation but they are he'll earn a victory over his alma mater that's a quality win and for Luke fickle they're going to be sick because they had them right where they wanted them but I got to tell you Levante David stripping the ball changed the course of the game and then Taylor Martinez and Rex Burkhead took it from there this is going to be the largest margin overcome for victory in Nebraska history from 21 back to win against an Ohio State team that for two and a half quarters was putting on Baibars most impressive performance of the season so Nebraska with the victory will go to five and one they'll earn their first victory as a member of the Big Ten Conference 1 in 1 in conference play and the Buckeyes will go to 3 and 3 overall oh and two in conference play for the first time since 2004 when they started on three that was the last year that the Buckeyes did not win at least a share the Big Ten title Taylor Martinez threw for 191 and two touchdowns he ran for a hundred and two and a score Birkhead ran for 119 and a touchdown and had a touchdown receiving as well best game I've seen Martinez play especially responding to what they came through a week ago he knew he had to play well Sean and he came he came through at the big time big times in game he played ping vocally nee said all week long and again at the half with Jeanine Edwards we need to fix us look like they found some solutions in that second half and he's with Jeanine congratulations but when we spoke at halftime you said you know what we need to fix us we have some things to work on what made it work in this second half well I just think we did just that our kids I'm proud of our football team I'm proud of how they fought we weren't perfect but you know I thought too coach Beck called a great game in the second half our offense got it going our defense made some stops and you know what I'm just proud of the care I've been saying we got a lot of character on this football team and I'm proud of we got a lot better we got to get a lot better but they hung in there Taylor Martinez had a tough week after last week's game how did you assess his attitude in the locker room at halftime Taylor that's a lot of confidence in himself and I think he showed it out there to why he's our quarterback great job and guys it was the largest comeback in school history here for the Nebraska Cornhuskers he might have had a tough week with the media and some fan reaction did have a tough night on the field even early on he was right on target first ten passes it wasn't going well for the team but they found a rhythm on offense after the big play on defense by David turned the game around final score Nebraska 34 and Ohio State 27 now for Matt Millen Jenny Edwards and our entire crew led a Blee by producer beau Garrett and director Mike Roy Sean McDonough saying so long from Lincoln Nebraska now Robert Flores with the Ford wrap up
