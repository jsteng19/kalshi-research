============================================================

two Trojan territory at the 49yard line is Sean Harlow with an ice block up front Rock hey Jones you take a look at this set you see a couple of tight ends in there for Oregon State they are running the ball right at USC so so far they've taken a little bit of the playbook out of the Boston College playbook of a couple of weeks ago where they initially started out running USC why and then just pounded him inside this is a Trojan defense and Leonard Williams did play that entire game that was at this allotted for some 452 yards by Boston College Banyon incomplete in and out of the hands of Tehran Ward as we reflect on the numbers from a couple of weeks ago and they've had about two weeks to stew on this yeah that one right there gets my attention 452 yards rushing against USC and that just doesn't happen but brought this beaver team their strength is passing the ball yeah can they do what deceived it well they've come out trying to run it and they've had a lot of success so far Sarkisian the head coach the USC former head coach to the Huskies u.s. my speed which is a real statement Savior Hopkins but nowhere to go that time yeah Jay archive I was there and he just threw off his wouldbe blocker and made the play but getting back to Oregon State now this is a third down situation we'll see them go to the air but their game plan so far the first drive was to run at USC the way VC did but now will at manion's and how much to try and move him as he's not a mobile quarterback I did a shotgun pick gold in their leading receiver not playing this week because of a finger injury but what they're trying to set up the screen the pass complete but not enough to the first down woods run out of bounds before midfield by Scott Felix and fourth down coming up for Oregon State are you got to see a lot of that tonight five rushers by USC they know where Mannion is they don't believe he can run away from them and they want to get him off his spot make him throw on the move and a guy that had one of his worst nights last year against faster punting to Nelson a galore fair catch called at the 17yard line a 33yard punt nothing on the return Cody Kessler a few new wrinkles he says ready for the Beavers this week we'll see when we come back Kessler little rollin here at USC he's thrown a hundred and five passes now 106 passes this year without an interception day he's just really making good decisions mark knows when to hang on to the ball when to scramble just playing really mature smart quarterback described by his coaches as a winner great leader hands it up this time to buck Alan powering forward picks up about four yards rod let's take a look at the impact players well we start on the outside with nelson aguilar he's he's just an outstanding receiver he has a chance to be a really good NFL pro defensively Dylan Wynn is just incredibly active Johnson in the middle is gonna wind up running into buck Allen and off the lot tonight because we expect to see an awful lot of Allen running the football at that defense a career high last year in this game against Oregon State up in Corvallis they tossed it into the boundary that time they're waiting for them though at the 26 yard line nice tackle made by DJ Alexander well that group of linebackers they are so aggressive they are run focused they almost say to you we dare you to throw we're gonna we're gonna treat every play like a run see how quickly they shoot the gaps they run past the blockers they're not worried about passing that was a 30 short we'll see it throughout the game even on first down there sorry honey from his own 17 yard line Steven Nelson and goes down at about the 17 yard line a 53yard punt and Sean Mannion with the reins of the Oregon State offense when we return prince opener for the Beavers as USC comes in 1 and Owen pac12 play that one win big one up in palo alto against Stanford Terron ward in the backfield first down in ten for the Beavers their own 16 yard line they ran the ball very well that first drive to tight end set between the tackles to ward and he picks up about three woods with the stop Jessica USC has had a long time to think about that loss mark they have and they have lacked passion that's what they came to after that Boston College lost in fact in addition to their normal film sessions they watch sessions of them on the sidelines to see that they lacked energy they didn't have enthusiasm players told me it looked like a regular practice or offseason workout they said it's not going to be an overnight switch but it's something they're really focusing on to get that energy and passion back into this channel they're one of those real important intangibles second down and seven they faked the fly sweep in the pass incomplete at the 14 yard line to Tehran Ward usually a pretty sure handed receiver rod yeah you know to follow up on just this point you know Steve Sarkisian had his players during the off week that weekend to go watch some college football and watch some NFL football and just realize how fun the game is get the energy back understand how much you've been missing out on they were too tight he said the Stanford game in the Boston College game just feeling too much pressure and he's trying to get him to relax and have more fun speaking with sua Cravens the strong safety number 21 up there said that the chance to have some fun watching his favorite team the Steelers that pass into the boundary and it's complete right near the first down marker Jordan Villa men working against Jackson how about that throw we talked about Mannion being an NFL quarterback that was an NFL thrown didn't have much of a wind Berger to the didn't to enthrone holding on the defense number four that's a tenure at Finley that's against chris Hawkins that throw was like a pitcher just fighting one on the outside corner lowing away where only his guy the catcher could pick it up and a great pass it was to Jordan Villa man the question begs rod who is going to step up in the absence of victory and to be that home run hitter for Oregon State you are so right they need a guy that could make a difference on the outside bode and his out so who is going to be the guy to take his place I formation for Oregon I say weed Wars brought down immediately gain up about 1/4 lard making the stop on the play there's a look at Bouldin who broke his finger last week against San Diego State and how does that affect what they do offensive well they're affected because they like to run that jet sweep that fly sweep and send a little fast guy around and pick up the ball and then go deep well USC is basically saying we don't think your receivers are good enough now and so they're playing bump and run coverage on the outside ghosting time and vote in the box to stop the run in motion Mannion picked up room service touchdown Trojans Cravens there is he's just kind of playing a robber position sitting out there just reading the eyes and Mannion Mannion never saw him as he tried to get it to his tight end Hamlet and it was not to be there are six interception of the season and Mannion thinking about that error on the sidelines and just mentioned swap Cravens and how he enjoyed taking that time off that Jessica alluded to a moment ago and he watched one of his favorite players Troy Polamalu for the Steelers said he patterns his game after the former allamerican from USC take a look here he looks like he's in man coverage at least that's what Sean Mannion believed but watch but Craven does it's a zone it's a trap and he just moves right back takes the ball on a silver platter all the way into the end zone Mannion never saw him sitting there he thought it was man coverage Ryan Murphy's back deep in a tent tonight's block Murphy on touchdown Oregon State wouldn't answer 97 yards back at you and how did he run through that tackle at the end now once he gets to the edge they did a nice job of walking folks inside he got to the corner watch the angle that bet there is he's caught but he runs through it Wow an incredible swing from one end of the emotional gamut to the next yeah that was a missed tackle by Leon McQuay that's the first points allowed by the traction spoilers all worthless season unsportsmanlike conduct on the offense celebration way past the end zone the touchdown was good the 15yard penalty be assessed on the kickoff did he run into the Jackson like boat I mean to the tunnel like Bo Jackson I'm not sure I know this this bothers you if it were up to you if you're the commissioner it would be freeforall celebrate any way you want to right they just want to make everybody a drone I think that is an emphatic answer and the game is tied at 7 apiece Ryan Murphy with a 97 yard boat across the grass here at the LA Coliseum yeah now it was blocked pretty well but he finished this by himself with great speed and then just shaking off McQuay completely disregarding him on his way to the end zone I think Mike Riley and Sean Mannion can live with the quote/unquote celebration yeah Mannion goes hey thanks for getting my back here and just like that just when it seemed like USC had a little bit of an emotional edge and advantage and getting up a little bit man they turned the beat around in one play the Beavers doing the crowd went from celebrating sua Cravens pick six you know kind of dancin enjoying it before they could get back in their seats that was what just happened Morgan State trying to prove that the three and OH record this encounter fit by any means want to remind you that the last time they won a game here in Los Angeles against USC Dwight Eisenhower was the president a little contact wouldn't know anything about after the unsportsmanlike penalty down for mrs. Smith at about the 40 yard line we'll be first in 10 for Tesla an 18 yard kickoff return Louie Kessler redshirted 2011 in 2012 he backed up Matt Barkley the starter this year once again his first start the season against Fresno State through for 394 yards four touchdowns but Rob's since that time this offense has been a little bit of rhythmic hasn't been the same yeah you know Stanford kind of shut them down and then Boston College really shut them down and I really believe you know buck Allen is the focal point now that the shotgun kessler swings it a little miscommunication with him his receiver a galore now now this is part of the problem when you throw on first down and if you don't convert don't get anything out of it now you're second and long you're behind the chains and USC did not want to be in this situation the Sarkisian talked to us about that yesterday and he said look with Boston College we got into 2nd and 10 and way too often so we thought there'd be more buck Allen on 1st down no no they're second and 10 again right now I'm looking for a better week than he had a couple of weeks ago ran through this time sacked back at the 31 yard line by Dylan win it was win of the Beavers that said coming into the game eight this one is worth some cookies this one counts it's a conference game and up to the task here right now he just ripped his man that time over there on that right side just a nice little move clubbed him with his left arm and wind plays with a lot of energy a lot of emotion it's two senior out of Concord California third and long now for Kessler got to get just beyond midfield for the first down this is Roy Alan caught but because it was low short of the first down that whole series fell apart because of the incompletion on first down it allowed that aggressive defense to go get Kessler on second down and third and forever is hard to convert Stephen Nelson now back to get this pun marido punting him for USC it's ticking away from Montgomery the games ago against Stanford and then struggled a subsequent week against Boston College not a great effort there beavers with the ball when we come back going for the gamewinner right here and right now so this is it he can become the hero here how about this for pressure on a kicker you gotta be tough as nails come on here and drill it run by storm warts stronger and faster this season picks up three on the plane yes so far they've run away from minute Williams she's gonna say we haven't said his name now yeah I don't blame him I wouldn't run at him either so they've had some success on the ground when they've run away from him not really trying to block him because he's really hard to block second down and six the motion out of the I formation Mannion completes it near midfield Richard Mulaney Mulaney picks up 11 yards he's their surehanded received talk about Williams look at the crowd he draws three blockers there is the chip that's the shot on the ribs by woods you know that that's the one that supposed to remind you hey it's gonna be a long night first team allamerican Leonard Williams what's the best way to attack a guy like that you run Adam lower weight well Boston College didn't even try to block them they just optioned him they left left him alone but if you're gonna run at him you need a couple guys motion ball is gonna be spotted and they're gonna lose about two yards on the play I had a problem with the snap there but sure Mannion was ready for that now now I want to hold on for a second you know that was a snap quarterback Center exchange we don't see that very often we believe actually I think we saw huddle yeah loss of two on the play second and 12 flagon Mannion in big trouble sacked back of the 27 by Leonard Williams eventually you knew he'd get there yeah well balls got to come out Mannion held that too long he's not a guy who can extend the play he can't scramble around he has to throw the ball away when there's nothing there he held that a bit too long he just can't protect him with a guy like Williams on the field he will get there eventually Williams the guy that runs like a wide receiver believe it or not folks at 65 300 pounds really an amazing young man a great studentathlete rides a skateboard around campus well and he will move to the outs to the inside now they've got six defensive backs out there and he'll be trying to put pressure from the inside situation to try and flow against his defense bird and 26 you see some of that frozen energy on the sidelines the screen pass incomplete for storm woods Sean Mannion seemed little rattled after yeah you know I think I think he held the ball too long there I think that pic suah Craven the pick6 you know there hasn't been a little rhythm there for Mannion he's had a couple of bad series in a row I think he's feeling that little bit lose your confidence when you give up a pick six and get sacked he's hostile punning from his own 20yard line now Senegal are back at his own twenty five for USC Bangalore is added punt return duties to his responsibilities this year for USC on the fly at 2:30 breaks one table now a second nice straight armature broken I Jack's out of bounds near the 40yard line but bounces back up Chris Brown got him with a nice shot on the sidelines a 36yard punt eight on the return and boy a lot of action on that one play but yeah he's holding hands and he's getting rid of Murphy there but but watch him take a shot here at the end good clean shot led with the shoulder got him underneath the shoulder pad nothing wrong with that just good aggressive football by Brown when you're looking at both your cleats up in the air on the way down it's a good hit 109 to go here in the first quarter tied at 7 apiece Justin Davis in the backfield first and ten for USC Davis ones under the boundary the 40 picks up about two on the plate Steven Nelson did you see time do you see DJ Alexander number four the weakside linebacker in the backfield that time on first down we talked about these guys he's linebacker they are going after him they never really got set defensively that time Rob but they make them play anyway back at the 35 so what's the counter for us seen well they don't want to have to throw it on first down misdirection play action pass at you haven't of time would help but on first and second down you see the formula Oregon State is just coming right after them they are daring them to try something else they don't want them running the ball and first down a loss of four on the last play all the way back to the 36 yard line an Oregon State defensively seemed a little bit discombobulated illegal substitution on the defense 12 players in formation flight penalty down that's what happened Dadar they're trying to get there they're nickel five defensive back unit or six defensive back unit on the field and there was some miscommunication third and seven for us farmer in motion to the top of the screen nestle with all day to throw and nicely padded away 48 yard line by Larry Scott intended for Darius Rogers fourth and seven the month they only rushed three drop eight into coverage this plan Oregon State has so far is working it is get after them on first down bring the pressure to stop the rushing attack and force Kessler in the passing attack to try and convert on second and long and third and long not so good so far 18 20 USC struggling a little bit here against unranked Oregon State on the return Steven Nelson on the sidelines and a flag down as Nelson goes down at the 45 but there's a flag all the way back at the 13 yard line 51 yard punt 37 on the return if it stands the Oregon State has been pretty good on special teams but for this flag already a kickoff return for 6a kick six and that punt return is looking pretty good until that flag was from Radha what do you make of us see so far one untimed down coming up here rod what do you make a USC they've had a week off what do they look like so far well I I think the college football world is waiting to see hmm after that Stanford game I think we all thought they could be a top five a playoff kind of team and then Boston College it's unclear so far I think their defense is planted a little bit better offensively we've seen no flow nor rhythms and they've kind of abandoned their rushing attack so far found it interesting that coach sarkeesian's said that they were a little bit tight as you alluded to coming off of the Stanford game even though they won they took that frame of mind across the country with them I still think they're trying to find their identity I mean I think of them as a a team that can run the ball with Allen and then throw but I think they want to be a team that passes the ball and then runs it again one and lo and behold another flag down the result of illegal motion on the front line false start offense number 62 first down defensive linemen have it a tough night tonight so far it's not only the freshman huh yeah not just the USC freshmen all alignment some veterans having trouble on the other side first and 13 will play one more here in the first quarter tipped at the line of scrimmage and not the way they drew it up although take it anyway as milady makes the that's who they are but that's not what they're doing little identity crisis maybe I think so second and eight for Mannion quick release and completely at the 37 yard line to richard Mullaney who was working against Kevon seymour yeah he's from nearby Thousand Oaks California he is 63 he's working against Seymour who's about six feet he sees the ball and goes up and gets it at the highest point he's one of those guys we talked about who might have to step up tonight because Vick Bouldin their best receiver is out they need their most experienced wide out in the backyard throw it in set up the screen well diagnosed Seymour came right back to make the stop on the play but a sixyard gain by Oregon State but you know you talked a little bit earlier about Mannion not not being himself and I think you're right and I think Mike Riley wants to get him comfortable again screen passes take off a little bit of the pressure get him a couple completions get him going Mullaney helped them out there they can't win without Mannion having a big night last year group too close to 5,000 yards second and five coming up for Oregon State with a nice cutback and picks up the first down at the 48 yard line Gavin Andrews with a nice block on the 8 yard game Hey hng take take a look here you got one tied in two tight ends that's not normally what Oregon State does but because of the success teams have had running against USC Boston College 450 last week two weeks ago they're saying we're going to get our tight ends we're going to line up we're gonna run it at to you we're gonna do what Boston College did interest an adjustment by Oregon State Banyon goes right back to Mulaney outstanding grab this one down to the 22 yard line working against Kevon Seymour again that's a 50/50 ball either player can get it but Mulaney has the better angle and does a good job of getting up there now that left hand that left hand that he had on Seymour that's okay yes he was gonna push off now you're you both are doing that chicken fighting you got your hands on each other you're not gonna get called for that you have to understand that and Seymour has to get rid of that hand get off and so it doesn't keep him down when he wants to jump seems like they're really going to work on Seymour he yep came off the field and now has come back on post intend to the Beavers right back to him working against the same guy and incomplete so three times rod on the same drive they've gone to Mulaney against Kevon Seymour well tells you a little bit in the scouting report this week was to work on Seymour and they got the match if they wanted and it's a 50/50 ball again this ball is just a little bit thrown away but that single coverage they're going after now Justin Wilcox D coordinator for USC he knew this was coming and he said his corners were gonna have to hold up in those matchups he knew Oregon State wanted to take some shots at his corners second and 10 to Rhonda Ward in the backfield single back formation and more flags false start offense number 65 fiveyard penalty second down that's the sixth penalty already against Oregon State while Savior Hawkins came into the ballgame how important is he tonight for again states he could give them what they've been missing with Bolden that guy who can run the fly sweet the guy on the quick pass he's number 19 in the slot he's coming to the bottom of your screen when he was supposed to redshirt this season but they burned up his bones at her emotions to the top there's that fly sweep fake Mannion in completely almost intercepted should have been caught it looked like Blanton burg had it go in and out of his arms Caleb Smith was the intended receiver that's a guy they want to find a lot tonight yeah but that play was disrupted by mcquay number 22 who was in a short zone but dropped back and he really kind of got a little hand on that ball that changed everything Ginty you might not be able to get it all if you already state but you want to stay in field goal range I can't take a side and down the middle of the field a flag down on the play they're going to rule it incomplete intended for Connor Hamlet that wouldn't look like it should have been caught yeah that flag is usually in the area of defensive holding honour Hamlet a big target the tight end six seven before the pass was thrown holding on the defense number four 10yard penalty automatic first down that's against chris Hawkins the guy who's interestingly enough replacing Josh Shaw who is suspended indefinitely so it's gonna be first down from the 16 yard line and that's the fifth penalty against USC that's a huge penalty that saves the drive Oregon State and they still they've got Hawkins back in now we pay attention him because he's the guy who can run with the ball from that wide receiver emotions and they will wait that's gonna be a loss all the way back near the 24 Cravens has been everywhere tonight rod for USC 21 he's having tonight and he was certainly also paying attention to Hawkins being in the ballgame hadn't had him lined up right from the start pick six tip ball and a big tackle for loss right there he was lying to us he wasn't watching Sunday football on his days off he was watching film yeah he was reading that scouting report second and 17 at the 7 yard loss as that back shoulder paid in some plead intended for filament and it's gonna be third and 17 coming up for Oregon State what do you figure right now they are looking at a 40 to 43 yard fill go which should be within range well within rubber remains right make it more about 46 from about here so you got to be careful if you're Mannion you don't want to take a sack you want to get something but you don't want to take a factor Eleni is split into the boundary I run this little screen to Hamlet I'd have gotten two yards on that Leonard Williams makes the tackle on the play and it's poured down in comes the field goal unit for Oregon State prepara main talent talented kicker but as lack of consistency at times Sophia's first make it a season from 38 marta and romain knocks it through now 1 for 1 on the year Oregon State with a 3 point lead here in Los Angeles when we come back football Tom Brady's pretty good yeah he's he's done ok I wonder if he could help that Michigan football team Marie Jackson on the return and Jackson with a nice return out to the 35 yard line coach sarkeesian had to get his team cranked up after three days off here's what it sounded like on Wednesday this week no let's go you're too close to the quarterback Justin throw it max good job good job good job good job oh my gosh coach put one of his players on blast then when he asked him who that song is done by who that rapper is it his player didn't know it was LL Cool J imagine that he's got demographics wrong he's got a lot of rap on inside first down in ten ran through almost the arms of his players tacklers 7yard gain on the play let's take a look at how USC is planning for success brought to you by Northwestern Mutual yeah don't pass on on buck he's the main cog of that often do a good job on first down and defensively it's all about moving Shawn manion's feet don't let him get set we got a pick six already not just what you were talking about on our Northwestern Mutual jeez there you know I was talking to mark banker the D coordinator for Oregon State before the game I asked him about the identity in an Allen he said don't don't say anything because we don't want to see them just turn around and give it the alley behind that big offensive line Allen out of Tallahassee Florida I snap it's the call again but this time two people he's gonna lose a couple of yards Jalen Grimble the transfer from Miami in the loss of two you mention Allen being from Florida I imagine that will Muschamp doesn't like watching USC play there way too many Florida players that he could be using for the Gators that are out here in California yeah Allen a galore and a host of others Leonard Williams Daytona Beach guy who's that drop complete varma one of the faster players offensively for the trojans you know that fan for a success talked about first down for USC not so good not 1.8 tonight and then this all really kind of started at boston college and they only ran 16 blaze rod in the first quarter well under the pace of the 7580 that they want to run or receivers out on this formation that case isn't as fast as we thought it would be for that whole bunch of moving parts that time for USC and none of them seemingly fitting together got the sense they were out of rhythm from the start false start offense number 82 flagrantly filter down you know Kessler spent a long time looking at the sidelines and then he had to relay that to the team and then yet the false start it just seemed like it was out of sync from the starter not a lot of rhythm to it but when you can't get anything done on first down your rhythm kind of goes away makes up a third down and nine at the 17 by Brice Dixon the talented true freshman went up in a crowd and got it well it was a blitz a lot of pressure Keller Kessler knew right away he had single coverage and he went his big tight ends he may be a freshman but he can play six foot four 240 he won the archein little receiver spleen well diagnosed Harris one of the bounds a loss of about two one more look at that great catch though by Dixon yeah that bats just getting the ball at its highest point that would be a 5050 ball he's got a defender on him then he's going to go up and win that battle some guys are really excited about some comparisons to a Jimmy Graham time yeah yeah yeah he can run second down and 12 Snickers split to the bottom your screen at 3:00 Smith brought down immediately the 17yard line cook tackle on the play by Scott but a gain of three sets up a third down and nine we talked about those plays earlier it's hard to throw those players against mantoman coverage but they have some matchups down here that might work for them you know they can split Dixon out as he did on that last play at six four he becomes a matchup problem but they've gone to that he's now attached and they've gone to an extra receiver that looks like another 18 Harris in the slot sniffing touchdown Trojans Justin Davis great balance by Davis to make it into the endzone yeah just a wheel route out of the backfield Harris the receiver ran off the coverage Davis just came out of the backfield nobody picked him up you'll see him all by himself out there and good effort to get into the endzone Cody Kessler that's his ninth touchdown pass of the season 29th of his career without an interception as well extra building USC backed up by four points Dez Kessler is a great decisionmaker accurate just trying to get the ball out on time a little bit more got it out on time that time came to ten Oregon State trying to snap 50 year losing streak here in Los Angeles you're talking 1960 but yes it's way back Oregon State coming in at three and oh enough a very impressive win against San Diego State the Trojans me bounce back after losing a couple weeks ago Chestnut Hill Massachusetts let's take one more look what was the key on this touchdown well you know Alexander is here I think he's got Davis locked up but watch the action by Harris as he runs let's not call it a pick but a little rub on here and completely blocks off Alexander but he was so far away wasn't paying attention to get out there easy for Davis and that will route there was nobody there and of great view aerial coverage provided by the Goodyear blimp everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven and a fantastic view from up top on venerable Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum all in a device cute yes it was a good day so far look at the scoring drive of USC you can see the touchdown on that watch ESPN app little devices oh you're never caught without Oh watching games on the phone on the way over the stadium every Saturday afternoon got what works storm Ward's donning the eye in the iformation he gets the call girl still on his feet keeps those feet moving determined dauntless running all the way out for the 40yard line storm woods picks up 15 off that left side and we talked about the tight end and sometimes two tight end formations that Oregon State is used effectively to run the football they blew a tire will have to come out of the Paul game Ron Ward comes in for him it's nice a complimentary pair Rock they have in the back here yeah he's a weaboo he wobbles but he didn't fall down Laney in motion and the lady with the reception over the 45 little 46 picks up six on the play Ward number 28 in four woods was the Northern California high school player of the year wasn't highly recruited but has himself a nice home in Corvallis Oregon playing for Mike Riley five foot seven 200 pounds great balance really good feet you'll see them use him down around the goal line because he's hard to see and then he gets up on a guy and it's hard for them to tackle and he'll just bounce off yards on the team from the middle ball game to call here falls forward for about two yards Ward and woods the combo package in the backfield speaking of Mike Riley we haven't talked about it here much tonight but here's the longer tenured head coach in the pac12 Conference a lot of great experience in the head coach of the San Diego Chargers this is actually a homecoming at Mike Riley was the head coach here at USC for several years I think there's a coach in college football who is more respected more well liked by everybody than Mike Riley third and two for his beaver suit weights back in the ball game the offset I Andersen's blah get enough for the first down Rob they just rolled up their sleeves and muscled up that they did and they ran right at sua Cravens 21 the guy who's having a big night why they go right at him and good job blocking they don't allow him to secure the outside and that's exactly where they want to run that's a really good job by Oregon State up front three yard gain but good enough for a first down Craven's already with the pick6 tonight yeah we're having a big night you see the balanced by Oregon State they've tried running it inside and outside but more success outside we've sent Leonard Williams name a few times the talented allamerican defensive end and not as much as we thought except for a sack that time by Cravens who's getting it done tonight oh man dad I don't think it was too happy about being blocked on that last play he's hovering around the line of scrimmage they've taken him and moved above into that strong side linebacker position and he is too quick for those guys on on passing downs so they've relieved him essentially of past responsibilities tonight we've gotten him more involved in the in the rushing attack played a lot as a true freshman last year Ravens and very impressive sophomore second and 18 now for the Beavers approaching four minutes to go here in the first half another flag on the play the way of game offense tigrerra penalty second down is it just me or do you get the sense that Mannion is is off tonight he's trying to decipher things and haven't seen him this out of sync so far this year and watching the film well we talked about the plan for USC is to move him to make him move his feet not let him set and throw the ball and a chance to get rid of it a little pass interference here on the play they're gonna get Hawkins again DJ Alexander back there as well before the pass was thrown holding on the defense number four 10yard penalty automatic first down Hawkins the culprit they're having trouble dealing with Mullaney but this time it's Villa mean who hasn't been out there an awful lot but he's six foot four and there's that matchup issue when you're 511 six feet and you're going up against somebody who's taller and they're just throwing it up there a combined 14 penalties for both teams tonight first and ten from their midfield dumps it off under run by storm wards to pick up an Oregon state first down just shy of the 40 yard line got 11 on that one great job just getting rid of the football my Mannion is under duress here the pocket collapses he's untime right now but when he hitches up he has to get rid of it he needed to get rid of it a little bit sooner there was no place to go with he stayin alive a little bit longer but he's not comfortable in the pocket you talked about getting him off a spot earlier did they do that that players what it was like he saw the hitch up he moved up a step or two when he should have been moving and throwing he was moving up in the pock and that's what they want to do 38yard line in the flight coming Tyler Anderson made the catch on the play he picked up four see what this flag is about right near where he went out of bounds see how accurate those throws are when his feeder said he gives the receiver a chance to turn up the field personal foul face mask on the defense number 10 15 yard penalty first down oh yeah there it is that's Florida Sean Mannion though he had a great offseason working out at the Peyton Manning passing Academy didn't do win that thing that's the MVP or something to stand out there we need to put it all together here the senior here taking a shot almost intercepted yes it is Leon McClane the reception that is that gets tipped up in the air by philomene philomene has a shot at it but he can't come down with the cleanly looks like that was a Dori Jackson who got in there on it but what a hustle play at the end by mcquay that'll give us see the ball in some momentum be eliminated NASCAR Sprint Cup Series at Dover tomorrow at one o'clock on ESPN presented by Pennzoil and back to the action what a great play on that interception a moment ago by a Dori Jackson number two plays defensive back plays receiver he has a touchdown as a receiver this year and is also on special team doesn't return get me started cuz you think he's not playing where I think he's a great receiver folks I'll say that first he is a corner he could be the best corner in college football before he's done why do you think you should ITP I put on the tape and watched him play mantoman against time Montgomery of Stanford and he more than held his own and then when you watch him in practice and other tapes he just jumps out at you and I've seen some really good corners and I think there are three outstanding corners this year and I'd have him right now without playing at full time he's one of the top five or six out there he he will be an NFL player at corner I wish he just focus on that and not the wide receiver spot also two on the last play and look at that more flags hey but I'm not talking behind his back I told him that yesterday you did yeah 90650 Finley third down hurt you mentioned something about getting paid as a professional yeah that's when it sais little yeah I mentioned that there might be a bigger paycheck involved playing corner than a slot receiver and so rare to see a true freshman be able to handle so much responsibility so early in his career now watching from the sidelines Tesla fires a strike from Pope Harris on the catch another freshman he's from Crenshaw High School this is his first extensive action and they have a number of talented freshmen on this team Billie are shaken up down there for Oregon State now there is some pretty good depth for USC when you go across the two deep and all the skill positions they've got I've got four freshmen receivers were good but here's the the injury and that looks like that's a shot that Justin strong took the backup safety he's down at the 40yard line will bat back be back with more right after this back in Los Angeles first down in 10 for the Trojans from their own 44 incomplete Jackson helped out in an interception a moment ago this time that pass incomplete he was the intended target rod yeah he's trying to show his skills to the receiver he beats the jam they didn't reroute him and he just runs right by the corner over there Lewis Nolan Lewis actually playing the safety spot on him and he was open balls a little under thrown and then the left hand by Nolan Lewis gets up there not one of Kessler's better passers he had completed his last nine in a row before that incompletion but let's go back to the true freshman Jackson how tough is it for him to go from one meeting room to the next offense defense special teams well you know they're managing that for him so he's spending most of his time with defense and then they're had they had six or eight plays that they use for him that he learns with the offense but he's got he's got great condition he's 18 years old he can run all day in motion as a man underneath as Bryce Dixon and they show you and he shows you why they're so excited about this potential and promise you know sometimes they split him out as a wide receiver to get a matchup that they like because he runs really well and he's about six foot four and that gives you a mismatch then close to Andre Norris field goal range he's made 155 Gessler wisely throws it away didn't have anyone open that's the decisionmaking we talked about it earlier you know he recognized first down I don't have to stay back here and deal with the pressure of a blitz then they get rid of it now they flagged it and saying there was no one over there gonna be grounded passer was in the pocket there was no ozone receiver in the area intentional grounding offense number six gloss it down at the spot of the foul third down so when you're outside the pocket you can throw the ball away so long as it goes across the line of scrimmage but when you're in the pocket you have to have a receiver in the area there is no one in the area there was this receiver lose 20 yards downfield it's good call second and 20 little over a minute to go in the first half Kesler incomplete intended for New Jersey Smith so it started off looking like a promising Drive now turns into a third and 20 and they're not even in field goal range anymore yeah you know it just hasn't worked out very well there that that penalty hurt them the deep ball that they couldn't get get handled they had plenty of time timeouts at midfield and this twominute drive has not worked out very well for them Trojans leading by four full complement of three timeouts remaining but not sure that they're gonna come in handy here or be a factor at all Dalen appended the 48 yard line by Ryan Murphy that guy right there has played a great football game tonight had a kickoff return for a touchdown now calling for the athletic trainer seems a little shaken up made a nice tackle on buck Allen that last play Murphy nice 10foot yeah they're gonna tend to him and in the meantime we'll kick it back to restate us in the studio Reese what's up all right race interesting to hear Rhys say what went wrong quoteunquote for Florida State even though they came back to win I'm interested to hear what reason may they have to say about it because their defense really struggle for Florida State today and they were behind and all for a long time in that ballgame and right before the game you and I had a chance to speak with committee member an athletic director of USC Pat Hayes who said that he was cataloging and watching some for football games this morning in this afternoon and filing the information away yeah he's they were two state game one of them and he said he was going to create his own personal top for tomorrow the next day that he's not going to share publicly but it's gonna help him kind of look at things over the next week or two and he also said he's got a couple of folks in the business school crunching some numbers for him helping him out I'm not sure how I feel about committee members getting extra help just numbers and there's a look at that Haden you know Barry Alvarez is getting some help to from somewhere I'm his dad college football playoff committee members you know all they have to do is listen to Reece Lewin mark is that easy out there and thousands of others play clock lines down Murphy goes into the Oregon State locker room they burn one other time out see their first time out this kind of a wasted opportunity to head first down in midfield get nothing out of it what's the thinking here for the trail perrolli they want to take a shot at a Hail Mary heels of the timeout Kessler pranks one down field in it's Hail Mary touchdown Rogers with the catch that's how you draw it up Wow apparently folks didn't see the end of the cal arizona game because defensive backs everywhere are yelling just knock it down just knock it down Wow incredible unbelievable implausible and he he's now the tallest receiver down there's about six feet six one but he gets up and gets it takes it away from everybody career long touchdown catch for Rogers an incredible way for USC to end the first half downstairs and welcome back everyone to college football finale here on ESPN a look high above the venerable Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as Oregon State tries to end an insidious losing streak that dates all the way back to 1960 right here in Los Angeles Mark Jones alongside rod Gilmore Jessica Mendoza down on the sidelines she'll be joining us in just a bit in the first half USC leads by 11 rod if he doesn't feel like that much of an advantage Kesler their quarterback not spectacular but a very efficient 17 to 22 I thought the Oregon State defense actually played well they harassed Kessler they kept things in check but a couple of plays got away from them and all of a sudden USC is right where they want to be ahead after halftime but I don't think us he played great in the first half Kessler did his part and Allen at tailback helping out in a balanced way both running and receiving Oregon State will receive the ball here to begin the third quarter and line drive kit Murphy already has a kickoff return for touchdown tonight not this time brought down at the 21 yard line as we go down to Jessica Lamar crowd organs they can compete and so Mike Riley told me at happy said the guys are fired up you said they said they'd take away a couple places that were in this game but they also are gonna mix it up offensively to get Sean Mannion more protection he said he's gonna turn it a little bit more and he's gonna try to get an extra guy in mark all right a lot of things on the mind of Mike Riley as votes for Oregon State maybe that last play of the game that Hail Mary type of play can leave you with a little bit of a hangover oh nana it can take the wind out of yourselves left tackle over the back of gavin and who storm woods with a nice gain of six yards on the play cerro with a tackle for the trojans and those two plays that mike riley would like to have back the pick six and the Hail Mary you take those two away if you're Oregon State fan you go you know what we actually are doing all right here but you don't get to take plays away not at all this Oregon State team coming in it perfect three you know in the wake of an impressive win against San Diego State to the top of your screen tight end formation picks up the first down and the 33 goes to keep plays right here well the first one is just a misstep by Mannion he didn't see sua Craven they're sitting in zone thought it was mantoman coverage watch the Oregon State defenders watch the how many of them are not involved into playing they're down there they're not Vaculik backing themselves up against a receiver they're not going for the ball they're there assuming the play is over what's the rule for DPS down there what are you supposed to do now you keep guys in front of you don't let me get behind you and you knock it down Mannion slings it complete at the 33 nice move in the open field and it's stripped clean USC football Ricky Ortiz got ripped and once again Craven's right in the middle of everything Hayes Pollard also helped out on the tackle but there's a flag down of the play let's see if it stands once again sOooo Cravens in the middle of the action he's having an allconference kind of night tonight the officials obviously discussing what exactly transpired unless the flag came before the rift we'll see right here before the ball became loose personal foul face mask on the defense number 10 15 yard penalty first down so Oregon State retains possession huge break for the Beavers here yeah and we'll see it right here it's the right hand the lard gets the right hand on the facemask and this trip occurs after that so a break for Oregon State that that new flag was there yeah that keeps possession that would have put them in a really bad bad position there had that not not occurred now on the Trojans side of midfield of the 47 yard line first down in ten protecting Mannion is the key and woods in the backyard lining up in the offset I woods behind the block parties but the defense light there to meet him at the 46 yard line a gain of one on the play works with the stop yeah Woods made the talk but junior divided number 58 there in your screen really turned that thing back inside he shut down the outside and allowed his teammates to help Malphite really good defensive play second and nine tight splits by the wide receivers here the playaction looking for Mullaney into traffic and incomplete he was lucky that one wasn't picked off Seymour had a good shot at yeah he's not seeing guys that's a second time he didn't realize there was a guy in the zone coverage who flashed where he wanted to throw the ball Seymour is in an underneath zone and he just sinks right where this ball is and Mannion never saw him what's USC doing to confuse him that much well you know they're showing some man coverage in the he's reading it is man coverage and sometimes you've got a guy like Seymour who when he's not bred and he just continues to sink and Mannion never saw him they were working over Seymour a little bit earlier tonight hence the more zone coverage 39 vanian almost picked off batted down by ballon vaudeville own the juco transfer makes a fourth and nine fortune State so after that huge break that the Beavers picked up on the facemask penalty don't have to punt after all well you see a good job up front by pallone getting his hands up third punt of the night for Keith kostol a galore back at the 12 for USC fair catch called at the 10 that's gonna be a great net 36 yard punt nothing on their turn first series of the third quarter for USC when we come back but travel to Eugene to take the field against Marcus Mariota and number two oregon thursday 10:30 on ESPN and watch ESPN as Mariota the best quarterback well we have to go back to last week first kal Arizona and this is one happened at the end of the game a Hail Mary pass last play of the game Salomon downfield caught at the other end the Cal media people had already sent out the email stating a talent in it didn't happen that way Allen would to run that time morally yeah wait until the last play before he hit the send button and we have a player hurt remember you'll see Arizona taking on Oregon next week that's jaylen Grimble the the really good defensive tackle for Oregon State is down on the ground now you know the good thing about Cal while we're talking pac12 here rod is that today they won a wild shootout game against Colorado in conference play they didn't let that loss beat them twice something to be said for them great mental toughness considering that Colorado tied the game up with 30 seconds to go with a touchdown pass bringing back memories for the cow folks of the Arizona game yet they held on to win that in overtime and see some of the top performers today and man Todd Gurley who he put some numbers up but what about the Colorado and California Costa Notre Dame with a career game today almost 400 yards passing and four touchdowns we're gonna take a timeout and find out more on that on the other side it's customary traffic and traffic jams look at the 10 and 110 freeways here in Southern California freeways weren't that clear the last couple nights clear they tended to on sidelines as USC runs it Boris Allen picks up three yards on the plane Allen started off the season with the game at 133 yards on the ground against Fresno State followed that up with a careerhigh 154 against Stanford in that huge win up in Palo Alto and then two weeks ago in that loss against Boston College just 15 for 31 on the ground a nice healthy average in that first half we'll see how much they use him the past Allen the intended target and it's incomplete and its fourth and four coming up so a quick three and out for the USC offense and Justin strong comes over and separates the ball from the receiver that that looked like a catch until he got there that's a big play cuz it will result in a punt which should give work instate good field position watch him come over and just separate the ball from Allen here Allen had a shot at a onehanded catch but great play by strong punt of the night in a fair catch call the back at the 43 yard line a 40 yard punt Nelson with the catch well aerial coverage provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven organs taken to take over with good starting field position here there's second possession of the third quarter a team trying to snap a losing streak which dates back decades and they need a solid possession here they may need to get Mannion comfortable and going he's he's thrown two pigs tonight that's not a good sign in Oregon State he's two and ten in terms of Oh Stu being picked off Seymour got there as Mulaney the intended receiver got there ii attend and driving everything pretty quickly but just really hasn't been enough down the field roads to make these corners back off when there was mantoman coverage they took some shots it sort of the fade routes but just really attacking them down the field hasn't happened the part of that's due to the lack of times too much pressure on man ward in the backfield he didn't sack we got it off it's gonna be ruled incomplete almost sacked back to the 35 yard line Scott Felix there with the heat can't hold the ball that long now watch our big guy here Bennett Williams look at all the attention that he gets he gets a guard he gets another lineman he gets him back and he just keeps fighting through because Mannion is hanging on to the ball and he almost gets in there now this is just too long you got to get the ball out gotta go gotta go gotta go gotta go can't hold it that long gotta throw it away Romanians missed his last four passes Brogan's D with a chance to pin their ear back and come by then incomplete at the 30yard line nobody home hunter Jamin the closest one there keep in mind folks if you're just joining us Victor Bolden Morgan state's leading receiver coming into the game tonight is not playing because of a broken finger did not practice this week and that's a huge loss for the organs get offense it's taken away their patented fly sweep game their screen game has been somewhat limited and the down the field deep ball has not really been a big part of their offense tonight Osmos punt bounces over 21 Aguilar watches it bounce and takes a beaver roll all the way down to the 12 yard line order be first down in ten from their 44 yard punt and back after this New Year's Eve New Year's Day six fantastic games and bowl games top four everybody's wondering let's take a look at this week's rankings brought to you by Capital One and we almost had a major shakeup at the top down nice comeback route complete choochoo Smith than to Florida State squeezing by how much you think it affects them in the overall picture of things I've stopped food I think the combination of the last two weeks struggling with Clemson and you know without Jameis Winston and being way behind today against NC State I think they're gonna lose some boats it wouldn't surprise me to see Alabama and Oklahoma move up Justin Davis on the run organ of course with the week off Alabama Oklahoma also Idol first down in ten Justin Davis again picks up seven that time running right in the perceived strength of that Oregon State defense is front seven it looks like they're going a little quick he arrived yeah yeah they finally get a little bit more pace because they got something going on down Davis again gonna be about a yard short of first down on a two yard gain you take USC out of there up tempo when they don't get positive yardage on first down if you win first down against that the temple team you can really change things because sort of keeping it himself well that's gonna be close I'm not sure he got it I don't think he did now fourth and short coming up what do you do if your coach Sarkisian well I think you kick it you've got a twopossession lead you're in your own territory why give momentum to Oregon State you know and take the risk here sometimes folks take chances and it hurts him how about Chris Peterson of Washington today rolled the dice tied with Stanford in the fourth quarter late in the fourth quarter fake punt from midfield and they're gonna go forward here fourth down and one for USC pull on the play clock hey go for it and they're gonna get enough it looks like luck Allen got just enough you see the approximation that line we have the first down line and they get it yes yeah I just think that's an unnecessary risk I mean you miss that one that's a turnover mr. 10 Kesler and incomplete intended for juju Smith Smith the another guy that factors significantly into their playbook I was talking about that Stanford Washington game Chris Peters was going to get some heat over that because had he punted the ball and back Stanford up they might have gotten it back the way they were defense is planned but instead they make a short field Stanford goes down and gets a touchdown wins a game we pass at the 40 she's tough and Telfer with the first down they got a couple of talented tight in that's a tight end doing that that's a tight end making people miss six four to sixty and nimble feet great job of extending the play by kessler but that's a tight end doing that look like a wide receiver a guy that's punching some injuries in his time here six more senior run it straight ahead walk gallon that time picks up a yard on the place and they haven't said enough about this line backing crew at Oregon State they've done a tremendous job tonight we got a player shaking up down in the field it's coming with a little bit of attrition it looks like somebody up front is that hotel I think it is that that's the second defensive tackle Grimble went down earlier and he and how tile play the same spot yeah Grimble will not return to the game we are told by our Jessica Mendoza down to the sidelines because of a knee injury you can see him there nursing it on the sidelines second down and nine coming up and boy they're forced to go deep into their depth chart now the unmarked banker the defensive coordinator I'm sure is getting concerned about his depth of front now coming into the game tonight Oregon State's defense was 10th nationally and past defense and number one in pass efficiency defense they haven't given up a passing touchdown all year this is a different level of competition tonight against USC yeah but you know they've played well though I mean you take away the pick six in the Hail Mary and they've held USC to seven points and the help Mary never should have happened they never should have given that up but this group of linebackers it's an aggressive group as we see how tile walking off the field that's good to see but they're aggressive particularly on first down second down and they've been effective we talked about some of the losses they've had going back to last year Scott Crichton mmhmm left early he'll draft ten to play the drive coming up for USC bass complete first down catch and run by Harris you will see going with their tempo game now 11yard pickup all the way down to the 41 Kesler finds a man of the 23 yard line Telfer on the receiving end again Kessler's extending planes that's a difference between Kessler and Mannion Mannion can't do this Kessler buys time he's mobile enough to buy time and keep his eyes down the field we've seen him do it three four times tonight boy really affords you the opportunity to make some place as opposed to being a stationary target back there under seven minutes to go in the third tesslar that time putting a little to rush and took a shot back at the 32yard line man he got rocked and that's oakum watch him a converted wide receiver yeah he's quick and he just slips right past the tight end Bryce Dixon and had a big shot there took him on just got rid of Dixon and a big tip big hit but but when he wrapped up its all the way he used the arms he got him up high but wrapped him up more exactly a year he was so deep on the depth chart as a wide receiver they invited him over the defensive end of the ball and has been a great standout since Gessler down the seam and incomplete into the end zone that one intended for Harris third and 17 coming up now for us see what do you like here because they've they've had pretty good balance for most of the night rod yeah well I would think that they would want to make sure they stay in the possible fill goal situation so it wouldn't surprise me to see sort of a quick screen or so where you think the range is empty formation 55yard ring please Alan and Alan inside the 20 down at the 18 sets up a fourth and about four to go picked up 12 it's gonna be a lot closer than 55 and there's another Oregon State player down how it just come back into the ballgame for Oregon State can't tell yet who that injured player is now for the Beavers it's a cut block no Kate on go on the receiving end of that number 91 yeah right there yeah just to cut block right at his knee yeah I'm just I'm not a fan of those things you know we've eliminated from the game the the highlow combination and usually you only see the cut block on quick passes not a fan of legal play though it's illegal it's legal and I'd like to see the competition committee look at all types of blocks that are dangerous to the knees and the light they're exposed enough yeah I mean there's some value in saying to the big guys and the pit there hey just get up and lean on each other push each other around as we noted jaylen Grimble starting left tackle it's already done for the night fourth and five coming up meanwhile for the Trojans as they tend to tango looks like placekicker aundrea dari has come onto the field you know that's that third defensive lineman you know that's separate injury in this ballgame for Oregon State with knee injuries it's good to see him right now the diary coming into the ballgame can attempt this field goal he's 4 for 5 on the season with a long of 53 this one from 36 get the snap down and he knuckles it no good a blown opportunity for USC in Oregon State capitalize on the Aaron kick one did a little over five minutes on the clock come away without any points come back with woods brought down for a gain of two on the play what are the Beavers have to do here Raza get some semblance of consistency going on offensively well first down would be helpful but sua Cravens is a problem for them they've handled Williams tonight by assigning three guys but Cravens has disrupted everything else for them is it harder to gameplan for a guy like yeah yeah he's too quick for those big guys up front in the pass game you know he's strong enough to hang in there and quick enough to get in the back show on run plays and so Mannion doesn't have great protection second and eight make before I sleep Mannion now to the 27 its Caleb Smith picks up four they'll be third down in about four to go for Oregon State been an adventure tonight on third down well the neighbors they need something maybe mulaney's your guy here but first and foremost I'd keep another guy in and protect menu you know go full max if I got to run a 2 receiver pattern that's what I would do but you got no chance of getting the ball off if you don't protect or 1 for 6 tonight we're down given time what a catch and it's incomplete he had it in his hands and then hit the ground and philomon had it popped loose on him at that point yeah a little bit high had to reach for it thought he had it for a moment but still you know that bad ball came out quick but still not comfortable you know Mannion still still rushing that way I don't blame him for rushing and he's been in under duress all night three and out where they only hold on to the ball for a minute and a half and the Trojans will flip the field on him a little bit here after this punt with some pretty good field position angle are standing on his 35 and a great punt by possible all the way back to the 20 brought down into 24 and we got a flag down on the play as well a booming effort 53 yards by heath coastal just as I said it looked like they were gonna flip the field on him well and he he got that off with pressure I mean they were coming to block that when it was not a return set up and he still got all of it during the return either he'll walk in the back on the return team number 24 10yard penalty first down let's take a look at it well right in the middle of your screen here comes the block in the back actually he whiffed on him but it looked like he was close enough I thought he did win I did win he tried but he gets flagged for the effort okay so they push it back to the 13th last time the Trojans had the football they looked pretty good they were able to move it down the field quite a bit but had that missed field goal a lot of penalties tonight total of 19 Justin Davis in the backfield on first down it's Davis on the ball Reitz 1 for the first down out to the 23 yard line hey Jonesy that freshman watched 50 globe and on with the big block on the edge out there he was the one who you know got flagged early in ball games Saul starts he's blocking playing pretty well great up with him good on that one flag down throws it away well they got him for a flag he was holding that time after the gridlock they come right back and and he he holds right in front of the official and you might have heard everyone yelling holding on the offense number 50 10yard penalty repeat first down 20 penalties now really sloppy sloppy sloppy game from that perspective there are three true freshmen playing on that offensive line at any given time during the night for USC kind of risky consider the health of your quarterback right rod yes yeah none of the more tackles well does it matter no it doesn't and it off this time to Davis a great first for the first day Davis justintime 21 yards as he moves the chains now remember we've seen three defensive tackles go down for Oregon State and they ran that right inside where you would have one of those guys as Davis again a battering ram that time ball came loose but they say he was down first at the 42 yard line picked up seven on the play of course USC has a great litany and tradition of productive Heisman winning tailbacks yes some of them left footprints on me Marcus Allen Charlie white their jerseys are over there rod just in case you didn't notice not as much yard in that time for Davis picked up a yard on the play but you go back to hojae Simpson and Marcus Allen Charles white well what would Sark telling you yesterday about Reggie Bush and every day they still think of the USC glory days as being the Reggie Bush show but the kids who are now of recruiting aid think about Reggie Bush or down on the toss sweet Allen makes the makes people miss running through people's arms Allen picks up another first down Allen picks up another first down see to me this is really the best part of us sees offense they've got a big offensive line they've got a big strong physical runner like buck Allen even Justin Davis when he's in there so I think that's the focal point I think that's their identity there they're trying to be more of this spread it out I'm temple but to me what they do best is knock you off the ball and give the ball over to buck Allen 1st down and 10 near midfield Allen again stopped up at the 44yard line at alman if you think back to last year he initially got his chance with him and Orrin became the head coach midway through last season entrainment Trey Madden getting down Adam got hurt and uh he was very productive ended up as the team's offensive MVP and we've not seen free Matt yet this season he's expected back at some point but still banged up there's understudy Justin Davis picking up a few yards but buck Allen a real testament to staying ready and being prepared when your opportunity comes because you never know when it's going to arrive but you have to take advantage of that chance because you might only get one atbat you might only get one touch in the game and he was ready for his approaching a minute to go here in the third quarter third and three for USC we've had a distinct advantage in time of possession in this quarter and down to the 28 yard line and another USC first down picked up 11 when they get the rushing attack go and it opens up everything else much more time for Kessler the crossing routes are available they go quick inside the 30 yes their hands it off how much room that time for Davis brought down for a loss on the play Michael doctor they're good to play in a nice game lost three yeah good to see him out there after he missed last season had a broken ankle got a season short kind of became an extra coach the coaching staff got in there watching film charting plays and helping out his teammates laying his sixth year six year senior we have 45 minutes in the books under the lights here in Los Angeles 21:10 for the Trojans when we come back those games and can't wait look at the flame Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum the site of two Olympic Games Summer Games this recent one in 1984 Jaguares Allen aka buck Cal in the backfield looking at a double row here they got a man Allen makes the catch as he and bounce no a Janey Harris threw it and kind of put it where it had to be it was close wrong but Larry Scott did a good job of coming over this ball is in the air a long time and it was clearly out of bounds but great great range by Scott coming over and Harris has had a lot of playing time tonight at that slop position hadn't played much before tonight a couple passes and had a chance to throw a touchdown pass there 1313 blitz coming Kesler balloons the heat and completes the pass Wow Bangalore makes a reception but Kodi Kessler's with his mobility made that happen tending plays he just extends to play here right up the middle just one little slide step and we're talking to Steve Sarkisian about him yesterday he said that part of his game is so underrated he's not the best athlete but he's athletic enough to make plays like partner the identity of this offense is right here buck allen's buck Allen buck Allen but he gives them that physical presence the toughness and then everything else revolves around it and I think if they were searching for that identity after Boston College and not scoring a lot of points at Stanford they've pretty much found it tonight crisis salt Trojans lead 2810 and from any angle field level or up high a blow from the Goodyear blimp pretty impressive run by buck Allen 2005 halt status contributed more than 3.4 million dollars in scholarship funds urgency the buzzword now for Oregon State down by 18 points Murphy has a kickoff return for a touchdown tonight but not that time tackled at the 28 yard line and keep in mind that Thursday a pac12 showdown coming your way on a Solomon in Arizona traveling to Eugene take on Merritt Marcus Mariota and number 2 Oregon Thursday at 10:30 on ESPN and watch ESPN Oregon with week off USC Frago to up against no losses in conference play will be make of their chances this year crop well we've got some pretty good races first at Oregon Arizona game I don't know if the linemen were going to be helped me enough for Oregon but Mariota is in a racing he solves problems even if they're not completely healthy we saw them again that was ward picking up about three on the play yeah that's one of the big question marks out if Mariota can stay healthy behind that line yeah and he needs to get those linemen back and if he doesn't he's still gonna have to do what he's doing which is he takes some negative plays and turns them into positive place or when they have a sack he still is able to make something positive happen like a 50yard run Arizona force with a miraculous comeback last week win against Cal actually misspoke it was a cow merchandiser that sent out that nice run that time by Tehran ward but a flag down to the play at the 27 on the far side of the field and you asked me about USC interesting situation for them Boston College lost to Colorado State I want to ask about that if they go on to win the conference how did that loss factor in against their top four there are two fouls in the play both by the offense holding number 33 that kylie's declined holding on number 77 that pill is accepted 10yard penalty second down yeah what happened what happens to USC well let's let's assume they win the conference knock off say Oregon in the championship game they beat UCLA they've already beaten Stanford if they do that that's a pretty compelling resume now you have to look at who else would be in the hunt but I would argue a pac12 champ with one loss is going to be a very strong candidate in the playoffs and I would select them over let's say a Baylor that wins the big 12 because they didn't play anybody in the nonconference assuming they also have Morgan State meanwhile no gain on the play by Iran war drop down you mentioned Baylor I mentioned Baylor our you know our buddy Kirk Herbstreit mentioned Baylor on game day today talking about Michigan State we see some little discussions going on in the field that that'd Michigan State lost Oregon on the road it's better than Baylor's nonconference wins against anybody and so Kirk like like I've been saying we both feel that Michigan State would still be in the hunt and and a legitimate candidate assuming they run through the victory something about the spirit of accepting competition on the screen pass you know where to go Ron Ward brought down immediately and a very underwhelming sequence of plays that time for organs yeah you know they don't have a whole lot of choice they can't protect menu he's been under pressure all night and when you have a third and 17 and you know your quarterback is going to get harassed well you throw a screen and run a drop play and you're not looking like the guy that's number three on the conference alltime passing list tonight we're gonna try and reset the clock and put a couple more ticks back on to 1229 as Keith kostol comes in to punt for Oregon State cynalco are standing back at his own 41 six punt of the night the pasta kick out of bounds right around midfield didn't go a long way just 29 yards back after this hey 2018 salsa basketball season yeah no Lakers and SuperSonics now coach Jason part of us you bigtime recruits he and head coach Andy Anfield getting it done here at USC this is Justin Davis hey hop down after a gain of about three so do you feel like that he'll marry kind of took the the steam out of Oregon State demoralizing I think they kind of lost their stinger a little yeah I sort of feel that way second down and six was at the end of the first half various Rogers was on the receiving end of a Hail Mary pass with seconds to go his pass completely Davis out of the backfield and one more look at the change that really kind of a tipping point in the game last play of the first half yeah down one second to go they took a timeout through this and instead of being down four points you go into your locker room at halftime down 11 pounded now behind Justin Davis comes loose recovered by the Trojans back at the 44 yard line so he'll be a net loss on the play well that ball was almost a scoop and score for Oregon State it popped up but when they tried to scoop they dropped it all the bounce is going Steve sarkeesian's way tonight but you know getting back to the Hill mayor I just think emotionally that will change the possession when that play by rule that goes to Southern California first down so they're saying that Oregon State yeah this time he actually had it had control of it so change of possession now let's see if if they actually had it balls out right now look at it it's a timeout called by their first timeout I think he touched it I'm not sure he ever actually possessed the ball Mike Riley's team had a great opportunity there to get possession yeah I think I think he's asking about this he's saying look how is that a change of possession if my guy never possessed the ball if he doesn't actually ever control it it's just a loose ball and you're waiting for someone to possess it now from that side you can't see if he actually you know controlled it so here's the other look very scoops it yeah it didn't look like he ever really controlled the ball looks like he scooped it up in the air the previous play is under further review yeah you have to have control to have a change of possession and that first look we had didn't really show you anything that second look to me it showed the ball just going straight up in the air as the scoop but you got to go back a little bit further did he actually get both hands around to control it and then kind of kick it up or something with his foot and if you can't clear see clearly then you don't have enough to overturn it and then the fall on the field stands right first and 10 C and you can't assume certain things you actually have to see it now from that angle to me it looks like he never actually controlled he went and grabbed it with two hands and as he picked it up or tried to pick it up it just blew : see looked like it might have been number 15 it was in the area Larry Scott this is a better angle perhaps yeah Larry Scott is the player right there yeah I mean I think the official from the back side saw two hands around the ball and said okay that's possession there right from that angle I'd say you don't have enough to overturn it personally I thought he didn't control it but from where that official was looking and not having a definitive angle to see the front side of it I've written one thing I bet you coach Sarkisian won't be calling for his ad to come out of the box and help my eyes that story's dead yeah you say don't ever do that again did that at the Stanford game Pat Hayden came down but he was arguing with the officials and he's in a tight ballgame he's got no reason to argue with the officials right now and his selfimposed ban for athletic director Pat Haden we had a great visit with before the game tonight talking about doing his homework as part of the college football playoff committee well they also inducted some folks into the Hall of Fame at halftime and we asked him if he was going to come down half times they said nope I'm banned from the field for you know another game that's so he wasn't going to break the suspension to come down for the halftime ceremony still waiting on the ruling here from the officials well when it takes this long they are usually looking at where to spot the balls and what to do with the clock yeah so if they're taking this long they're trying to figure out where to spot the ball during the play it's determined that the defense did not possess the ball therefore there was not a double turnover it was recovered by the offense it will be fourth down four yards to go on the 44 yard line and the clock will start on my signal Auriga state will not be charged with a timeout that's the right call yep they got it right yep it took a little bit but they got it correct well I think the reason it took so long was because at the end they had to figure out where do you spot the ball for the USC recovery they spent the first part of the time looking at was their change of possession and as we thought there was not a change of possession because he never controlled fourth down and four now in a month a situation Albarado in for USC but he has a good night when pressed to action that thing made a nice dividend about the six yard line like they using a wedge eleven minutes to go here in Los Angeles after 35 yard punt yes being to incent intriguing compelling storylines coming into this week's action in the NFL how good is Tom Jackson on this show TV is awesome those ways back the filament stay alive and finally brought down at the 12 you know Jonesy I think that he'll marry was the biggest play of the game when you think about what happened offensive ly and defensively the Oregon State before and afterwards it's basically first half second half before the hill Mary the defense only 146 yards offense in sorry 146 30 since the hill Mary and the defense gave up a lot more yarder to after the Hail Mary Rogers on the bench the guy that caught that he'll Mary pass incomplete in a flag down on the play might have a little interference as Caleb Smith the guy they wanted to go to a lot tonight and put the ball in his hands to make some plays haven't been able to do that though before the pass was thrown holding on the defense number 56 10yard penalty automatic first down ser oh yeah Anthony cero with the hold there don't forget up next it's UCF against Houston and then a big one in the pac12 Arizona Morgan how cool is that a Thursday night doubleheader get your IV get your food get your catheter stay on the sofa yes sir first down in San to the beaver in launching it up for grabs and incomplete outofbounds stopping the clock Villa Minh was the closest receiver it has been an uncharacteristically discontinuous type of night for Shawn man yeah yeah tough night yeah yeah he's under duress I mean the SC had a plan the plan was to make him move his feet they didn't care how much they actually hit him they wanted him to move his feet they're gonna get a free one here and retain possession well they got pallone on that late hit on the quarterback balls gone oh yeah it's 2 2 full steps 2 full stats after the ball is clearly gone let's piggy tried to help him up as him to say I'm sorry that didn't work in the eyes of the official Mannion boy that pocket collapsed on to me fire is incomplete when USC's plan was executed to perfection the stunt get in his face make him move his feet to the right again pressure inside make him move to the right rarely did you see him step up and simply deliver the ball too much pressure and he is a pocket passer who likes to set his feet and when he does when he's in rhythm he's as good as anybody for those of those numbers he's misfired on nine of his last 12 at 10 of the last 13 now that incomplete intended for Smith again and it's third and 10 for the Beavers you get the sense that this Trojan defense senses an opportunity here to really close the door they're trying to get it back trying to get a little swagger back a little extracurricular activity beavers need to hang on to the football here I haven't done a good tonight Mannion completes the pass to Jamie but he's short of the first down took another shot to pick up of six more than four coming up and another hit for Mannion yes slow developing play hangs on to it a bit there and he gets crunched again no choice here but to take a shot at it I'm fourth down i'ma need a tough kid in him yeah smart player son of a football coach one of two on four pounds this year they may not get it off in time delay of game offense fiveyard penalty still fourth down Oregon State's office you just joining us that touchdown that they've scored tonight came on a kickoff return the offense has not put it in the end zone the season a very uh impotent and non prolific night for them you know had a lot to say about that Craven's Cravens out of pick six and a sack tackle for loss he's been all over the place tonight Hostel in for another buns AG alarm calls for the fair catch at the 12 nine minutes ago after the 50yard punt and it's all good for the Trojans when we come back ESPN is your home of the new college football playoff and Brady has had much more success eight to ten seemingly in control here Allen picks up eight on the play that's 93 yards for him on the night on 15 carries he's got over a hundred allpurpose yards tonight and as we talked about before and he's really become the identity of this offense at least in my view of course USC has a full complement of scholarships available now a probationary period has ended Allen cutting it back and stays inbounds after picking up the first down at the 25yard line got five and it looks like there's a late flag on the play you said full complement of scholarships well eventually the personal foul late hit on the defense they actually that's a 15yard penalty first down USC actually has about 57 available scholarship players there's a late hit by Wynn and they actually have about 50 scholarship players suite it up ready to play tonight put that into perspective for us right how much is that handcuffed you the full allotment is 85 so they have a long way to go to get back to their full number of scholarships now they'll be able to offer 25 this year it's a little probably net an increase of 10 or 12 so it's going to take them a couple years to get to 85 and run it between the tackles again Allen picks up about three and how difficult is it to stay as competitive but not even be competitive to excel and do as well as USC has done during that period it's hard you have one you have to stay healthy you can't afford you to lose any man got to have them all it's harder to practice you know you start limiting things well can you hit this often what's your depth like what do you use for scout team players you you hope you get a lot of walkons who can do the scout team work but they're not necessarily giving you the same kind of look as scholarship players with so it hampers you in practice as well Allen has done over 100 yards rushing for the seventh time in his career takes it again and falls down at the 50yard line right at midfield picked up about six on the play and let me ask you this about walking so if your son says hey Dad I want you to pay sixty thousand bucks a year for me to walk gonna play football USC you gotta take that ride somewhere I thought yeah he would have had me at walkon yeah that was a tough deal doing it at USC would be a very attractive place to do it that bunch of reasons a lot divided in Southern California huh it is a recruiting advantage third down and one for the Trojans trying to hang on to the football and run out some clot I'm sure they're gonna get the first down on that opportunity nuku stopped up a little bit short of the first down and again some extracurricular activity fourth down coming up for Coach sarkeesian who told me you know in coming back here it was it was an interesting feeling he said I knew the school and the people and a lot of people at the administration from his prior time there but the leadership was different it's been great they go for it on fourth down Allen stays on his feet it depends on the spot here and it looks like he got the first down so we're gonna hold on to it just over six minutes to go yeah they do point it out first down for him and extracurricular activities again you see the officials trying to get control of this he's doing a good job of it you know you were talking about Sarkisian there a couple other things he mentioned I thought were pretty interesting share one with you after this play Allen again and a lot of the workload here late trying to stay in bounds and another another flag nolan lewis there to make the tackle number 17 and some of the frustration now starting to manifest itself in plays like this yet by Oregon State you have no need for play is over well one of the things Sarkisian mentioned was after the play personal foul unnecessary roughness I'm a balance flowing the player down number seventeen automatic first down fifteen yards boy great restraint that time by Allen nuts yeah responds yeah good job but one of the things that Sarkisian mentioned was domestic violence and that it being in the news with the NFL and the like and and he says that it's filtered down to the college environment and they've made sure here at USC to bring in experts to talk to their players but the interesting thing he said was hey one of the things that gets the attention of players is telling them the amount of money it is costing NFL players and professionals when they're involved with that and he says unfortunately it's not just morals that get their attention it's sometimes cold hard cash this age group that you're dealing with 18 s and 23 Davis groundandpound action picked up seven down to the 21 yard line as USC now on the verge of improving to three and one overall in the season as well captain Trojan hits for the exits he's not alone well you think about USC and and we wondered if if they were finding an identity if they were back after seeing UCLA the other night you start to wonder about the South Vegas turns it up touchdown he just kept going he almost got the sense that Oregon State players assumed he was out of bounds are going out of bounds and he just tight ropes this and who makes attack whether it's Murphy who makes a tackle but he kind of went for a ride into the endzone yeah three arcs deep for Davis is his second rushing touchdown of the season the eighth of his career but he is such a good block or a good in pass protection didn't seem get an opportunity to show off some running skills extra point good and this one's pretty much on ice cooked glazed and ready to be sliced back after this defensively we saw saw them last week Washington State put up a lot of points on them and even if Oregon gets healthy with their alignment they still have a defensive issue their secondary has to get better offensive coordinator this year for them haribol on a return and a nice return out near the 40yard line well guys getting after it after the whistle and look ahead to next week some intriguing matchups am squeezing one out today against Arkansas they take on Mississippi State yeah next weekend is the best weekend of the season so far in college football and part of that is we have to have better games in September that's part of this whole selection committee if the selection committee doesn't encourage teams to play better games like Michigan State did with Oregon then we're not going to get great weekends like next week until October we want some of those in September yeah I second that motion new quarterback in the ball game Luke del Rio the Alabama transfer we were back now for Oregon State has it's done for the night complete stops the clock and if that Del Rio name sounds familiar it should his dad was a great player here Jack Del Rio at USC his dad was here at halftime being honored or the ceremony's going on where I fell head coach and assistant coach coordinator player now the D coordinator at Denver Broncos running that franchise second down and ten for the Beavers the real wants to get his slings in pass incomplete intended for Jamin after having seen USC tonight and UCLA on Thursday night and Arizona's win over Cal last week I think it's safe to say those are the three top contenders although we should not exclude Utah and Utah will face UCLA next weekend kind of a showdown in the south in Pasadena and USC will take on Arizona State ten gel real back to pass and incomplete and don't forget SportsCenter coming up next folks that pass intended for virtual Mulaney a big day in college football Florida State getting off to a slow start and ultimately coming back and winning against North Carolina State of course that's where your fresh hot edition of SportsCenter will come from right across the way there and the shadows of the Staples Center drop by there the other day that's a pretty cool estudio be careful you walk through man yeah you got to put the suit on go to work good angle our back for this bun it bounced harmlessly at the 22yard line time out on the field with just under four and half minutes to go after the 39 yard punt in the backfield takes this hand I brought down just across the 30yard line and another flag down to the field I got really sloppy tonight with with all the flags at last count I think it were 21 or 22 I pardon me 27 I literally lost count after the play was over personal foul on the defense unnecessary roughness 15 yards automatic first down is that the third or fourth personal foul on Oregon State in the second half yet that is the it's a monument to frustration right there huh I don't know about that sure maybe there was something said good night for Kessler low 24:32 couple touchdowns and still has not thrown a tip on the season he's continuing to make good decisions extending plays we saw so much of that tonight yeah relationship with his head coach : again brought down by Johnson they showed a little chemistry and enthusiasm on the sidelines after that touchdown that he threw the only problem was that Kessler didn't jump as high as head coach and didn't quite look right rod yeah the landing wasn't quite here about that or has heard about it but you know Kessler Kessler was in a battle with max Brown preseason you know there were a lot of people who thought that max Brown might win the job he was top recruit out of Washington state of Washington last year big arm six five to 20 hands it off this time again to Tolin left side gdr children first now let's look ahead a little bit next week rod to the USC Arizona State matchup those two teams match up when you look at their strengths and relative weaknesses well I think a lot of it depends on whether Taylor Kelly is back a quarterback for Arizona State if he's back in the mix for them and there's a good possibility he will be that certainly helps Arizona State instead of Mike berkovichi who is a young quarterback and was in a tough spot the other night could not keep pace with UCLA and Brett Hundley how impressive was oh man this is with a bad elbow right yeah interesting the way they doctored the gameplan for him though they took away all the design runs and that's a big part of what they do with him and and just let him throw the ball but I don't think he got comfortable until he scrambled a couple times jumped over a guy got hit a couple times and felt good about things and then from the second quarter on he was the the Hundley that everybody had been talking about during the offseason DJ Alexander meanwhile down in the field for Oregon State walking off under his own power 250 to go so next weekend's matchups give you a pretty good taste of the race and the pac12 South with Utah UCLA and Arizona State and USC from the 46 third and the trojans pick up a first down and then some Tolan again and getting a lot of workload here late so let's pretend there's a lot of people still watching in Tuscaloosa Alabama and you talked about next week's matchups here in the pac12 what do you make of the relative strength of the conference's head to head you know I think it's still too early to make that assessment I think until the pac12 plays the SEC headtohead and beats the SEC in the minds of the public the SCC will continue to be a head of the pac12 and that's probably right I mean given that that conference is won seven of the last eight national championships tossed into the boundary Tolan stay inbounds keep that clock running with 144 to go what's the old saying if you want to be the king then you got to beat the king Auburn getting a win today and Kesler meanwhile we talked about putting a bow on his day 24:32 261 yards a couple of touchdowns passing and since giving away to max Brown at the quarterback Oregon State shut out in the second half and actually their offense unable to score a touchdown the entire game they miss big golden and on to Tolan again and brought down at the 31 yard line with one minute to go now they need to get boat and back he's got that injured pinky broken finger he's not just a guy who can catch the ball down the field he's a big part of their rushing attack the fly sweet some of the screen games so they they had to take all that out of their offense tonight and that was why the USC defense was really able to kind of focus on hey let's get after Mannion let's make sure that we move his feet make him move make him chase and scramble and we'll be effective and they work but if you get Bowden back that should help Oregon State's office so let's go in conference play as for USC while they waited some 13 and a half days to expunge the memory of what happened in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts and they've done it here tonight but this is USC this is Los Angeles a major media market and in the words of coach Sarkisian it's always something 35 to 10 the final score number 18 USC defeats Oregon State folks don't forget coming up next it's SportsCenter Murat Gilmore and Jessica Mendoza I'm Mark Jones he put a lid on a great Saturday in college football remember SportsCenter coming up thanks for watching good night from
