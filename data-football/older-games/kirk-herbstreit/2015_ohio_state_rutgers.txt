============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC and welcome to college football's birthplace and Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart and thanks to the old Raritan and Rutgers a jack duck stadium welcoming the number one ranked Ohio State Buckeyes against Rutgers in a Big Ten collision place is jacked up Rutgers coming off a 25 point comeback win in Indiana last week and Kirk Herbstreit my friend of the New York New Jersey metropolitan area we got good memories of Thursday night games some great games there'll be a good atmosphere here Ohio State the number one ranked team playing in the number one ranked market for the first time since 99 Rutgers hoping for a milestone upset the news for the Buckeyes is they make a change the quarterback now it's not unexpected but it might be unprecedented when you consider the cardio Jones is 10 and I was a starter won a championship his stats this year Kirk aren't that bad but the shortcomings in a couple key areas means that JT Barrett gets the call and I think Obermeyer was very clear this week when he talked about this it wasn't necessarily what Cornell Jones wasn't doing it was really more of what JT Barrett was bringing to the table most especially the last two weeks in the red zone stepped up and made plays and I think gave the Ohio State offense some rhythm I think if you watch him tonight the keys to watch as it affects the running game his ability to run the ball gets the defense's attention can open up some big running lanes for Zeke Kelly you worry about Zeke Elliott this is what JT Barrett we saw him do a lot last year this was last week zone read he'll pull it himself and tonight to me this is the key if you load up against the run you can see the safeties and linebackers you can get frozen on playaction leave you oneonone Ohio State has some of the best group of wide receivers that you'll see in all college football so for Rutgers tonight with eight with an a very veteran group up front some big strong linebackers their DNA is to blitz come after you load up against the run if you do that they've got an inexperienced secondary that they couldn't leave oneonone against those JTP I can throw the ball yeah they got one of the worst past defenses in the country which is bad news they need to score a lot of good points tonight and the good news is Leon say Carew's going to give it a go he's their best player Big Ten leader and touchdown receptions hurt his ankle last week in that comeback victory was very hobbled at practice yesterday Kirk though we saw him pregame and this tough guy is going to give it a go tonight at least at the start but he is by far their best differencemaker on the perimeter and and there is a key to see him play and get opportunities against mantoman coverage Ohio State plays a lot of man he's going to have a big opportunity in a big stage to show the country what he's all about I think he's one of the top receivers in the Big Ten but can he go for four quarters with an ankle that he heard just a week ago and the other thing is if they can hit him a couple times downfield really the strength of their team is running the football and that could take some of the pressure off of that run game Scarlet Knights against the scarlet and gray in new jersey coming up on ABC soon GT is earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers geebeare opposes so many problems for the Rutgers defense govern the Piscataway it's going to be that what's more than pen moves for the upset welcome back to Rutgers down on the field we are now joined by Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer and coach after starting powder Parnell Jones for seven weeks ago with JT Barrett tonight ultimately how did you make that decision well I've been saying it all week is tough decision but red zone production third on production and turnovers so JT's been very efficient and we're ready to go how do you think that JT changes the personality of your offense I think this is a very close team that cares about each other gonna play real hard tonight coach thank you Chris back up to you Heather thank you everyone was locked in before I kick up it's tough meanwhile how flood this is his first home game in five weeks his second game back after a threegame suspension he broke a Rutgers rule that he said he didn't know about contact the professor about a player's grade so he has been getting beaten up in the press and could use a big victory tonight as three touchdown underdogs against the number one ranked team Buckeyes won the toss and deferred so the Scarlet Lance will get the ball to begin there is Le'Veon take kuru we talked about him the wide receiver that is a serious big play threat and a leader on this team trying to grit his teeth and play through some pain tonight with a sprained ankle there's Joey Bosa and Joey Bosa coming off one of his best games of the year last year just really seems to be coming into his own and when you leave him oneonone tonight if you're rutgers you better get the ball out fast because he's either can overpower you or use his speed there's a twostep Baptist for here the student section does a great job at Rutgers and see if the team could do its part over the years Rutgers defenses Kirk is you know I've been able to feed off this energy in here they'll need all that tonight they have an aggressive mentality on defense and sometimes that could work out and sometimes that could create opportunities for the offense genera and grant the receiver and very dangerous for Turner has taken three pigs back for touchdowns this year couple pick offs and the punt will receive the kickoff of Jack whooping as the Buckeyes try to stay on course and undefeated here in New Jersey Olivier's always picks it to the left corner and it's too deep for grant to bring out so Rutgers goes on offense Chris laviano was a sophomore from Long Island New York making his sixth career start got a pretty good command of this prostyle offense yeah that's the word the coaches used command what I see is just a guy with a lot of moxie a lot of poise last week his team was down and he did a very good job of just kind of keeping his wits about him they were down to 25 he didn't panic in fact late in that fourth quarter he led them to the gamewinning field goal and converted a bunch of third downs I I think he grew up last week as much as anybody tonight he's gonna have to play a great game and especially when it comes to his decisionmaking Rutger is very intense on running the ball and very confident that they can have success against the Ohio State offense or defense running the ball tonight it's a first down handoff running right about a 5yard gain is his Paul James the speediest of the four backs here Kirk take a look at this week's chickfila impact players for Rutgers Robert Martin they have a committee of backs Robert Martin has had a hot hand here in recent weeks we already talked about Leon tech crew he's got to be able to make some plays one on one Joey Bosa as we know one of the best pass rushers in the country and Raekwon McMillan as much as Rutgers will run number five has got to make a lot of tackles for Ohio State in the middle second and five up to the first down gain by James is the lone tailback they fake it to him laviano takes a shot downfield and the catch is made out near midfield and that is Leon take karu who is such a dominant part of this passing game and you can see the respect that Ohio State had form there Eli Apple Winstanley is from New Jersey giving him a pretty good cushion he's looked at a lot of film on Moore and despite that ankle injury he knows he can go by him and with that cushion nice patients by laviano and a good job of sitting down in a space there too big gaming for hunters to play 13 quarters querque has nine touchdown receptions there's a first down attempt laviano dumps it away now he's getting pressure there Macmillan was in there like a big thing dissed Rutgers has preached all week and it's just kind of the DNA of their offense with Ben McDaniels their firstyear offensive coordinator clay caller is getting the ball out fast they've really respect ohio state's ability to rush the quarterback there's been and he knows that he got a spread amount we got to give a lot of different formations that slowed him down and the quarterback has been instructed to get the football out of his hands quickly it's a good idea against that front this is James who breaks the tackle gets to the second level finally shut down on the sidelines but Berkeley for Penn State did last week to the buck guys again missed tackles watched the block right here by the left tackle he said Keith Lumpkin actually Springs him here picks up a nice block 10 right there who's a problem for Ohio State last week missed tackles a team that prides itself on its ability to make plays Chris ash that has to be driving him crazy after such an emphasis this week on tackling after last week's game against Penn State and gaming that gave Rutgers confidence they could run the ball well they give it to James again he's a guy that rips an ACL missed the last 9 games of last year missed spring practice and is just now getting back to his old self he's got a serious burst yeah he's a one cut downhill runner has a lot of physical traits you can see they rotated in and out you get James you have Josh Hicks number 8 come in and also Robert Martin they all bring something a little bit different to the table but they challenge the Ohio State defensive front seventh it is number eight Josh Hicks the sophomore from Florida to the right from laviano now he'll motion out Aviano flips it over the head of his receiver there and Lee was all over the tight end Nick Archie doc you know this is one of those games where Rutgers understands that running the football and seeing Penn State run the ball can be very very helpful to set up how they like to throw the ball don't mix it up they'll go empty and they'll do some things but they really become effective with their playaction game when you can run the football against Ohio State that opens up some opportunities and leaves one on one coverage with Peru and those receivers first thirddown of the game scar mites have been pretty good in this department needs six laviano has protection breakdown a classic runner but he can scramble he can keep plays alive you stopped a yard short it'll be fourth down and a decision for flood early your big underdog you're at home your team right now is driving the football already seven plays in 57 yards fourth in short what the heck crowd approves I think the players feed off with an aggressive aggressive attitude from a head coach early in a game when you're a big underdog at home James behind the fullback Sam Burgin they sneaked it and he's got it good movement up front and the Scarlet max offensive line gets the job I think it was a combination of Derrick Nelson to Center and Chris bowler the right guard and then just a quickness to the quarterback it was almost like his day was decisive and even though it's just a quarterback sneak on fourth down that quickness can catch that defensive line off guard a little bit and I think they were bit surprised and it allowed Nelson and company up front to get a pretty good push Scarlet Knights a first down in the redzone James not much in the redzone this year they've been in there 20 times and scored 13 touchdowns running the football and running the football eventually those playaction opportunities on first and 10 are gonna be there and it's something that Rutgers is gonna try to exploit surprise there they had Ohio State a bit on their heels it is tough to run at Ohio State inside that bread zone area now in sets up a second long James is the tailback Leon take Peru to the bottom of the formation laviano looks that direction throws to his tie receiver just over Carew's outstretched hands he had a little bit of space ahead of Conley there that's an example this guy is fighting through an ankle injury and there's Conley the starting corner from Ohio State and he doesn't get any kind of impact at the line of scrimmage doesn't get a jam to slow him down and crew has the speed despite the ankle a little shake and he goes around and that's one laviano would love to have back just a little bit more air that's a touchdown now it's third down and now you got to try to figure out where they gonna move Joey Bosa number 97 that's for sure this offensive line has three firstyear starters and Rutgers will spend a time out to talk about this third and 10 play Ben McDaniel got to feel pretty good about the script and what you've done the plan you've come up with ten plays sixty yards on this opening drive and Ben McDaniel sports the brother of Josh McDaniel who's the offensive coordinator with the New England Patriots and his dad is a legendary high school football coach in Ohio Tom McDaniels was was a coach of recent McKinley but way back in the days since America's McKinley arrival I tried to talk to Tom at practice and he goes to he goes to Ben's games on Saturdays goes and see the Patriots games on Sunday when a kid retired he's officially retired you know he also coached at Warren Harding it was Maurice Clarett high school coach to say a great man and one of the better coaches the history you think he's got a big young guy first year that he's calling plays and really has a good feel for got the third down back number 32 is Justin Goodwin the junior in the game grant goes in motion but guys get immediate pressure they flip it off complete but way short of the first enemy that's the advantage of being able to rush a quarterback with only having four to get the pressure the reason that's big on third down you rush four and you've got seven other guys with their eyes then they're gonna give you a different look a little bit of zone pressure they actually bring the Blitz up the middle with peri but still it's only for him because he has to get the ball out so quickly you've got seven defensive backs and linebackers with their eyes on those receivers and they can adjust quickly to that ball once it's thrown in the air pala Federico had trouble against Indiana missed a couple of PA TS he's been a reliable field goal kicker he's from 29 yards and the troubles continue just off the top of the left upright this is a senior who is a strong bond with Kyle flood but that miss means that Rutgers marches 64 yards in 12 plays and comes up empty on his first possession ouch JT's earn the right to start Saturday at Rutgers Cordell is gonna be on a very active part to we're hopefully to very much involves it was a difficult decision but Reds own production a third out per option for the two areas that made the difference so JT Barrett's first start since last November against Michigan in his ankle was fractured opening the way of course for Jones Clos so superbly in the Buckeyes final three games in route with the championship where's Zeke Elliott the workhorse maybe hurt some mindset to lighten up his load because he has carried such a big burden for this offense so far this year yeah he has if you think back to last year he really caught fire the second half in particular that's the last three games you look at JT Barrett and Zeke Elliott now who's actually flexed out they're going to go empty here they got four receivers bunched and it's a quarterback run all the way and Barrett shows his skillset slips a tackle gets to midfield in the Rutgers territory and down to the 36 such a tough to stop dimension here's what's amazing is Ohio State missed some twists right at the line of scrimmage see this guy right there he just shakes him gets around and safety that's coming up to be able to make the play and this is the part of the Ohio State offense that has been null and void with Cardale Jones in and with JT Barrett on the sidelines now it's back in play we get 39 yards in a play that wasn't blocked all that well Barrett now pitches to Elliott Scarlet Knights stringing out bounced off a few tackles and get back to the line of scrimmage before Quan Lewis who was a graduate played three years at South Carolina attack you go back to that last play that long game you're backed up in your own territory they stunt look at this guy defense event comes around he's right there to be able to make a play Decker can't do anything and he just runs around him he's able to break another tacklers two guys that he accounted for himself before he picked up those big yards second and nine Braxton Miller in the slot to the left of the formation at 3:00 just get it off Barrett looks left and now rolls to his right has room down the sidelines campers for a first down inside 2:30 dangerous on design runs dangerous on scrambles this is one you go back and this is just again him working himself back into the lineup watch how Braxton Miller breaks free here this is going to come eventually but he is all alone right down the middle of the field picking up yards because of his athletic ability but those are plays and last year you would see JT Barrett make routinely but he still he hasn't played a lot of football in 2015 he'll start to see those things the more reps she gets passes in 2015 this is Elliott picking as well in fact JT doesn't have an incompletions in September against Western Michigan he's 6 for 6 throwing the ball sparingly in the last couple of games said that the jump pass touchdown and late against Penn State then threw a fade did the Thomas for a touchdown yeah and I think there's been so much talk about his mobility is in his feet that sometimes people forget that he can throw the football and that for Unger's that's what they're trying to figure out he'll load up against the run and leave yourself oneonone against the pass or do you try to play a little bit but don't break mentality where you don't give up the big play through the air and you make them have to go slowly running the football down the field second and seven so run all the way in Barrett hammer down at the twenty it'll be third and two these linebackers from Rutgers are aggressive they will lower the boom Steve Monga right there number three is one of the more physical more active linebackers he leads his team in tackles Juan Luis 14 Quentin Goss all three of these guys they are attacking downhill and trying to do everything they can to stop Zeke Kelly at her JT Barrett from picking up yards miles very tough to stop with 15 and 16 in the game on third and 2 keeper as to reverse bill Barrett gets away bounces off a blocker doesn't get the first down does the ball come out yes Rutgers has a fumble recovery not only do they stop there they taped the ball away a rare Ohio State fumble yeah he fell awkwardly after the ball came out he looks like he's close here good job by Rutgers of containing him you can see he kind of lands awkwardly there that's true freshman Jarius Adams 25 is involved in his play that ball it looks like it's out Rutgers football bang didn't a Michael Thomas great awkward there towards the end of that play and they're definitely gonna take a look at him closely ankle was what was injured last year so they're gonna be very concerned about that cautious meanwhile Rutgers defense makes a huge stop one thirty shore on Snodgrass is the referee Tom field or the big ten replay official will not have a look there's the collision with Thomas that right knee is what they're looking at see the right knee now looks like it may it looks like that's a great angle you just if it's bangbang let's take another look knee down there ball that's way out again they have to see substantial evidence here to overturn the call of fumble that's the Lango right together that's ball that was out the knee the defender came and knocked the ball out just a fraction of a second before Barrett's right knee hit the ground yeah I think that'll be the best look that they'll have good news is JT is up and moving around right but Scarlet Knights who march down the field missed a short field goal which is deflating obviously for a huge underdog the defense turns around and makes it play on paper short big third down play and even if the ball didn't come out they held him short of that first downs they were second fumble recovery for this Rutgers defense all year they have struggled with takeaways so many of the eight take away only the second time they've recovered an opponent's fumble so still scoreless in laviano after a productive opening drive although it didn't produce points no flow on first down across the middle completion an 11yard gain getting right behind the linebackers Raekwon McMillan Darren Lee coming up into the line of scrimmage because of some of the success of that running game there they're coming down hill and I think Rutgers feels that they can get behind the linebackers and in front of the safeties with a quick throw those tight ends and from the receivers crossing there's some space in there to work with and that time laviano it's exactly where he put the ball Andre Patton 6 for junior receiver who's Delaware made that catch in Aviano another percent except he can't escape boats has got him and Joey Bosa now 3rd consecutive game with the sack and Chris it's not just speed it's technique watch his hands over here watch his hands and he goes up against JJ Denman right there just use his hands his hands or his quicker as his feet and this is what allows him to get around him you see Denman is struggling to move his feet to stay with that suddenness and quickness to the outside and so it's a combination of athletic ability but the hands high Bosa are special we're yard lost most of now with three and a half sacks on the scene they flip it to Carew nearside he navigates through traffic it makes a short game across the 30 it'll set up third and ten and this is exactly what Ben McDaniels knew that he needed to try to avoid they need success on first down they need some success on second down they want to stay in that second medium third and short they're going to go a little bit of tempo here to try to avoid Ohio State communicating getting there right call in Ravi ah no escapes pressure chased by Macmillan and fires over the head of Peru who was tightly covered by Darren Lee Joey Bosa is such a force and it reminds me a lot of JJ Watt you know JJ Watt works and works and works here he's with Larry Johnson a defensive line coach working on that same move this is one of those things the guys that are elite pass rushers they don't just rest on being a great athlete for being physically gifted you go to the next level you're working on technique and that's what Joey Bosa said this year has really mastered so following the fumble Buckeyes defense forces a three it out and here's Joey wah the senior punter Jalen Marshall is the returner and give it a shot at the 20 slips a couple tackles Marshall turns the corner jaelyn Marshall for the putter debate is tackled in Rutgers territory as love saved to touch to pound but a great return sets up Ohio State in their second position scores here in Piscataway Saturday Night

performance Goodyear more driven the official aerial provider of Saturday Night Football now state fumbling away the ball and its opening possession there it okay back in there kind of trying to shake out that left leg but the Marshall return sets them up the Scarlet Knights 42 Ohio State gets one on one on the outside they'll try to exploit that hit some big plays for the air Derek takes a shot down in the traffic and over a couple of defenders it was Thomas working on Isaiah Wharton this is a secondary clerk you mentioned in the open is an experience very thin and missing two guys that including one starting corner Hassan Austin you got Michael Thomas who's one of the better receivers in college football and that ball is close there I say a war is probably their best corner he gets right by them but Ohio State saying the same thing I'm staying Rutgers loading up against the run you've got to take some shots downfield something we've not seen a lot oh by the way the Ohio State offense all year this is on just grabbed at the last second there by Wharton and then second down and for Zeke Elliott it hasn't gotten going yet Heather Cox Kurtz JT Barrett came off the field and after a quick consultation with the medical staff tested that left shoulder no medical attention he talked on the headset then walked over to its own line getting each and every one of them knockos and said hey that one's on me JT now facing a 3rd and 9 markers defense trying to come up with a second big stop early on good protection over the middle Elliot's got it and he's got the first down hard worked by Elliot muscling forward well it's another way to get you're one of your better players the football he's empty got to get the ball out fast and well this is what's unique about seek Elliot the hands here is one of the better sets of hands on the team and then the way he understands it's third down instead of running horizontally puts his foot in the ground lowers his shoulder and picks up the first down what do you first catch of the year from Elliot an underappreciated aspect to his game blocking and receiving complete back no doubt Barrett still got it protection breaks down and he slammed for a short loss their Scarlet Knights Quan Zell Lambert the junior defensive end that is a great job of coverage downfield Steve longa number three takes away Nick vennett right here he runs downfield and that's where JT was looking to get the ball thrown downfield coverage downfield was so good JT Barrett looking waiting trying to be patient and eventually to crack the pocket just collapsed on top of him first full sack of the year for Lambert only the 11th for this Rutgers defense Barrett looked at Elliott now zips it across the middle Thomas has a first down to the 12 yard line an accurate dart as the top receiver gets involved and watch how it uses his eyes to move Steve longer the middle linebacker he looks left which is going to impact the linebacker he moves him and then comes back and he's got one on one opportunity Thomas does a good job of getting to the inside of the mantoman coverage he knew he was going to come back but he used his eyes that time to move the defender 24th consecutive game Thomas has had a catch now first down handoff cannot get the corner it was strung out there he trying to get past Anthony Cioffi the junior safety but stop about the six yard line and Jeff Green picks up a nice block here right there right there in front of the front of the run here but give Rutgers and their defense a lot of credit that you more often not you see Z Kelly and get the outs to the outside like that he's going to even run over top of somebody or get to the corner been so efficient in the red zone the last couple of games Barrett barreling forward after starting very poorly in that department in the first five games 6 for 16 touchdown scored in the red zone they've been very very hard to stop the last couple games feels like it's 30 goal but it's third and one Ohio State could still pick up a first down something to JT Barrett needs to be aware of to tight ends in for the Buckeyes final minute of the opening quarter the tight end shift to the right side Eliot hit very quickly it's going to be close where they're spawning it I think he's going to be just a few inches short enough to measure julienned Penix Arak nice play that time on his own read play it's actually who JT Barrett was reading and he came down in a hurry did a nice job of wrapping up Zeke Elliott Phenix Andre from Montclair New Jersey one of the thoughtful leaders of this defense he talks about his role and see if longest role in trying to help his guys hang in there it was a it was a rough rough game last week against Indiana it is a first and goal for Ohio State this defense was getting gashed left and right they came up with a couple of takeaways and that's what really sparked that big comeback it's a Brazilian group without a doubt I mean with all the talk about Michigan and Michigan State in that finish what got lost in the Big Ten was Rutgers trailing Indiana 52 to 27 in Bloomington and coming back to win that football game it did take a lot of character a lot of belief to be able to come back and win Rutgers defense asking for some noise down on the goal line the field is the first down by the runner it plays in a further review so Tom fielder we play official we'll take a look at this and see if there is enough evidence that Elliott was stopped short to overturn the spot of first and goal thing that would potentially happen here is he on top of a defender because his knee touch it looks like he gets on top of a defender right there I don't think he's down yet say what he sure does that is a very poor spot based on that video evidence you're right though he's on top of a player until right there and he's he's well short of the 2 yard line yeah you saw flood over there if it was the only thing they calling Fort progress before he got pushed back is the only thing you could think of after further review the ruling on the field stands Wow Wow the garage is our official consultant not enough they're dug to turn that over look like Ellie was spun down short of the marker from where we saw ya replays gonna have to have some frame of reference on the field a hash mark or something like that before they're going to be able to change that just tough to do but they did give them for our trip dunk it's very rare to see a spot overturned at that one if there ever would be point you would think that would be in well I was that was yeah I agree as long as you have that reference point something on the field anyway Ohio State now has a first and goal walk running inside of 20 seconds in the first quarter Elliott easily barrels in his 12th rushing touchdown and Ohio State draws first blood in the final seconds of the opening quarter they go back to the breadandbutter it's combination and worrying about JT Barrett the Z Kelly really good push there on that left side Marcus ball a backup tied in gets a good block Nick vennett also in there we'll take another look at that way that was not overturned I still don't know what you need to see in any case Ohio State uses the Jalen Marshall bump return to set up a 42yard touchdown drive 7zip Buckeyes but guys score touchdown it would have been fourth and short if replay had showed that he got stopped here at Kirkland SEC another look interesting you're talking about trying to spot a football and look at him now he's going down this way and how is he gonna see where the where the mark is when he's all the way he's at the goal line trying to see if he's maybe gonna break the plane of the end zone meanwhile you're trying to see if if it's a first down so he he looked to me like he was out of position they're trying to spot that football then he kind of just kind of jogged in and just put the ball down yeah if he'd been stopped short they had ruled it that way Ohio State perhaps would have gone anyway blows my mind you could spot the ball it's not just about this situation it's just in general becomes the spotting and football crucial moments and games another deep boot from Willoughby and Scarlett Matz will take a knee to rubber forest in the studio for an update a Robert hey Chris Taco Bell's studio update let's get you a couple of updates from some undefeated teams right now Utah number three in the country tied up with USC Trojans went for it on fourth down get it to go and at number five LSU on ESPNU a 147 on the half two out of conference Ville Western Kentucky Chris Robert thank you we'll keep an eye there was a 14 unbeaten teams Ohio State of course one of them coming in none of them lost this afternoon they were there for playing tonight so Riker is back on offense down by seven Robert Martin number seven is now the tailback you know flying before the snap false start false start offense number 81 fiveyard penalty first down Matt Flanagan the sophomore tight end flagged it's an offense crooked as you said struggles so much when they get instantly behind the chains first and 15 it is not easy for any offense no not for it well maybe for Baylor but but for pro style offenses you know you don't like to start first in 15 as we said they want to get into the second medium third and short fumble fumbled snap laviano pulled away quickly and Rutgers he's going to fall on the ball and avoid a turnover there looks like Martin the tailback has it that'll be the final play of the first quarter so a Zeke Elliott touchdown run puts the Buckeyes on top back after this message and a word from your local ABC station and welcome back this Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart topranked Buckeyes and a short touchdown drive of 42 yards set up by our Jalen Marshall punt return Zeke Elliott took it in from a couple yards out Victor is facing a second and 17 as we begin the second quarter everybody makes oh hi Oh safe there Super Bowl and no exception for three and three Rutgers you get her that quickly Martin but the Buckeyes are swarming all over him over there Hubbard nice to see Josh Perry out there as well Chris and guy that had an injury last week Dante Booker came in you can see Rutgers this is why it's so important to stay on schedule look how good they are at four yards or less one of the better teams in converting you'll see that 84% in the country you can see the longer it goes five to seven eight plus they really struggle so that's why they talked about not selfdestructing having penalties losing yardage on third and eight seen the Buckeyes have that package in there with three defensive ends to get after the quarterback and they just kind of say forget about that we were going to have hard time protecting we'll just hand it off and Punk the ball Joey Bosa the defensive line when it's third and long you're thinking screen or draw and again they move Joey Bosa into the middle right here typically is out here on one of the edges this time they keep him in the middle and well he goes right by Dorian Miller look at this technique Pete right by where's the punt again returnable from Marshall who's tracked down at the 40 so that time excellent coverage by the Scarlet Knights coverage team and Ohio State will take over on their 40 up 7 on ESPN Monday Night Football and a/c West leading Arizona Cardinals is Joe Flacco and the Ravens Monday night countdown at 6:00 kickoff at 8:15 on ESPN and watch ESPN so JT Baron and Ohio State I said I've at the 40yard line trying to build on a seven nothing lead quarterbacks got it and getting able to shake tackles and make a nice first down game very shorthanded Rutgers defense because six players who are allegedly involved in a home invasion and an assault that took place in the spring they were officially dismissed minutes before kickoff of the opener Barnwell would have been a starting corner Pele has played some corner Boggs would have been a starter Stephenson was a free safety starter last year you got less on Austin out with a concussion and Devon Jacobs the safety out injured incredibly thin back there incredibly thin playing three freshmen tonight starting in that secondary and yet Ohio State's only attempted three passes tonight really favoring the run as a hit in the backfield as Elliott is dropped for a loss by kamoko tarea young talented explosive sophomore they think has a big future yeah he has such great athletic ability look how he feels it senses it knows for the ball but as much as we talk about how there's somewhat depleted on the back end they are athletic and aggressive on the front end and especially at the second level with their linebackers they get after it basically one year of high school football very talented basketball player newer he has kind of stuff you can't coach so it's third and five for Barron gets pressured hit as he throws it's incomplete the ball was bounced in front of Michael Thomas says JT took a hit from the blindside this is what Rutgers does is they bring pressure at the snap of the ball they're going to move here and then they end up bringing the pressure from the field to the blindside of JT Barrett and I think he feels him but I think he underestimated how quick Andre hunt was getting in and he's trying to get the ball off but Rutgers that's the strength of this defense they get you to third down they're very very multiple move around give you a lot of different looks and even with four veteran offensive linemen a veteran quarterback they still get confused blitz packages you kind of go back to the Greg Schiano a day that occurs yeah they still have some of the same principles so Cameron Johnston fine hunter for Ohio State gets away not a particularly good effort at back spins and Rutgers will take over at the 25 still down just seven Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought to you by Dr Pepper Dr Pepper and college football it's a oneofakind tradition Ford we go further so you can and Michelin a better way forward well don't miss any of ESPN's great college football action while you're on the go the watch ESPN app every game streamed live just download the app go to watch espn.com Rutgers came up empty its first possession missed a field goal moved it 64 yards the last two possessions have not netted much they go back to work they really started off with a good plan a nice balanced attack had Ohio State on its heels and as you say Christie's last couple drives and not being able to get anything going they hated the Paul James soup breaks the tackle goes forward for four yards four McMillian that melon knocked him down that's a pretty good collision when Paul James and Raekwon Macmillan go head to head talked about him Raekwon being one of the impact players today high estate defense because of what Rutgers wants to do offensively give you a lot of different looks try to confuse you he's the quarterback in the middle of that defense he's got to be aware communicate it and then he's got to be able to be physical against the run leads the big 10 in tackles coming in one more tackle than Longo the linebacker you talked about for the Scarlet Knights on second down nothing there it's going to be third and long again for Rutgers as we check back with Robert Flores dr. pepper championship drive update right now number three Utah in trouble on the road against USC the freshman Cameron Smith his second interception of the night this one goes the other way and right now the Trojans are leading 28 14 late first half now that's the old somebody knows something game right you talk top five team underdog to USC and down a couple of touchdowns Sam Hubbard in here on third down for Bosa not at the bottom there guys showing pressure fourman fire sack catch made by Nick Archie diakon on the tight end got loose and the Scarlet Knights are in aa now State Territory they had two receivers at one area you're going to see right here tie this pal does it just kind of gets caught in between two receivers you got a guy that's getting down here on the wheel route another guy here Powell comes up and it opens up behind him it's a good recognition there by laviano he had to wait for it to break free takes a little bit of time but he does it the line gives him the time and Patton has the catch Bose is still standing in the silence with his helmet on but not in there in this play either and the timeout timeout Rutgers for a second the tight ends are all used in this pro style offense we've got twenty nine catches between him coming in Archie diakon O'Flanagan and and scarf I was a big part of a McDaniels offense yeah yeah I think that's safe to say I thought it was interesting talking to to Ben this week and talked earlier about his brother being at New England as the offensive coordinator he said you know they do a lot of film study he worked in the NFL himself for it for a few years so he does prefer in this era of spread and tempo running more of a kind of pro style set in his quarterback even though he's young Chris laviano he's looking at a lot of NFL film a lot of Tom Brady film and trying to pick up as much as he can because Tom Brady is basically running the same offense that he's running here at Rutgers did tell me though Kirk that it's really hard in this offense to improve leaps and bounds and crack as you need gain reps all James makes it cut for a nice first down game Rutgers has had some progress with the running game tonight I think that's that's been the one area that again they knew coming in that after watching the Penn State film last week they felt confident because of their offensive line and because of the backs that committee that they have back there they feel confident they'd be able to run the football and sets up again other aspects of their offense the first time we've seen it effective though and since that first drive my formation James again on second and four running to the left knock down two yards short of the marker it'll be third down Balthus Washington on the tackle if you put yourself on the other side as a defense getting ready for a Rutgers think about Ohio State other than Penn State last week and if you think about some of the teams they plan to big ten more than nine you're spread out you're almost playing like a nickel package worrying about the perimeter and worrying about people throwing it over your head or throwing it sideways now you got to deal with Rutgers team who's trying to run downhill at you it's a totally different mentality they go empty backfield now I'm 32 Leon take Peru is in the slot to the left of laviano but guys bring pressure quarterback gets it out even complete he was looking for kuru who was well defended and Buckeyes gambled on defense and it pays off fourth down now at the Ohio State 40 let's see what flood does yeah and you go empty you know you're gonna have to deal with some pressure and he felt Josh Perry coming well that is a tough throw and great coverage by time his pal that time yet Eli Apple behind it Tyga's POW in front of him tight window on third down for laviano with the pressure of Josh Perry coming right at his face what electing not to go for it on fourth and to the punter of Joey Roth is in the game Iowa State keeping an eye on a potential fake but rock boots it away just missed going out about a foot from to go find that he's gonna try to catch that and then he just lost the ball that ice always gonna catch a break the balls going sideways look up closest is all the small marks is going against Dave of inches over on ESPN get you ready for week seven in the NFL tomorrow 10 o'clock Eastern the NFL insiders event boomer in the boys on countdown take you up to kickoff also streaming live with a watch ESPN app so Scarlet Knights only Nets 20 yards with the touch back after not going for it on fourth and 2 I estates so far running the ball only four past if only one receivers caught a pass Michael Thomas and Barrett with the keeper again again able to run through one arms actually went to pick up for longer was able to track him down what's happening right now and the reason you see Ohio State continuing to run is it when you have an athletic quarterback quarterback they can run it becomes a numbers game so when JT Barrett is looking out at the defense he's seen two safeties that are back fairly deep so in your early miner type of offense you're thinking you've got a run the stick long does that walk when you have safeties back here like this when they start to commit up then you can pull it out and start to throw the ball but they're being effective with two safeties deep and still being able to defend the run pass on second and six this is Braxton Miller turned in the quarter and hopping into the secondary he's got a first down at the 33 it's what the cat mouse game becomes is not just vertical passing game because it's tough with two safeties back is you run ccleaner JT Barrett into the teeth into the middle of the defense and if that's not successful that's where those Jets weep so you just saw with Braxton Miller or some kind of run out to the outside to the FIR every quick pass to the perimeter just to try to stretch this defense horizontally goes as a pass and the 18th reception for Braxton has been working hard on his wide receiver skills and Urban Meyer confident that he'll be an NFL ready in the next year at that position Barrett keeper against lips attack hook pumps into a blocker and gets that in midfield I think that the only thing preventing him from a touchdown there perhaps was a blocker and there's the zone read he's going to do a good job of reading Lambert 22 right here he's reading this guy see how he walks out with them that signifies to keep the ball for JT Barrett now he's gonna follow 50 for Billy price and the runs as you said in the Jeff Green but Ohio State now find a little bit of a rhythm offensively within this run game too big receiver Berwyn into green 6 5 to 20 effectively getting Barrett's way so first down from midfield JT looks immediately in the direction of Thomas who's gotten more exit tackle they will not catch him but stay at Ohio State depleted an inexperienced Rutgers secondary beaten by the Buckeyes best receiver there well here's exactly what we're talking about Chris see the safety is back here now watch on this play they walk a safety up and when you walk it safety up you create oneonone opportunities on the outside JT Barrett looks over makes the adjustment little playaction one on one on the outside a nice cushion and now your receiver can make a play but you don't have to worry about two safeties back in coverage and it just becomes the numbers game again with JT Barrett because of his athletic ability running this offense Isaiah Wharton is the corner that could not Corral Thomas's 50yard touchdown his sixth of the season gives Ohio State a 14 nothing lead now early second good year providing aerial coverage kick off your drive with tires that return superior performance Goodyear more driven the official aerial provider of Saturday Night Football on a scarlet here Kirk it's hard to get a point out with your high state fans are that little corner there here's that touchdown again by Michael Thomas top the strength by Thomas this is where he's really gotten better as a complete receiver not just a strength with the speed to split the safeties to take it all the way to the end zone that single high look to JT fair recognizing it being able to exploit that they've had to be very very patient in their passing game in his first half a short kickoff and brats can have his first chance to make an impact as a returner tonight but the Buckeyes Parana kick coverage team flies down there and stops him at the 21 yard line Malik hooker on the tackle listen FeliCa the bear is made his way from James Madison with you today and he's got the Aflac trivia question for tonight Chris hey guys starting to look like it might not happen tonight but can you tell me when the last time ap number one one on the road and lost to an unranked a pony 18 number one losing on the road to an unranked well this is the first USC at Oregon State in Corvallis that the Rogers brothers they're in first when we get really good all right you got with seconds marks quarterback that was a tough night for them for the Trojans Henley called that game was fun that was nutty there's a crazy care in the beaver scored on a touchdown like the bounce off people into the hands of the receiver second and nine empty backfield laviano looks laughs too dangerous thrown the catch is made by Grandpa Hill he stopped immediately by Darren Lee not your average linebacker in cousins no Darren Lee is special when talking about a guy last year that really came on for the better athletes on the team they put into the field plays like a Nickelback outside linebacker six to about 235 he's been a little bit frustrated at times this year because people don't always go his way he's not being able to have the kind of impact it ease it he'd hope to have and so when he gets his chances a strong side linebacker who can cover the fastest guy in the entity a slot receiver here he is right here on third down Justin Goodwin the third down specialist is back in there laviano escape delivers catch made against short of a first down Andre Patton came back to the ball they'll spot it at the 30 and again it'll be fourth in short Conley and Bell converging and Rutgers sends out the punt team again Chris ash and Luke fickle much like what we're seeing from Rutgers on third down and you see it all over college football obviously in the NFL but you get these offenses to third down and you have the advantage and the reason is you can give a lot of different looks and at the snap of the ball some guys are coming and some are dropping and it's up to that line to communicate and Ohio State being a very effective getting pressure Ben McDaniels knew that third and long was gonna be tough in Scott natural 1 for 7 on third down tonight fair catch made by Jalen Marshall ABC's newest drama wicked City starring Ed Westwick erika christensen and jeremy sisto premieres Tuesday night 10:00 Eastern 9:00 central but after Marvel agents of shield here on ABC so Iowa State will set up at the 35 yard line trying to build on this 14point lead for half to go until halftime but guys have had a very run heavy play calls so far tonight they're at 44 691 yards he's also rushed for 83 yards in his return to the starting lineup responsible for all but 13 of Ohio State's yards been a very quiet evening for Zeke Elliott who's had a streak of 12 consecutive hundred yard games he's gonna have to work hard to get there tonight only 13 yards on his eight carries so far JT's surveying the coverage he's got Langston Miller in the slot to the right Eliot again cannot be tackled in the backfield escapes for a short game but they're all over amber 15s and linebackers are coming downhill and that's why it's opened up opportunities for JT Barrett what kind of impact is JC Barrett had after a quarter and a half he's already rushed for 83 yards in this game and you think about the first six games Ohio State quarterbacks to the entire game have only averaged 60 yards for an entire game a quarter in half and he's are need 83 yards their focus on Zeke Elliott it's opening up the running lanes for the quarterback Rutger shows pressure on second Nate Barrett gets the ball out looking for Miller down so tough to cover out of that SWAT position well this is again another phase of his offense with the running game you've got to worry about playaction now you've got oneonone with Braxton Miller up against a Nickelback up against really a safety how about the adjustment by Braxton Miller a guy that's trying to prove he's more than just a great athlete oh they're gonna take pity end up catching that football if he did it came off a knee wasn't it I saw it come out I didn't realize until we had that look that it came out that much how about the concert I was focused on his adjustment back to the ball and everything you know he's trying to show that he could be a complete receiver but the focus to be able to come up with that catch should be maybe should have made it the first time it kind of went through his that's hard you're falling back all your momentum is coming back fourth I off Cioffi sty job choppy actually pushed it to him kind of landed he gets it at this press later yeah and this bolts out that's a tough catch the crowds reacting they don't realize yet they he ends up yeah that's a catch he never does touch the ground but it was complicated we talked about the skills the athletic ability is obvious but all the receivers skills that he's trying to learn in just one season to get ready for drafted his entire life he's been a quarterback in fact I remember seeing him as a freshman furthering he started which is tough to do it in the Dayton area of Wayne high school as a freshman quarterback is a 14 year old so that's all he's ever known is being a quarterback and you know even though he's fast he's athletic I think we're seeing in the last two or three weeks him blocking better running better routes the careers right now being a complete receiver now they come to red soda you got to worry about him and his quickness in the open field and Barrett is at the bottom of the formation to the right as Braxton takes the direct snap fakes it to Elliott and now follows Eliot around the lefthanded bricks and Miller knocked out reaches for the pylon no signal you know spot him out short of the goal line Jarius Adams the freshman corner just shoving him out it's a good effort by Adams to put up close down just before the ball has reached across the plant another look but guys playing fast here Barrett back to quarterback it just goes in standing up they don't worry about the replay JT with a short touchdown run a 45 yard crazy catch by Miller and then Braxton takes it down to the one yard line and JT does the rest and there's all the weapons that they have Michael Thomas we've seen make up play this is easy touchdown for JT Barrett Braxton Miller that was really the Braxton Miller Drive at that time that's what makes them so tough as you close one aspect to their offense down and it opens up other avenues for them to be able to go out and have opportunities to make plays so it was an 80yard Drive followed by a 65 yard touchdown drive 21 nothing I have to say I've been getting off to some slow starts on offense and recent games they bring Barrett back II quarterback and as a very productive first half three touchdown drives for Ohio State becoming more balanced now with some of the big plays they had through the air 1:16 on the ground 136 now through the year remember last week against Penn State they were a little frustrated they were to run heavy 314 to 114 through the air grant will have a chance again another high short kickoff from the 9 yard line knocked down a 25 yard line just a little thing here Chris but it's worth looking at watch Oh Braxton Miller steps up to set up the block by Zeke Elliott just this little step up he intentionally pulls the defense here and now you get great blocking angles and it gets him to the edge of the defense where he can run and use his speed so he steps up if Gibbs see Kelly had a chance to actually pick up two blocks and then into the ends are close to getting into the end zone in this court in the next play and there was a holding penalty on the return so Rutgers we'll start with poor field position a lot of state coming off as you said it slowest passing yards output in the last 15 games since penn state gaming he a year ago they didn't really need to throw the ball because their offensive line was having its best game of the year wearing down penn state's fly in front but you said they had a chance it gets a very poor pass defense tonight to get the balance back and and rediscover same rhythm in the past they've had to be patient with it because Rutgers was taking it away early in the game they had to keep running the football for Senate sent laviano Luke's a nice ball catch made there by Carew and the weapon for the Rutgers team has slammed down by Connelly out near midfield this is a perfect fall if you remember they ran that exact same route earlier and he overthrew it this time he delays it right over the shoulder of Carew 22 the coverage by Connolly step for step but the ball struggles it's right over the shoulder than speedy receiver 33 yard gain Rutgers this desperate to get something going before halftime where's down carry for Robert Martin slips aside potential tackle from Perry and picks up seven on first down Josh Perry again last week out of the lineup Booker got a chance to get some valuable reps but Perry surprised me I thought they might try to see if they could get him a week or two of some rest before they get ready for the back end of their schedule should say that Tommy shut one of the starting defensive lineman is out he had hand surgery this week so Joel Hale is senior stepping in for shut who could be out a couple of weeks give it to Martin again but he's hit in the backfield and spun down for a loss that was Darren Lee invading instantly yeah Raekwon Macmillan and Darren Lee you're gonna shoot here but here's the playmaker right here and if you're not going to account for him setting the edge you're gonna have some problems and I don't know if that's a mixup run miscommunication yet too tight in that time coming over looked like he was going to pick up a block but he ends up going back to the right made it very easy for the very athletic Darren lead and make the play nobody got there about at the same time the football was given a Martin so the law sets up another third and long they need nine more he's knocked down by Joshua parry so Rutgers misfiring after a nice first down gain in that series this is just a poor snap yeah they looked like they might get a little bit of momentum going and Nelson just throws that well short of getting back to the quarterback laviano and laviano was thinking hey it's hard enough dealing with this guy right here Perry at 97 Joey Bosa Darren Lee gotta get the snap up to me give me a chance Joey Roth has been a little bit too busy in this first half for but Chris fans liking Marshall standing and is at 11 yard line it's a low kick he will let it bounce roll dead at about the 17 in the final minute of the first half John Mark and Mac will head with the capital one halftime report scores and highlights update that Utah USC game Trojans earlier had a two touchdown lead Ole Miss is hammering Texas A&amp;M by the way in Oxford right now the Ole Miss still controls their own destiny and the SEC went next week Notre Dame visits undefeated 22nd ranked temple Matt roll fine young coach for the Owls they get a very experienced team almost exclusively seniors and juniors in that too deep a stout defense stick it on the Irish in Philly primetime on ABC next week they were just taking a knee Meyer uninterested in trying to add to this lead before halftime say what Tyler medic heaven is a linebacker of one of those veterans in that temple team seven and OH for the first time in school history and how sky high with 18 when the Fighting Irish come to town next week very that'll be his Willie might be an all day scene hey you got tempo out there you got Houston out there you got Memphis out there yeah yeah see who's gonna survive that gauntlet and join the the new year 6 wanted Toledo undefeated widows out there with Matt Campbell well Ohio State a couple of long touchdown drives into the second quarter 21 nothing at the break the capital on halftime reporting putting in their visit with POW foot right after these messages and welcome back to Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart Chris Fowler curb Street Heather Cox and Rutgers borough high o state has a three touchdown lead the DSW halftime stats showing you the Buckeyes have been productive averaging almost nine yards per play even though their workhorse Zeke Elliot has been limited to 15 yards rushing a very successful first half for JD Baron Kirk of course takes over starting roll again and you know how it looks pretty comfortable on the lead they'll get the ball to again in the third quarter yeah on the road really relying on their running game early and the 29 plays they've run the football 22 times but the big plays in the past came came in the second quarter when they found some oneonone opportunities and JT Barrett first time really taking over this offense I think people has such high expectations but truly other than some red zone packages the last couple weeks for us he's still kind of finding his rhythm but he's off to a very good start here taken over the offense Chris got to kick it away at Becker's defense created a fumble recovery in Ohio State's first possession Scarlet Knights best scoring opportunity was on their first possession and field goal with him off the upright curtis samuel back deep for Ohio State get things squared away over there the ball is falling off the tee first work that Goff's had tonight it's a low line drive boot on the hop Samuel goes up by the grabbing at the 5yard line and not spin free we knocked down about the 25 big Pacific Life game summary Kirk looking at the first half for JT it's up first half 5.7 for 136 yards he had 10 carries in the first half alone it did a very good job of just kind of reading the defense and taking what they gave him I still feel you're gonna see him get better better as far as the continuity of the office but seem to be in great command Urban Meyer told us this week he was hoping to maybe give him eight to ten touches as far as runs he's already a ten I think that's really as much as what Rutgers did in the first half to take away Z Kelley and opened up those chances for him just nine carries for 15 yards for Elliott or has one here but as always capable of breaking free and that's his biggest run by far the night but guys quickly into Rutgers territory you better keep your aggressive attitude as a defense because it's going to get tougher and tougher to tackle Zeke Elliott this is where he in the offensive line usually get more aggressive and if you lose your edge because you're down 21 you start to feel sorry for yourself a little bit Ohio State's not going to let up but neither is JT Barrett's running 27 yards on that carry he'll be it again just tried to break through an arm tackle dragged down for six yards to Heather Cox Chris absolutely no surprise Urban Meyer very happy with his defense and if our defense continues on the space there's no doubt we will win this game now when I asked him how he would assess JT Barrett in his first start since last November he said we had one drop but he's tough he's also doing a nice job reading the Blitz as the Rutgers throwin he did he wants to get Vic Elliott more touches only ten carries now which is interesting because he said normally he gets between twenty and twentyfive tonight pregame meet said we want to keep we got a bye week next week but keeping Elliott fresh for this stretch run is important he's worked hard in the first half of the season last couple of years number one in the FBS and rushing yards and yards from scrimmage he's ahead of last year's pace in terms of touches and then yards per carry and I think I think they'd love to see it continue that streak of 100yard rushing games 2:13 tonight yeah caught up how many times he touches the ball running but he also has twenty receptions coming so it he gets a lot of different touches in a game and their goal is not just seven games or eight games it's obviously the long stretch and they know what's coming up down the road with Michigan State in Michigan and potentially a Big Ten championship game see he is trying to get to that thirteen straight 100yard game and that's why I think you're gonna see more and more Curtis Samuel not just tonight but as the season goes on to try to spell him from time to time to eliminate some of the wear and tear I think it's smart yes but don't feed Elliot again makes a cut and is just barreling ahead now big holes and the Rutgers defense down to the 30 before Quan Louis stop the other thing you think about is you know you want to maybe give him some rest here there but he gets better as the game goes on he starts to wear a deep fence down and kind of steal their will a little bit and that's where he starts to really crank up the big yards in the second half Barrett now playaction on first down gets hit in the mouth but gets the ball away Samuel touchdown Ohio State flagged down it'll be against Rutgers roughing perhaps Barrett JT says it'll count and another big downfield pass plate tonight for Ohio State yeah Lewis hit JT Barrett right in the mouth as he threw it defense over 14 15 yard penalty will be enforced on the kickoff was over play touchdown he comes in with the tomahawk chop after the ball look at this little stutter and go and Curtis Samuel one of the best athletes on the Ohio State roster one on one with Anthony Cioffi who was a corner a year ago but plays safety when you get a safety isolated against a guy like Curtis Samuel great recognition and getting the ball downfield he also had Jalen Marshall wide open on the other side they elected to go to the right were the young sophomore receiver Curtis Samuel was the 30 yard touchdown catch for Samuel earlier it was 50 yards Barrett to Thomas but guys up 28 nothing there's the Allstate Saturday Night Football bus enter the Allstate it's good sweepstakes for a chance to $100,000 plus a VIP trip at the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game as well as weekly prizes throughout the season Curtis can just roll that bus down i95 to Philly next week a short trip he's loving that that'll be a quick one Ohio State will kick off at the 50 after the 15yard penalty on the touchdown pass the roughing the passer so willoughby could you could take aim and knock this through the uprights if he wants to he'll beat so it's a short kick they'll try to sky it and cover it grants had no success a dangerous returner and in here Chris when you run the ball again with thready JT Barrett all night tonight along with C Kelly and C the safeties how he has to get down when you get a safety down you over commit to the run this is what defense is gonna have to deal with with JT Barrett he can throw the ball this is an earlier touchdown the first half to Michael Thomas is the last one to Carter Sam you walk a safety down oneonone coverage safety in the middle easy throw goes right over his shoulder as I said he had also Jalen Marshall at the top pretty good adjustment here's a former running back because he's so athletic they want to get him on the field nice job adjust him to that football getting better and better himself at receiver second touchdown reception for Samuel this year James in the first town hand up well you know what their tried to say at the halftime in the Rutgers locker room guys we came from 25 down here 20 minutes to play at Indiana Rutgers actually twice in the last eight games if you go back to the Maryland game a year ago has come from 25 points down to win both of those on the road this but if if you're on this field and you're the coach and you're a player from Rutgers you got to be thinking about hey we've been here before we got to keep battling laviano off play action delivers the misfire across the middle trying to get the ball to his tall receiver I think it OC opening drive 12 plays they were moving the ball a very balanced attack they missed a field goal a little bit deflating and Ohio State makes some adjustments defensively the defensive line has really cranked up the pressure the linebackers have been active against the run game and made it very very tough for them on third down getting a lot of pressure on these third downs and here comes another one right here just one of eight state just foaming at the mouth just a bunch of Buckeyes crowding the line of scrimmage showing pressure again they twist around laviano is hurried and frozen complete trying to get a Daggett I see again but well covered and for that again so you worry about Joey Bosa and you use two or sometimes three different guys to deal with his pressure and then you've got to deal with Darren lien and others who can get pressure so you see how they slide everybody then right and then it frees up another defender that's what makes this defense so tough when they get you to third down they can get you fresh with Bosa Washington Lewis Perry and Lee Joey Rock with a pun one of the undefeateds has fallen tonight and we're gonna give you a studio update coming up here a shocking finish in Atlanta not so shocking here so far in Jersey 28:7 Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart get

in his career blocked before that one scooped and score so Florida States they can get a good chance to win it at a worse it's otona jackets were this shocking upset in Atlanta play clock running down on first down there gets its snap and keeps it running left he gets into Rutgers territory a nice first down gain again for the quarterback he's approaching 100 yards now with 93 on his 11 carries eight and a half a carry just using your quarterback as a running back the reason he checked state is he saw the numbers that he wanted to where he wanted to attack and oops if you add him as a number as a defense or if you don't add him as a number he's gonna run that football now playaction Barrett flips it out to Elliott inside the 40 it's another first down Steve long who is the big hitter to that Rutgers defense he got the shot delivered by Ellie instead you also have KY Hester who's out there but long is right there who is a physical physical linebacker but he absorbed that head watch this lower your shoulder drive your feet you're talking about longer with you say second the big tenant tackles and aggressive that time he just held on Curtis Samuel is now the tail back behind Barrett collision now bear it down the middle try to get it to Jaylin Marshall nice job and a flag comes in it was Hester in coverage but reps wrapped that arm around jail and Marshall and drew the flag crowd grumbling about it take a look trying to get the ball with a few solos that left arm from hester wrapped around the neck there of jaylen marshal interesting that they picked that up after the call right there officials came together but to me it looked like hester got there a little bit early with that left left arm around the neck Ohio State they're they're changing a lot of the plays of line of scrimmage getting calls from the sidelines it's not just JT Barrett you'll see sometimes when he looks over the receivers also will look over when they get that confirmation Elliott barrels ahead not really playing at hyperspeed tonight just selectively tempo for Ohio State and I think you know a guy that had a very quiet first half we talked about how he seems to get better as the game goes on and if you can even though you're down by 28 if you don't keep pressing the button and continue to shoot those gaps the way they were early in the first half he's going to keep hitting those eight and 10 and 12 and eventually Bharath on third and short fire is incomplete looking for Thomas but he was well covered so Meyer figures to go for it on this fourth and short took a shot on third down my friends still out there when you have the a running game cranking the way this one is tonight you know you're more than likely going to see him run the football they're having nine yards of plays fourth and one wish them a timeout by Ohio State's and they'll talk about this and you're right it's it's not terribly original but so tough to stop whether it's 16 or 15 yeah from a yard out and forth down now the reminder the Ravens and the Cardinals funny that on ESPN countdown at 6 o'clock kickoff at 8:15 streaming on watch ESPN out the Cardinals home field of course is where the championship game will be played on January 11th after the semifinals on New Year's Eve in Arlington and in Miami I had Warner there at the bottom all fits a coordinator now he's taking some criticism back in Columbus early in the year a lot of people when the offense wasn't quite clicking wondering you know hey Tom Herman's in Houston and they're winning every game and that's obviously Tom Hartman one of a kind coach but 16 in their quarterback it's amazing how much better he'd be coming with a play ball and strength gets it because he was grabbed initially behind the line by Cioffi but overall our the safe watch this jump cut here I mean this this is taken away to the left and watch his recognition he's just trying to find grass and even when he found that grass he had to carry Cioffi and Lambert with him across the marker for the first now the Buckeyes playing quickly and Barrett in the first and throw looks for Thomas he's on foot in the end zone a flag comes in he was grabbed as he was breaking free by warden he got by him with a double move went right by Wharton leaving your corners on islands to get numbers up to defend this running game and that is a dangerous thing to do defense over 11 15yard penalty again you're talking about NFL caliber receivers that Ohio State has it's exactly the move he used on Kendall fuller against Virginia Tech a little stop and go was a touchdown week one against Virginia Tech this time it would have been a touchdown if it weren't for the pass interference call it's kind of mastered that look at that move he's mastered a lot of aspects about playing receiver McShea if not the toprated draft eligible receiver one of them Buckeyes right back in the red zone the first end at the 11 Eliot I sit back but hit for a loss there Julien Pinnock Cedric Quentin gauze the linebacker combining and that's the kind of penetration that we saw from them a lot in the first half and of course there will be intense this is where you back there this is where that the zone read the playaction pass usually starts to come into play for Ohio State grand receivers to the left and that's Samuel in motion they are a redzone machine right now after struggling in that department for five games you saw you saw curtis samuel coming underneath tim tebow used to run this play for florida a little shovel pass like a trip wob trip there's nobody to option off of so he just gets out of it and just ends up following cutting back and just being an athlete that is his fourth touchdown tonight then he's responsible for two through the air and two on the ground I think they've missed 16 a little bit Sammy will say they give me the ball but JT said it and no need I'll just don't just take care of this myself and Ohio State rolling now a couple of touchdown drives in the third quarter 35 nothing on some of these fans perhaps thinking about the G minute he gets Dallas tomorrow over on ESPN and if he'll insiders at 10 o'clock and then boomer in the countdown gang at 11:00 to set the table right down and still kickoff Giants and Dallas is a wacky finish when they played earlier this season I think the bangles are still stumbling around out there right undefeated they are the bye week actually for the Bengals next week right got a right root for the Broncos stay healthy just keep pushing your Broncos Broncos undefeated Mohamed Sanu is a Rutgers Graduate receivers of Bengal he was supposed to be here tonight by week I saw Todd Frazier a little earlier Jack Willoughby has been busy tonight just working on the coverage I want to get these guys some action so he sky's the kickoff but Grant is dangerous he was knocked down from a side there as he crosses the 25 well how the state began this season is the first ever unanimous number one in the history of the AP poll not terribly convincing so their little pie began to get divided up a little bit in the most recent poll Baylor had 12 firstplace votes TCU had three LSU one Clemson once those six teams sharing the firstplace votes Utah had the secondmost we're down 42 to 17 tonight yeah the Utes are getting whacked in South Central Los Angeles and they will absorb their first loss barring a miraculous comeback you know how state's gonna pick up more firstplace folks after this performance and Utah's loss there's a diving pick Conley went down low and grabbed it at the 45 but that was really good coverage from Gary and Conley see if he holds on to this well what an effort think he got his hands arms underneath it same standard for receiver the ground cannot aid in control of the ball but Connelly a terrific job that should stand he went all the way across the field his hand got underneath the ball that is a terrific play second pick of the year for Conley if it stands the interception is one thing it's where he had to come from the entire field and mantoman coverage and show tremendous closing speed there to make that play calmly but guys first takeaway tonight they still have only 12 for this season as we take another look I don't think this route is going to go all the way across the field and keep an eye on this closing speed and the way he makes his play ball is thrown behind him which gave Connelly a chance and he has such long arms now you have Connelly on one side Eli Apple on the other and Ohio State plays a ton of mantoman coverage and Connelly has stepped in for Duran grant this year opposite of Apple and did a really nice job at his first year as a starter assuming this interception counts we think it should why state will still be in negative territory turnovers for the year don't be 1 something they figure to get fixed as the season goes forward well it's a huge emphasis from Urban Meyer Luke pickle and Chris ash they need more turnovers late ators interceptions coming in to tonight as he said and last year they had 25 first we the only thing is the defense they haven't done well they forced 32 3 announce that's top five in the FBS among the best defense is in preventing big plays do a great job there haven't yet and the takeaway numbers sacks are their top five in the country in that department will you combine the coverage from Apple and Conley in mantoman and then you combine that with the pressure that they get from Bose and Washington and Lewis and Perry and Lee it really makes it tough to throw the ball on it though one of the best in the country and pass defense Barrett rolls out delivers nearside Jalen Marshall makes the catch and I got a prediction for you that the marshal will be involved and you get a touchdown here here in the rest of this game I'm kind of keeping track up here with who's had a chance to make plays and we've we've already checked off of course JT Barrett Zeke Elliott and Braxton Miller's had his chance Michael Thomas is that his chance the only guy yet is number seven makes the catch their yards to get to a 13 consecutive hundred yard game muscled out Heather well Kristin Kreuk bad news for the Rutgers offense their star wide receiver lay on take Haru out for the remainder of the game not even out here with the team he didn't practice all week after that right ankle injury talk to him before the game didn't have cortisone just taped it up said he'd go as long as he could help his team well it flared up and he can't help his team anymore well then Buckeyes number four Samuel is short gain he is a tough guy I saw him at practice yesterday and I thought there is no way this dude's gonna be on the field he couldn't even participate at all in practice was hobbled he showed his pain tolerance if it didn't get an injection it's miraculous that he contributed as much as he did yeah and he really has come back this year is one of the more physical warrant more athletic receivers in the into big ten from Don Bosco Prep right here in new jersey Elliott we needed 16 yards for a hundred before that carry knocked down by Kwan Lewis after a short game but it does move to change I think when we were doing our research and getting ready for this game it was pretty obvious to know that the health of kuru was paramount for them to have a chance to have an a balanced offense attack tonight he was able to make three catches now Barrett looking across the middle Elliott just slips down at the 16 after picking up five yards Gailen Marshall I still think he's gonna get more involved he wasn't that that last catch because urban loves to spread the ball around keeps all the talented playmakers involved yeah so again Jalen Marshall at this point he has one reception for just 11 yards he's to the far right Samuel in the slot Barrett look in that direction it's Marshall makes the catch can he make a man miss can't hot escape down to the six yard line we have a little fun because I think one of the major play calling challenges for this Buckeye team was just getting off the guys the touches and all the touchdowns exactly right watch right here and this is just another little thing that JT Barrett is gonna get into film study he throws that out there that's a catch by Michael Thomas and probably a touchdown there's just little things like that it's one thing to be able to win be up 35 nothing he is such a perfectionist there's two or three plays he's going to go back and see and it's going to help him kind of get back into the groove that you normally expect to see from him now Marshall on the pop pass in motion on first and goal is it for a loss well diagnosed by Gauss they're trying they're trying we both know how Urban's mind works Eva Curtis Samuel has gotten in on the act tonight the Nick event at the tight end has been quite a fashion a few games he's a very talented Walker and pass catcher and he had a big touchdown last year against Rutgers Elliot in this slot he now goes in motion they fake it to him Barrett to Thomas in traffic but he still gets down near the goal line stopped at the 1 so flag is down and he grabbed his facemask there personal foul face man defense good spot that's Luis on the face mask so it'll be a very short penalty as they move the ball inside the one yeah what you see receivers run those tunnel screens usually it's a undersized guy that is quick in space not very often you see a receiver six three to ten willing to come back in there and just I think speaks about how tough a guy Michael Thomas is due to get the touchdown here to this time I think fifteen or sixteen right seven yeah Marshalls gonna throw it or tries to just cuts it back it walks in we had a feeling Jalen Marsh was going to get involved his turn to reach the end zone as Ohio State rolls up the score here now late third quarter they're actually just you know he played quarterback in high school at Middletown High School and he's trying to throw it to Michael Thomas make them both happy but instead Marshall goes back to his old days and saying you know what if it's not there I'm just gonna look at me would you call this a gap that he just ran through middle eightyfive I mean this is rolling in yeah creativity at its finest toying with an opponent is another word for it 42 nothing robber 4th with a studio update UFC continues to extend their lead on number three Utah hoodie customer up top to juju Smith it's 42 17 five minutes ago in Los Angeles meantime on ESPNU number five LSU beating Western Kentucky 48 20 less than two minutes to go in Baton Rouge Chris well many people who didn't believe the Utah was worthy of that ranking gloating a bit today it was gonna be very very tough for anybody I think to run the table in the pac12 and this is the night that the Utes number came up in LA muchneeded win for USC play helping the interim coach therefore they get ya meet in the South Bend they played well last week against Notre Dame but I think that's the thing that everybody gets so excited about debating these teams usually get get into November at the very least and see where we are teams were eventually gonna expose themselves Marian grant and is knocked down at the 15yard line Denzil ward and the special teams tackler as a flag down Ohio State not penalized tonight it'll be the 6th penalty on Rutgers receiving team number 26 the three unbeaten teams in the Big Ten Iowa had a off weekend Maryland at Indiana Minnesota Purdue at home and then at Nebraska to finish up Iowa would be favored and in all of those games Spartans had two Lincoln next and then of course yet Ohio State it's November the 21st in the Buckeyes visiting in Armour the 28th Thanksgiving weekend a bye before facing Minnesota for Ohio State and the illini it seemed they put up 50 plus three straight years nights been back at the six after the penalty on the return Martin trying to create some space gets a crease and Robert Martin with a big stiff arm dives out across the 20yard line I think Joey Bosa we've seen these last two or three weeks where he has really become difficult to handle whether it's against the run or the pass has such quickness such great feet and hands his added this year to his repertoire moves dealing with double teams relying on his friends to help him out when they spent too much time worrying about him so what makes Ohio State's defense a pass rush so effective is Bosa gets the attention but there is a group of athletes up front to can get after a quarterback he's a first down hand up to Martin again pulls up with a sack tonight bringing his career total to 24 and a half that's equal this shilly Calhoun number one among active players in college football he was sucking the sweet Kirk about all the little techniques that she used to knock guys down and the various moves that he's developed and perfected including grabbing a guy like up under the celeb arm then trying to inflict some pain again that's NFL stuff we can start talking about your art to a point where you know where to like grab a guy to try to hit like a pressure point right that's that's ridiculous for a college guy anyway Martin Falls forward talked about all the draft prospects on this Ohio State roster here these are seven different position groups which the Buckeyes have one of the top five ranked players to the position your wonder kirk about Cardale Jones it was in cotton McShane's top five quarterbacks and how the new status as a backup will affect his draft stop I think what's interesting we talked to urban about that challenge of having a team that's so gifted I mean he said it's a good problem to have but it's a challenge last year they play to the chip on their shoulder this year we're kidding around like okay this guy got to touch this guy scored this guy scored that's a whole different deal when you've wanted championship and you have so many individuals that are eventually gonna go on to the NFL Urban Meyer's talked about that being he's been there before in Florida but that is a different set of problems for him than what he dealt with last year and el Jones by the way warming up perhaps you go in and in mopup duty which can't be easy for a guy who as we said before he's is tena no and as soon as a starter didn't play badly this year I think it had as much to do with the way JT Parrott just kept coming when they gave him the red zone package and the way he executed within that red zone package I think it was more of a reflection of what he was doing as much as anything and again his his skill set fits this offense there's a different rhythm to this offense and the tempo and the decisionmaking is in a whole different level when he's in there so you can see tonight he's off to a pretty good start and taking the reins back as a starter you think so on third and three here's the end off and a rare conversion on third down for Rutgers only the second time tonight you know Jones up there in the top five quarterback prospects screen in the Shea along with Connor cook who's second rated behind valve Jared Goff Hackenberg is in the top five now long it's been since the Big Ten has had a quarterback drafted in the first round Carey Codd sure that's exactly right 1995 the last firstround draft pick NFL quarterback now they've had plenty of guys who played very very well out of this conference we need to go back very quickly to the Ohio State touchdown and you follow the rules Mike Tirico does too this is a shovel pass technically Jalen Marshall so because it's a pass and even though what happened quickly he started to look like he wanted to throw he could not have actually thrown that ball so I don't know if he's just using this as a decoy but if he would have thrown that football unit to where a bid for a touchdown it would have been a flag thrown like a TEM servation the defense certainly didn't didn't play it as a run now they pretty much left him alone that's right one first down pumpfake trying to escape drop by Sam Hubbard who backs up place but a very talented freshman defensive end but how about the big fella Joel Hale the senior getting excited out there showing some emotion has had to come in for shut he's right in the middle getting doubleteamed great coverage downfield Sam Hubbard who's had a heck of a year this year as a freshman at a Cincinnati bowler but Hale showing some emotion there getting to the quarterback to help out a fifth year senior might be making his first start and I believe in business is his first start Tommy shut is out time your life Joel getting in on a sack there loop's it down near side incomplete he was looking for a dicey but again good coverage on the edge there I was talking to the Ohio State defensive coaches about their corner play and asking them when you have a man you leave your corners on island so much when you have a guy out there by himself what's he looking for if the receiver has a step how does he want to turn his head look for the ball when does he want to turn his head and look for the ball he said you know the coaches feel with the receiver like in that case has a step on us we want to wait to the very last second and goes through the hand when his hands go up to be able to catch that ball our hands are going to go up to separate his hands from that football and that's a that's exactly what Mark Marchand Lattimore did on that play flag down the balls delivered good point on the far side and he breaks three out near midfield this likely to come back tie his powell on the tackle not much to complain about no hiyo stateside even though they be pinched eight by four touchdowns the defense wasn't happy with its tackling last week can't find fault with this performance from Ohio State defensively that's for sure shift offense fiveyard penalty repeat third down they had the one fumble by Barrett in their first possession that's the only turnover and no penalties so far not too many missed tackles and excellent balance which is what Urban does look for 203 rushing 223 passing it's exactly what they wanted they spent an inordinate amount of time on tackling this week fundamentals of tackling because of the game against say Quan Barclay last week in Penn State they said you know for a team that had so many last year they're one of the best teams in the country at fewest missed tackles and that really bothered them to miss as many tackles as they did last week so that was a big focal point coming into this game to defend this this Rutgers offense but Chris let's let's the time expire 15 minutes to play in Jersey back after this message and a word from your local ABC station forty to nothing after three quarters here Ohio State got the one touchdown of the first quarter so in the second three and the third and the defense trying to protect the shutout Rutgers held to just 181 total yards tonight I mean it's third and thirty as we begin the fourth quarter laviano heaves it short catch made by a gadot see if he breaks six tackles he'll get near the marker but he is shoved out on the far side but Chris just really couldn't afford to hurt itself with penalties and that's been a problem for this team really all season long Maya State playing almost mistakefree football since the early turnover now state doesn't have a penalty in the note ballgame walk deflected and outofbounds connelly the starting corner one of the stars in this defense that stays on the field for special teams got in there very quickly yeah and I like black who's our expert when it comes to kicking up here in the booth is right here at the bottom of your screen this is actually a very slow time giving Conley enough time to be able to to get there they want to try to get this off under two seconds and this was well over two seconds and Conley has too much speed coming off the edge they didn't even necessarily have punt block on he was just coming on his own off the edge and with that slow delivery there it gave him time to come in and make the play Barrett's silly quarterback to begin the fourth quarter Jones is warming up moments ago perhaps hopefully Barrett's gonna keep the ball and lose a yard to rubber forest for an update Robert by Chris quick start for number ten Stanford against Washington opening drive Kevin Hogan Austin Hooper he just gets into the end zone it's seven nothing Cardinal on ESPN first group garden will visit the Palouse next week number Washington State controlling their destiny the pac12 north repeat that again fiftyfive but the defense here was some boos hey Chris watch Taylor Decker here the left tackle one of the better left tackles in the country he's right in front of ball the tide in he goes up gets up to the linebacker does a really good job there I'm just opening that up along with Billy Price the left guard that opened up and see that again to Zeke Elliott you might contain him the first half he eventually in the offensive line they start to figure things out up front and he just gets more determined as a runner as the game goes on becomes more physical as a runner as the game goes on and I cook he had 15 yards rushing in the first half a hundred 27 now in the second half so he's got his 30 consecutive hundred yard game and his second touchdown tonight 11th year sponsoring the good hands field goal nets from Allstate making contributions to general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kicks today Ball State has contributed millions in scholarship funds no field goals picked tonight just seven extra points Jack Willoughby for the Buckeyes another kickoff I think they're just giving these guys a chance to cover kickoffs because he's very capable of reaching the endzone most of the time but he he's trying to sky the kickoffs let these guys run down there this time he decides to boot it away well today in college football and ugly ugly performance by Miami the al golden howling will get louder the alums are sending out tweets 58 zip from the Tigers on the road Alabama had to just barely survive against the game Tennessee team blocked field goal returned for a touchdown at the gun is Georgia Tech upset Florida State in Atlanta wild finish and USC dropping the hammer on the Utes in the Coliseum first loss for number three Utah so down 49 nothing change at Porter back as Hayden Rettig a sophomore from LA who signed with LSU and then transferred here to Rutgers he lost a a close battle for the job with laviano and he actually started the opening game when Liliana was suspended for the first half for a curfew violation he's now replaced laviano he was a pretty highly touted recruited out of LA to go to Baton Rouge transferred sat out last season his brother his older brother a very good quarterback as well that's right if you remember Boston College chase but it was a player for three years there yeah goes about well and practice so if you can evade the pressure hammered from behind that it falls incomplete welcome to the game Hayden reading the Buckeyes just teeing off now and also Chris you've seen a lot of second unit players coming in here here's Lattimore who's gonna blitz off the corner nobody picks him up io state maintaining their aggressive attitude wait there's an attempted block there by the running back doesn't good they're not they're not just kind of trying to get to the finish line here they're still attacking you Redick you're telling James and the end the running backs guys make an effort the throw block ready Lutz the ball downfield to jump ball incomplete again that was Lattimore and coverage and I guess he had run out of bounds anyway there was a good example of some contact back and forth but because Lattimore was in position and because he had his head turned around looking for that football they allowed both the receiver and the defensive back to try to work to try to get to the ball see his heads turn if your head gets turned they're gonna allow you and the offensive player to push back and forth on each other Rauf the punt again when you recall deflected gets this one away and Marshall waves for a fair catch at the 39 Buckeyes back to work up seven touchdowns Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought to you by Pacific lights for life insurance annuities and investments choose Pacific lights the power to help you succeed and Dr Pepper Dr Pepper and college football it's a oneofakind tradition we thank good year for the aerial coverage everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires but they roll into yours Goodyear more driven the official aerial provider of 17th at football got the traffic looks like on route 18 most of the folks here for Rutgers fans have headed for the Jersey Turnpike Iowa State has a whole bunch of fans here you see folks in 15 and 97 jerseys 16 jerseys in it typically they've moved down behind the Buckeyes bench here in Jersey Kordell has come into the game and fire is high there's Jones now replacing Barrett and we'll finish with 14 of 18 passing 223 and three touchdowns and a hundred yard running game along with two scores that way so five total touchdowns for JD a very reminiscent of how the offense flowed with him last year that sounds like a stat sheet from the 2014 season of JT pair prior to his injury his brillante Dunn who backs up elliott new powers who over for nine yards other guys it's been really refreshing to be down here and watch the 2 ohio state quarterbacks interact the last few minutes we've got the role reversal card Alvin JT's got the headset on and you know they've spent we were with them week one and that even then they said you know what there's no animosity we've been competing since day one this is nothing new to us and you know what it doesn't look like it's just talk they really believe it so much support a ton of highfives between the two and there appears to be a great bond and mutual respect really a cohesion that quarterback unit that Coach Meyer puts so much emphasis on you know Heather it's gonna be tested here for Cardale Jones because he was the guy and when you're the guy it's it's easier to have an attitude and approach that that that is you know more of a you know willing to share the duties and I think JT Barrett showed and when he was the backup I think he really showed his leadership and being able to be there to help Cardell as a backup and help the receivers and that kind of thing and you know just watching JT bear throughout this game it's not just what he's doing on the field it's what he does on the sidelines and the way he talks to the defense in the offense and every everybody it's what makes him so unique in such a special leader field general is the way Nick Bennett described it JT admitted that he was pressing a bit when he was in that backup our situational role trying to make plays make the most of his chances but now as the starters and I looks completely comfortable with that role as you might expect a tnt strong performance look at what the quarterback did in his first start again since last November very efficient running and passing five total touchdowns third one Samuel hit behind the line struggles to the 40 he will be short and it'll be fourth down Wenzhou Lambert still playing hard made a tackle along with Quan Lewis but crew starters on defense for the most part still out there but guys apparently gonna go for it here would say number 12 keeper if you were to be if you're a betting man perhaps hear straight ahead hands it off and fighting for a first down is done just gets the line to make pick up the first down saw that reaction from Cato Mitchell one of their wide receivers from Ohio State who's checked in they've put some backups in he had maybe the hit of the year for Ohio State on a crack block against a linebacker and you saw his reaction you think thing maybe wondering what in the world is he reacting to it was the block he made play clock winding down I just get it off some confusion and Jones thrown for a loss there Lambert stopped him that play didn't didn't look right from the side it didn't you know I wonder we just talked about Cato Mitchell the receiver who had that big block he wonder if he was confused or he went a little bit too fast there to disrupt the timing here's this block that Mitchell had he's right there in the middle of the screen watch him crack on this linebacker boom you don't see a receiver hit a linebacker like that very often then he jumped around like you thought you thought he scored a touchdown severs get excited when they get to his good clean blocks it's one thing to block a DB he had a linebacker as you said starting middle linebacker he's done it hard after a short gain interview third and long and when herb admirer does when you're willing to block like that he tries to get you the football came back you know the jet sweep where the timing was mixed up but honestly that's what makes herb admire so unique is he these players know that it's whether it's special teams covering a punt or a kickoff walking as a receiver Zeke Elliott blocking as a running back when you do those kind of things he's getting reward to you with touches and opportunities Jones rusher delivers catch mayor Jeff Green getting involved the 65 senior from Georgia how about that catch balls thrown behind him he reaches back with the defender right there showing some strong hands to take the pawn to put it away from him knowing he's about to get just drilled by the linebacker first catch of the year for green that was a fastball it was own stall hands but guys at 515 yards total offense more than doubling Rutgers total tonight we'll leave the next backup to get a touch and perhaps a touch down here it's the only suspense Jones obviously would love to engineer a touchdown drive his first appearance tonight a new backup role and you've done dropped for a short game the Pacific Life game summary here so much of the story line was about JT Barrett's return to the starting lineup 324 total yards through four three ran for two Elliott with a strong second half got his hundred yards Michael Thomas a big night as well five receptions some big plays 103 yards and with JT Barrett running this offense the threat of him and Zeke Elliott in the running game it's just going to open up opportunities in the pass game for big plays because of the oneonone coverage on Thomas and Marshall and Braxton Miller gunned down inside the 20 so you like their chances in the next game at home against Minnesota yeah champagnes really makes it that the two games season that back loaded schedule we talked a lot about the home game against Michigan State which stayed unbeaten today but got a tussle from Indiana and then of course the road game at Michigan November the 28th those are the two games at the beginning of the year you knew to circle and you knew those are going to be their challenges now the way thing is things have played out of course those are the two games and then if things work out for Ohio State the Big Ten championship game more than likely as we sit here right now against the Iowa Hawkeyes who have had a very very solid year and you look at their remaining schedule there's a chance that Iowa still a long way to go there's a chance Iowa may be sitting there with maybe an undefeated season or maybe one loss and so you could have really potentially three games in a row with Michigan State Michigan and maybe Iowa and a Big Ten championship game if Ohio State were to get that far into the Big Ten championship first down boy worn bel into the game to give him a touch knockdown he only had six carries this year coming in under the reminder Monday night her Ravens and Cardinals on ESPN countdown gets it served at 6 o'clock Eastern then 8:15 kickoff also on the watch he hasn't been out yeah there it is Michigan or Ohio sit out of the East if they're undefeated against potentially undefeated Iowa yeah quite a showdown in Indianapolis but guys can stay perfect in the red zone tonight with Jones running the show powers down inside the ten still have a couple weeks until the committee releases their first rankings for their for their top four teams and there are certain teams you look at and you think that they're in pretty good shape as far as controlling their own destiny and start to try to forecast out and look at this you know you have teams like Ohio State Baylor and TCU that are up there how about Clemson making a statement today down in Miami and you look at their schedule and they've got a game at home against Florida State but they're gonna be heavily favored in every game that they have remaining and maybe becomes a one game season for Clemson at Tigers could be in the driver's seat to get there Jones a third down flip to Bell who's knocked down short of the first down if you missed it earlier the big news in Baylor is went over I always say is that they're fine quarterback Seth Russell playing as well as any quarterback in the country suffered a fractured bone in his neck he's going to have it evaluated this week we certainly hope the prognosis is positive but that just sounds like a serious injury and that Art Briles offense Cory Coleman and company it'll be tested now without their triggerman in there fourth and two and that's a loss bell dropped in the backfield so that red zone possession with the backups in does not produce points Goss on the tackle 417 why over on ESPN following the game between the Huskies and the Cardinal tonight ESPN will have SportsCenter at night complete recap with your college football Saturday not the busiest guys in Jersey tonight Kirk this is the crew that shoots up at Cannon when something good happens Rutgers they had the thing going free game they had it loaded up and they were still up and ready in the first half they shut her down around midway through the second corner this guy's thing I get this put on the costume I sit over here I got nothing to do I don't know if he talks like that but it kind of put a lot of people who state do Oh Josh shakes trying to make something happen on the far side this is look at a technique here and I want you to watch the reaction with watch these guys they're they're ready prepared hit crew here it works all week on this we presume they brought some ammunition they have not needed it since then it has been quiet you okay Kirk Buckeye fans are right in front of me get the big one since they do the cannon if they'd fired shots off for Ohio's a big plays that he did use a lot of ammo in right out right now oh lordy looking very much tonight here in New Jersey and like a team hungry to repeat the chase was an urban mired of last year this year's it's called the grind because he felt it might be tough physically and mentally to wear that big target having been to the mountaintop and his team perhaps didn't start the season looking like they were the favorites to repeat but they certainly look that way now I'm not trying to overdo this thing with JT Barrett but I said earlier in the week when this announcement was made that I really felt this could be a turning point in the season from Urban Meyer and his team just the insertion of of JT Barrett into that lineup because of the way the impact it could have not just on the offense but but the entire team it's your leader that's now out there taking every single snap it definitely had an impact on him tonight reading games it off Josh Hicks Northwestern Mutual presenting the rankings Utah with an 18 point loss of course drop out Stanford up quickly on Washington Florida State again on that blocked field goal returned for a touchdown as time expired losing at Georgia Tech you got Clemson 58 zip at Miami and right now it's 49 nothing our researcher Chris Balika says this is the first time ever you've had two top six teams go on the road in conference play and have shutouts of 49 nothing or greater never happened history of the sport I got to get the bear little love this morning on College GameDay he said Utah and either Clemson or Florida State would go down he thought to the top six would go down and sure enough Utah law student Florida State law to the top ten Utah lost in Florida State went down and Clemson obviously looked looked great today but the shakeup will only continue for the next five or six weeks Buckeyes meanwhile are going to extend the streak 16 straight true road games 128 straight big 10 regular season games 1 and of course with 21 game winning streak you know the excuse me that's patent on the catch perfect Meyer now with four separate 20plus game winning streaks in his career no one else has more than two and we're going back to old George Woodruff there at Penn before 1900 credible it is incredible incredible some of the names that he's up there he's up there with but while doing of course at the two monster 30plus game winning streak ready back takes a down field shot looks a taiga dorsey is behind the Buckeye defense where workers end the shutout no he's thrown down inside the 5 with 24 seconds to go get the camera ready they're up they're up in a position actually boys are up ready not the classs is not buying into it he's not convinced they're gonna guards hold that shutout note is the big play downfield and has put Rutgers in a position to get on the board here against some backups on the Ohio State defense this is where your prides on the line most of these guys are backups they're feeling the pressure from the starters those starters want that they want that shutout timeout taken by Rutgers with 24 seconds to go Robert Flores will have the Ford wrapup show after the game giving you the in progress scores and wrapping up what's already happened a couple of unbeatens going down the few Rutgers fans that are showing extreme loyalty and are still here were yelling over that to the the Canon crude it to get ready let me look at the long pass play by Redick to get that inside the 5 he had just enough time to be able to throw this and Chris he talked about his arm strength he witnessing it in practice and not just a strength there but the touch and the accuracy big concern for Rutgers going forward is getting Carew back in health the iechyd OC backs him up and he made a nice play there but this offense clearly needs number four healthy Rutgers first and goal and do have a timeout in their efforts to bust up the shutout here very late renting fires over the head about ten feet over the head of a six four receiver yeah he wanted to go high but he didn't want to go that high to make a play for the cannon crew here they're there they're anxious they're ready you're about a hundred yards away in the near left corner here it's loaded it's loaded I still don't know if they're buying it but we'll see we'll see if they're ready Ohio State again look at the starters up here on the edge just yelling out to the backups trying to get their attention and trying to make sure they're locked in great spot yeah you're there coaching them up over there and walk the shutout and a whistle before the snap timeout called spend one that last timeout means that if this play doesn't get into the end zone they're gonna are gonna struggle to get another playoff it's interesting to watch these starters from Ohio State we were kind of kidding about it but but really it tells you a lot about the older players Vaughn Bell number 11 up at the top right talking to guys you got all the other starters and they're not only these these backups dealing with the coaches Daron leads right in the middle of it up at the top look at him yelling trying to get these guys attention not only do they want the shut up in themselves they're helping they're coaching these backup players it kind of talks to you about some of the leadership that's on this football team but guys trying for their second shutout this year they beat Hawaii 38 nothing at home back in September Josh Hicks to the right of Redick who drops back throws far side and again way over the head of Archie diakon oh so it's third and goal as the crew waits patiently well by using that last timeout Ohio State again they're there trying to preserve the shutout they're blitzing and if they get the reading and get a sack two games over you know it's just too good when in on third and goal heretics straight back delivers in the endzone touchdown get that cannon crew ready Rutger is finally on the board you went off early and it went off real late puppies let's make sure that the footwear patent did get down yep them yeah that's a heck of a throw there by Redick got to that back line where there's typically a chance for receiver to find an opening there was man covered today with Lattimore Federico adds the extra point it's worth another blasts they hope for a few more cannon shots tonight reading the backup they're just gonna empty they just look rid of the ammo here now the Ohio State fans are cheering for them cheering for the cannon when it goes off why not send it off again I mean if you're gonna go to that much trouble to put the unis on what is that that was you guys to what mr. Corso had on it James yeah but I mean the guys are gonna go into that much trouble Uli's gotta get a couple shots not you sure the Corso is not part of this crew of you that's skin closely to see if Elsie isn't part of the brigade you got some of his contemporaries out there Brutus he was prepared not bad for the 50 year old until Brutus did I haven't mentioned Matt we're talking about a hang on Sloopy less we could ever get the fact that the McCoys or the never got are very light than ever yeah with the actor that wrote the record of that numberone hit 50 years ago for the Ohio State band played Brook derringer the part of that band Dara and I in the truck appreciate that in Blacky derringer of rock and roll hoochie COO later Famer as you well know as a solo artist where'd we lose control is it Midway fourth quarter tonight I think halftime Samuel just lets it bounce and go into the end zone will be a touchback so the Buckeyes will have to run one more play they'll be mild disappointment among some of the defensive players they didn't protect that that late shutout but a very very successful return to the starting quarterback position for JT Barrett Bo's have had a sack tonight and the Buckeyes will enjoy that bye week before the Gophers come calling yeah and I think for Ohio State the maturity will be tested because the fans the media a lot of people going to be starting the peek ahead talk about the Michigan State game and the Michigan game at the end of the year but I think their experience from a year ago will definitely help them keep their focus against teams that they should be expected to be able to take care of and for Rutgers it gets deeper you go to Wisconsin and to Michigan the next two games that you get in Nebraska and they're going to be borrowing a major surprise struggling to get back to six and six and try to get bowl eligible here and the heat perhaps will be turned up on Kyle Flood after a lopsided loss against another Boeing team here tonight finals tickets per seconds tick away one final and it's 497 bourbon my regime is his first visit to the stadium and all the Buckeye playmakers got involved including Thomas Oh had a big night Eliot another 100yard game Braxton Miller had a big catch touchdown run for Jalen Marshall mentioned the sack for Bosa 528 yards total offense for Urban Meyer's team and he's with heaven Chris thanks so much urban all week really all season everybody's been talking about your often so let's shine the spotlight on your defense a little bit minor blip in the last minute but 59 minutes of some pretty great football how did they play a nearly perfect game yeah I thought they played great I thought it's been coming because our defense has been playing well you look at the last few games other than a couple of big plays and we eliminated a big place against a very good throwing team I think it was second or third ranked offense of the Big Ten so very pleased how would you describe the additional sort of elements that JT brought to the field tonight I don't know I don't want to be unfair to Cara Dale and I think JT was great JT is a great leader he's a great player and he made those around a better day but it was it was a good team team win waiting for a smile there's a smile so how much fun is it as a coach to be able to spread the wealth offensively like you were tonight oh you always want to get guys touches and I kind of try to watch that you know I'm glad Zeke got 100 yards I'm Mike Thomas got a hundred yards but I try to you know reward the Warriors guys that work real hard for us deserve to touch the ball coach on a night where two unbeatens went down you may not know this but Utah and Florida State both lost and your winning streak continues at 21 how would you describe the chemistry of this team I love these kids they're good people a good coaching staff I just like going to work every day and eight knows a chance code I know that's all it is coach things I almost scripted that for you my are getting to 150 career wins against just 26 losses by far the top active winning percentage and goes to 26 and OH at Ohio State in games October and November back to Heather with JT Barrett all right Chris thanks so much JT describe what it's like to me as a quarterback out here as offense then I just try to do my best to get the ball in my hands get to the playmakers that we have on offense and we executed well offense today which was really good how would you describe how your perspective has changed this week moving from a a red zone specialist to a starter I mean not really I'm you know plagued I was starting quarterback last year so it really wasn't like a big change or anything like that but now just make sure maybe prepare I was preparing well but it mean just a little bit more watching film they were there this and that before the game so I mean nothing really changed Kirk upstairs in the booth and the fourth quarter talked about how this felt like a turning point for this team yes you guys are undefeated but tonight felt different did it feel like a turning point to you and if so how I think it was a turning point for us we've got keep on pressing got keep on going not get comfortable but I think as often as team we could both sides of ball special teams as well so I think it was good team win for us but we know we could get better so that's a good thing about it JT Congrats enjoy it preciate it Heather thank you you know Indiana was a tough opponent for Ohio State they didn't really take the lead for good and until the fourth quarter Maryland I gave up 28 but we've seen shifting gears against Penn State and out Rutgers in the last couple games yeah and you know we've talked so much about JT Barrett and the offense what's getting overlooked I think is the way this defense has been playing and Urban Meyer just made a great point to Heather this Rutgers offense you could say whatever you want about their record they've been scoring points on people almost on every single team they have played tonight they were controlled they had a nice opening drive other than at Ohio State put the clamps down it's because of the way the defensive line is played in the man coverage they play on the outside but to me the reason I feel that this is a turning point isn't just the the forty nine to seven win over Rutgers it's because their guy their leader is back on the field executing this offense and leading this football team and he's providing some abilities to make a lot of plays running and throwing you call it a turning point they go from pretty good sit to really really good yeah still undefeated still on course for the showdown in November against Michigan State and Michigan wrapping her up yeah wrap up the Canon crew only a couple of shots tonight for Rutgers plenty from Ohio State next Saturday 8 o'clock Eastern ABC the Fighting Irish visit Philly an undefeated temple looking forward to that one hope you'll join us for Kirk and Heather and our entire team here in the banks of the rarest and Chris Fowler saying good night from Piscataway the Fort wrapup show coming up now and Robert Flores
