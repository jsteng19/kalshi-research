facing a critical problem children at risk hi I'm ray brown with the San Francisco 49ers brew United Way we've seen programs that work to solve problems that's why we're part of the NFL United Way team bringing all the community resources together to protect all children the NFL the United Way and you the power of teamwork you welcome back to San Francisco California where the 49ers are leading the Saints 1413 we're almost ready to start the third quarter of play this is not the normal score between these teams the last three meetings eighty seven to seven San Francisco but what makes this one different Jerry Rice has not caught a pass in the first half of play it is stunning because it's the first time he's been held without one since 1992 they try to get a couple of them to him but they were a little high yeah just a little high and also I think the Saints have really done an excellent job in the secondary of jumping all the shorter routes I really feel like the 49ers are going to have to try and go down the field a bit more in the second half and create some big plays for themselves rice upset with himself when we could go for a couple of drops one would have been a touchdown thanks to kickoff as we start the second half chuckling be at the 152 the 23 and no further San Francisco will start from there take a look at the first half stats from this ballgame and one of the biggest stats in this game was turnovers five in total San Francisco turned it over three of the first four times the rushing game virtually nonexistent for both teams San Francisco leading in the time of possession that's something they rarely do they score so quickly person Edwards in the eye first and they'll blow the play dead an inauspicious beginning guy earnest snap false start number 66 offense fiveyard penalty first down Kevin Gogan let's go to Solomon wilcott Solomon what do you have Mike the biggest adjustment made by Mike Ditka at halftime is he had it Flair's changed from the smaller 5/8 inch elite to the larger threequarters of an 8inch cleat because the players are slipping so much he's also concerned about the fact that they are fumbling the ball now that lead to only help them keep their footing it won't help them hold on to the ball Mike long lets they put them on their gloves younger that little half roll wide opening yeah totally 81 yards in disgusting that time instead of dropping straight back they walked with a little half roll and it bought him some more time well what a man needs to do is it manages to allow him to get lost right in there he excuse me not there he's over here he's going to wind up going down the field you see him come to the middle he's rolling right now he does a good job of just hanging and heading on up the field that's what happens when you get in this bed to get up you get a hand back outside nobody can quite figure he's the first cover Wade Lindsey the rookie place he'd just for the point answer and he's got it young would belong to touchdown pass of the season and garrison verse 81 yards it's an idea that's been around for a pretty long time at Southwest Airlines we call it friends fly free just buy

San Francisco and Richy set to kick off again that is the quick strike San Francisco offense that people have come to see over the years played four games in a one hammered at the 18 go back to the touchdown show what happens my is this really as a design play what you want to do is you want to get the backside receiver right here which is garrison Hearst he's just going to come on down and lollygag a little bit as young rolls out he closed up the field but watch Sammy Knight fight as young rolls out to the left tonight now bites up now courtesy as soon as her sees him bite up he takes off and turns on the Jets and it's thrown back a long way to the backside in Marty morning wig the offensive coordinator finally gets a big play out of his offense now how will the pain respond Collinson that control final desert and set but the 17 Brian Young you hear you hear so many times about coverage sack it's not taking anything away from Brian Young but this is the coverage sack the quarters downfield Dawkins is covered everybody's covered here comes Cleveland he's covered by the safety McDonald now Brian Young number 97 look at this the blocking is there and look at when Kerry Collins kind of steps up inside Brian Young is there but that is truly a coverage sack who on the night for Bryant young he now has nine and a half commendeth number for defensive tackle not on the load to the outside Cole has it knocked away nice job by Burton Hank the ball hung that is another thing that's been missing from the San Francisco defense is the big plays out of merton Hank he hasn't had the opportunity he's only had one in has had no interceptions up until tonight but you see mcquarters winds up let him go now Hanks this is what he's supposed to do he's supposed to roam and cover out there and make plays like this when Merton Hanks can roll in the middle of the football field from sideline to sideline it's hard to slow the ball downfield consistency time who has been there Pig play guy Andre hates confessions referred wideout good protection again for Terry Collins this one is there for a cross down the ball the second fumble on John talking tonight after a great kick boy heya this was all John Dawkins going after the ball and making the catch because this ball looked like it might have been out of reach Dawkins goes after it and you're absolutely right Michael's the second time then he catches the ball and you've got to put this thing away you got to believe that you're going to get hit that's Norton it hit something would get back there but you've got to believe you're going to get hit he's yet to have the ball in his hands with up with his hand over the point of the ball and tucked up under his armpit he just really has to do a better job of tucking the ball away took turnovers in the game young goes right to look up and 5th at the line of scrimmage was intended for Stokes Wayne marking the veteran defensive tackle got a hand on it now that autumns on the sidelines and boy he's made a couple of outstanding catches but you have to protect the ball that's the shame of it he has done an incredible job getting his hands on the football making plays he's got to realize that he if he's anywhere near a couple of red shirts it's going to be a bunch more getting close second and 10 from the 38 in Berlin peacenickel took them out of bounds Wow you know I'm really disappointed in the quarterback in here now wait a minute just stop for a second Steve Young is if he blocks Mitchell Thoreau is still running three tries a complete does man this is a big old linebacker look at number eight looking on 59 yeah Woking great a lot eating in a piece okay so you got a very little a big just a little piece of little piece of them it's okay Steve I'll defend you don't worry good job Steve first goes out of the striker again Edwards is your single setback fortyniners flicking on offense now young to Edward and her fight for nine almost gets the first out of the ten yard line you know it you know what that punk does every time that Steve Young makes that pump it freezes defensive lineman Joe Johnson is coming in and he's on a rush Steve Young fakes he stops and as soon as he stops it gives blotches on the left of the screen you'll see the pump the linemen stop young steps up delivers their coach Joe Johnson watch this he's going to see Steve Young up can't get to him he goes by they measure for the first down it's across our ESPN first and 10 a gold line and it's right at the 10 it's a real good innovation you know that too when you're at home today it was home that one weekend I was sitting every we know you took a lesson we get on it is really nice to see that line if it isn't pure but it's there these are something to look at play at the nice fake by young got a run for now he's going through the arms of cork put Steve Young gave you the whole large belong that one now the only problem Jose when he bootleg he came out to the doctor collection anybody to throw the ball to they did hurt the Saints did a real good job of not allowing Clark to get there in a hurry you can see Young's looking look and look and now he's got to turn it on but just before he goes out of bound manages to set fling it Clark's got a shot at this thing just gets through his hands second down from the ten first avoided one tackle ball come home and it looked like vork got it back did not hear a whistle before the ball was bumble Chad coal is up there to rip it out and now we have an injury and a timeout they blew this ball down because they brought it back to the eight yard line Joe Johnson 94 is there that he is on the ground garrison Hearst they blow the ball dead it's pulled out but then make any difference

Thursday night at 7:30 mississippi state patrolman today thursday on ESPN after falling behind 10 nothing the 49ers have exploded against the Saints defense courtesy of turnovers and they're up 28 to 13 Wade Richey the rookie from LSU to kick Aaron flavor they could see the back before favorite times in the school take the reverse flag is down so it Clayburgh the 25 will set the marker glance shoulders makes the tackle they're working from ops trip and this will cost them some yardage back inside their own 20 Sean Dawkins has made some spectacular catches tonight and really has been the guy hold on the ball here he does a nice job of missing the reception gets the ball knocked away the 49ers scored after that one great catch here again the ball gets stripped from him the 49ers just scored on that one he's doing a terrific job of getting his hands on the ball he's just got to protect it that they'll have to start from their own 12 they're going to cost behind flavor nice run by Smith 25 49 yard line before he's knocked out of bounds by Merton Hank so for one of the few times tonight a chance to run the ball for New Orleans and they ran it very well on that play but you know we talked to Mike Ditka yesterday about his football team he said look you know what'd he say about the 49ers they're great organization of great football team he said we have to out hit him we have to hit these people now on defense they were hitting him very well in the first half but if you stay on the field a long period of time you're going to get deep last one with the whole thing same play again let me give two boxes of 35 yards I really like that call and Daniel bream which does a good job there so often the coach has a big play and they say okay well they're going to defend it we'll go someplace else he's going to come right back with the stuff that's working for him and he does an excellent job of putting his team in a position to pick up some yards this is what Mike Ditka's talking about his and just watch the fullback number 32 Cramer and you see his block that's what Ditka wants out of his football team just hit some people in your mouth John Jennison blanket away from the South coming out with that he hung in there and through the walls is a boy of death that's awesome that's the top right for Kerry Collins you know why they glue it dance you've got jeopardy yeah because McDonald already hasn't and what white sees is another red shirt going to take a shot at him and all he did there was to try to protect the quarterback McDonald is going to have a piece up right here he's got him wrapped up now do you see Barker coming in when he sees him coming in that's when you blow it and that's a good call it's a nice job by an official protecting the quarterback the way you have to that's what he's going to do if Archer doesn't show up he'll let Terry Collins fight for it three yeah which one tackle dived out to the 36 I can tell you one thing Michael at the end of this game Chris Dolman is going to be the happiest guy this baby's over with that's the quick control is puts him on the ground he cut him on the screen he's been blocking them all evening if Chris is tired and I don't blame you mark Royals is on to punt and RW mcquarters will go back to the 25yard line Broyles led the NFL in the yardage a year ago blokes neck takes it on the hop code for the sideline mcquarters on the run stays in bounds and it lost his footing at the 33 nine yard return at the front of 40 William roll the Pro Bowl offensive tackle 1999's almost here sound early rauch

aerial cam high above 3com Park for ESPN's Sunday Night Football 49ers now with a 15point lead and the ball at their own 32 hurt three Mike San Francisco on offense has really become a threewide football team and the effectiveness of this package works this way you take Stokes rice and Owens you line them up in different configurations as three wideouts means Drake four takes one weary then goes outside to cover and then mold and winds up on rice now here's the problem you have in the slot with rice you can take it out he can take it in he can hook he can go to the post or he can go to the corner and you really have to cover so much of the field and what you wind up with there's a lot of touchdowns out of that formation drop flight hood Paes maybe 6 to the 41yard line a year ago the San Francisco 49ers really got into a quandary because Brent Jones was hurt so much they didn't know whether he played they did in the whether he was healthy we had Jerry Rice back you had Owens and you had Stokes so you wind up in a situation where how do you get your best receivers on the field you start using a lot more three wide and that's really how this whole offense has evolved for Mariucci and it's been an effective one but it really is taking the production to tight end out of play completely for this football thing bird and a yard first first down and more good did he say in there he did not Carrie right through a good blog forum downfield it was a gain of 27 well there are a lot of blocks right at the end of the line of scrimmage including Clark number 85 the tight end you're talking about a tight end not catching the ball very much but what they do ask him to do is to block so they block very well along the line of scrimmage and Hurst get to the outside watch number 80 right there getting the block her steps out there they get him but Jerry Rice is in Jerry Rice there's so many different things he comes off the line now he's got weary he realizes that Garrison's coming up behind him just enough to stay up and create some type of a block another first down for the 49ers you're starting to take this defense apart Edwards is blasted as he got back to the line of scrimmage hit first by Port danau then finished off by Johnson for Jerry Rice one of the biggest problems he's had coming back from the knee surgery has been on one blocking like that his biggest concern is that somebody's going to roll up behind him and hurt his knee again mentally he is fighting through this year and he says each week I get a little bit more comfortable but I'm nowhere near where I want to be now he's hurt the other knee hanging out of Lansford yeah and he had a great play to sit in fighting those monsters in my head young with time going for life lot of contact incomplete the official goes down but there's no flag you know so let's go back to the three wives with this football team and you said something way back about nine or ten weeks ago remember when you go three wide and your third receiver whomever it may be I don't care if he is very good like on this football team here what it does to your defense it puts your third best cover guy or corner on one of their better receive which is exactly what you wind up with with Fred weary trying to cover Jerry Rice and the rookie out of Florida is the guy they have picked on tonight third and ten for consists of young has to step up his pride a run for the first down why he got a good mark from the official on top of the ball and then the two back judges come in and they will mark it back a little bit right you can see he just crossed our yellow line just managed to get cross that line and pick up the first down when you slide they mark the ball at the spot where you start the slide not where you finish it's to give up well when you look at the whole defensive line they overrun him young and he goes up now that's right let's look where he slides and where the ball is that's his where they mark it I think he's got this one neither yep right oh I'm old for two I'm your Oh forever but it doesn't make them stop you are guaranteed to get to the first one wrong every game we've done for 12 years those time in the field goal team third fourth pinch I'll tell you what fourth in addition in your head and your brain use the field goal team and they'll boo you out of this thing okay the other thing to don't don't put it past this 49er ballclub throwing the ball into the end zone to try and get six Harry Kirby comes in he is the only set back they go with three whiteout young quarterback keeper first and flag goes down though the thingthe indicating there was movement by the 49ers what a bonehead plays that would be prior to the snap false start never come before my family that de Fiori the left tackle you know the bad part about this whole thing I mean put the camera on fitori and we look at and Mary she's looking at him it's a little explain to me your tackle this is a quarterback sneak and it's going away from faculty it's going away from you just stand there so now the field goal unit has to come on deprived from 45 Ricci has struggled this year always be better like and officially Lance seven and this is great down the pipe Ricky with the field goal that count grows to 31 what's so hard about winning a free trip to the Super Bowl from Southwest Airlines

next week with the undefeated Denver Broncos Terrell Davis hits to his hometown of San Diego to battle the charger join Joe Theismann Paul McGuire and me right after primetime at 8:15 Eastern there's a flag down on the kickoff even though we didn't have a return there's no holding on a play the ball was dead in the end zone therefore is no infraction result of place a touchback first down I guess you can't have holding if you didn't have no reserve you can have it but it's not gonna count about bravery just thinking about coming out he has two guys we're going to attack life of his own guys those guys are going to tackle them total yards the Saints have been limited to 45 here in the second half and their offense has to pick it up now they're down by HP Kalem got this one out to pull made the catch of the 30 and now they overall it incomplete Darnell Walker was right there with him I was going to say a fool caught that one there is some pimpin sketches made this evening and now you're going to start to see I believe the 49er corners Walker and the quarter really try and jump the routes a lot more there goes pooled he sits down Walker's right in his hip pocket if he doesn't slip down he's got a chance of making a play on it now you see the ball squirted out back into the pen for Terry Taylor they're go up the middle on the running play which will gain them about three yards you know more that's one of those I have two runs yeah perhaps a rare carry you have to do it just to give Collins a little bit of a breather okay he had an axle on first half he has thrown the ball very well he's had three or four receivers fall down had a number of them drop and now we have a player down you know it looks like it's Craver the guy who carried the ball and now they get him to his feet it was kind of interesting talking to Collins just today about this offense Joe you said how difficult is it to learn it when he said you know it really isn't it's kind of a simple wording suspect an offense that I was familiar with when I played it bases everything off of what's called a passing tree from 0 to 9 you number the routes and then you identify each of the receivers with a number and it applies to that particular round it's fairly easy to pick up and he should be fairly proficient in Danny's offense in about fight you know in the five or six weeks that he's had a chance to look at it it will be third and eighth course Danny abramowicz Danny abramowicz you tell me had any number of quarterback like 7 to worklists in Pike Victor took over as head coach of the st. and they bring them all living it sounds good and they completed to Hastings up to the 37 yard line it's enough for a first down for New Orleans all you mentioned the fact that they bring them all with them there well here's Heath Shuler he's here over he's here worth while he's here Collins is here taller is here the spire you see their records very good over 11 and 15 in a total Gary Collins you only one it's 1a no those go Hobart he started the season on IR along with jeweler he never even got the pharmacy hiss and dropped Dawkins had a shot at that one and John Dawkins just looks out of sorts well that's that there was a situation where the ball hits him in the hands and you fight it Kerry Collins again gets it out quick it's a quick post they've had success with the route this one this is one of the easier catches that he had an opportunity to make he's made some real tough ones all night that one just gets away second and 10 4:05 to go third quarter solemn good time is it up for pool can't get it but there's a flag down and Darnell Walker charges the official there's another flag down here on about the 34 yard line in the backfield personal foul unnecessary roughness number 68 often came to the age illegal contact number 38 defense penalties offset replayed it down surely gets the penalty and then Darnell Walker gets the one in the second area and Mike Ditka really upset about the call against this glove he take a look at the one in the secondary it's on Darnell Walker number 38 he just flat runs in the pool as he's trying to go up and make the play the contact was just before that though as tool tried to break up the field and that was right in front of the Saints defense though Mike Ditka had a good look at that one second and 10 from the 37 Collins with a double flood gross this one complete dawkins makes this guess gets out of bound for another first down I asked Kerry Collins yesterday so do you have a feel for any of your receivers yet yes with 25 this Shawn Dawkins exactly Dawkins does a nice job of getting back outside and a terrific job of adjusting to the throw I said Chris Dolman 56 wants to wait for this night to get over with watch William roll it just runs them right there there's no chance to get to the court respect I mean you talk about great hands on a tackle he is terrific jovem number four on the alltime sack was but he's had no success with the rope what a great catch by Cleveland he'll only pick up about three with the rookie from the University of Washington went down to get that one these guys might have had trouble in the first half holding on to the football but they're making some touches in the second after incredible you also noticed too that their footing has been a lot better the complete change that Salomon talked about at halftime has really made a difference for these think wide receivers looks like just about everybody change please decadence seven from the food what straw myth get away and he's buried back at the 41 yard line Jeff Posie number 96 in his way I'll tell you what 78 the backup tackle Shane Bonham is just makes an outstanding play you know you're thinking you see blitz Collins reads bless he sees it coming the bottom has enough smarts to know that this may be a draw play look at number 78 he's going to the quarterback now he reads drawings back inside that's athletic ability he doesn't make the tackle he doesn't have to he's got enough people help him third and eight column one throws backing up Dawkins makes the catch dives forward to the 32 and it looks like he has the first down the one of the 49ers is hurt that's marques Pope who has suffered this year through a bad back playing in the nickel and he went down hard Sean Dawkins and marques Pope they both slept down Dawkins yet that's where Pope you orders me watch Bronzeville you want to see a hit right here you're not out of bounds yet you're going out of bounds Kerry Collins does a nice job of sliding in the pocket the 49ers have decided they want to bring more heat and pressure to him if marques Pope didn't have a bad back before he made this movie he's got one now and he also hurt his knee ouch as part of the risk you run when you go to longer cleats you want to have better footing you want to be able to make moves but if one gets caught it's just not going to come out and it's not going to release and make it easier on any joint whether it be an ankle or in need so the other thing about marques Popa Murray was telling us about his heel one day he's fine he's in the game he's playing in a game and one of the receivers runs by his back goes in the protecta they said they never know what is back to me good or bad coming up next on SportsCenter Dan Patrick and Kenny main the top stories the Vikings against the Packers will have our NFL Blitz and the conversation is with Drew Bledsoe that's all followed by NFL primetime Chris permanent Tom Jackson with all the highlights of all the day's games so Pope comes to the sidelines and RW mcquarters right back in there the rookie from Oklahoma State at the corner and hope very gingerly go to the sideline RW mcquarters what a great college career he had on some bad teams at Oklahoma State columns for the end zone poll panel Walker close on the save the Hudson the Kerry Collins can get this ball up just a heart beat quicker and eventually I think he will as he works with pool a little bit more they've got themselves a touchdown I give Darnell Walker an awful lot of credit he's beat right here Poole doing a good job trying to stay with the ball Walker goes up in between his hands to knock it away and not interfere with him watch where his arm goes right up in between bulls that's a heck of a play he has been with steady is gone in the second area second areas has been burned the losses here becomes another blip Collins unloads and Shawn Dawkins makes the catch the 16 I haven't seen Kerry Collins throw the ball as well since that year in 96 with Caroline well just think about something too on top of it he sat out for four weeks Joe then it was back and he played last week not so bad but when you watch him throw the football tonight this is Kerry Collins had his bet look at this rope down inside no chance late but Dawkins catching the ball he's the only one John Dawkins 7 catches 132 yards does they're both career highs but his two fumbles of a huge in this game too Collins will exchange too long what why he couldn't make up his mind whether to slide or dive and he stayed in between and paid for it right on our goal first in 10 lines should I bet your another try at it Michael why not no you get one shot a game you're always wrong that this no redemption for you leave any seat where is it let me see where it is all right your turn well I'll tell you what they're going to miss this by half the ball now if they made it no they did yep do you think yep you I think you're right I think you're wrong Anna Salai half the ball okay no I'm retired as soon as me no I said I said they didn't make enough well I know I said he is consistent he said they did I'm here down you are Michael Heseltine can I borrow this has been a very impressive Drive for the New Orleans st. this is the 12th play of the drive after it appeared they might be blown out of this game down 18 decadent instance what about quick worked well last time in this situation and it works again you know hits a wonderful Drive the only problem with it fuck's sake I mean it was nine minutes I'm having minutes in this ride well I'm with five minutes and drive you can mean when you're behind against the 49ers as quick as they can score you've got to score in a hurry that's going to be the end of the third quarter Mike Ditka is safe down by 18 but they will have a first and goal at the five when we come back to San Francisco II 1/4 prevent and they sell 99 a court in the game I often get asked what type of investor am i I want answers now if I get the information today I can act upon it I can get the first call report the artists report the vicar's report the Home Depot drops below a particular price I want to be notified if I wanted to buy sell or sell short I just click on the option certainly I'm not the same type of investor I was when I was 30 when I was 40 or when I was 50 I can go on what kind of change do we bust will have the Denver Broncos next week against San Diego trying to become only the fourth team ever to go 12 the no the big story this week is it's been all year the Renaissance of the quarterbacks I mean all those young guys that are playing we're not talking about the record book now Cunningham Vinny Testaverde you know Benny really has found a home with Bill Parcells has married him up to a football team where he's got people to work to inside Randall just throws the ball up in the air so well with to Randy Moss and I think the great decision in Buffalo to name Flutie they're starting for two but whether he yeah whether he's the quarterback of the future not makes no difference they said okay here's your quarter back to the rest of this year turned out to be a pretty good decision I say so first the goal to the thing column quarterback draw walk football and it looks like the Saints got it back but they haven't until yet Roy Barker knocked it loose now that was an odd call Kerry Collins is not the best runner you've ever seen that's why you call it Mike that part of the reason why you just don't expect I think it's pretty a pretty gutsy call by Danny abramowicz he drops back there's nobody there it's just that Brian does an excellent job Brian Young does an excellent job and Roy Barker manages to strip the ball away from couldn't pull the front for the 49ers now second and goal just inside the seven you joined us late the Saints led and nothing the Niners have come roaring back Collins now he'll secret and got inside to five what he wanted to throw finally forced to run and picked up four yards you know I was just sitting here watching the William rope again blocking on Chris Dolman on the outside and the most amazing thing about him what he does he opens up a window look at the window he opens up for college to throw the ball now you the government and he's chasing from the eyes college is way gone don't worry about him you're not going to get him William role in propelling through the great tackles along with Ogden maybe the three best to agreeing third and goal 49ers show blitz and New Orleans moved up front the report on Keith pull a sprained shoulder he may not be back just remember now defense can't force them out crashing number 51 defense they had distance to the goal filter down this is Ken Norton coming up inside thinking like and trying to get the guide the driving offense a guy up he does that they call him they call the defense that's new this year watch Norton he comes up inside now that guard moves valla tell you what I eat Danny will not simulate a snap hey holding if you did Steve going he did like I really did Joe they only did not see him at all now formal one columns under pressure close to high flag down this will be interfere the second time tonight interference in the end zone Lee Woodall was all over Collins and Darnell Walker's going to be called again I think they have to have a conversation touchable that ball was nowhere near catchable and that ball really sailed up and I believe that's what the officials are talking about right now talk it over boys they're the only mistake is the uncorrect admit a k well there's also a fiveyard bump zone and and when you get down this post to the goal line it's really tough to discern where those five yards in there you go this is a huge call there's no infraction on the play back within the first five yards there's no pass interference fourth down obviously that's what it is I mean and this is something Walker's done an excellent job he got an interference call one time before on this you see the contact down here you watch what happens there it is it's within the five yards right around that fiveyard area it's a good job by the officials working together and allowing each other to work at the team the game may be on the line on this play fourth and goal from one and a half nothing shows and Jenna hand up here's the kicking me up saying this is the sensational play by Merton hang in 10th day the 16th play of the drive they come up empty or cheese somebody order a pizza oh I guess it's a pretty typical dorm room stuffs constantly going on hey dude can I borrow underwear we party we study can I borrow some stocks and not we eat we order pizza so it's not like I have a ton of time or money to shop for a car but I heard some pretty good things about Saturn and I figured I'd check out their website it was definitely different I mean I could actually pick out a car play around with options figure out monthly payments avoid a lot of houses I put some deodorant and Brian my sales consultant treated me great looking at the coupe which was also pretty different that was not all do what I can consider in the first time we actually met it was when he stopped by with my coupe hi I'm here with the Saturn somebody order a satyr on weekends the game comes alive app and after days of constant training and careful preparation these weekend warriors are now ready for what lies ahead a 48hour carnival of contact that will challenge the mind/body hem soul forever introducing AT&amp;T PI's and weekend 5 cents a minute Anytime Anywhere what the calls begin it is yes me and Sunday Night Football is brought to you by a PMT is all within your reach by NFL quarterback club99 from the flame sports available on Nintendo 64 by Saturn a different kind of company a different kind of caused by Charles Schwab and by five.com the internet super storm why buy anywhere else the New Orleans Saints just completed a 16 play 79 yard drive it took 7 minutes and 16 seconds off the clock and got you know garrison hurt maybe a yard gang tackled and driven back but the Saints have any a prayer whatsoever to try and make this thing into a fall game they're going to have to stop the 49ers here and get the ball back in a hurry they are down three scores and we just went under 13 minutes talk about tough times for saving your alien the defensive coordinator he was a Christian Armenian growing up in Lebanon he had to wear a red sweater so the Muslims do he is a Christian at the age of nine his family moved to what now he Pete looking from tough neighborhoods during his life Edwards takes it up across the five to about two seven who has a sprained shoulder their big play guy came into this game averaging better than 22 yards of catch and this is a critical down for New Orleans it will be third and five they need to hold as joe said and get the ball back because they need three scores with only 12 10 to go in the game you just got to believe that Jerry Rice becomes a guide to speed Young's going to look at on that patented quick post instead they go to her sonogram and garrison Hearst barely close to the first down Martin fields made to stop right in front of that gold ESPN first and ten line well either that or go to garrison her stone had patented off tackle okay mark fields mark fields does a terrific job here of making the stop they might have picked up the first down but he fills the hole with such great instinct and does a terrific job of just stopping garrison Hearst in his tracks field slides along does a nice job of avoiding the block a dolmens keeping his feet squares up and Fang right there you're not going any further garrison Mike Ditka said sometimes you would be hardpressed to find anybody who plays better at outside linebacker than mark field first again jokes Johnston drags him down this time what would Thanksgiving be without a good old college rivalry join us at 7:30 on Thursday night in state rival Mississippi State and Ole Miss and remembered all begins with college game night Chris Fowler Kurt Herbstreit no Lee Corso will preview the big games of the weekend you know John you're talking about mark fields Mike Ditka says he reminds me a lot of wool Vermont and I asked when he came in the room yesterday is just look that I'm not over marshal nor my juniors al I am mark field young knight point one Steve Young on the keeper directing losses slides in at the 30 gain of 16 in the keeps the clock moving Steve wanted a couple more yards turned the official T today look you know they said not Steve get back there this is what he does to a defense he creates so much of a problem the receivers are come you go and run with a receiver that's fine when Steve Young sees your name going the other way he's going to turn upfield and believe me he's good enough to be able to pick up a lot of yards coming into the game he rushed for 240 to third in the NFL for quarterbacks back to her hit the line of scrimmage nothing there Laroy Glover made the tackle and Steve Young has just become the second NFL quarterback to go over 4,000 yards Randall Cunningham still the leader nearly 4,700 Randall Cunningham has changed his style of play to Randall T Randall very rarely will take off and run with the football you thought a couple times in the game today he really has disciplined himself to stay in the pocket and throw the ball down the field those three big guys he thought when he was younger their returns when he was the best Manning back on the field young to write and Gary Wright had no place to go Drake Burt took him out of bounds young even at age 36 can still run and look at this 20 yard touchdown runs only Earl Campbell has more at that distance Marcus Allen has him tied with six that's remarkable he's going to break those records that one Earl Campbell he'll beat him I mean third and ten Yamamoto right first down and more right does that about at the 48 I guess you can't call it a record because it is not an official specific yeah but what it does is it gives you a perspective of just how good this guy is and how many how well he is it getting in the end zone from a long way out and no matter what time of the ballgame that becomes when he's looking to get rid of the ball could find jarred earth rookie I mean it's amazing you know he he will find that guy in a ball game and rice will be open clock running 804 to dawn again what a defensive line has been tough for the Saints tonight and you know something the San Francisco 49er offensive line really is not I don't believe a one blocking offensive line there are 65 35 pass to run ratio offense and their strong suit is not knocking people off the ball and one other thing and we didn't even mention this tonight going into this ballgame but if you look at the San Francisco 49er offensive line all three of the tackles that are playing tonight are all playing hurt that's why they've been interchanging young over the middle Edwards with the catch to the Saints 45 yard line Vinson Smith out of East Carolina made that stop one thing you're seeing about a Mike Ditka football team no matter what the score is these guys he will not allow them to quit you know and you don't want to go to that sideline and face him or face him in the movies I've always believed that might get to Bill Parcells and Jimmie Johnson are the three men in football today that by their mere presence on the sidelines have the ability to will victory it's gonna be a little tougher for Mike night but he had that kind of ability he can bring that much emotion out of his players third and curse for San Francisco trying to put this game away gross short carried Kirby with a pet struggling to get to the first down marker and he won't make it taken out at the 43 by Chad Cota boy this was an excellent play by Koda and Mark fields because Kirby all he had to do was turn up field and he gets the first down they kept him from getting it Kurt we'll watch this on the catch he catches the ball here look at Cota stops him pushes him back I mean this is a great play by a safety and as fields comes in and finishes them up fortunately way sincerely their second punt of the game will be to kick that Hastings they seemed west ago and it was kicked into the end zone New Orleans will take over at the 20 with 550 Tory to go in the ballgame they are still down by 18 back if we go down to this the new Saab 93 zero to 60 in 6.5 seconds and more importantly back to you

virtually all our own stuff check which sounds better good or good the second gear good thing fortyniners in command 31:13 with 553 to go in the game the Saints have the ball at their own 20 carry Collinses put it up early and often 17 of 36 269 yards trying to scramble look out from behind Jake's attack look at that abandoned us 35 maybe the 36 yard line they're Kerry Collins when I had it I had a chance to sit with him for a long time last night talked to him and said it his heart is in the game he understands he has things to to try and do and prove to really people but I say he is a bull when he runs with the bun and he's played he's played very very well and I think he's going to be the quarterback of the Saints for quite a while Mike Ditka says he is going to be a free agent certainly he expects other students to make offers suppose he thinks we will play that well keep over the middle incomplete almost ineffective in their hips up our front neck person flags are down everywhere Brian Young involved in it well they're going to call Brian young for a clip on the return but boy does he try he's trying to make a play and they're going at it now he's one go probably the winner getting thrown out if he's not careful Mike Ditka is out on the field well if we saw last week things can deteriorate in a hurry I say one thing that's also one of the most disappointing things that Mike talked about was no respect for the game anymore and that's one of the things we started to see a little bit as guys don't understand the traditions and the respect that this game should receive the interception will stand the flags came down well after the pick I would say some after all this is soaked sorted out Zach Bronson this is one of the great interceptions I've seen in a long time you talk about onehanded interception I got the ball going a clip is one thing that really lights players up well what it is it's actually a block below the end of the knees that's not a clip but it's a it's a low block and on change of possessions you can't block below the waist but watch watch this interception I mean this is absolutely magnificent onehanded process right here look at this I got it bring it in roll over protect the ball back up and then the fun begins that's his fourth interception of the year that's Turley Turley got up in in into better inaudible house personal foul low block number 97 during the return then well after this action was over we've got unsportsmanlike conduct number 97 both penalties will be enforced 97 is ejected whoa 30 yards and you may be the best defensive tackle in football and that's certainly what should have happened a week ago when all that action went on with Kansas City there should have been some people thrown out of that game well you like the call you like what they did because the one thing that the officials are doing is the one thing Marty Schottenheimer said about his team you don't do anything to the integrity of this game now this this is happening after the low block so Brian Young got a block below the lacing it looked like he took a punch it's early to 15 yarders and an objection and a fine I'm sure that's coming the only good thing that came out of this whole thing is San Francisco has the ball but I like this move by the officials I think you have cleaned it I agree with you guys I think it should have been done in the Monday night game and it wasn't as young leaves there's only 507 to go on the clock so San Francisco now can try to protect that lead Steve Youngman started so poorly was throwing the ball high and wide of everybody really came on in the second half that was about five minutes ago in the first half he really started delighting everybody up got it out to the 45 and another flag is down Kevin Gaughan puts his hands up and says who me so disease and Grogan said give it to geez holding number 40 half the distance still first down it wasn't even there but was Fred Beasley the rookie pullback you know it's kind of amazing about Brian Young clipping and blocking below the waist how much defensive lineman complain about getting bit below the waist how much they want to protect their legs yeah but I can tell you something and you when an interception is had and you're on offense defensive line or the first one to come and find not yet how do they fall apart it's perfect first hit the backfield and clutched at the five the NFL's best pregame show sunday NFL countdown every week at 11 a.m. a tree during press permit in the Faculty of Bristol

comeback for the 49ers tonight down nothing early now they're up by 18 the Tom's trying to get a look gets away from the gold with only a few times Solman has provided any pressure tonight this is the time in a football game when you really get a chance to post some numbers if you're a defensive lineman you know what teams going to have to throw the football even going to somebody all day now you get a little health because the linebacker steps up maybe you get the edge on a guy only Kevin Green has had more sacks than Dolman after his 30th birthday and Zollman number for all time but rope has done a tremendous job on him again tonight Collins flips and steps up and throws complete for about eight yards as Merton tanks makes the tackle on Brett Besh wellö for over the last three hours we enrolled at Crystal going at each other and I can assure you that roll wins the battle third and short for count trying to keep the drive alive and throws complete down to the 42 yard line this time to can Cleveland clock continues to move under three minutes Darlins under pressure this time gets it to Cleveland at the 25yard line Kerry cargo jacket Dawkins Kerry Collins has done a real nice job of just hanging in the pocket he's had a good feel for when he has to flush out and go make the play or when he wants to sit in that pocket and try and fire the ball down the field thrown for over 300 yards can I hit 20 of 40 so this one off his back foot and incomplete the quarters with good coverage there well I said before all night long William Rolfe and crystal Minh have been going at it the first game Roman had four sacks well physically well look at his hands and his feet movement he's got such terrific hands that was to the face but Dolan has had a major problem and then they get down on the goal line and he not only blocks the defensive linemen but he blocked his own guard and open up the hole second and 10 with 209 to go in the game Collins was plenty of time throws complete out in the flat to Craver take a look at the numbers in the rope and Dolman battle 48 of 56 plays they have gone headtohead they've run behind rule 4 times 7 pressures the sack was when he chased Kerry Collins out of bounds behind the line of scrimmage and I think nearly was just on but the first game that he had four sacks none of them were attributed caught the roll Danny Wuerffel is also the quarterback to the Saints to that game again he doesn't move to wake Carrie Thompson 3rd and 2 for the wall sawing close the app hinting get it down near the 2 yard line as we hit the twominute

Bledsoe asked questions to give answers in the funding conversation any main Dan Patrick SportsCenter after the game 155 to go from San Francisco New Orleans first and goal with the two but they're down by 18 they still need three floors column sidearms that knock down and nearly pick by hey Burton hangs has picked his fuss tonight to make big plays one in an interception knocked the ball down created a problem in the throwing lane just before on that 16 play drive when New Orleans drove down the field all he's doing is keeping an eye on Kerry Collins I when Kerry makes the delivery he reaches up that's one he thought he could have had merton Hanks who did not have an interception before tonight nearly had his second of the game now go what they hand off to the goal line Craver did not get in well one thing about Merton hanks go to yester Friday when we talked to him he was telling us you know with the change of the coroner's on this football team and here is a veteran he was so concerned about what these guys were doing he was trying to help out everywhere making plays for other people instead of doing his own job he said it's going to be different now braver from an inch away touchdown Saint now are they going to go for two are they sending on the extra point unit two touchdowns and two twopoint conversions would get them within a field goal look at this they go to the right side for the touchdown they only in Clarence Jones they just bury people just at me and this is what your offensive lineman has do just clear a little bit of a hole you only had to go about a half a yard and that had to surprise in a little bit that they need to run behind right flying to the point after and he's got it 31 to 20 Dalton just shaking his head Steve Mariucci after one year as the head coach at California comes to the 49ers and now he has tied John Madden with a win tonight for the most consecutive home runs to start a career this would be 13 in a row at home but I still think he has to be concerned about where his football team is I don't necessarily believe that he would he was looking for some answers tonight I don't believe that they have been answered I still think his football team lacks the kind of confidence and the swagger that they've had and we've come to know the 49ers to have when you look at their remaining schedule there's a real good chance that they'll have a chance to run the table but they're going to have to play a lot better if they want to go anywhere in the playoffs well the people out here in the Bay Area have been quick to criticize this franchisors looking at some of the letters to the editor and one of the local papers this weekend and one guy wrote that Steve Young is the worst bigtime quarterback in the NFL that the franchise has seen its death knell since they lost to the Atlanta Falcons I think the burial was a little premature I do too but also there will be some changes in all likelihood you know Dwight Clark may not remain the general manager there's a good chance that he might move on who's going to be running in the front office you know what is the future of the 49ers is really up in the air as a team and the future of a new stadium in a Super Bowl here as well st. we'll go for the onside kick Harry Kirby got a hand on it they blown the play dead well that's because they kicked the B motor whistle me just practice it go practice on it I'd say what Oh mr. Kirby would have caught that ball it was touchdown and they'll line up and do it again the Saints can't touch it until it goes ten yards the 49ers can touch it anywhere and Doug Brian will try it again popsicle a plain creepy again Gary cookies very what Brian is supposed to deal with this ball video on us including Google but is popping up in the air so that your teams can go down and trying to catch the ball in midair but quite not once but twice he kicks the ball perfectly that carving look is it the ball is he get up in the air it hits the ground Kirby knocked it down almost has a system he got the first one you'd think he would be aware of it and here goes Kirby it was out of bounds at the 4 yard line but he almost has a touchdown that was like a fast break when he played basketball at Virginia no clothes was they didn't let you tackle on the hardwood going to be first and goal and here comes another penalty flag down even before we get applied he had a chance to look at that thing once and once he got his sights on it just figured why not all brake on it and see if I can make the play but one of the things about to play though at Kirby knew he had all these guys behind them so it didn't make any difference and when Brian didn't when we pop that ball you've got to really drive it into the ground so the ball popped way up in here he just almost like a pooch kick hardly even hit it you've got to get your guys down ten yards give them a chance to get that far no flag get the yellow piece of paper on on the field first and goal garrison hurt to the one which means the TV on is looking at my dentist and still call timeout for uptodate or Stansted analysis on all the NFL action log on to espn.com and remember fans only one more week to cast your ballot for the Pro Bowl log onto nfl.com and vote after tonight's game and Steve Young will take the name that's it before the play though Steve look over at my distance and look at don't call timeout I'm going to take a knee I promise you if in fact looked at as a okay on the Kong and if we hadn't done it my Fit field would have come after probably Gary Collins will leave with the loss but an outstanding performance for the New Orleans Saints and Steve Young after a slow start Ward back and San Francisco wins it 30 1 to 20 big night for Merton Hank he played exceptionally well our final for San Francisco 31 Orland 20 coming up next for senators and Jenny Maine that complete wrapup of the day in sport for Joe Tyson Paul McGuire founded all kinds of our entire ESPN crew this is my Patrick that night from San Francisco this has been a presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports the SDN thanks you for watching this presentation
