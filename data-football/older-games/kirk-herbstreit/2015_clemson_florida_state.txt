Announcer: Kirk Herbstreit
============================================================

temp since Death Valley is alive this is the game of the year in the ACC and a game of huge playoff importance Clemson ranked first in the first selection committee rankings of the season trying to dethrone the Seminoles and win the ACC Atlantic Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit and the Seminoles take the field Kirk for the first time in two careers and probably the last as doubledigit underdogs and they do feel disrespected by all of it this there's no doubt about it you just feel being on the field before the game this Florida State team I'll be shocked if they don't play their best game today as far as the energy is concerned here's Clemson number one ranked team as you said in our first react rankings with with this newfound pressure for them but with the leadership that they have led by the Shawn Watson and their head coach Dabo Sweeney I don't think it's too much for him and we'll find out here after this 60 minutes of football for the Noles Shawn Maguire replaced the suspended Jameis Winston beat the Tigers a year ago he replaced the concussed Everett Golson last week the golson's back and healthy which left Jimbo Fisher with an interesting decision to Twitter if he isn't yet officially announced yeah and he made it very clear to us this has nothing to do with health he's decided to go with Shawn the choirs his starter today the fire comes in off of a big game last week and his first start of the year didn't complain that's the thing that's the president he makes great decisions that's the big reason he's starting and the big play ability which could be on display today as they try to get the ball pushed down field against this very talented Clemson defense and then you have the intangibles a guy that can get on the road and try to keep everybody calm and poised because in this adversity in Death Valley you need a quarterback remember he has his third lot of games but he has four years of being in the system which could be big for them in his day good news for it looks like Galvan cooks gonna be okay at least to start he's at an action missed last week is that hamstring problems for weeks seems okay number four for Clemson though is the key for the Tigers it's been amazing to watch this John watts in the last month Bobby you can make an argument there's nobody playing better at that position in the country as far as again having the command it's an offense that he ran in high school and I think because of that he's not slow he's processing defenses quickly he's a threat running which you'll see today he's obviously a threat throwing and the big thing that I love is he's staying out of the bad play you ever run to the left almost said they're blitzing from left he's going to get out of that and finding a pass that he likes better so making good decisions avoiding back plays which he better do against a very very aggressive Florida State defense that Valley on his feet is a very special moment for Clemson they touched Howard's right Hill as the number one ranked team for the first time in clips in history then the head coach sprinting relevant less impressive I don't know if he ran that fast as a player in Alabama before the goal line to the 40 we should got a clock on that he says it's another game doesn't feel like it cleansing and Florida State fights the division title and whole lot more coming up you and welcome back to ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers in this presentation of the SEC on ESPN the conference gave of the year a soggy start so far the rain has stayed away see if that was sweetie has caught his breath after that sprint he's with Heather Cox Curt thanks so much coach in a week dominated by talk of rankings of talk of being number one how have you been able to keep your team's focus where you want it to be just do what we do we don't change anything you know we all know that that know that stuff means anything you thought about how you play each and every week so our folks have been all trying to get ready for a great loss 18 what do you see is the biggest challenge for your quarterback deshaun Watson today he's just I mean they're going against the great defense got to make good decisions we just got to do what we do and do it together that's all it's all about thank you enjoy this is impressive speed they watch this and you talk about being fired up to play you got to be careful down the hill it's slippery on her wet demonym technique it's now you cranked it from there we gotta get him and Matt rule some kind of contest after the season Jimbo Fisher meanwhile didn't talk a lot about the disrespect underdog role but his players we're talking about it with me this week ten and a half point underdogs against the team they beat in the last three years and until you beat the champs in this division you can't you can't call yourselves the top dog well emotionally no matter what's being said by the coaches the reality is you come out in front of 80,000 people and you can feel it the Florida State players were kind of looking up at the crowd kind of like okay bring it on bring it on the roles are reversed the psychological aspect of the game will see how both of them handle it throughout this game Tigers won that's awesome deferred so Florida State and Shawn Maguire will get the football first Emin alaikum to boot it away for the Tigers Sherman Whitfield and Jalen Ramsay who wears Charlie Ward's ol number 72 return kicks back deep for Florida State Tigers have been vulnerable allowing to 100 yard kickoff returns for touchdowns this season wake up spook Max Whitfield up then it'll be a touchback so Shawn Maguire comes out he's from New Jersey he's a junior this is his third career start he's got a strong arm Kirk he can operate this pro style offense the way Fisher wants him to yeah he's coming off a game last week where he played outstanding 21 a 39 no just distant commands felt really good about it I gotta tell you Chris I'm so impressed with how he handled a situation written here throughout all that Jameis Winston stuff kept his mouth shut funny now it shot at being the guy loses it to a transfer never Golson doesn't say food just keeps grinding and working finds himself now in the starting lineup when it matters most will they get protection from the offensive line that's very young banged up and has been shaky on the road Dalvin cook good news for the Knowles starting at tailback I'm gonna round this is a Winfield on the pitch and the Tigers closing down no game the energy of this stadium right now as you can see Jimbo trying to trying to get wide to outflank the Clemson defense but Shaq Lawson who's having a monster year number 90 and Mackenzie Alexander right there to force him back into the teeth of the defense flag priest Memphis cook takes off breaks attack when his off and running Dalvin cook headed for the end zone but a flag came down before the ball was snapped he is going to score now I will check the marker because the only thing I can think of is maybe Clemson lined up offsides Wow 75 yards for cook if it stands what to see if his form if it's not a formation another flag down here after the play what start for Florida State this is Dan that's what you're saying in the open so much talk about the quarterbacks but how about seeing a healthy number for back to the lineup I didn't Clemson lined up offsides side defense result of playing is a touchdown TJ the new zone missed the tackle Florida State as they did a couple of years ago when Winston was the quarterback silencing this crowd there was a point two years ago when they came in here the first play from Jameis Winston to Kelvin Benjamin up in the air and now they come in and Dalvin cook deserves a lot of the credit but Chris I got to tell you that offense a line with four new starters what a job of opening up that whole longest play from scrimmage against this excellent Tigers defense all season Roberto Aguayo makes it 181 for 181 in his career Poinsett two touchdown watch this offense align left' guards gonna get a nice little block here but really it's the centers block hotel that gets up to the linebacker that's what opens this thing up and once the opens up right there look at that stiff arm right in the hole TJ crane you mentioned he came up and runs support but that's the Dalvin cook the strength of Dalvin cook at 202 pounds nice good look at it slow there's the linebacker trying to make the play on it Goodson nice block by the fullback as well Freddie Stevenson so they gave him eight or ten yards on his own but that stiff arm is lethal as the safety Green tried to come up and make that tackle little wonder why he is number one among power five running backs in yards after contact gives about 70 yards after contact there that's what makes Jimbo Fisher's offense so dangerous again the quarterbacks are always going to get the attention that's a great look at a guy had to sit out last week because of an ankle left ankle and a left Amy that's been reoccurring for him but right out of the case Jimbo Fisher showing people that it's not always about the quarterback for him it starts with that offensive line and the running of Dalvin cook and they get off to a huge start here in Death Valley because of the penalty after the touchdown wild it booted away from midfield wouldn't bet when they kickoff return here he's gonna pooch it short give the coverage team a chance to run down there but it's a touchback all right so 45 seconds into the game it's the rear opposite of what happened when DeSean watch to get off to the great start against Notre Dame here the other big home game yeah and we said and I really feel this I know trevone Boykin at ECU is playing great football but deshaun Watson is just a guy that's in command is very intelligent prepares like he's one of the assistant coaches so very familiar with each defense that he faces his feet today against this Florida State defense he's going to carry it probably 15 times he's gonna have to be a factor in the run game to open up the passing game that they want to try to put on the nose first play of the hen it's of Wayne Gulman the physical running back he's approaching a thousand yards and a terrific season he's emerged as the workhorse gets about ten and he is he is really the key to giving this defense from Florida State a reminder that as much as the Shaw Watson makes plays the physicality between the tackles with number nine is really what makes defenses have to respect that at that aspect and it opens up everything else Domon to the far left of the formation the ball Patek complete so coming in that was the rangy defensive end DeMarcus Walker that's his third on the year we did their Florida State Miami game and I remember you and I talking during the game and even after the game it even this week that's become the new thing with defensive lineman athletic defensive lineman with tempo offenses and balls that are getting out fast you can't get a sack so the next best thing is to get up in the air and batam down Domon one second along a short gain and the Noles have a whole bunch of talented offensive linemen who were tall with very long arms now locate a man they sure do you know I think a guy that gets most of the attention is 99 Nile Laurence Stanfill but they get you up first and second down you'll see 9091 who made a big play there Newberry Walker they're all very very active so this play called collaborative for Clemson has a choice to make on 3rd and 9 here's the pressure the notes are going to try to get on the on the perimeter Nate Andrews on one side and chops wet on the other Watson downfield where she wrote peek through it over his head so the Tigers get one first down but now we have to punt you say that they'll give you looks on third down and you have to figure out is Andrews coming or is he gonna drop he ends up dropping here is he gonna come is he gonna come is the food's gonna come and who's gonna drop at the snap of the ball you can see they're trying to disguise some things affect the offensive lineman into protection especially on third down and try to affect the rhythm of the shot Watson and et's doll to punt Bobo Wilson is the returner for the Noel's it's a high kick and Wilson backpedals and calls for a fair catch at the 22 yard line early fireworks and Florida State of wire and the Noles toward on the foot touchdown you this election committee which includes Dan matakovich pumps an ad and the former Clemson player Bobby Johnson of course they were excused in the road when the committee made claims that is the number one team in the first rankings said his team practice well there was no loss of focus but they are behind seven points the more immediate goal is you got to try to win your division in the ECC in the Florida State Clemson winner has won at six three years as the flight sign brought to you by climax illustrates the last three years that has been Florida State one play and Dalvin cook went 75 for a touchdown so here's McGuire's first pass attempt and it's a misfire looking for Bubba Wilson thumbprint Venables the defensive coordinator from from Clemson especially after that opening drive I already knew coming in but there is right there now I really know okay Shawn Maguire starting every goal send the mobility is not there we've got to put the game on his shoulders we've got to put numbers in the line of scrimmage to take away number four and makes Shawn Maguire beat us by throwing the ball Center steps in the holes on the money again tell the truck to the forty to midfield took the second huge play he looks healthy and he looks inspired today watch the left tackle Johnson and lavet II watch the doubleteam right here which opens it and then you've got a couple guys pulling around a counter play but it starts with that double team right there they they kind of pinch it down that creates the opening and number four Dalvin cook doesn't need a lot of room to be able to squirm through there and then hit that acceleration button and before you know it he's to the third level running by people who carries 111 yards for cook Evans trying to figure out what that happen come on Brett we got to figure out a way to stop him they can stop momentarily kajak was Patrick the talented freshman spelling cook to McGuire in the pocket delivers a strike down field and the catch is made then that's Travis Rudolph coming off a monster game last week with three touchdowns right now the Clemson safeties are lost Jevon Kearse a junior from Fort Myers Florida really wants to play in this game watch him come into the game right here he runs into one of his own defenders blanks and a playaction call after successful runs you're getting the safeties and linebackers now they're determined determined to stop cook what a time by Jimbo Fisher to get the ball thrown over top of them with a playaction pass it's a first intent handoff to juk West Patrick the tutors 35pound true freshman out of Orlando who rolled for a hundred sixtytwo and three touchdowns when cooks set out last week against the orange what a great compliment and is important for him to get those reps he wonder how it cooked had to have gone last week if Clemson was last week could he have gone and by allowing him to play against Syracuse a team they probably felt pretty comfortable they could handle it gets him reps and he gets him ready to come in and compliment Dalvin cook and give him a few carries it takes some of the workload off at Alvin cook Jonathan Vickers in the 26 joining a cook in the backfield on a second and seven McGuire flips it a lateral to cook it swell strong out and alas since Clinton who creates a negative play Vijay Goodson the middle linebacker was their first they'll try to find any way they can get the ball out to cook running or throwing but I don't know how many times I heard Clemson's coaches this week talking about leverage the football especially when Dalvin cook has that leverage the football means you want to see four or five orange jerseys surrounding him and not allowing him to be able to get through that was the first time we've seen that so far in this game Tigers at the best third down defense in the country opponents can work just 21% the Noles need 10 their first third down in the early stages here the clock winding down at one when McGuire gets the snap backpedals fires downfield interception Adrien Baker put the pic at the 5yard line as McGuire mixer makes the mistake under pressure I'll tell you what Chris he kind of threw that up and hope and I'm gonna tell you Baker deserves a lot of credit to sophomore I think he confused McGuire he actually looked like he was going to go to the inside on one of the inside receivers and McGuire that's who he saw the last second he thought he saw his receiver open but Baker came off of Travis Rudolph and then went back out to the outside to take away the potential threat of Kermit Whitfield it's a really good job of baiting McGuire they're on third down by the sophomore from Florida only the Noles third turnover this season the offense only has two of them so does the defense reeling but does get the take away and the offense takes over backed up with their fiveyard line in first down gain of three his Randy Sanders visiting with Maguire he's still a little bit prone to mistakes like that he's still inexperienced oh yeah I mean the one thing he brings in his experience within this system but obviously I'm his only other start other than last week was against Clemson at home so he's still a young guy as far as the speed of the game is concerned effect it's a common and near side completion appear who wrestles across the 20yard line still fighting it has a Clemson first down operation for Watson Curt Chris McLaughlin the time about ball fake here's the ball fake watch this linebacker right here when he sees a ball fake he steps up which creates a nice throwing Lane right there makes it a much easier throw completion far side are Tavis Scott leading receiver in this team only a short game tackle by Marquess Waits I think a big part of Clemson and how they have to attack Florida State he is tempo tempo tempo tempo the reason they want to go tempo number one they have a quarterback they can handle tempo and number two you want to get Florida State's aggressive defense on its heels as opposed to being aggressive themselves empty backfield loans bringing pressure on second late note we throw an opportunity his second leg it too tight him was running free and what some would love to have that throw back they're gonna have to go back to that because the Florida State safeties are splint meaning the middle of the field for vertical throws is wide open and Leggett has ability as an athlete to be able to get down the field at 6'5 255 pounds he can get down there in a hurry he was open to Shawn Watson just missed him third down again Muhsin plus it'll be hard to fight for young against the snow his defense he's hit on the bounds of flag Jalen Ramsey pressured the quarterback and game comes in a gift it was going to be a fourth down instead it'll be first down now to kind of keep you had to keep your motions in check jaelyn Ramsay plays on an edge with emotion early in this game he's been wanting to hit the Shawn Watson for five days he finally gets a chance that he thinks he's in bounds and if you go super super slow you could say oh boy he was still in bounds but the push and extension through the sidelines is a right call that time officials right on in top of that he was running out of bounds he had given up on the play Jalen Ramsey's got to know better than that I agree though he he made contact at the sidelines it was the aggressions of the show yeah on first down Gulman hammer straight ahead this power running London's been a puzzle surprise to everybody here at new that could throw the ball yeah but on the ads with Gulman has been a huge part this year yeah and I think it's just a difference in them as a team it's they always had Sammy Watkins and guys who were explosive but now I think they're much more confident with the offensive line and gone in the middle and also Watson running to shortgame marital set up third in short he's a running ethics had to learn to be content with just taking the basis I go to the home on all the time but very workman like very sturdy got good enough speed and the fact that he said his second year in this system I think that really helps him get a good feel and makes the vision and the cuts that much easier for him we'll see if he gets the ball here on third down remember Watson's a factor of the run game has not yet pulled it on his own ring off the zone leaders slow completion are they first down at midfield that was light at the tight end blanket a guide that has got six touchdowns this year most on the team then that's a very high number for for tight ends around the country so far this year shares the lead in FPS with three other guys on first down Watson pressure cannot escape drop by Derrick naughty and Niall Lawrence tample the two tackles combining on the sack there well it really starts his well Christmas with Jacob hue who's going to come right here as long he forces him up into the pocket and he's gonna deal with pressure coming off the edge a lot the done in his football game because Florida State's that's a real strength of theirs but not he's able to get in there and contribute as well and a very very athletic front will be the biggest most athletic front Clemson seen all year they've been a very good protecting offensive line just the 13 South allowed and now on long distance it's golden breaking free just tripped up has a terrific tackle by LA Marcus Brutus are gone the one who got in a hole ones warm he got out into the open and looked like he had a chance to be able to make a big play but again this Florida State defense swarming to the ball Clemson's going tempo here it's big third down trying to sustain this Drive Zach Brooks number 24 was in the ball game in the backfield you see that class in that hurry up all he's trying to do is get the defense to have an indicator show their tip their hands so to speak in their coverage and now he's got a better feel of what to expect but sure again Watson cannot escape gets back to the line of scrimmage Jalen Ramsey came flying in from the corner and sue Shaq's in that series stalls the clemson dr charles kelley mixing it up right here's Jalen Ramsey Brooks will pick him up and it frees up few untouched I knew these the offensive line would be challenged the right tackle that time Joe Gore he didn't block anybody he came down and he had to Florida State defenders to his right one goes free and the others just by the running back it's a faith the flag is down as the Tigers head the ball running around the edge TJ green not that far aside who do convert on the face shade to the old pot ruski that the nose spraying here double check DeMarco Dabo furious 21 player said that one's on you so the fake they worked a lot on and felt confident in there's five guys back there yeah ain't that an illegal formation and something that it wasn't even really close it wasn't as if there was one of them that was a yard or two off the line of scrimmage they were they were all I want to say almost four or five yards all back deep into the into the back field just a miscommunication on the Clemson side so listen back to receive the punt Fruities doll getting shot no fair catch it he takes his shot immediately line down and coverage $2 Johnson Seminoles still up 7 you ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers who would like to remind you that right now it's engagement season Walmart get ideas for your gametime party at walmart.com slash gametime recipes at the 2016 Ford Explorer be unstoppable we kept tremendous excitement here Clemson and a half hour ago Death Valley was pure pandemonium there's a hush in here now the dr. pepper championship drive game of the week thanks to Dalvin cook around 75 yards the Seminoles in case you joined us to fit late now to the fakely reception Tigers gained 43 in flip field position so McGuire's third possession begins from the 13 yard line why not try clicked again Tyga's this time get twit penetration and he's knocked down after no game Christian Wilkins the true freshman yeah the true freshman at six for 250 there 315 pounds has such quickness as an ability to shoot the gaps and that's what he did there the coaches I remember when we had them earlier this year against Notre Dame and at the time they did not have DJ reader who is now back they talked about Wilkins being such a big factor on that defensive line never they lost their entire front 7 to the NFL so they have a lot of new faces up there Wilkins has emerged as a goto guy if it was young look again on second intends has the middle and slips down after a short gain of Goodson involved in the tackle Dallben of course came in with that question how would the ankle what the hamstring hold up throughout this game explosion on his first carry Shaq Lawson bigtime player for Clemson is down which is never a good sign he's the sack leader sixandahalf this season 14 and a half tackles for loss on the left side number 90 here number nine he just kind of lowers his his head there to take on a block he's up right away I don't know what that might have been but he was in pretty severe pain there arrived in the ability Kirk of this field to take heavy rain it's been raining here for a few days it looks aokay but you can tell the traction he's a little bit an issue down the pit it is because when I was out there and it hasn't rained for the last hour so but the field is it's holding the rain as far as moisture but it's slick very slick on these Claire and you make a cut that's something that I think could become a problem story especially a defensive back busting client number 91 replacing Lawson on this third and eighth the noise is bad once this shows heavy pressure and brings it mcguire gets the ball away Luke's it downfield it was some pushing and shoving but Wilson wanted a flag and there isn't one walk down you know McKenzie Alexander number two it's most of the recognition but but Baker had an interception earlier Tankersley here in coverage Brent Venables mixing up the looks disguising brings the pressure late Green all those gets home forces to throw out early before McGwire probably wanted to get rid of it so they get home and get to pressure but great coverage and good ball awareness like contrary Tankersley baby at his goal line is the Tigers force first three and out very good defense of doing that this season hunter Renfro the scrappy little former walkon slot receiver dependable punt returner makes a fair catch Tigers have good field position but the Seminoles Zil up by a touchdown more scoring to come there no down seven nothing here we'll get a report momentarily from Heather when the shack Lawson's condition as they get the screwdriver out and then they've got a couple guys down there's a drop far side trying to get it two legged never what's the latest down there well it is a right shoulder injury for Shaq loss and what they're doing is trying to tighten up that brace that was a brace he was wearing before but right now he's got a team of thousands working on it to tighten it up shock looking very patient whereas they get the screwdrivers out and try to try to tighten it meanwhile Thompson so line without Tyrone Crowder he has a little injury back up maverick maverick Morris is in in gone and nowhere to run it'll be third and long as Terrence Smith who returns to the line of the dolls number 24 backs of veteran chosen 11 now in Northrup and Hoskins have done a really good job reg Northrup would have started alongside Smith but Smith says went out October 3rd and has recovered nicely you could see the quickness that he brings to that second level this Florida State defense Knowles runs foreign third down watson fires near side why they make the caches I tell you this Scott in mark fleshlight was in coverage in there were a couple of flags it'll be a good battle over there yep the focus goes on Ramsey's and rains you have the best team in the quarters in the country yeah then you have Rams here to the boundary and here you've got it just grabs onto it right at the end they're back shoulders fro tough to adjust actually gets a hold of the jersey that's a great look at it right there that's why you saw Tavia Scott come up so emotional looking for the call from the official he didn't see it from that was the call was coming in from behind but white is a big long athletic guy but Ramsey into the boundary is somebody they want to try to avoid for the most part so two major penalties on the Noles corners big so far in the red zone watch the safeties you'll see him separate see him separate opens up the middle of the field we talked about it earlier they had it they missed it they go back to it and they'll continue to go back to it if the middle of the field will be open the Miami game you saw a lot of the same approach trying to attack the middle of the Noles defense 25yard game there and now Golemon trying to get the left edge Leggett is the guy comes from the bar Florida that's in the Panhandle that's Florida State's backyard they only offered him a scholarship that day after Clemson bits he said I'm gonna go with the Tigers they were loyal to me but he is inspired today like it oh yeah it's it's fun to why you go down the roster of the of the Clemson team especially the skill guys there are a lot of Florida guys on there they're going unbalanced left now they're going a little bit of a new wrinkle now they're going unbalanced right here two receivers into the boundary we Watson as they move the pocket quite often it's nowhere to go good job by the Knowles defense not buying into all that presnap stuff there was a lot a lot of stuff going on there and they're just trying to affect the eyes anything you can do to slow down an athletic aggressive defense one of the ways to do that is a lot of window dressing meaning formations personnel groupings different looks pre snap movement to make them have to look to each other to communicate that that can slow a team down at that time get floor to stake frediting grapes but they're a great position to make a play 5 receiver look gone into the top of the formation on third and six late pressure ball batted down a game at the line of scrimmage Hyannis to Marcus Walker it's his fourth of the year the second today okay you can't get home you can't get the Blitz you can't get blockers Watson's getting the ball out of his hands fast so you're athletic you go up you time it up and you knock it down that's to me just as effective as a sack or a quarterback hurry what a big defensive lineman has the athletic ability to time it up and knock that football right back into the face of the quarterback Brett Google's a walkon has been very reliable ten for ten field goals in ACC games need nine for ten inside 40 this from 31 yards to get the Tigers on the board did he not see through so touch soon a 44 yard drive cuts the Florida State lead to 7 3 you just because you're on the go doesn't mean you have to miss any of ESPN's college football action you can stream every game live with the watch ESPN app just downloaded or go to watch espn.com so the Seminoles struck quickly at Alvin cooks 75 yard touchdown run Funston trying to stabilize its defense they got to take away down to their own fiveyard line and now they have some points with the short field goal defense get out a little bit of a sleepy start against NC State last week and then got involved in a shootout venimos says that was a dose of humility for this defense which is number one in a lot of crucial categories in Africa touch back the holes of the 25 tonight on ABC we'll see Hotel jones responds a starting quarterback Jake see Barrett of course suspended after being cited the golfers come to Columbus eight o'clock on ABC everybody anxious to see Cardale Jones in for JT Barrett see how he plays tonight at home against Minnesota and what it does to next week where they play Illinois he cut his lights out wasn't what do you do you save her back to a quarterback to seasoning Columbus with about the third or fourth time the creek be he the quad now back in it miss buns of steel fences responded a bit the offenses produce three points McGuire backpedals and flicks in short Cook has a blocker on the eggs and doesn't need much space able to pick up about five before Goodson forces amount remember we talked about after the long run by Dalvin cook Brent Venables adjustment I'm sure his communication what he's saying to these linebackers and safeties is guys we've got to do a good job of keeping our eyes on Dalvin cook we want to see we want to see if Sean Maguire since he's the guy in forever Golson did he make these decisions consistently and avoid the disastrous play they've got it was fun a turnover but they want to put the game in his hands if they can't have to make plays it's a Johnny delivers downfield get on one coverage and it's over the head before Kermit Whitfield and it's hard to beat Mackenzie Alexander the lock down corner and how excited is he to get a chance to be left on an island and make plays you know they do this to the inside you see him playing then Nickelback and what a great matchup that is with Whitfield with that speed against Mackenzie Alexander Mackenzie a wrestler in high school and a tough guy from the gannett state of Florida the scouts look at guys they're looking for weaknesses looking for flaws they don't find many in this guy's game like I said he's backed into the inside now Shaq lost it back from that shoulder injury trying to get pressure he's actually right down here 36 rush your cones McGuire gets it away incomplete and a flag comes in Whitfield was defended that time by Alexander really flag came in little too aggressive that time they moved him in to over that slop receiver a Kermit Whitfield because of the athletic billions speed they want that matchup he's okay there then he craps on that that's that's where he had a problem he was a great position there in the early part of the route but when Whitfield matey's cut to the inside a lot with that right arm and prevented him from getting to his five demos when he's fired up about it he's screaming at the official who threw the flag from a long way he'd seen his Malinois for getting new too close to the field emotions boiling over here see Shaq lost despite that shoulders still getting pressure there and you're not gonna see it there wasn't it that was that he was early at the top of the route when he made his move to the inside cook as a crease Dalvin cook nice again in the Clemson territory to the 40 before Travis blanks knocked him down low center of gravity it's another counter play where he's going to follow his his fullback this time Freddie Stevenson the right guard actually pulls around Wilson Bell low skinflint that low center of gravity is kind of skipping along and he's just wait waiting to make a cut on D broke two more tackles there and we should start keeping track of yards after contact on Dalvin cook Clemson allows 109 rushing yards per game Cook has 128 after the first quarter the death valley after this message in a world near local ABC station back for the second quarter ESPN tell us the Fallen AVC presented by Kay Jewelers Seminoles on the march again averaging 11 yards per play in that first quarter thanks mostly to Dalvin cooks 128 yards on six carries Tigers not used to playing from behind that did have to answer NC State's touchdowns last week escapes a tackle tough to bring down this guy he's the whole package is and I think again it's it's the vision but it's the balance and a low center of gravity remember if he sat out last week he said that the hamstring that's been bothering him he's had the ankle last week here's that vision and balance we talked about it again I I think we definitely need to keep a track of of the yards after contact because so far these Plimpton players they're in a position they think to make a play and either miss they have a guy position it's the arm tackles are not gonna bring him down they've got to have two or three defenders here to have a chance sequest Patrick no fun to tackle either as the freshman barrels forward for a first down before Goodson stopped him he emerged as a guy that that they can count on if cook cannot finish this game remember he hasn't started and finished a game since Boston College in September because he's at that hamstring problem yeah and not to mention if everybody's healthy he's still a nice guy to bring in because they say he understands pass protection and because he's a different style of runner he isn't downhill runner and it gives this defensive different looks I think he's great to bring in just to compliment McGuire Laguna throwing first demo the little catch made by Ryan is owned that side end has a first and goal they're picking on these linebackers both in the run game and now in the past McGuire sits in that pocket does a good job of getting behind behind the linebackers there's a little hole here he's got to throw it on a rope which he does and it gives his receiver this time in so a chance to go up and now get down to protect himself before TJ Breen comes in to hit him great throw that time to get the ball out fast and accurately by Shawn Maguire his though a terrific athlete they haven't had the production that they got when O'Leary was here last year but it's his new catch animos toward the corner wrestled down just outside the five by Tankersley we'll talk later about Rick trick is the offensive line coach but for it prey a team that lost not only for starters up front but for guys that played a lot of football they have had some injuries up there they've been shuffling to death this the best day has played solely in this game in the second quarter of a trick trick and doing a heck of a job with his group the best they played in the toughest circumstances all year the important sequence the nulls have not been all that efficient down here in the red zone think a lot of field goes down here that's right knockdown penetration by Goodson little B's Byrd and gold that's a great job and the first time we've seen BJ Goodson be able to penetrate he's coming right through here on a blitz and there's because he timed that up perfectly there was nothing that Florida State's offense aligned fit dude Wilson Bell the right guard I think by the time he even came out of his stance good still was buying look what do you call here now they had the touchdown early can quote from outside the red zone they had to pick down inside the red zone this is where you missed a big receiver like a bench I'm going to go up on a fade they don't really have that guy get both gonna call a timeout too thick it over and they haven't had great quarterback one game up while is not that guy down on the red zone either so it'll be interesting to see what Fisher calls here on third and goal you the board moment is this game as the seminoles almost eleven point dogs trying to go up by 11 third and goal from the 8 after the timeout we talked about what do you do here to me you got to be able to find a match up where you get a crossing route Travis Rudolph probably their most physical receiver if they could find a matchup that they like there he is in the slot to the right of McGuire Whitfield took the pitch running inside and the Tigers snuff it out stopping short of the five it'll be fourth down on another red zone fail for this at this talent office they just struggle down here yeah they do and I think the big thing is they miss that big bodies and they've always had down in this area and when you're going with the kind of a really over reverse or something to try to get to defense out of position you're lying on a trick play that tells you right now they're kind of grasping in the red zone to come up with touchdowns 100 and second in the nation coming into today on their touchdown percentage in in the red zone so chip shot for a guai away by his own super lofty standards has been a little bit of a slump but does not miss and still has an inside of 40 so a 69 yard field goal drive and the rolls back up by 7 ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers brought to you by Nissan premier partner of the Heisman Trophy Allstate proud supporters of college football are you in good hands and AT&amp;T mobilizing your world breaking ground what is the Clemson Tiger football dream home new facility that incorporate their indoor practice facility their offices Dabo told me he wants the locker room here at the stadium to be special something that the players only visit seven times a year once it was sweat and get dressed for practice in a different locker room they will once that new facility gets set up this program has reached a top 10 the program and their facilities are starting to match the product on the air rayray macleod receives the kick off with the two and gets pinned in does not get back to the 15 mister FeliCa the bear made the journey with you from Tuscaloosa this morning he has there a flick Privia question for today well a lot of people remember Leroy Butler was the big part of that putt ruski play in 1988 but who was the Florida State punter on the play that had the great cell of the the staff for Forrest there's Williams whose son Garrett Williams plays for Clemson we handed the fall off to leroy buck right so you're ready for that you're ready oh I just know that because he's I bought the freshman what's dinner was he did a heck of a job he lept up with the air yet turned around started to chase it he did a heck of a job Donna blocking and around the edge they hand it to Scott so they try to get some yards on the edge and the top receiver carries about for just the second time this year by the sledding so far have been pretty tough in the interior so they try to get some yards for the outside and now they're going with his tempo again second one thrown now Scott gets it break our block and scampers out across the thirty first down you put three receivers into the boundary like that and all deshaun Watson needs to do it's like a good shortstop get the body your hands as quickly as you can on a bangbang play at first that's what he did he got the snap got the ball out he had two blockers two other receivers his blockers to take on two of the defensive backs and picked up some yards for a first down he faked it's a Gulman move the pocket again and Watson shuts down fear for rent boy nope incomplete they took a shot with the scrapping former walkon how about it how about that effort there how about the throw it actually got in the rent frozen the inside he works to the outside on a wheel round and Elliott has to work around to get to him you can see right away Renfro calling his shot he put his right arm like I got him I can get there that ball got in there but he only had one hand to have a chance to be able to try to pull it in Renfro having a great freshman year he sure is he's a redshirt freshman who's the high school option quarterback his Garmin tests the middle bounces off a tackle red throat 155 pounds coach's son gym rat good shortstop but his teammates just admire the heart and the will he's he just wanted to give it get a chance to play at the highest level in areas and the coaches tell us he's probably of all these 5star recruits they go everywhere to get he's a walkon as a quarterback bobby has the best change or direction of all the wide receivers and probably other than our Tavia Scott the guy that he trusts the most to run the right route and be Ray needs to be that in the game on third and five once it has lots of room and does make a man miss times for a first down he had to a loo ticket to to move the chains that he did well they rushed three then eight guys at queue had his eyes on in the entire time he's right here and he knows he's week that watch he's gonna run on third down he's in position but that slippery field and a nice cutback gets the first Scott does her plan fast makes the catch on the edge in muscles bore for yards that doesn't show up in the stats as they run but that's a run and in this offense let's just get the ball we saw it earlier on this Drive hit the ball we got two guys are gonna block flipping out there and it's like a 5yard gain on a power play but it's the modern era of college football his friends darlin not much there the Timmy Jernigan was the guy was a nightmare for for everybody including Clemson last you didn't have a Jernigan type wardaddy perhaps but they have a whole bunch of high quality D lineman they sure do and Christmas right now DeMarcus Christmas the sophomore really emerging Derek naughty ninetyone now Lawrence Stanfill they've got a nice rotation there in the middle and so far in this game the interior winning that battle against Clemson's offensive line yet another third down the 617 for Clemson and Watson makes the mistake he had gone man wide open who would have waltzed through a big game and that's the second overthrow bad one from DeSean so far they brought more than he could handle it's a hot route so instead of blocking it they get Calvin out I just dumped it and you got exactly what you want nobody cut is covering him if it's a softer touch and Gulman catches that boy he is turning the corner and off to the races Watson just use ooze calm as you know Kerr keys he's no longer stressed about his knee he's trusting his protection he had a terrific October but by his standards he would say he's disappointed if it starts so far a couple of missed opportunities in the passing game and now Wilson makes a fair catch back inside the 10yard line 755 until intermission the Seminoles back to work up by seven some of the year may see you Dolph is happy for the folks flinging it around and JW Walsh cutting in to be a nice compliment at 21 not they're just it's so pregame warmups in a big claw when they touch down here came in the second play from scrimmage the cook 75 yarder NOLs have had five possessions all in poor field position backed up again here that time Boulware makes the play on it but it's been a rough outing for these linebackers and safeties and runs support sometimes they're in the gap but as we saw there Green took a stiff arm from Dalvin cook this time the cutback they're out of position there and nice block by you so but these linebackers and safeties for Brent Venables as this game goes on but they've gonna have to do a better job of kind of leveraging that football and not letting down and quick get out in an averaging eight point super carries more than double that so far against this normally stout defense hesitation just on sheer talent and hard work moves the chains again Heather Kirk after hearing what you just said about Clemson's defense you won't be surprised to hear that defensive coordinator Brent Venables spent that entire series not talking to his entire defense talking specifically to his linebackers got the grease board out spent the entire time reinforcing methods showing that what they need to do to slow the run talking GATS talking schemes then however boffin said be yourself you don't have to be extra special today you got to be great you got to play as a group to stop a great back leg down and cook action first down McGuire delivers his strike in his short game Travis Rudolph knocked down quickly there by Baker and on the other side if you're Florida State you've got a quarterback making his first start on the road in his entire career you want to be able to run the ball not just to take the pressure off of him every quarterback loves a great running game but because of Jimbo Fisher in his system it does start even when Jameis Winston was here with their ability to run the ball and get those safeties and linebackers so caught up in defending the run game that that opens up the playaction and gets McGwire in rhythm second down handoff to cook he's hit immediately and he manages very little so it'll be third and short Shack Lawson is showing a lot of heart today looked like he had a right shoulder that was bothering and Heather talked about how he has that brace on they may be feeling the effects of that shoulder here on this big third down happy to go out but he makes a big play there on second down but he's a leader of this team they lost a lot of leaders from a year ago he stepped up to be that anchor for his defense Royals have not yet converted down it's about hundred before on the TV meter as they need to ban to ban across the board here McGuire Rosa slant incomplete he's trying to get the ball to Wilson and excellent coverage by Tankersley fourth down again having trouble up third down on third and short you're gonna get crossing routes you're gonna try to get some separation and take loose famously does a good job it looked like his left hand might start to grab on to that Jersey a little bit early but he let go and came around with the right hand to knock that ball away he has really grown as a firstyear starter to worry was early in the year when they tried to pick on him to where he is now midway through the year he's starting to make plays like that Renfroe back make the fair catch at the 25yard line needed contact but no flag Clemson was 509 to work with before halftime back to work down seven he's payoff the athlete trivia question Garrett Williams dad Dwayne played for Florida State he was the up back in the famous punt ruski end of the ball to Leroy Butler but Palicki that was not the question you asked us what's the answer it was the punter in that infamous 88 game I knew you would be well prepared and tie the Jane Williams note in the air so I decided to get the third man involved the credit that will be cheap family with a punter apparently there was a hole in my preparation you got I thought you I thought you had it zette Brooks in the game wants it on the cupid weave his way in diving after a first down game to the 38 that is a quarterback draw all the way it's following his running back that time Brooks his center Guillermo picks up big yards there on first down hasn't been a sharp start for Watson Kirk but the Tigers would love to be able to drive the field here tie the game get back on even terms at halftime talent a true freshman of the guys from Tampa on this team crowd wanting a face mask penalty at the end of the run you're talking about two of a better true freshman in the country Derwin James who could have gone anywhere in the country he did not grab the face mask Derwin James and Ray Ray McLeod Derwin was recruited by Clemson but he had a Seminole tattoo on his arm about his sophomore year in high school they were gonna win that recruiting battle is a flag down interference on the defense all right so that's a costly mistake they were warned earlier in the second time customer fiveyard penalty he's fired up about wanting the face mask all they showed it actually here in the there's jumbo screen and the crowd reacted now one the face mask raiveer and macleod did take a hit and he's going over to the sidelines looked at some hesitation of his first town play no word intended for why city decides to just slip forward for a game to the 45 yard line inside of four minutes now in the first half see him get involved in this running game and he is an elusive runner that has a lot a big play ability if he can find a crease Florida State's aware that locks it in the pocket we now flushed Jase he just throws away the Marcus Walker's at a terrific first half he was giving chase to the quarterback that time Swain Galman is for the most part in this first half he has been shut down as the nine carries only 32 yards and he came in averaging over five yards a carry ins is such a big part of who they are the identity we were bragging about hey this team has a lot of confidence there they're in balance team they can run the ball and not had much success up front it's already the seventh third down for Clemson they flickered short cuts made by German hopper but he's going to be about three yards short of the marker as Terrence Smith and Ramsey combined so fourth down and decision here for sweetie yeah I think it is a cross midfield dare Charles Kelly there he you know he's healthy he's got Nate Andrews back he's got Terrence Smith back it's amazing to watch this defense when they have the play in front of them how quickly they react to it offense on the field on fourth and three if you look bitch late hit no first down Scott stop by Jaylon Ramsey Keller going nuts you want to run it number eight on fork down be careful that is a bigtime play by an allamerican in Jalen Ramsey who does a good job at at top of your screen watch him work to get off a very physical receiver and chiron peak did you summer who is peeked into the Miami defensive back he put him on his back today against Jalen Ramsey peak works off of him and watch the Charles Kelly how excited he is yeah what up talking about I love that emotion just another game man is a fire aired up coaching staffs on both side lines they know the meaning of this game about a lot more than just a division title to the Noles defense with a stock now they got 257 to work with before halftime a two tight end looking playaction McGuire again back peddling hit as he throws and delivers it out of bounds Goodson came on the Blitz no ground and call yet they'll talk about it I wonder if they're talking about was the ball tipped that's that's probably what the officials are coming together on and now they'll throw the flag there was nobody in that vicinity if you're wondering at home you're panicking why did they call right away it's because they may have felt that the ball might have been tipped that's why they came together to talk it over great job by Goodson by the way timing up that blitz second time we've seen him you're right there is nobody there but I love how the crew came together and talked it over and said no that ball came out clean there was no issue at all with the deflection is it it's definitely going to be a penalty second in 24 cook into traffic on the left side for a short game let's get that penalty random changes the philosophy how aggressive the fish are going to be trying to add to this lead before the break it's risk it's risky with a quarterback that's never made a start on the road and this is where you're usually doing this if Lakers screener that's just something that's going to be simple you play the field position game you're under three minutes here good defense has had a heck of a first half you don't want to do anything costly at this point we've got a nightmare on the third down today 92 31 yards it really isn't a good call for third and to know you're gonna work that play clock down and probably even run the ball they is down at line and don't know if he got it off did not there is a flag that comes in they're even if you're a place to call on third and 26 I think he wanted to work that play clock down the memories right he's dealing with a guy who's never made the start in this kind of atmosphere and he his two starts against punched in at home last year then last week against Syrah shoes we get the House of Pain baddest cut back into it because the defense has been able to come up with some stops you run the ball here you try to get Clinton probably have to use one of their timeouts another flag priest now this is offensive line whether their last two road games has really have problems with presnap families off to a terrific start today but they're so young and so inexperienced and haven't really conquered this kind of environment as a group yet yeah it's always tough on the road in college football any big games but they've averaged 46 points a game and home and only 15 point of the game on the road and a lot of that has to do with for the offensive lineman's a new quarterback not having Rashad be printing everything there's a lot missing from last year makes it a lot tougher to do it on the road yet cooks touchdown that was only the sixth touchdown in three road games that they play chance to check in with Cassidy Hubbard from the studio for an update Cassidy thanks Chris been update for the Big Ten Jordan Howard with his second touchdown of the day this one for 29 yards 1714 losers over unbeaten Iowa in the second on ESPN first our way back to you do you see that one coming today I thought their head had a possibility of scoring with them I just I thought I was very sad you said I look big on the barrel tell you later Capital One halftime report John we'll update all what's going on around the country Pratt is Parker's now good damage control and now we'll see if Clemson uses the first of their timeouts they're gonna use I think they have only one timeout left second excuse me so it'd be fourth down and they'll get the ball back NOLs just selfdestructing on that sequence the game was pretty good field position the ball was at their 42 yard line that just moves steadily backwards and now Renfro who doesn't normally create big plays with a pump return there used to just trying to make a fair catch begin the series right right if you take away Dalvin cooks long run that was really 7075 far out that he goes 75 on this you're looking at a pretty similar game for both teams offensively outside of the long run by cook we're only touchdown came in the first 45 seconds here this afternoon baby sit away comfortably bro pedals drops it chases it down inside the 20 so a nice boot from casein Beatty 51yard so much for good field position yeah that was a a big pun and you could tell Renfro struggle the whole way to get it kind of make a feel for where that ball was gonna come down he was lucky to jump back on top of that Tyler hunter was right there he's our Pacific Life game summary talked about the Knowles coming in as underdogs and a little bit disrespected inspired cook providing a spark showing no ill effects at the ankle or the hamstring problems 157 at halftime Tigers now with a minute 24 in one timeout Watson steps up the littler over the middle and the catch made by Leggett on his backside and for Senator had a bad first half in in minute 17 to go this is where you're trusting your quarterback comes into play they're backed up deep into their own territory you have deshaun Watson you get aggressive at 18 in the first play there's a flow into an window right there hit him right in the chest and Paul got in there to the freshmen but he should have held on to it Deon came I don't think anybody got a finger on that that was a tight window but it ball got through and it just bounced off of his chest Ramsey came diving in late to perhaps distract a freshman who's freakishly talented he's becoming a bigger part of this offense Watson worked the middle successfully in this after the big tight end yeah they get behind the linebackers and that gives you an idea of his arm strength deshaun Watson throws again it is a laser over the linebackers and in front of the safeties to leg it so games of 18 and now 28 yards in the Clemson working closer to field goal range now seen a tan Troost who is a safety but when they go into their money package which is six defensive backs on the field he comes up the play up close almost like a linebacker when you have an arm like that it gives you an ability to be able to throw that ball 30 yards 25 30 yards downfield but again on an absolute well it's just a frozen rope and legged is a guy he has a lot of confidence in they can make those catches they were backed up inside their own 20 when they started this Drive and deshaun Watson puppy the best tease look throwing the football here to start this drive the entire first half Knowles after spending its hanwen on defense trying to pressure Watson history shot Watson to the secondary thinking seven not three and he's following those lineman downfield pretty good effort there by D octane to pick up a big block they got in about another 10 or 12 yards before he stepped out of bounds you can see that acceleration to he kind of slips his way through and it hits that next gear delete speed Goodman yep final minute now sweet chunk plays on his possession and that Watson looks far side first came of his tip on a short game 51 seconds to play Gyan cane 6 and 200 pounds a high school quarterback in his own right along we talked about hunter Renfro the redshirt freshman who is a high school quarterback an option quarterback and Kane and rayray McLeod both from that area played peewee football together and now here they are playing for Clemson the fine was a high school running back so they take great athletes and then teach them the position he's actually played very little receiver so he's very raw but very gifted he's going up against one of the best corners in the country up in the top and Kalin Ramsay the exact Brooks came in motion before the state for the second time in this sequence we'll take a timeout on defense it's their last of a half go back and look at him he's a crooks is he's gonna follow the lineman downfield look to the right there there's Deon Kane trying to do everything he can his Jalen Ramsey but the acceleration by deshaun Watson 6 to 210 pounds right there he makes sense mind up there's the block did a little bit of a stiff arm there the linebacker it's that combination at that skill set of being able to be a real threat as a runner and being able to throw dimes all across the field as a thrower makes this offense just so hard to defend that Kirk gets Clemson's turn to get down and face one of these crucial red zone situations 27 strips for the Tigers they found the end zone 17 times so far this season onelegged has six touchdown receptions as you talked about earlier he is a real threat to tied in he's in motion here in this in this area to feel Watson running over there's a lead block from books it's a short game before Walker Knox and bad luck running there used to tempo they want to save that time out so they're lining up quickly now third down they need three interesting I think he made him a stay here I think he thought that might have been second down yeah well now it's no choice wart down the Apple can't believe it here comes a field goal attempt you don't see that I don't know if he was confused I could tell by the way he's hurting him up I'm thinking is he yelling fire fire fire he was hurrying him up so quickly I thought maybe they had the play already called that's what he's he he was saying I was saying let's go not clock it Bram so Watson got confused by the signal from the sidelines third down you know you almost never want to clock it on third I understand less the clocks down to two lives less you're counting on five down simpler bail and let's go I let you down to three two and one and you just try to get out of there you're going a chip shot for the 25 yards he's two for two so Clemson goes 75 yards a field goal drive but a disappointing finish to the drive and the Noles are going to take a fourpoint lead to intermission the first time Clemens trail that halftime can see the look on Dabo Swinney face you're seeing some some things that have happened that have been uncharacteristic of this Clemson team that we've seen for eight games the way the game started where they were in position to be able to put TJ green and maybe wrap up and tackle Dalvin cook and they missed the tackle and it's a 75 yard touchdown here we have your best player on the team Sean watts and moving the ball right down the field then he he fires the ball and a third down they have to kick a field goal just a middle mistake something we haven't seen all year from Watson well tonight on ESPN and seven o'clock Michigan State number seven in the selection committee rankings tries to stay unbeaten they head to Nebraska to take on the Cornhuskers rough first season for Mike Riley in Lincoln it's all presented by Hilton Hotels at 7:00 Eastern in on the watch ESPN app so Clemson at the moment now out for his date after the Noles with that big new start he cooked dominated the first quarter there's the pooch kick it takes a big hop finally is collected there by Luke field trying to make some space on the far side and he is gonna be drought short of the 30yard line 23 seconds to go no timeouts for the Noles all state bringing you this week's rankings we talked about Clemson your reaction when you saw Clemson LSU Ohio State and Alabama the first four uh I wasn't necessarily shocked about Clemson at one because of the resume and who they had beat and I felt all four had a chance to be up there I thought Baylor would have been a little bit higher you can see today TCU down to Oklahoma State by the way Oklahoma State undefeated down at 14 at eight no they're up early in that game 28 to 9 looks like about a team that could take a huge leap up yet consideration you beat TCU and home and they're doing so easily right now look out for the folks so Watson disappointment at the end of the half but Clemson is climbed within for the end of 30 minutes here in Death Valley the capital 1/2 tanh before is coming up including a visit with Heather Cox then Jimbo Fisher right after these messages and vodka back DSP on college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers and this presentation of the SEC on ESPN first Clemson home game as the number one ranked team in their history a chance to clinch the division to dethrone the Seminoles all week from both sides just another game but you can tell the intensity and Kirke some normally very poised reliable guys make it a couple mental mistakes but a pretty good first half an hour it sets up as a great finish a great first half as far as feeling each other out competitiveness and now it's it sets up these last 30 minutes where both these offensive they wanted to try to get through that first half save some things and now you open up the entire playbook and you ask your athletes to make plays and try to go win it to the second half Alvin Cook was the story early 75 Garrett bolts 45 seconds into the game the Noles that silenced this big crowd after that but his defense did a much better job each team has had to kick a field goal in the red now the Tigers will get the ball to begin the second half ohayo trying to take famous Scot the talented returner right out of play here he does so by hammering the ball through the back of the endzone has been putting it to work brought to you by car hearts number four give it to him early a great look at his stiff arm then he put on early in this game as he went to the house for a touchdown and he has been a physical back you know he's known for his great quickness and great speed but he's picked up for this defense to be able to try to contain that gift clemson credit you know outside of that long touchdown run they've given up some yards but they they have not led them into the end zone other than the one touchdown Watson meanwhile 12 of 21 in the first half ran at nine times Dallman really hasn't busted loose yet for the Tigers retching Northrop on the stop and see if I'm if I'm Jeff Scott Antonio led to Co offensive coordinators along with Dabo Swinney you're in there at halftime you think of what do we got to do to get this thing going I'm challenging my offensive line they've got it do a better job at trying to assert themselves upfront control the line of scrimmage a little bit better and get that running game going five receivers Watson quick hesitation and then just dives forward on the keeper it'll be third in two Heather Chris and Kirk I talked to Davos Sweeney about what he said to his quarterback deshaun Watson after that mental error to end the second quarter he said you know it was a mistake he thought he saw a signal he made a mistake we choose to focus on the positive we got some points out of a great Drive as for adjustments in the second half we said we missed opportunities we missed them so we can't do that in the second half also guys wide receiver Raven McCloud is out with a right hand injury so he joins right guard Tyrone powder get out by Jalen Ramsey on 32 is he got a long arm up there they tried to pop the quick pass and Ramsey sniffed it out again that's their answer sometimes to these blitzes on third and short is just a little a little hot pass almost a jump pass but not only does Jalen Ramsey knocked it away you could see the safety Brutus would have been right there have a chance to make a tackle short of the first down so Charles Kelly the defensive coordinator from Florida State dial and sum things up and doing a good job of affecting the rhythm of deshaun Watson and the Clemson Tiger defense three enough for Clemson to start this third quarter is teased all and Wilson chargedup thought about if it lets the short on bounce it's a good Clemson role goes dead at the 22 yard line so 45 yard kick how do you assess the play of Shawn Maguire obviously Cooke and the offensive line surprisingly poised in here but about no sense well they haven't asked him to do a whole lot he's five of 10 just 51 yards and has the one interception early in the game where he kind of threw it up and you saw Adrian Baker make a good play on it but their goal tonight is to run the football and put him in a position to be able to throw on his turns as opposed to being put in those third down in long situations here's a first down drop back McGuire looks it downfield deep throw wilson broken up he took a shot right away the Tankersley closed and knocked it away but he's got a lot of confidence in his arm strength and we saw him make some throws last week and hit these receivers on the money this ball right here just at the end you can see it's just in quite have enough and I go back to the beginning of the play he looks like he takes it an extra one hitch two hitch three hitches and when you've got the speed of a guy like Bobo Wilson you got to take one hitch and let it go put it up in the air and as far as you can throw it he took one too many hitches here and he ended up having his receiver downfield too far in second and ten McGuire is chased flushed and drops we lost by Goodson South at Fisher Kirk go for the haymaker in the first play of the third quarter doesn't get it and now it's another third along and now he's seeing a defense when they missed the home run shot they went for the big one for Jimbo they come back on second 10 you know what you appreciate his confidence he's showing his quarterback but now you see Brent Venables in the defense a zone blitz bringing both linebackers Boulware and Goodson and dropping Kevin got it confused McGuire nothing to do but just eat the ball have not yet converted tonight on third down and eat 30 now they're walking around kind of creeping around trying to affect the pass protection play clock winding down McGuire's see it Flags hidden all that presnap stuff I bet on his defense you've got a quarterback who's never made a start on the road and you've got an offensive line that not only is breaking in for new starters this year for Jimbo Fisher but when it comes to pass protection the communication being on the same page I'm a right tackle I'm looking to Eucharist as a right guard you and I kind of trust each other's hand signals it's hard to communicate quarterback the play clocks running down there's a lot that goes on before the ball is snapped and it's very challenging on the road in this kind of environment to communicate against new freshmen to sophomores with a junior in that Oh give it to cook on 13 18 yet really call it a give up plate when cook select the ball at all he gets out to the 29th EJ green that time unlike the opening run for cook made the tackle and it's fourth down and again penalties undoing things yeah yeah that's exactly right they decided to take that that long shot throwing the ball downfield and the thing you know about that if it doesn't end up coming coming through for you you've gotta have a second ten never never go away from down the cook that third and 18 he comes up just a yard or two short so for Clemson retain as Scott replaces rent for was the punt returner as they try to make a big play but Beatty drives him back to high boot fair catch made at the 20 yard line so neither offense get too much in his first possession of the third quarter you here's the allstate bus and a chance to remind you to join the Allstate it's good sweepstakes when hundred thousand bucks plus a VIP trip to the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game in Glendale as well as weekly prizes throughout the season an oldfashioned slugfest year three touchdowns court was in the first minute of the game tugs any shot taken that's Kane the freshman a nice gut from Watson and they moved the sticks quickly and he does a nice job as a young freshman getting his hands up and getting off of Jalen Ramsey Dylan Ramsey came up right away started to communicate with his safety Brut is saying hey you got to help over you got to come over and help me out now they feed Gulman he just runs into heavy traffic Clemson expected to have more success running between the tackles they have all year long but not today so far a guy who is really emerging for this defensive line is Marcus Christmas number 92 sophomore from Sarasota he just tonight especially you're seeing him just thrive these linemen back into the backfield down at the 40 it'll be another third down Marquess white on the tackle lower boom there Marquess white been challenged all week by Charles Kelly he and Jalen Ramsey got to get involved and run support everybody talks about corners at Florida State you take the prime time you're thinking about being able to cover people in an island but white six feet about 185 pounds coming in and being involved in that run support we walked out of the Noles basketball team couple years ago last season actually on third and six Watson flushed did he escape yes first down midfield slides to the Seminole 45 yard line the best place for Clemson tonight is the corvex scramble all week Chris I wonders when they got the third down what would Florida State do they play so much mantoman but when you play man under it means everybody all your linebackers are locked up in man coverage and your backs turned to the quarterback and deshaun Watson is going to take off and run you can't stop him at 15 yards there now Scott just not much on the edge Terrence Smith and Brutus there not much nothing about the crack block that time by Dion Cain the freshman again he's a true freshman going against Jalen Ramsey little right here coming from the left boom little crack block needs to make sure his heads on the right side there's an getting block in the back Gulman motions out watson buying time chasin flips incomplete that scott a diving catch inside of 40 it'll bring up third down and three with big difference between third and ten and third and three the big fella lawrence state boys down when they move the pocket like that it makes it tough these defensive linemen like Lauren sample they 300pounder you got to chase the quarterback a lot what was great if you're a Clemson fan about that is that is a design drop back and get it shows you the relationship you have between Watson and Octavius Scott his favorite receiver in this lineup was a broken play soon as he got into trouble he went to his left and Scott saw his eyes they connected and broke away from his defender when NFL countdown on ESPN you can meet the dozens of high school players throughout the state of Indiana named Peyton after you know who it's one of the features on countdown following the NFL insiders Buber in the gang Sunday at 10:00 Eastern on ESPN so this time the Tigers need a long two on third down Gallo reached the 36 the receivers are stacked because of the mantoman had tendencies by Florida State the stacked receiver gives him a free release Watson flips it back thirty yards unser down and closes first touchdown and first lead good future here this big future Duggal makes it 13 to 10 80yard Drive in seven place fabious Scott usually makes a play makes the place for these guys stack receivers and look at the line beginning downfield they got Florida State out of position with the formation they don't look like a baby might be a screen to the right they came back to the left to Cain and there is the speed in the open field the Tigers have their first lead ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers brought to you by the we style decor from Honda the Home Depot more saving more doing that's the power of the Home Depot and Walmart get ideas for your gametime party at walmart.com slash gametime recipes our Dr Pepper Championship Drive game of the week now 1310 Clemson as the Tigers lead for the first time for today the crime who cooked to get their cellphones on beautiful seed here's sure it turns into night Whitfield as a crease and Kermit slams down at the 30yard line and a look at the tiger scoring ploy the stacked receivers on both sides here in here but watch how the running back going this way gets this linebacker right here occupied this linebacker blitz is so there's really nobody left here once he dumps this now you've got the lineman coming down field we get a block here and this guy gets behind it and he's going to be able to get the numbers that he needs to Center the elbow has nobody it's just a footrace to the end zone between he and cane and now a misfire on the offensive lines ole I'm beginning to feel the pressure to sophomore Wilson Bell the last three for two state drives just 27 total yards and one first down and now the noise will be amped up even more they sense that this offense is rattled now this is where you're gonna get Shawn Maguire the first time starting quarterback even though he's a junior on the road he's never faked this environment with young offensive linemen very importantly maintain their poise at this point the football game Burstyn 15 Clemson rushes only for McGuire creating the traffic nearly intercepted there Travis blanks the linebacker Dogen front play he was kind of sitting back behind Rudolph as if to say he's open throw it he's open and he gets you can see it gets a great jump on it right there and there was a little bit of a miscommunication because McGuire threw right for Rudolph was and Rudolph was working back to the outside and he threw it right to number 11 Travis blanks he catches that ball Chris he high steps to the end zone should have been the second pick tonight for the Tigers defense McGuire delivers a low strike catch made by Whitfield still needs six more for a first at the only spot he could put that football low and away from the defender TJ green diving in there is at least a chance here on third down lot of frosting routes would be in play here for these receivers you're probably going to get a blitz then how confident can you be they support about their girls for six best third down defense in the country and Brent Venables dials up a lot of different loss nobody in the backfield means you better get the ball your hands fast they found out don't blitz McGuire has time fireside lies catch made Wilson and they finally convert on third down to midfield what a great job here by Bobo Wilson working himself back to the football there's another example where the quarterback scrambles he breaks down and he's got to be able to get back to the foot boys right here he comes back he runs his route but it was really about the adjustment once the quarterback has to extend the place he worked back right there mcguire pusher none first town just loves it up and the catch is made by Rudolph he beat Mackenzie Alexander who didn't spy the ball no a wheel round he's on the inside mantoman he uses his own receiver who's also covered in mantoman they cross he gets Mackenzie gets caught up just enough and then he doesn't see the football the ball is underthrown he doesn't do a good job of coming back to the football and once again Shawn Maguire feeling the pressure that time DJ reader getting in supid completions in the news in the to the 33 Loren's into an orange wall games a yard this Monday fenced off to a very slow start Kirk do they have responded well since that opening run the adjustment and what you've seen at least here in this second half when Brent Venables had a chance for twenty minutes to get everybody's undivided attention was attacking the line of scrimmage the plant quit on the toss sweet cook has a lead blocker has to get the edge and fights hard as he always does down inside the 25 jr. on curse stop that it'll be third in about a yard yeah they tried to go recent you seen Florida State go hurry up you used to sing Clemson it's a hurry up Florida State going hurry up to try to get a confident defense right now they'd be out of position it actually worked Sweeney was questioning the spot he was pointing to a spot about two yards better get down go back off the field third and one nothing he lost two yard now what do you do on 4th and a garden 1/2 so it'll be the field goal range to tie it and he just says field goal there's your answer yeah yeah and he's frustrated about it but good against good everybody knows it once you're not likely gonna see Dalvin cook following that fullback in the interior that time at the clemson defense defensive line and wasn't just the linebackers have a DJ reader who's back for only his third game right here he gets a cross fighting his way across Rock ruble heck of a play Wow this year believe it not beyond 40 is only 1 for 4 this is from 41 he slides it through so Aguayo draws the seminoles even Midway third quarter in Death Valley yesterday thank you light rain beginning to fall here in Clemson he's been a very rainy season unusual these parks they've always talked about an Iranian game they've had a few weep in here to see him so Ryo after tying the game boots it away hi he's taken CJ fuller remember Heather reporting that rayray McCloud is out so he will not be a part of the special teams anymore Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart Gophers and the Buckeyes fronting the shoe with Cardale Jones back I started quarterback Clemson's offense last time they had the ball marched 80 yards for a goahead touchdown DeSean wants that accounting for 79 of those 80 yards he was five for five actually have one run there for 15 15 yards shaking off the couple of overthrows and that mental mistake that he made spiking the ball on third down at the end of the half as you can expect he wouldn't there's a high misfire though Scott was well covered over there by white a lot of these players on from the skill standpoint are Tavia Scott Dion Kane who made that touchdown reception no a lot of these Florida State players from going back to when they were in Little League and even in high school and second down peak makes the catch sure old Pete is the only guy in the Clemson side Kirk that is played in a win over Florida State he's that 50 year guy he played and then registered it later in his career but obviously three straight for to seye wins only number 19 knows what it's like to walk off the field beating these Seminoles yeah you're right you're right and that's why I think there's such desire and hunger from this team this week they realized the opportunity they have here comes another big third down here Leggett decided in motion Noel's bring some pressure up the middle any complete that was red fro getting caught up in traffic couldn't get past Pugh and it's fourth down again you know Pugh is known because of his ability to rush a quarterback but we've seen him this year also be able to drop it this time he's lined up here and it comes over comes completely over and I don't think the Shaun Watson even thought about him he sees 16 and he's lined up up close to the line of scrimmage he's thinking he's going to be there as a pass rusher and there's a kid Charles Kelly coming up with a different look there on third down to try to confuse the receivers and quarterbacks inde Teasdale not used to being this busy it's Wilson charging forward didn't field it but it takes a good balance for Florida State and is down at the 49 yard line this is the eleventh season for Allstate sponsoring the good hands field goal Nets making contributions to general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point allstate has contributed millions in scholarship funds so very good field position for an offense for the lawls that's been struggling lately after just a 28yard pun Shawn Maguire look at him in there challenging guys he's talked into these guys right now in this huddle he senses an opportunity with his field position he's challenging himself and the line it's been poor field position tonight until this possession for Florida State cook the first down carry knock backwards quick penetration by fan Bowl where the junior linebacker I keep going back to this but but the adjustment is everybody at the line of scrimmage other than the corners we when they go with it with one tied in and two running backs and I formation we are going to put people at the line of scrimmage the four down linemen the three linebackers in the two safeties nine guys up there to leverage that ball and win the battle the line of scrimmage to make the choir have to throw to move the ball and if contain cooks since that early explosions ever they McGwire a dart catch made by Wilson who darts out of bounds across midfield it'll be third down he'll need five pump McGuire's background and high school out of New Jersey he ran the old single wing team where he didn't throw the ball alive more really a runner in high but did enough in high school and in camps to be seen by a lot of schools was known as a pretty highly touted quarterback coming out of high school number 55 Chad Nvidia a lifelong friend he got two guys who sparked a New Jersey or Lucy one of the chances on 37 Maguire has time to let was a strike ahead and falling down is Whitefield he gets the first Sampat had more yardage it he been able to keep his feet Mackenzie Alexander was trying to get the safety over you see him going motion well to the left there you can't see it but McKenzie Alexander's trying to get help over because he realized the defense the Seekers turned around right away they did not adjust to Whitfield going in motion they didn't have enough defense defensive backs in that area a good recognition there find a wire they're gonna have to make a big pass play on first and ten and give it to Clark who's not head over heels there Christian Wilkins had a nice ball game he took a number formed put his feet up in the air but he is so impressive every time he makes the play I gonna remind people cuz he's 64 315 pounds and he's a true freshman can you imagine him on a high school field last year at 64 315 pounds out of Springfield Massachusetts played basketball growing up just a great athlete who had the balloon up to 315 he is a force in the interior that defense five receivers empty backfield on another fall start this for state office this block ruble of freshmen is starting because Derrick Kelly is banged up Shack Lawson who I don't blame him for trying to get a head start rubles making one of his first starts in front of this kind of crowd he doesn't want to allow chef Lawson to go around him so he's trying to get a little bit of a jump and after he jumped back Jack Lawson kind of stepped across glass Prevage almost say it's alright rookie haven't died actually seven dot that time tell them to just relax jumping around trying to get guys lined up here now good luck quietly crowded you see that won't work here Sean and that doesn't work either McGuire's firing up in the center another freshman up there is Alec Epperly that's the third delay of game but the reason it's frustrated is he's trying to get the balls snapped he's trying he lifted the leg he's clapping his hands he in the center right now are not on the same page and it's costing Florida State it's not just how many penalties that they have Chris it's the timing and when they're coming up with these penalties that's 9 for 65 yards in a number of the bins fall starts independent very pleased chart for this offense but after half time so second and 20 now way clock winding down again got her just got it off McGuire delivers and Rudolf dropship normally reliable players coming off a career game last week just drop that way you you can't go on the road and selfdestruct it's hard enough to play against Clemson let alone when you're making good players making mistakes Travis Rudolph who had a monster game last week five catches over 100 yards three touchdowns that one just flips right through his fingers a monster game after what he thought was a rough game against Georgia Tech he drops it in loss third and 20 that again we get it out quickly witless can mix the chance and takes a shot at the 40yard line is work down very surprised we did not see a flag come in there a defenseless player ship on Harrison not Wilson making the catch but got hammered Wilkins hits him up high defenseless players ball his tips and then right there his head was bent for wasn't he by the initial arm and then he got snapped backwards after the second hit but again a once promising drive for Florida State shortcircuited by false start penalties and a delay of game when Beatty tries to pin the Tigers deep excellent job drop the tip get that sand wedge and they finally collect the ball at the six yard line but to the Arizona USC game over on ESPN stick around for SportsCenter at noon night recap of the busy day I'm also streaming live on watch ESPN app so now if your Clemson you'd love to create something on this drive but perhaps more importantly Kirk just take care of the footballs we give it to be a rainy night tie game late third quarter yeah but again but because I think the face that they have in deshaun Watson I think they they still maintain their their approach no matter where they are on the field it's gone men running behind the two tight end look mean that's a productive honey boy by the standards of what they've been able to create tonight they had about six yeah one of the first creases we've seen with this offensive line being overmatched at times against the athletic ability to strength the Florida State's deal I'm at that time that's what you're used to seeing from Wayne Coleman when he gets the ball in his hands he's used to having five or six yards to be able to make make some productive yards for Florida's for Clemson's offense once that on the roll throws it the catch is made a very short game there by a hopper when it's enough to move the chains deshaun Watson is already ready to snap this football there they go with that double stack look again remember they ran a screen here Donen stutter steps that's another positive first down running play for the guys tonight Mavericks less than three and a half of carry and that is such a big aspect to their offense it's been missing tonight because it freezes the linebackers if it makes them have to respect Galman and then you can get back out to getting the ball out quickly to Octavius cotton these receivers Tiger trying to squeeze in one more play between the third quarter expires and first down slides down short of the 40 so the ACC game of the season Division title on the line playoff hopes on the line 15 minutes to play here and Clemson back after this message and a word from your local ABC station here's set for the final corner this presentation of the SEC on ESPN name of the year in this league is typical of how closely CCC games have been more than a half of the ECC James Kirk decided by a touchdown or less that's way more than any power five conference I think you could make a pretty strong argument top to bottom this is a conference that week in and week out you see competitive games just 11 points it's it's 19 points if you look at the rest of the FBS leaves fourth quarter began to the swing pass to Coleman protects the edge it barrels in the Florida State Territory so the leading wash to the every game until this one for Clemson finally makes the play finished in the pass game yeah they are doing what they can to try to get him loose nice job of the blocking by the receivers Renfro that time taking the guy the defender the linebacker Terrence Smith out of the play who had Galman mantoman 15yard gain on that point in short gain with two on first down Ramsey a cannonball from his corner position through the Seminole defender down on the field when the deer sidelines there said Hoskins I think it is Derek Hoskins the middle linebacker it's a test for the defense isn't it Kremp Clemson has cranked up the tempo and they haven't really negatively impacted the Knowles get Kurt but they've run 61 plays that went 16 more plays than the Knowles have tonight well but I think Florida State kind of anticipated that that's why you've seen a big rotation up front with the defensive line and even in a secondary they're trying to stay keep their bodies fresh for this fourth quarter Larry's trunk estatement my the cowboys today in the 2nd and 8th Watson flips back it's a sprain and Renfro couldn't Corral it the Noles have been all over these screens tonight yeah they have they're a lot of different white jerseys running towards Renfro even if he catches that ball and that play is not going anywhere the other thing they're mixing up remember earlier we saw Leggett getting down in the middle of the defense with two safeties kind of splitting the field gonna cover two look they have mixed up their look from single high too too high making it tougher for the Shawn Watson with his receivers Watson what's down feel it's off the fingertips of Kane he was well defended by Derwin James that was true frosh on true frosh there and this is a superstar in the making Derwin James is usually up close to the line of scrimmage and blitz it's a lot this time he's back showing his ball skills and without that play right there that's at completion he gets behind a little push there on Ramsey but he gets behind him but as you said Krish the true freshman James knocking that ball out of the hands of the true freshman Kane guys at three starts he's the number three tackler on this defense he's just a natural playmaker header as you said he's got he's already a star he's gonna be bigtime it's a very short but high kick he Wilson makes a fair catch at the 13 yard line what do you have well Chris after the three false starts for Florida State Jimbo Fisher immediately came over to his offensive line went straight to center Alec Everly and got the ball that's all you have to do the ball then the Ola in coach Richt Rickett gathered them all around and simply said relax we have 25 seconds to snap the ball do not panic it was a very frustrated Florida static oline loss and headset hanging bag I better wake up right now Heather no time to hang your head in a 1313 game in a fourth quarter there's a catch by Rudolf and they move the chains quickly and I it's a great call by Jimbo Fisher because of what Clemson's been doing on early downs look at the guys at the line of scrimmage what's been the adjustment to stop down the cook nine guys up to the line of scrimmage challenge this at this Florida State running game mate Shawn Maguire the passing game bjoo and that's a great adjustment by Jimbo Fisher on first and ten instead of running and running throwing the football we'll try to back that defense off a little bit McGuire wellprotected who it off a second catch he's fifth no real big games he's been contained he had to drop but now the quarterback trying to find some rhythm here absolutely and when you have a defense it doesn't respect your quarterback and doesn't feel threatened but in that area you you've got to make them feel that well you've got to throw the ball in first to ten throw to set up the run and now they fix it to rip fielders in the backfield in carpet Sprint's out near the 40 so the four state offenses now moved away from the goal line at near midfield they gave a different look but a receiver in the backfield Kermit Whitfield by the way with all the injuries in the backfield guys haven't been practicing a lot you know who has been getting a lot of reps Monday Tuesday and Wednesday permanent Whitman a guy who knows how to play running back but is more of a slot receiver you can see the acceleration they went tempo just handed a pitched it to him and he just got to the border because of that speed in footage short and knock down immediately is the fullback Stevenson just a yard game so they've had three first downs on this drive to strive started inside their own 15 at the 13 yard line and they have thrown the full hit ago again with that hurry up tempo tempo tempo hurry up get to tiein lined up court drives a cloud that breaks precook across midfield didn't look like much but then he shows that burst interesting that the Jimbo Fisher has found something here with the personnel on the field and they're getting the look that they want they're sealing the edge with the tight ends block is oh and then he's just features kind of waiting for that crease to find itself and info right there he cuts behind the linebacker Boulware I thought the ball almost came out but he holds on to him Jack was Patrick the true freshman spelling kook McGuire miscommunication I let this offensive line though that have been so rattle is that the reported you come out and you said let's run tempo let's let these guys don't give a lot of time to say I love it you notice how the ball is no longer having an issue anymore with with ever lay in his snaps I mean the ball is being snapped quickly you're becoming the aggressor again as an offense instead of just sitting back there crowds getting into it the play Fox down to five four three guys are chunk either a false start or delay of the game there's just no wiggle here they found a rhythm here second example pirating the air and falls to the turf Austin quiet yet another talented true freshman defensive lineman in this game got his hand up Chris the offensive line Spurs the wrong way they're turning down linebackers upcoming Steve got two guys that rush in the right tempo this time Ruth was left alone to block to God they've confused them with their look in their protection they they kind of they slid to the left they should have slid to the right there's the athletic ability by the freshman Brian going up the area not the damn third and ten what is heaven as he throws it therefore we're particularly a fumble this will for sure be reviewed Boulware came flying in and hammered mcguire scrub for the fall now and get a sort out who's got it wait the fans were excited because it's the signal has been Clemson football but they're definitely going to take a look at it McGuire indicating that he thought his arm was going forward Dave Kataya is our rules expert Joe Rogers the replay official here steps up there if his hand is moving favored at all it's considered an incompletion I to me it looks like his hands moving forward that's a fact it looks like it looks like he's attempting a pass Dave's on how you'd see it if he were chill rider in the replay booth take a look at this with Kirk and you guys are saying is right does he have control of that ball when the arm is moving forward to me he does does he have control as the arms moving forward Lawson to me yeah yeah I mean Boulware makes contact but the ball is still in possession and as his arm is coming forward the ball is still in possession meaning he has possession of the ball and then it comes forth then the ball comes out so it looks like an incompletion to me the arm moves forward about six inches but at the same time in the contact but the contact is not relevant they don't think the officials do the right thing to rule it a fumble then you can go back and fix it if it is an incompletion rather than ruling complete which could take a fumble recovery perhaps out of the play I think this is right I would err on the side of calling it this way and then fixing it right great great point Chris absolutely it's funny broadcasting here at Clemson it's like we're here amongst the crowds are turning looking to us and what's the call I'm singing completion there you're saying oh they don't like that call they're our friends if we said fumble then they why don't you pick up one of these monitors and turn it around they could see they're employed with the booth is looking at in the case bull are made a big play and even if it is ruled incomplete is going to be fourth down and ten at the 49 yard line did you see where Boulware came from there Chris it was interesting he he wasn't coming he was locked on with Dalvin cook in case Dalvin cook was going to go out for a pass and when Dalvin cook did not go out for a pass he decided you know what I'm gonna take it I'm gonna go in there he's right here he's matched up with Dalvin cook watched Alma cook he stays and he's gonna try to help out now he says okay then I'm coming boom lowers to boom right there but he was not blitzing initially the quarterback was in possession of the ball what his almost ball forward incomplete pass McGuire is pretty confident that would be overturned yeah they've thanks for your help I think the correct call in any case it was as you pointed out a heads up play by Boulware and yeah now we'll have a pun and as we get into this fourth quarter and a 1313 game with so much on the line for both teams really field position is huge and Florida State by being more aggressive offensively this drives start at their own 13 they get it close to midfield and without the fumble there now they have a chance to pin Clemson back deep in their own territory Boulware comes from Anderson it's just up the road and they had a huge high school game here last night is it about 10,000 people his alma mater Hannity lost to West Side in overtime which is in Long crusher yeah that's what's that number one of the state head yeah I'll tell people they love high school football in South Carolina he had two very strong teams right in this area just up the road from campus Sears Beatty again dropping the tip it's that sandwich tries to knock it close to the pen and does it very well that's outstanding excellent execution Tigers back on offense 11:59 to play dye gang you ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers who would like to remind you that right now it's engagement season Pacific Life or life insurance annuities and investments choose Pacific Life the power to help you succeed on ESPN tonight unbeaten Spartans win a free invades of the big 10 traveled to Lincoln 70s presented by Hilton Hotels Iowa also unbeaten now an eightpoint lead on the road ABC of course will have the Buckeyes and the Gophers tonight from Columbus Tigers are backed up once again if they're a yard line calming muscles forward this has been one of those oldfashioned field position games and seems like both offices have so often didn't backed up at the beginning of Drive you're right about that and as this game goes on and whoever's gonna emerge as a winner you wonder if anybody's gonna be able to take poor field position and do something with it are they gonna have to have the benefit of getting great field position here's the catch made hyper slipstream closed down they improve their field position to the 25 Terrance Smith grabbed him the linebackers are playing so deep and by running down menhir these last few possessions it does open up those those inside receiver routes it's another first I run hard collision that Reggie Northrop a linebacker you could hear the pads pop was they are rotating quite a few guys now that Aaron Smith is healthy Reggie Northrop is out there we saw Hoskins playing some Jacob Pugh obviously playing north took the leader he had a great quote this week saying he's almost like a proud father watching some of these young players emerge Watson patience in the pocket three darts up the middle he slides to safety again out nearer to 40 another first down another great scramble when I try to get the ball right here the leg in this time it's taken away by the linebacker and that's where exactly where he's looking when it's taken away again there ya always have to take into consideration great job covering the receivers but who's got number four things break down I mean that is no fun being a DB in the opening field that time it was Elliot with a kind of a helpless feeling whoops runs out there late the tailback to the left of Watson they fake it to him they told the defense up in a tip it to Scott because near midfield and then the first and increasingly popular play were seeing Reggie Northrup and DeMarcus Walker out there on the edge of the defense 44 comes off of Scott Northrop ser there's nobody left to the outside he kind of baited both of them and then a little bit of a state another jump pass fade away past the Scott is that more Sam left and ski did yeah that's a little bit improvising Watson down inside the 35 they took their receiver peek and cleared him to the left as the receiver or to the quarterback and that opened such a huge vacant scene mantoman peek running away from the freshman James and man coverage watson thought about taking a shot downfield now just thread it on the sidelines and that's a catch by logan it's live for this court about calm and sea with the game on the line things are moving around you know they're throwing the ball fast they're getting it out and showing great patience in that pocket not panicking even though the game's moving fast around if it's not moving fast in his mind if liquid on the end around there's a little pop pass but Scott just nowhere to run rich in the North Shore and company sniff that out it's a big loss and a great play by Elliot 14 who actually was the key there he did not allow Scott who wanted to get outside of him that shit's weak you want to get wide look at 14 doing a great job once he makes him cut back into the inside that play is over what a story Elliot is his dad sent tape out to colleges nobodynobody recruited this guy monson knock down here is JD and Elliot a walkon didn't play football for three years went to a junior college in play football he's out here in a huge game making place think about that it's pretty scholarship offers in your eyes school play yeah good for him love to see guys with that kind of perseverance and you could see he's it up to 511 176 you can imagine what he was like coming out of high school he's worked his way into a position to be able with the injuries they've had in that back end he's out there playing and helping there in field goal range so they don't take a further loss third and 14 Watson clips each short not going to be a force down and he's knocked down at the see the 20 years 17 yard line when I Smith so that losts on the in Duran and first down yep got a kill would have been a very sharp drive now they're gonna have a field goal attempts well they went ten plays in 75 yards in under four minutes I mean they were Shawn Watson was in control moving them right down the field but you're right they went with that jet sweep and got him negative yards put him behind the chains and made it easier for Florida State to crank up the pressure on second and third down you go to four to this from 34 for the lead I snap good job by the holder Seth layin to bring it down and the reliable Hugo puts the Tigers numberone team in the country back on top five three at football bears and the Chargers beginning with money that countdown at six o'clock Eastern Time fifteen kick on ESP Ana's hit those Fowler pushups but where's the extension he usually does a lot more work than today not goodie pushups the tiger and Alstyne Fred there's a short kick by an lekha to the 7 yard line Whitefield can he get to a chess tournament Whitfield midfield and finally wrestled out in the man who made the huge return the biggest kick return in school history and the BCS championship game has set the goals up in plus territory a Pacific Life game summary all about the two number fours early on of course it was cooked a 75 yarder in the second play at a 48 in the first quarter and since then it's been a little bit tougher form this was early in the game where he was getting a lot of room to work and since then they've shut him down and deshaun Watson has settled into the game better position to be able to make plays that was the goahead touchdown to Dion came the Christie ride a big return by Whitfield they start this Drive in plus territory as a 44 yard return he continues to be a serious problem for closely covering the kickoffs among the worst in the country at that some acquire gross Dave Fiat well city little stuff up as the ball came down but it's overthrown two Tigers bracketing him a good job by Clemson first and 10 again throwing the football by Jimbo Fisher and it's a nice job by Clemson being awake and anticipating that not necessarily being baited that time in thinking Dalvin cook talent cook from the last couple series we've seen Florida State willing to be more aggressive on early down second and ten Wilson collects it gets to the 40 before TJ green stopped him it'll be third down less than two you get late in the game like this so much at stake you go they're going that hurry up that toss sweep look out going to the right Tigers not even lined up and cooks got it but he doesn't get first down yardage he's knocked down about a foot short over there just inside the 40 it'll be fourth down you know and I know it Clemson knows it I mean this is what they've done here is when Jimbo Fisher has gone hurry up they they've run to the tight inside Clemson's defense even though they weren't in position you could see them still trying to get in position but they noticed it they just needed to know where the tide in is and they get start running in that direction the fishing wants to know just exactly how much they need on this fourth down it's been anything but automatic on these third and fourth and shorts for either offense needs almost a full yard Kirk actually get up under center high formations right okay how are the ball you have to or you go wide with Dalvin cook the interior is not a good matchup for Florida State in short yardage situations I think you've got to go wide and trust Alvin Cook to be able to get wide on that outside stretch play and then find a crease and then get find it in a hurry heading into the teeth you're only going quarterback sneak or you go wide with Dalvin cook I would not go iformation go deep in the back field up the middle and hand it off to Dalvin cook does the line of scrimmage maybe going backwards I'd go wide with him see what they decide cook is lined up seven yards deep he's got it but it doesn't get the first time where it came flying up and just like the Notre Dame game down to goal on its that Clemson front has made a huge play pleasure I think they weren't probably anticipating what you and I were talking about Boulware cleaned it up but you know made the play Shaq Lawson watch him right here he's fighting off makes the freight play right there and gets off of his block horses cook not only back inside Chris but he does a good job of getting his hands on him to slow him down he actually made the tackle before Boulware got there Clemson football a third and one and a fourth and one stop before where and this Tiger defense Clemson back on office protected a threepoint lead you last year's romantic collision in Tallahassee you recall Jameis Winston even though we warmed up suspended for the game deshaun Watson comes in as emergency player in the second half gives Clemson the lead they felt like they outplayed the Noles but in overtime Williams with the walkoff winner as gutted a locker room as squeezie says he's ever been around the third consecutive loss to Florida State and out Clemson and don't think that's turned on the mind at ease Clemson players all week this week is a first down Gary bike Gorman he's about five again only one player Jerome fake who's a veteran has been a part of a victory over Florida State Clemson clinches the division clinches first spot in the ECC championship game and dethrones Florida State with a victory here as well as of course staying on course for the playoff other rankings out hope they came a bow we're not gonna have a big pizza party here right tell early December if they're still in the number one spot Vaman just slams into a wall and gets knocked backwards Darren Smith flew up in support Walker he sure did but Naya Lawrence Stanford he and Derek naughty they're tamarcus Christmas this time right here watch the big fella take on that doubleteam look at that work this pushes it back and that's impressive that's why you lift weights right there you don't skip leg day well instead of working the play clock let's see if they do Kirk its third and six they could punch him pin them back and here's his guy that he loves to get the ball to in these kind of situations leg it to tie it in he's flexed out he's laid six catches tonight late clock down at three Watson pump fake throws it to for conversion for Clemson how bout him Christie talked about the pump fake he barely he'll watch the quarterback here then he holds on to it he was actually waiting for Pete to get clear look so many of those screens have been ineffective tonight yeah the timing there was not great he got pressure from the Marcus Walker he got 21 yards in that third and six and pick the veteran of that receiving corps makes a huge play and now the clock becomes a bigger factor when Walker went up into the air and if he would have thrown it the first time he would have hit him right in the chest so he held on to it waited and then made the right decision this time he holds on and dogs forward that's an effective six yard first down game if your Florida State right now it's about you've got to hold deshaun Watson and Clemson to a fuel goal and see what you can do with one last possession you've got three timeouts it's under four minutes to go obviously you can't let Clemson into the end zone they get in the end zone for the most part this football game is over and if your Clemson you're taking knockout punch somebody make a play get the ball into the end zone let's beat this Florida State team look why you're hoping you get a chance with this still a one score game and headed back to books breaks a couple how customs adjust gets leveled there that's that but to Marcus Walker the junior with Mario Edwards moving on any moment moving on this defensive line kind of and all years played with a chip on their shoulder nobody more did to Marcus Walker he clean that play up it's a timeout Florida State dtmc presenting today's strong performance by deshaun Watson Kirk after a little bit of a shaky start a couple overthrows he spiked the ball on third down the end of the half he's been in command though in the second half look at his numbers I mean they don't have as many points as you're used to seeing but what doesn't show up is how he's able to keep his poise and make good plays they go with that double stack look again with their receivers to the left and to the right not really in google's field goal range at this point it's like the practice screen and now becomes important the Florida State spent a timeout before 37 Talman goes in motion out of the backfield this is the touchdown play for Deon Cain by going here he takes Terrence Smith with him there's nobody left in this area over here so they get it Terrence Smith out of the way little fake to the right come back to the left a blitz Jalen Ramsey that's the play that Dion Kane took to the house they're lucky to even come up with a stop there because they were outnumbered bigtime to the last McGuirk you said in the break they put a lot of eggs in that basket trying to make that stop on third down now the null is just two more timeouts inside of three minutes to go told me first Kakaako perhaps they've got hit with a right cross 45 seconds into this game the rowdy crowd got quiet but they have climbed back and now with that 25yard touchdown run Clemson is up 10 with 234 to go interesting here that your best linebackers far as tackling wrenching Northbrook watch him work his way out here before the play even occurs he's your most physical player where's he going Jared Smith misses the tackle it would have been right for Reggie Northrop was and that's a tough ass former LaMarcus frutos once galmans running into that second third level when I'm stopped by Reggie Northrop walking to the field you know they're going to run the football they're working clock you need to be attacking the line of scrimmage with your linebackers instead he's walking out and it just so happened to be it's exactly where Clemson was running with the football the boy Wayne Galvan looks like a guy that's been cooped up all night and he finally got loose and he just said you're not stopping me from getting to that end zone exactly Turkey's had to earn every yards tonight he's got these but that touchdown run perhaps to play Bella number around these parts for a long time Death Valley is jumping literally to feed the chips you got to feed the champs when that's been the Seminoles in this division of this conference for the last three years Webster's certainly felt they were the better football team if you believe that the far better team coming in this year by 10:00 the job not done though this time Brookfield is not done up to 20 here's the Allstate good hands play and set for this great play watch Shaq Lawson here not only as he makes a play for his but watch how he spins him it prevents the ball from getting across the line how fitting that Shaq lost and the leader that defense makes that play on fourth down and he's got the bum shoulder all the no pay low my husband had the reported he's been fighting through it all night adrenaline is a great painkiller Nayla mcguire must look deep serious urgency question okay almost intercepted reaching back and trying to make the catch there was TJ green who missed the tackle early on yeah almost had a chance to really put the bow on this kevin dodd almost got to Shawn Maguire Clemson that time only rushing three dropping eight trying to make it tough on Shawn Maguire they're not just gonna lock up and play mantoman quick completion real often running is Rudolph who lost the ball that's he's got it he just took it away from at the end of the play but Aerith two or three defenders hanging Boulware got his hands actually on it and knocked the ball loose his rudolph was going down his knees actually off the ground and for watch three defenders dreams in their Goodson's in there here comes to the left Boulware gets his hands in there and watch him rip at that football well before he's down that boys Alfre ball and trypsin jumps on top of him to the linebackers so it important in today's efforts combining the strip right to here and their recovery you do that every day in practice is sprint drill as an offensive player you work on trying to take care of it as a defensive player you try to rip it out and I'll tell you bull wearing this defense in the second half against Florida State three points there's the crowd caught up gang tackling my Clemson yeah guys oh yeah on Rudolph and now just trying to believe that clocking Gulman eats less to get 200 yards to people it was just being carried by the linemen they get 11 yards there in this bunsen defense you can't be anymore rocked and they were a minute into this game has really responded I think they threw up more in one game tonight defensively than the previous eight weeks because of the body blow that they took on that touchdown at 75 yards early in this game from Dalvin cook good almost had an auto feeling for Dabo Swinney Brent Venables but instead they kind of stuck to their plan they made some adjustments they made it tough on Dalvin cook from the second half on they had a lot to do with his victory obviously for Clemson at Syracuse and then home against Wake knowing they've already clinched the division now with this victory but obviously thinking about the playoff they have to rivalry game against the Gamecocks in Columbia and they will now play in Charlotte and the ACC championship game could be against the Tar Heels who were rolling right there are two games that would concern me if I were Clemson eight games you have to be worried about anytime you go into a rivalry game where one team has nothing to lose they're having a terrible year and you have everything to lose that that would be a game where on the road you want to make sure everything's buttoned up in South Carolina by the way since Steve Spurrier left they have not given up on things for Shawn Elliott and they do right now is playing better than North Carolina so it's not as if they just after this victory they're gonna walk their way to a chanting championship opportunity the Final Four they still have you know they're gonna be favored but they still have a lot of work to do with the remainder of their schedule bringing right back down to earth Kirk a good coaching W heavily favored on those gates a heavily favored yeah but I think a lot of people found if they beat for the state it's over there in I school I just say that there's still some work to do go down gum by the way Kirby the touchdown run event that assisted 10yard game has reached a hundred yard mark for the sixth time this season here's debo Sweeney just another game right coach I don't think so let's start when he sprinted down the hill and across the field he's been very animated after that latest turnover he knows they got it they finally got the nose for the first time in four years this team just has a a different feel that you know they've had some great teams here in the last three years this team is a different field which is John Watson leading them on the offensive side ability to run and throw maintains a poise and on the defensive side as well you've got a lot of new faces out there that it's come up big wonder about John McGuire given the start here even though Golson was healthy his first road start trying to gather his linemen but it was it was not successful and wonder where Fisher will be coming forward Billy has something else to think about with with ghosts Turner McGuire the second loss of the season will really kill the dreams of this very young team they got a big future but they will not accomplish what they set out to this year Watson a very safe play now some blockers inning runs it down inside the 25 and that will be the first day that it cups it for pleasure two things he's thinking about on that turn after that fake get the first down and stay inbounds and that'll do it now this is a team that won a national championship 81 but they took over number one after beating South Carolina the only team with a perfect record and 81 but they've never played a home game as a number one team never one down that Hill as the number one team really knew about the pails of that and he's just letting it loose it's gonna be a dance party in the lot for the state before the dance party is Heather already does Heather got her help give her a helmet keep baby red he saw how emotionally was after the Notre Dame victory 107 rushing yards for Watson what a monster second half to the quarterback after a subpar first half Clemson here in Death Valley tonight dethrones the Seminoles in the division and stays on course for the college football playoff win the whole thing it said Fisher he knows the absence he only concede that his best position to do that yep and he knows what it takes to win that whole thing there's going to be a party in Hudson tonight there already is one here in the field we wish Heather Cox best his me Throwdown hold on sweetie congratulations coach how did you get this team with all the expectations all the talk about the ranking all the pressure how'd you get them to get it done tonight we just do what we do give credit to Florida State they've been a great champion in this league they've represented this league but tonight it was time whose championship football is all about baby you gotta wait in the fourth quarter and on guys it's made the plays when we had to make them what does it mean to get this one for your senior class tonight had never beaten for the state every French girls because because they Oh years old we've got Gracie where we've got 40 freshmen well young team but this finger leadership has done an awesome but the best is yet to come it's great to be

they love each other they're passionate and the man I'm just touching they didn't prove one thing they were exactly who I know they are and they found a way to win and it just really proud of them a good spot to stay we got great respect for them they're a great football team but tonight was our night it's good look at that happy coach didn't see Hornish the legs get all fogged up it had to creates a lot of emotion you said it well Kirk a lot of emotion a lot of frustration close calls summer bears was all thirsty courts of the other this game is Clemson a very strong statement after allowing the opening touchdown held the Knowles offense the two field goals they got challenged early and they answered the call they they really I think again they did more in this game than anything we've seen all year of going up in the Florida State is still an athletic talented team and they took it away from they took the crown away from them before they achieved their ultimate goals they had to accomplish this tonight and they did it with 300 sue yards offense after intermission clemson has won the division but a lot more work to do to reach what they hope will be their ultimate goal the selection committees number one team played like it in the second half and they D thrown the threetime reigning ACC champions from Florida State with a 173 edge in the second half what a seat hearing close to the ballgame this quarterback this team Tony Elliott these coaches will never forget on ABC tonight it's the unbeaten Buckeyes hosting the Gophers on Saturday the football presented by
