============================================================

and Missouri when Larry Smith arrived at Missouri he wanted them back in the postseason four years later they have arrived the Missouri Tigers marched to San Diego has been led by junior quarterback Corby Jones he's the big 12 leader in total offense and he's already Heisman material in 98 the Colorado State Rams ran through the WAC with two big backs Kevin MacDougall and Damon Washington both averaged close to a hundred a game Colorado State the champions of the WAC Missouri the darlings of the big 12 the plymouth holiday ball its next Qualcomm Stadium always a great stage for what is always an entertaining ballgame it's the plymouth Holiday Bowl the 20th annual Plymouth Holiday Bowl our matchup tonight from the WAC the Colorado State Rams at number 17 from the big 12 the Tigers of Missouri at number 20 you saw Larry Smith Colorado State head coach Sonny Lubich as hard as work right now as well play reckless out there defensively swarm to the football your number one attempt in the turnovers because you swore defensively just keep doing the thing that got all here pursuing the football special teams you can win this game for us come up in our specialty take the private now if you've done all your life it's a blank move let's see this guy we want to see how physical footballs play with Shaw hi everyone rich wants rod Gilmore welcome to San Diego I know you're ready to hit somebody Sonny Lubich was very emotional when he talked to us two days ago as well he said big game obviously for us and big game for the company have those guys that get physical he wants to get after him right now he wants Colorado State to get some national respectability and he wants to whack to get it to they've lost bowl games already twice Colorado State is a last chance Missouri got some respectability and national attention the hard way remember the kick against Nebraska this is a very good football team one reason why their quarterback he's outstanding corby Jones yeah you can turn a program around when you have a great player like Corby Jones option quarterback great running quarterback great throwing quarterback he can get it done inside or out he's about 227 pounds and a real load when he's in the open field rich he can make plays all over the field he could be the difference in the ballgame when Sonny Lubich needs plays in his backfield he's got two guys to choose from Kevin MacDougall and Damon Washington they both can go for a hundred in the same game yeah well they both have gone over a thousand yards rushing this season mr. inside mr. outside Damon Washington mr. outside speed quickness and great vision McDougald inside strenght toughness great versatility he can get it done for him as well talking about the backfield of Colorado State the man that pulls the trigger is moses moreno outstanding quarterback and there's certainly a legacy of that here in the Holiday Bowl one big question about Moreno who threw 420 touchdown passes this year his right elbow the bursar sack I know it's not the most famous one in college football Peyton Manning's got one on his knee Moreno's right elbow may give him problems for a report here's Chris Marlowe all right rich ruptured bursa sac or not Moses does indeed have a sore elbow now we first heard that elbow in the San Diego State game a week later in the WAC championship he banged it hard again it swelled up to the size of a baseball he could barely throw and he suffered through the worst game of his season now tonight all Moses needs is a little protection he was thinking about wearing this pad he decided not to he is going to let his offensive line try to keep him upright now the other story were following tonight Missouri's Brian Cray craft he broke his leg November 8th against Nebraska and when he is healthy he is Missouri's best defensive lineman but you see him right there he is running in pain the key for Craig craft he is a run stopper Missouri has problem stopping the run if he can play 50% of the stops now if the snaps tonight I should say Missouri will be in business back to you Sonny lubic leading his Colorado State Rams on champions of the WAC they've been here twice in the last three years they have yet to get a win they want to stop that tonight in their sights the Missouri Tigers led by Larry Smith of the big 12 conference it's the Plymouth Holiday Bowl the Tigers of Missouri come in at number 20 Colorado State at number 17 19 previous holiday Bowls 12 have been decided by a touchdown or less we demand no less tonight the plymouth Holiday Bowl is brought to you by Janus noload mutual funds Jack Murphy field at Qualcomm Stadium home with a Plymouth Holliday ball as Colorado State gets set to meet in the Missouri Tigers a good crowd on hand Sonny lubic is here in just his fifth year three whack titles his Rams come in at 10 and to know Colorado State team has ever won 11 football games he'd like to add that notch to his belt Larry Smith has done it in a lot of places this is his fourth team into a ball game only three other coaches in history have done that this year a breakthrough year at seven and four five and three third in the northern Asia of the big 12 conference Missouri won the toss and elected to kick Scott nickman will kick it off daran Hall Kevin mcdougal our deep and the 20th annual Holiday Bowl is just underway it is traditionally a bowl game that has delighted with its fantastic finishes and as you've been telling me all week we're going to get that tonight both these teams put up a lot of points it'll be entertaining Nick Nick and it's home across the 25 and out to the 27 yard line flagged down as we look at Moses Moreno senior in a good 120 touchdowns this year nine interceptions and Missouri will watch Colorado State backed up on their first possession holding against the Rams starting lineups for Colorado State Damon Washington averaging 93 yards per game he's had some big games throughout he'll rotate with Kevin MacDougall Eli Worthman a very good tight end 18 catches had two touchdowns and a great offensive line as well we're ready to go moses moreno at the controls derek you'll in a two tight end set with eli workman and marina is gonna put it up swings it out to kevin mcdougal across the 20 mcdougal falls to the 27 yard line and he's got a first down a gain of about 12 i told you about the offensive line 30 secs this year anthony Cesario one of the best in the WAC firstteam pick Cesario and center Mike Newell have not given up a sack this year Richie noticed right off the bat the two tight end scent was out there but what they did was they forced him to put more guys to the two tight end set and they came back and ran the screen pass to the weak side where there were fewer players mcdougal did a nice job finishing it off both MacDougall and Washington the two backs can catch the football and mcdougal can lay a lick on you choose he's across the 30 out to the 32 yard line Colorado State has a big defense Missouri does not that might be a factor tonight it's a Missouri defense that does not put pressure on the passer Steve Erickson gets the start in place of Brian Craig craft as you heard Chris Marlowe talk about Craig crafts legs just 17 sacks for this unit al sterling is in the middle he's a junior he's a converted nose tackle a secondary that has 14 interceptions Harold Pierce Lee has 54 in his last four games there's a look at Erickson McDougal again across the 40 and MacDougal is across the 45 to the 47 yard line rod Gilmore you heard sunny little bit talk about it very important to establish his physical presence up front hey this is about answering a question is the WAC team tough enough to hang with a big 12 team and that's why they're coming out right now putting big bodies on smaller bodies and pounding away at them MacDougall heads up field and he's lowering the shoulder he's taking on people designing Lubich said be physical and they're coming out trying to be that way MacDougall had an absolutely huge game and the lack championship action swings it out to Eli work for the tight end and it's incomplete one thing rod we should address early on and that's the layoffs that these two teams have had for the Missouri Tigers their last football game was November 15th they beat Baylor Colorado State has played two football games since that date so you would expect that Colorado State would be a little bit more crisp than Missouri they played in the WAC championship just three weeks ago so they should be fresher more accustomed to the hitting and ready to go after it and they are starting out that way Moreno had an outstanding year completed sixtyone percent of his passes Jeff Turner in motion and it's Turner who has the close to midfield the gain of baby Harold fiercely made the stop significant that Jeff Turner is in the football game there is a question as to whether he was going to play because he has a bad knee you see he's limping off the field right now he was their leading receiver this season and they wanted to find out right away if he'd be able to play and it looks like as he limps off that knee is bothering it there are a couple of Rams that are dinged up in this one Missouri comes in very healthy third down set there's a look at Turner one of the emotional leaders on this football team Moreno's throw is cop Paul Turner with the catch very close to a first down Missouri plays a lot of mantoman coverage Colorado state expects to be able to beat the men coverage with Turner and others and this time just a quick short route you see the mantoman coverage right up in their face of the receivers Turner number five works inside against Chris and makes the reception a little bit strange there for Colorado State to have two receivers in the same area but Paul Turner the senior from San Diego was able to work his way inside and pick up what looks like a first down first down Colorado State initial Drive of this football game Moreno really spreads it around sunny Lubitz offense is an interesting hybrid of the spread offense a three receiver set but they run the ball first right if you've seen Washington State and teams like that they spread you out and they throw the ball well Colorado state spread throughout but the power game is what they're going to give you Paul Turner will make some catches 21 on the season but it's the power game that is the bread and butter for Colorado State Marino's other two targets on the outside Darren Hall and Corey McCoy also had 21 catchers it's a very balanced offensive tackle and it's something that's been missing for Colorado State in their two other holiday bowl trips mcdougal over the right side and he's hit hard they'll gain maybe a yard brought this defense for Missouri Kevin Ford making the stop Ben's doesn't break you know but they're gonna have to stop this play the old counter trey is going to come around in here they've got to be able to attack that thing and hit it behind the line of scrimmage they do a good job this time of getting into the backfill and hitting the linemen before they can turn upfield Missouri is smaller but they're quick so if they do that they can stop that play 19th in the nation against the run and that was a real concern for mo acne their defensive coordinator as well as Larry Smith little option look for morena pitch to mcdougal and he's outside mcdougal is inside the 35 to the 34yard lives last year he played both offense and defense they kept him on offense all year long and it paid off for the key for Colorado State is Eric Bailey and Anthony Cesario 71 and 72 when they get out front and lead a play they do a great job there you see Baylor with a nice block they do go further outside picking up good yardage but those two big guys on the right side are the key for the offensive line for Colorado State almost four minutes into this drive eight plays MacDougall in his offensive line have been a big part of a bailius senior at 295 third down short McDougal on a play that really stuttered from the start might just have the first down well they came again with the counter tray play the one that was stopped a few plays ago you come back with it they may have picked up the first down here but the thing that is really good to note is that Colorado State is really trying to be physical again you will see them again come again with the counter tray they run up the other way this time you see the guard tackle action pulley getting in front of mcdougal once again though Missouri does a good job of getting up the field Ford is in there to make the play but rich the WAC has a reputation of being a soft pass happy conference sunny movement wants to send a message to the country that they play physical football out here this is not a WAC team that our mommies and daddies told us about it's a different kind of wagon the tradition of the holiday fall the Jim McMahon's the wide open offense of BYU sunny lubic in the Rams are an outstanding team on the crown 220 yards per game MacDougall already has 30 in this one shotgun look from Marino houses with time swings it out it's holy McCoy the Junior and rich you see how the running game gives you the ability to have time to throw the ball Moreno has plenty of time to get this ball to McCoy watch how he has protection and see if this ball is a nicely thrown ball does his elbow bother him doesn't appear so he's comfortable he's sitting in the pocket not a real nice followthrough there but nevertheless plenty of time to get that ball out to McCoy no one around him boy he does a nice job of picking up the first down Daymond Washington in the backfield in motion his workmen on first and ten and it's Washington who has excellent speed on the outside he's inside the 20 out of bounds of the 19 yard line Daymond Washington four times this year was over a hundred yards his biggest game 188 and sunny Lubich told us two days ago he'll go to either one Dave in Washington for Kevin MacDougall they're close to averaging combined 200 a game well I mean these guys have done a great job mcdougal was the guy who was the star in the WAC conference championship game against New Mexico with 255 yards but Washington is a guy who really can turn it up a notch McDougal is back behind Moreno and he'll get it straight up the gut inside the 15 and it takes six Tigers to bring him down he's short of the first down it'll be third down and three last year two backs over a thousand yards this year two backs over a thousand yards that's quite an accomplishment oh you see what what branch did for them last year before moving on to the NFL and the Raiders Washington has done it two years in a row they do go well he'll have a chance to do it even more he's a guy that's been a twoway player for them initially a defensive back they moved him over with great results Colorado State apparently was listening when Sonny Lubich told him before the football game they want physical football will show they have muscled their way inside the 15 section 14 yards and the Rams are on the board first but you saw how that counter tray action was leading the run well they give the same action this time but they come back with the reverse that time back around that allows them to get the touchdown watch the end of the play as Hall goes down Oh Darrin Hall celebration with his teammates winds up heading back down here at the end he's hurt there and he's trying to get down to the ground and his teammates are holding him up he was clutching either his left shoulder or his left side looked like the rib area by the sophomore it's a sweet place to be for him Qualcomm Stadium he's a San Diego kid in a 14 yard touchdown and he appears to be alright in Sonny Lou bik's Rams have a six nothing lead and what a nice drive great play call me finishing it off with a play that comes off of plays they have been running earlier in the drive Brian Esslinger will hold it Derick France will kick it an impressively Colorado state champion to the wack have come out and put seven on the board in a Plymouth Holiday Bowl the Holiday Bowl is presented by Plymouth more fun more car that's Plymouth and in part by San Diego call one eight hundred seven oh one way for a free visitors planning guy Qualcomm Stadium home of the Plymouth Holiday Bowl Colorado State on top of Missouri only one possession in the football game so far CW Hurst will kick it off for Colorado State and a short kick which is fielded and out of bounds it goes at the 22 let's go back to that touchdown and watch what happens here you got to get this action again which we've seen before and then they come back with the reverse behind it that was a play they ran earlier in the drive to pick up ground yardage now they come back with the reverse it moves Missouri Paul gets into the endzone but takes a shot at the end from Chris and Perkins and it's a big hit at the end that knocks the wind out of him from this angle you can see it rich watch what happens at the end of the play always going to get sandwiched by two quarterbacks Chris and ha watch them as they show up with the hit right now as he comes through bangbang two shots nots the wind out of them but Hall is now okay the moral of this story don't let up until you're safely to the sideline for be Jones to the air has his man it's cut layman who can't hold on and it's incomplete a look at Corby Jones our first look at Chris Marlowe Chris all right rich you gave it away he did have the wind knocked out of him but he's got a sore rib to go with it now he's okay he'll be back in when the Rams get the ball back on offense Darrin Hall the first touchdown of the ball game and now our attention turns to the Missouri Tigers and their offense a welloiled machine it's been Corby Jones the Junior he has beaten teams with his legs and with his right on and it's Jones and stay has it in 11 games Missouri had just 14 turnovers in the second play tonight they've already got one they're playing a team that comes in with a plus 27 turnover margin they get another one here watch they hit at the end on corby Jones he's just trying to pick up a little extra yardage and he takes a shot right at the end from Taylor Willie Taylor he makes the hit and that makes the ball come out corby Jones has done a great job of protecting the football this season but he never saw that hit coming this time came from the back side had the ball up and Taylor knocked it out Rick crawl with the recovery he was very close to being down and now Colorado State back in business Moreno going D and I guess Darrin hauls ribs are okay he made a nice effort and shad Chris was okay too that was pretty good coverage out there there was never any separation between Hall and Chris watch how Chris stays with him at the end he never lets Hall separate that's great speed by Chris when you have a corner that can close like that you got yourself a real prospect which he is Colorado State defense and a look at Brian Craig Kraft who's in the football game inside handoff mcdougal smothered sterling with help from Justin Wyatt rich we saw Craig Kraft in the ball game he he broke the fibula in his leg which doesn't bear the most weight on the body but they say he's healthy enough to play but he's having a lot of pain and you can see he is still limping and he's still trying to play through it they want to play him early to see if he can work his way through it opportunity for the Rams they've converted all three on third and ten mcdougal slips and down he goes we were talking about turnovers both of these teams made that a big part of their resume here in 97 Colorado state just 13 Missouri 15 yeah here's Colorado State only 13 Missouri down here and that includes and that includes the fumble by Corby Jones tonight yeah and when you don't turn the ball over you have the best chance of winning football games that's why both these teams are in this bowl game Preston lows the punt and Missouri will get their second opportunity to move the football on 39yard part Colorado State on top of Missouri from above courtesy of the Goodyear blimp eagle based in Carson California the Goodyear blimp began covering football back in 1962 which Bowl rod Gilmore did they start with I don't know but we have a blimp that's great you know the Orange Bowl back in 62 is that right yeah well we got a blimp here man the Goodyear blimp second possession now for the Tigers it's the big pullback Ernest Blackwell straight ahead let's look at the offense at this Tiger Team 420 yards for a game 263 of it on the grounds I told you about core P Jones broccoli V is the blood and the guts of this Tiger Team Olivo 67 yards per game and 11 touchdowns Kent layman a big play guy 25 yards per catch that led the big 12 conference an offensive line that's given up just 19 sex rod ready they say as a future star just a sophomore and Mike Morris right next to him making his 40th straight start on the offensive line second and seven Jones man to bring down he's across the 25 they'll be short of the first down Colorado State's defense outstanding just 327 yards per game and they get to the quarterback 34 sacks on the season Clark Hagen's gets their the most 11 sacks for the sophomore out of Torrance Willie Taylor in the middle the junior with two picks a very active line backing crew for the defensive coordinator Larry Kirk and Myron Terry has 6 of 18 colorado state interceptions this year five the pitches to Devin West he's got the first down antara made the stop and the Tigers move the sticks I know Colorado State comes in here with the plan of taking the ball away from Corby Jones make him pigeon well that's okay except when you pitch it to Devin West and he makes a play like this it kind of makes you rethink that strategy Gorby Jones has got to give up the ball quickly here but Devin West is 215 pounds and has great speed and when he lowers his shoulders he can pick up the extra yardage and he did it right there so the plan is good but you gotta follow through and make sure Devin West doesn't get it done too West again across the 40 down by Willie Taylor you normally hear this in a passing offense rod but there sometimes aren't enough footballs for Larry Smith to go around offensively yeah but if you're a defensive back you got to make sure that you stay on your feet and that you can make some plays and Myron carry right here is going to find out that that's a little bit tough to do when you get guys on top of you he's going to come up to try and make a play he just gets hit right here watch bang you got to be a hitter you can't be the hit he and Meyer and Terry was taken at that time there are a lot of hitters in the Missouri backfield this man 40 jabus who has hit a big one here inside the thirties down to the 25yard line 33 yard pickup well when you get the quarterback coming down the line on the option you always assign somebody to it you got to make sure that you get there it looks like this time they wanted the free safety to get there and take care of the quarterback Meyer and Terry doesn't look like he gets there he's coming over here comes a quarterback now Corby Jones up in the in the lane Terry's late getting over hard to make that play Gorby Jones can make you pay if you do not account for him on each and every play that time Corby Jones got the offense going big time and rich as good as advertised we've got a right open game Jones as his man it's Eddie Brooks is tied in first down Missouri is Eason Ramson on the stop well when Corby Jones makes a play on the ground he gains confidence and that's when you wanted to throw the ball when he's confident well he does it here over pursuit once again by Colorado State they're trying to contain Corby Jones so they make sure that they keep him in the pocket but they don't get pressure up the middle on it that Willie Taylor was there to hit him I can tell you one thing that Colorado State is making right now is corby Jones on the option and Mary Smith is probably thinking yeah that's not a bad thing to do down here I want my best player to have the ball and Gorby Jones is his best player he's 227 pounds and he makes good decisions judges this time to keep it inside the five down to the three third down Missouri can get a first down inside the one and see when you have a guy that is that good you can know what the play is but he still makes you pay for it now watch Kirby Jones here we talked about decisions but what about athletic ability right now he says it's not there let me go back the other way he changed stops on a dime makes the play and picks up something when there was nothing now flags down there was time on the play clock prior to the snap false start on the offense fiveyard penalty till third down a big tent officiating crew tonight big tender wherever you can certainly tell when there's movement and it's right up there you see it looks like it was a tighten up top stew he was the guy that moved number 88 takes to be the big tight end who's been a great blocker Missouri all season long this makes it a tough passing situation rich there's not a lot of room for receivers to work down there only about 18 yards Colorado State's scored on almost a sixminute Drive and Missouri has run some clock as they moved the football in this one on third down charges get you down it was just a freshman with a big head actually there were pretty good protection by Missouri they didn't have enough time to get receivers open we talked about how everything is condensed down there initially Corby Jones has time good poggit he pulls it down because no one's open that gives been a time to come in and make the hit Bryan Douglas the holder and the kick from Scott nickman is good Missouri is on the board the tiger Colorado State in the Plymouth Holiday Bowl Colorado state seven Missouri three minute and a half left first quarter rich Waltz rod Gilmore Chris Marlowe do the fun activities like what they do yeah in San Diego and Scot nickman who's field goes but Missouri on the board we'll kick it off very accurate field goal kicker hit on 11 of 13 throughout the seasons you get a holiday bow you get a fantastic start kevin mcdougal may be the largest kickoff returner in the country is not across the 22 the 23 yard line ESPN continues its bowl week coverage tomorrow at 8 number 20 for Oklahoma State number 16 Purdue the Boilermakers the Cowboys in the Builders square Alamo Bowl 2 tbspn tomorrow for all the full week excitement here in the Plymouth Holiday Bowl both teams with impressive drives Colorado State almost a sixminute drive you can see Missouri's Drive there over five minutes Moreno gives to Washington Ross the 25 to the 26 down to the sidelines Chris Marlo I'm ready it's one of the teams due this week when they weren't practicing football let me give you the quick rundown barbecues they went to the beach they had lunch on an aircraft carrier they went to the zoo they went the Disneyland and SeaWorld and by the way I asked Larry Smith who went to SeaWorld and the zoo which did he liked better and Larry Smith told me Chris I'm a su man I'm an oldfashioned kind of guy that likes lions and tigers 7:3 football game Moreno's put Dallas Davis with the catch and it's a first down a nice job by Marino and a nice route by the tide in and takes the coverage away Marino looks to the right makes the play but he has good help when his tight in comes down on here and that pulls the linebacker 39 out of the way you'll see there would be someone crossing his face and that opens up the the area over there and it looked like it was Odum 39 who was unable to get in the throwing lane turn he has another Colorado State first down flags down there's no flag on Larry Smith his fourth year how often does that happen you get a flag and it gets waved off usually the holding is called just on general principle they'll measure for the first time we're talking about Larry Smith 21st year overall six years at USC went to three Rose Bowls with the Trojans seven years at Arizona four years at Tulane has brought his fourth team to a postseason bowl game well and I think a lot of people are happy for Larry Smith that he's gotten this thing turned around in Missouri remember he was at USC for six years with the Rose Bowl his first three years last three seasons 1717 and two and then was unceremoniously dumped by USC and there you see what he's done and he's only one of four coaches have taken four different teams to bowl game Lou Holtz did it Earl Bruce and Bill Mallory Larry Smith has a formula that works for turning programs around short of the first down it's mcdougal and he's crunched now sterling and Marquis Gibson the first to to hit him it'll bring up third down in short first quarter in the books the Rams by four seven three Colorado State on top at Qualcomm Stadium they still do call it Jack Murphy field if you want to use the Murph you can third down short for Colorado State Derek you'll in motion its McDougal who needs a yard and a half I think he has it first down Colorado state some key plays in the first quarter pretty much Colorado State getting it done counter play and then the reverse off of it Darren Hogg getting the touchdown to put Colorado State up 7 nothing and then on the other side of the ball they handled Corby Jones down inside the 20 to make sure he wasn't able to get into the end zone 7 3 Colorado State and at first in 10 just short of midfield it's Washington who slides through to the 46 yard line now one of the problems for Missouri is that they're pretty small defensively particularly at the ends and the linebackers marquise grissom Grissom right Gibson number nine is only about 218 pounds and he's down as a lineman and you see how he gets handled on the line of scrimmage if he can't stay in there and handle the linemen they're gonna have to find a way to give him some support because he's always 118 pounds he's a better hitter than marquise Christian I don't know marquise can hit that ball a little bit in the football stretch yeah he was looking for Paul Turner Wade Perkins the junior out of Las Vegas made the play yeah and what everybody likes about Moreno Moreno is his ability to stand in and be a tough quarterback and he knew he was gonna get hit on that play and he just stood there and took the shots and quarterback at this level and at the next level have got to be able to stand in and take the punishment he knows it's coming and he gets it from two guys but he hangs in there nevertheless you heard Chris Marlowe say earlier though that right elbow very tender so far so good not so good in the WAC championship game it they had to shut door the ball fires this one enhances man Dallas Davis with the catch first down Colorado State same pattern rod and they beat Wade Perkins the man that made the play nothing but a 3ds own coverage here and when you're able to get that and run off of it you can do something with it here you see three deep coverage here just take down and run outside you get good pass protection you can deliver the ball you see them dropping back three deep coverage just run the out pattern there's nobody underneath the receiver plenty of room to make the throw first and ten Colorado state has dominated the football so far Washington to the 30 it's a gain of two and I think Missouri is a little bit surprised by that and Colorado State is doing exactly what sunny Lubich said at the outset be physical they're trying to establish at the WAC is a tough conference they play hardnosed football and that's exactly what Colorado State is doing right now for all the memories in this football game surrounding the WAC conference the WAC has struggled in this game since 1986 the Western Athletic Conference has won just twice here in the Holiday Bowl BYU and 91 and the last time they won in 92 the Rainbows of Hawaii sunny Lubich has been here twice Austin Kansas State and a Michigan meringue on second and thrilled by he's Gibson he is a better hitter than bar but that's his game right there speak and Moreno is down and a real concern for Colorado State although it doesn't look like they're looking at the right elbow Moises Moreno was down that time he took a big shot from Marquis Gibson and we told you about him being a tough guy he had tough guys get hurt from time to time another look Gibson 220 pounds he was a JC top pass rushing specialist he uses his speed and quickness to blow right by the tackle and to get there I mean when you can come around the tackle that quickly you've got a chance you see that there was nobody who was gonna help out that time Damon Washington number 20 was looking to get out on a screen pass and he never ever saw the guy coming Bryan Esslinger will come in and play quarterback Moreno is had a good night so far six of nine on the sidelines for now Esslinger has attempted just 18 passes this year but he's hit on 13 of them he's a junior at a Pueblo Colorado option look Washington Marquis Gibson again but you know he put this man on the sidelines by delivering a big hit he must have been using the Louisville Slugger beret No look in realtime it Moses going down you know that's significant for Missouri rod they had just 17 sacks this year in 11 games it's not a whole lot question Lowe's gets a nice bounce down to about the 11 yard line Moises Marino trying to get his senses back 7:3 a gorgeous night in San Diego for the Plymouth Holiday Bowl the mentality Bowl is presented by Clement for more fun more car that's Plymouth and in part by San Diego call 1 800 700 one way for a free visitors planning guy as they work on State Defense now trying to keep Missouri inside the 10yard line Ernest black wire to the 12 it's a gain of maybe a yard what's up with Moses Marino Chris Marlowe all right he got blasted by the big hit the trainer tells me he's sore and beat up but he is going to come back in the next series so count on moses moreno to be back out when the office takes the fifth back thanks Chris because you mentioned the elbow problem he came in with and if he starts taking a pounding on the rest of his body they may wind up doing what they did a couple of weeks ago which was give up on throwing the ball and just run it all day they did that against New Mexico and boy did they run it all day and with a lot of success that was in the lack championship game Barbie Jones trying to get the Tigers on track and Jones has stopped at the 14 yard line a bunch of rams there to get him Myron Terry Greg Haller at the bottom of the pile well the thing is they're so fast right now Colorado State their linebackers flow so quickly that Corby Jones is not getting to the corner and they're doing a real good job of handling the inn and making sure he can't turn it upfield Corby Jones is probably going to have to wind up looking at running the counter and get them flowing one way and to come back the other way to try and take advantage of this the speed of the line back at the Colorado State one of two tonight on third brach Olivos number yet he's in the backfield Jones to the sidelines and it's broken up by the Eric Olsen and Olson saw that coming a mile away and the reason he saw it rich is that they only had one receiver out on the pattern and with one receiver out there was no threat inside and so Olson knew that he could come up and help right away look double coverage there he's coming over now he knows that's the only receiver he has to be concerned about and he just drives the football would have helped out Jones if the receiver had worked back to the ball a little bit Torrey Coleman the intended receiver Vince SIBO sans Shu a problem area from his averaging just 39 a kickbutt this one is a missile goodness inside the 20 no problem there 62 yards for the sophomore Moses Moreno ready to answer the call Colorado State on top of Missouri snow Colonel Bowie continues as Clemson battles Auburn in the chickfila Peach Bowl cleansing Auburn Friday at 3:00 on ESPN and he continues to throw the ball well if you got to put him in the ballgame you might as well find out right away if he can play see if he can throw the ball well he comes in and he fires a dart picks up another first down we talked about how tough this guy is he's an accurate quarterback and he's tough again he's just been knocked around he comes right back in and fires her doc a dart right out there but he looked like it hurt him a little bit you see the end there he kind of closed his eyes and looked down I think he's having a little bit of pain Sunnie Lubich watching this measurement turn her very close to the first down fifth year for lubic and talk about making an impression early on his third wack title this year 94 95 in here at 97 was an assistant with the defensive coordinator at Miami for Dennis Erickson before he came to Colorado State he knows about deep Missouri has established some goals for themselves as well to try and contain Colorado State and other opponents one of the things that we knew they wanted to do was try and hold Colorado State to about three point three yards a carry they haven't quite done that tonight but they're getting better at it's been about three point six yards of carry so far second and very short Kevin mcdougal the long setback and straight ahead he goes top running by kevin mcdougal first down Colorado State we started talking about the Missouri goals we're here they are they want to make sure they don't give up any thrives over 12 plays third down percentage they want to keep it to 33 percent or less defensive coordinator Moute Ankeny has established this he also wants to get a turnover within the 30yard line and also control the sudden change when the sudden change sudden change means it's a change in momentum you have a turnover you got to go out there and stop them and that's what they did to Colorado State in the first quarter you saw that on the top of the list no drives over 12 plays first try 13 plays 85 yards of his apollo's stays on his feet and wisely goes down with a slide across the 35yard line cauldron off Easter made the stop promoting he has to be pleased with the way that his defense is playing right now it's undersized they know that but there's fast they're quick they can make plays they put enough pressure to keep Moreno kind of under control right now you see a nice job of Erickson just slightly through the block of Bailey to get there and almost make the sack it's effort like that that they're going to need to keep pressure on Moreno eleven David Washington tripped up Barry Odom with the stop and David Washington is feeling it he felt it was right there he just barely got tripped up if he hadn't been tripped up he still would be going rarely do you say this about a team that is a ball possession team that eats up yardage on the ground the Colorado State is a big play running championship game Washington had a 51yard er mcdougal and three over 40 yards five of seven on third down what's coming the draw Washington and Missouri's got it Donald Jones forced the fumble and recovered it as well but it's not a takeaway inside the 30yard line but mo acne will take it it's a take away nevertheless and it puts Missouri in position to get a quick score watch the end of the run Washington trying to fight a little bit to pick up something extra and he just loses the ball there he loses the ball and then Nell Jones makes the recovery but it did look like Jones knocked it out it looked like that ball either came out by itself or was knocked out by someone else and that's right it's sterling 48 Alice sterling got a helmet right on the ball and Jones recovered it turnovers a buck apiece before the judge is going to throw the least attempt to inside the 30 sar the 20 or be Jones and the Tigers perched down inside the Colorado State 20yard line and this is what is so maddening about Corby Jones I mean you play perfect defense you take away the play he wants and he still beats you for big yardage Hey look here they're gonna they're not going to bite on this thing at all they're gonna double cutter the deep pass off the option they're gonna be all over this thing rich nobody is open they know it they have the play stop right wrong Corby Jones takes off and makes another play a big play Clarke Higgins chasing Jones on that play it's the first time we've called his name inside the 15 down to the 12 he is a unique individual broccoli for the senior has a reputation that is probably going to carry him down in history of Missouri his number is going to be retired therefore having won the National Special Teams Player of the Year award so they don't retire his number the mostly to to ku a war Moe hanky right now surrounded by the defense you can see takeaways on that list James they ignore he's got a first down its first in golf for Missouri look at San Diego the Holiday Bowl to Plymouth Holiday Bowl festival going on all week the pictures brought to you by the Goodyear blimp eagle based in Carson California our pilot Tom mattis was out of Huntington Beach this city of course bracing for the biggest one the Superbowl that's right great January right here in this stadium about a month away and James in the backfield James straight at home this man is 63 276 pounds and he's a fullback he's not alive in her a tight end moved to fullback he's a fullback yeah and that's right at 275 you weren't an exaggerator big guy and perhaps the best blocking fullback way in the country and earlier in the season they were really trying to do a lot with him he was slamming outside blocking people in there running behind him and they weren't giving exactly what they needed they started working him inside more and letting Jones take over with the offense second down and goal James has not scored a touchdown on the ground this year and just 32 carries coming in Kobe Jones's gonna punch a touchdown he's got another one his fifteenth of the season and the Tigers capitalize on a Colorado State turnover but it's the first question is really did Courtney Jones get into that endzone looked kind of kind of strained from this angle Scot nickman the kick and the Tigers take away first time in this football game said seven Missouri on top of Colorado State they're already talking Heisman Trophy in 98 for that man Corby Jones out of the big 12 Missouri on top of the wax champion Colorado State ten seven Corby jokes Jeff's getting in the inside yeah now watch the end of this play that we thought from our angle that maybe he didn't get in but watch the extra effort he gets his shoulder over and the ball over clearly a touchdown and somehow he kept his hand on the ball with all that humanity on top of him five to the 26 but Jones didn't do it by himself watch two things here rich one the block and then second you'll see Jones finish the run you'll see a nice block by right there Ron James 34 but then at the end the extra effort by Corby Jones now again you'll see it from this angle a great block by James Wright their 34 and then the extra effort at the end 221 pounds for B Jones getting into the end zone taking on Terry number two Byron Terry 206 not often that a quarterback then deliver a blow like that possession colorado state took it down the field by 85 yards douche for the third No against New Mexico touchdown runs of 66 44 and 42 that a 52 yarder and once again it's the inside blocking of Cesario right there 72 and 71 this play we've seen all day long they've run the counter tray once again they get out in front but it's the effort by MacDougall that takes what should be about an eight yard run into a huge run for him he goes 52 yards he now has 91 yards on 12 carries once again rich this action that run this play all night long again breaking tackles that's the big play for Colorado State McDougald was a safety and a running back last year he said playing safety helped him as a running back he delivered a blow that time timeout missouri colorado state is on the move Cole Whitt continuing there Colorado State and majority limit Holiday Bowl Colorado State on the move at the missouri 22 McCoy don't touch Karina was hurt some bit here man in the mid coverage when you're locked in you can't get beat time moreno beats the man for the touchdown wide open against the mantoman coverage for the easy touchdown beating Easter one of the toughest things about played Colorado State they are a running team that can throw the football coming up at halftime we're headed to Pasadena let's go there right now with Chris Powell well rich thank you yeah if you take the i5 north couple hours then turn off on the 110 we're at dead ends right here at the Rose Bowl have our halftime report Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit will join me we'll have a report on the Rose Bowl focusing on the wazoo running back Michael black from Miami an Orange Bowl breakdown Tom Osborne's farewell game and courtesy of ESPN news we have bowl game highlights from this afternoon all that coming up at halftime from Pasadena back down to San Diego thanks Chris you know there's a Washington State connection to Colorado State in a roundabout way Sonny lubic is a guy that really paid his dues as a coach and we've seen this a couple of times rod Gilmore where we've traveled the country and talked to coaches this year Sonny lubic played his high school football for a coach named Jim Sweeney some people have heard of him some people have it in Butte Montana that's where he started sweetie of course coached at Washington State coached Fresno State at Montana State as well now to the 25yard line Mike price the head coach at Washington State just one of the Jim sweetie disciples ain't coaching today let's get out of the sidelines Chris Marlowe all right you're looking at the brandnew Plymouth Prowler a beautiful car and with me now Nick Verna the zone manager for Chrysler Corporation in Southern California Nick your thoughts on the first half so far chris is a great football game we've got two great schools and it's just turning out the big game we really expected to be now Chrysler not only the title sponsor of this event but involved in painting the stadium tell us about that yeah last month the stadium needed to paint a little paint job and we got some City volunteers and I want to thank all the people at San Diego that volunteered to come out we rarely great to be associated with the Plymouth Holiday Bowl the Prowler right behind me how important a car is this for Plymouth in Chrysler it's very important is our image car is our statement that we're making to the public we all have a great line of Plymouth products loaded into van behind us the breeze the neon we got a great lineup for 98 all right Nick congratulations on a new line of cars how about one of these things for Marlo the Prowler for Marlo that would be a beauty let's do it we'll take care of it after the game all right give me the case all right back to you guys I'm going with Chris I think he'll be getting the Hot Wheels version of it there's a look at Sunny Lubich Lubich of course and Dennis Erickson was another guy that was influenced by Jim Sweeney and he worked with Jack out way sunny whoo big did as well a Missouri poor Vee Jones the pitch Devon West across the 30 across the 35 and Missouri has a first down Rick Cabral made the Sun well Colorado State really hasn't stopped Corby Jones yet tonight and he's picked up 77 yards on seven carries but Devin West is also picking it up when Corby Jones doesn't have the ball he's making some play he's getting good blocking out there on the edge Blackwell does a nice job but these guys just haven't had the ball a lot the more they get the ball the more they'll do Devin West 33 yards on four carry 15 on that last one approaching three and a half minutes left second quarter Blackwell the fullback not the critic straight ahead he's out to the 44 yard line well you can't be very critical of Blackwell this is a guy who has real NFL potential and he's 235 pounds and he is the fastest man on that team Scouts love him and actually Smith would love to give the ball to him a lot more but he's got so many backs he can't do it yeah I mean Larry Smith told us he's one of those guys that's faster when he's chased 2:35 guy that quick has a future on Sunday it's down to the sidelines Chris Marlowe Chris all right just minutes ago I overheard sunny Lubich telling his defense to watch the tiger offensive line he said watch the splits that will give away where Missouri is going tight line splits Missouri will have a tendency to run outside wide splits the Tigers will go up the middle back to you guys that's a good stats good stuff down there Chris what he's talking about is the space between one lineman and the next lineman when their clothes are together see you see all that room right there that means that they're gonna go outside according to sunny movement and see if it happens those are pretty wide squit they do go outside with Jones on the pitch West and he's gotten the first down to the 42 yard line that's one thing to know what they're going to do it's another thing to stop it and the wide splits gives them the key that they know that going outside but look what they have coming outside you've got a 215 pound back with the lead back of about 235 pounds that's tough stuff but that man right now is picking up all the clues on Missouri you know he was Dennis Erickson's defensive coordinator at Miami and he probably could have had that job and he wanted it when Erickson left to go to the Seattle Seahawks the elected to stay in four columns though and they're glad he did Toby Jones with a rifle shot that's dropped in the end zone by Dennis Randall who had an easy interception had he held it Dennis Randall did a great job he didn't bite on the playaction fake there he was not thinking about it but you know there's a reason that guys like Randall and myself and others played in the secondary because we couldn't catch if you can catch they turn you into a wide receiver you can't catch you're a defensive back a great coverage by Randall though second intent Barbee Jones had 12 touchdown passes this year right now Missouri not moving it through the air almost solely on the grass has a big hole and he's outside Devin West he's 20 he's 10 and he's out of bounds at the 7 eric olson chased him out and missouri is in business as we come to the final moments of this first half we talked about great blocking this man right here Blackwell's going to do a great job he knocks off the blind backer and opens up the inside for Devin West once again allowing him to get into the secondary a 35 yard run six carries now 78 yards for Devin West picking up the slack for Missouri I'm first and goal it's Blackrock and Missouri answers loser no clues Missouri ran right over Colorado stayed on that drop that they did in 62 Morris does a nice job blocking inside why not let the man who deliver the great block on the last play get the touchdown here but what a nice job by Morris the guard number 62 and the kick is good the holiday Boehm has been long known for its shootouts and it's wild endings my scoring affair right now but not in the in the Holiday Bowl fashion it's on the ground and it's a lot of fun to watch Missouri a 1714 lead hey the Rose Bowl just fi5 as Chris Fowler pointed out it's 4:30 on ABC Michigan and Washington state for a national championship Volkov stadiums side of the Super Bowl this year and home to the Plymouth Holiday Bowl a rich on that touchdown we told you about the blocking of the tackle watch the block here of the sinner reading Rob Reid he's gonna do a nice job of really knocking the tackle out of the way creating a crease and that is a great job when your sinner can do a job like that and get a little help from the guard Morris it makes a huge huge opening more 62 gets a nice block to the right of the screen and in its read the inside who just clears out the way it's a very talented offensive line for Missouri ready surrounded by Mike Morris and Chris Heimburger Todd Niemeyer Travis beeble McDougal scoops it up and breaks a few tackles out to the 24 yard line mcdougal may be hurt and that obviously is not good news for Colorado State it looks like it's the lower part of his leg the ankle or knee but he was struggling to make sure he picked up this ball as it was loose and maybe at the end we can see what happens it's hard to tell from that angle but it looked like somebody rolled on him a little bit yeah yeah left ankle Moreno back to the air a tumbling catch by Dallas Davis and he made it an 11yard pickup Colorado State with the first down and rod will get a chance to see now Moses Moreno in the twominute drill that's exactly right he's going to have to make sure that he does and wisely you don't want to turn the ball over here when you've got a chance to get something going if you move it out into the area where you can get a field goal or seven points inside Tosh Darren and he's close to the first down shed Chris made the stop Colorado State has all three timeouts left and they are looking at the left ankles Kevin MacDougall second and short and it's Dallas Davis and I'll tell you what Moises Moreno was not advertised as having a strong nose that very accurately yeah but watch how much room that the defensive backs are giving the corner the receivers see all the room they're still backpedaling when the receiver is making his move to the outside they're guarding against the deep ball they're giving up the shorter routes the Colorado State's heating it up for Stidham 10 grams on the moon take the shack and probably burn a timeout here they will with 42 seconds left in the first half Justin Wyatt made the sack a rich we were just talking about the corners playing soft well on that plate they came up a lot closer and took away the short route Missouri is on top don't go anywhere Colorado State trying to stick it in when we're back 17:14 Missouri on top of Colorado State 42 seconds left as the Rams they set it down in 13 2 timeouts left the pelvis completed six straight sterling and rich I don't know why you call the timeout here now I mean you've just been sacked by sterling and you're way out of here now 36 seconds and you burn a timeout you might wind up giving Missouri a chance and what sterling is going to get in here from the backside Marino can't not get away from him and now immediately his reaction is to call a timeout well now you have a third and forever and you might give Missouri a chance to get the ball back third down in 26 let's head to the sidelines Kevin mcdougal turned that ankle update Chris Marlowe yeah he did turn the ankle he's trying to walk it off I know it's not very professional but just a moment ago I shouted to him how you doing he said I'm fine I'm fine I think I'll be back in he's done yes he is no question about that in the Colorado State booth Steve Fairchild the offensive coordinator yep he's right there on the right and Larry Kerr the defensive coordinator he's right there on the left right now the Fairchild is the one who was on the spot trying to make sure they get something done there's three plays of his drive 33 yards the last two 16 he's leafing through the playbook right now going okay let's see third down 26 their dad 26 what do we got third down 27 I've got a script for that Missouri we had just 17 sacks all year's been there four times it's Washington let's see if Missouri burns a timeout probably not because Colorado State where the punt can stick it inside the 10 Fairchild on the right her on the left Sundy lubic the guy who's one of the first things he did when he became a head coach rod Gilmore was promised himself he will let his assistant coaches coach that's a hard thing for him to do we're talking about a guy who won four national titles at Miami was a defensive specialist and now he's got Larry Kert doing the job here and he winds up peaking in our meetings a lot Larry Smith and Sonny Lubbock will head in the locker rooms and in the 20th annual equipment Holiday Bowl the Missouri Tigers had 20th in the nation with a 1714 lead and Missouri is actually called the timeout but there is no time left on the clock well you know you mentioned that they wouldn't want to have the punt go back into their own territory but I was thinking here now wait a minute why not force them to at least make the kick you might get something out of that they might block it it might have a bad snap actually Colorado State put themselves in this position by calling the timeout when they had the sack when they should have let the clock run so I don't know why Missouri would not take the shot here and try and at least get something for nothing if your Colorado State why even hunt the ball with to say you don't you Neal that's why they should have called the timeout a long time ago instead of letting the clock run down in two seconds they have one timeout to burn Missouri does and they're going to take it to the locker room with we'll probably heal but he might want to pause a second just to make sure that the thought does expire Washington will take you inside the 35 and he's out of bounds in the 27 yard line sunny little bit looking for his first 17:14 Missouri on top let's head up the road to Pasadena and Chris Fowler Tigers returning from halftime of the Plymouth Holiday Bowl the Tigers on top Colorado State a 1714 football game with a numbered 20 Tiger Richville sila with rod Gilmore holiday Bulls are supposed to be like this one team gets the lead now the team comes back I guess the twist here tonight rod is that both teams are doing it on the ground yeah I think that's right but no surprise it's been as good as advertised a lot of offensive explosion in the first half and a very physical football game all right let's talk numbers and let's talk highlights for Colorado State for the Rams they've been doing it on the ground all year they got off to a great start a tremendous drive 85 yards 13 plays capped by this well they ran the counter play counter plan come back with the reverse off the counter Darren Hall getting the touchdown from about 14 yards out then after that moses moreno showing that that right arm is okay Cory McCoy with that catch and that for Colorado State they're two touchdowns I was impressed with Missouri Corby Jones has been doing it all year long he's the guy that really led them back in this one yeah he did you know but they only had 27 offensive plays in the first half and so pretty good job by Colorado State to keep him off the field but they're ahead in the ball game and they had the ball game because Corby Jones got into the endzone first to get things going for Missouri a four yard touchdown run and then they come back after a big run with Blackwell finishing it off to get in the end zone and that put Colorado State behind Missouri now is it 1714 Missouri's favored numbers from the first half total yardage pretty impressive for both sides blue the passing yards though for Missouri Bobby Jones hasn't been able to really get much going through the air but then he hasn't had to but sooner or later he's going to have to complete a couple of passes downfield they've tried on the option pass play but they have not food Colorado State one turnover a piece you might think that's low for these two teams that's high these two teams two of the best in the country at not turning it over thing I'm most impressed with is Colorado State 41 plays only 27 for Missouri Missouri will get the football at least they'll try to ricky ross fumbled it and he pays it pays the price bag of the seven good special teams work sonny lubic said before the football game our special teams can win this game and right now the special teams have put Missouri in a hole to start things here in the second half but you don't want to start this way in the second half and Ross Jess takes his eyes off the ball hits him right in the shoulder pads and then he has to scramble just to get back on the ball but he did a nice job of keeping his composure and not panicking Tigers with awful field position now inside their 10 brach Olivo who did not touch the football bunch in the first half games about two yards down to the sidelines Chris Marlowe Chris alright guys I talked to Larry Smith at the half he thought his team was rusty showed good poise what adjustment is going to make is to run inside more against the spread out Colorado State defense back to you Chris apparently swept up in that halftime extravaganza we lost him they did I think the X game bikers they took the car not to the 14yard line third down now very important for Missouri to come out and establish some sort of tempo they've had some big plays in the first half but they really haven't established stride they need that man for B Jones to convert something on third down they haven't been real good about that yet this ball game and now's the time for Corby Jones to come out in the second half and prove he can make plays happen on third down well as Chris pointed out the rush that Missouri may have had after played their last football game on the 15th of November melting away a bit Jones on the move and it's a first down hint layman the sophomore with a catch 22 yard pickup oh we talked about Corby Jones making a play on third down he did at that time most of the time you think about Corby Jones looking to run not on this pathway he finds layman in between the zones behind the corner and in front of the safety and layman just waits out there busting Jones to find him and Jones does a nice job of not tucking the ball down and running instead he finds his receiver for the first down blaming a big play guy averaged over 25 yards a catch best in the big 12 Jones again to the air across the 40 it's a gain of about form but we saw Moses Moreno take some hits in that first half and look who's warming up Ryan Esslinger the junior Moreno had the sore right elbow in a sort everything else when Marquis Gibson planned him in the turf here at Qualcomm Stadium remember that he was also bleeding from his hand because he had his hand up around the shoulder pads when Gibson hit him and his helmet cut open his hand as well so Morano is the little Moreno's little bit banged up Missouri has dug themselves out of bad field position they started this drive inside their 10 John's trying to string it out Colorado State with a nice stop let's go down to the sidelines a Moreno update Chris Marlowe alright Moses Moreno badly sprained right foot not sure if he's going to start this series obviously Esslinger is warming up a couple of other notes Jeff Turner has aggravated his knee he's out for the game and Kevin MacDougall has a severely sprained left ankle he's sitting right in front of me he hopes to get back in back to you guys who Rich the problem with sprained ankles is that the more time you're off of them the more they stiffen up and the harder it is to get back and play so the worst thing for Turner with his knee also was to be out after that and with mcdougal his sprained ankle certainly only got worse during halftime and another colorado state ram is down right now Sonny Lubich has seen his team lose some players near the end of the season we just talked about a couple of them Rick Kroll the sophomore the linebacker is the player down we'll check in with him when we get back to the Plymouth Holiday Bowl the plymouth Holiday Bowl is presented by Plymouth more fun more car that's Plymouth and in part by San Diego call 1800 seven oh one wage for a free visitors planning guy rich Waltz rod Gilmore along with Chris Marlowe back in San Diego written Kroll the song for linebacker from Colorado State on the sidelines they've already had Moses Moreno Kevin MacDougall and Jeff Turner banged up on their offensive side of the ball or B Jones swings it out it's broccoli Bowl he's out to the 44yard line he'll be short of the first down you know originated Kwame is in the game for Colorado State at linebacker one of their top players and he made that tackle finish it off over there and it's good to see him in the ball game because he's been banged up yeah he had a sprained foot coming into this football game rather Colorado State the good news is they played two games after Missouri ended their season the bad news is they had some guys nicked up in those games Vincey ball routed 162 yards his last timeout Darrin hog and hogs got some room add some speed Colorado State his second score of the ball game and what a sunny look at say at the top of the show special teams and talking to his team you guys can make the difference plus great brought to get it going and it's spread out wide open for Hall and now watch the Jets there are three guys who have the angle but he has so much speed there is no way that anybody can get him he outruns the angle each and every time that's his second touchdown of the night rado stayed on top longest punt return for a touchdown at Holiday Bowl history at Colorado State leads 20 to 17 ESPN continues its Boeing coverage Wednesday 3:30 number 22 Southern Miss against the Pitt Panthers in the Liberty Bowl Wednesday at 3:30 Bowl week continues right here on ESPN all three of us will be there for that one Southern Miss and Pitt 85 yard punt return it's a record of Colorado State does a nice job up here of holding up the Missouri guys going down on the tackles they don't I honor that get down there because they hold them up that creates spacing and that's all the room that Hall needs to show you his jets he's got a lot of get up and go and nobody could get there to him two yards better than the former record vai Sikahema a BYU a great special teamer yeah a great boxer in the endzone dancing the end not a bad dance there from Aaron Paul he's learning to get pretty good at it for his second touchdown of the night so Colorado State has the lead 21:17 what have you ever seen a Holiday Bowl game when it wasn't back and forth to be changing hands all the time now Missouri will get in devon west not to the 33yard line Erik Olson made the stop now if your Missouri you've seen this momentum shift a couple times in this football game you know there are no strangers to close games rod they had a bunch of them at the end of the season the two overtime win at Oklahoma State 5150 they won on the road at Colorado everyone thinks about that Nebraska game and the seesaw game as well but those two wins it really showed that Missouri has arrived in Devin West arrives at the 44 yard line with a gain of about 11 Dennis Randall made the stop a rich member sanny little dig said that when he sees the wide splits of the linemen that means that they're gonna run outside when they're in tight they're gonna run inside while they ran inside that time you believe that the splits had to be tighter and his Larry Smith told Chris Marlowe coming out of the locker room Missouri would like to exploit up the middle see these secrets seen before that's a lot tighter that means they're running inside option Wesch nice move to get outside good state/territory multiple flags are down and deservedly so you see that was a very late hit rich we talked about the splits before the play and it looks like Missouri has caught on to the fact that Colorado State is on to that so they didn't have the big split and they ran the option outside trying to cross up Colorado State a little bit and then the personal foul at the end that was a blatantly late hit dead ball personal foul on the defense 15 yards another look Devin Weston making plays watch the end Ramson maids that makes the tackle here now watch someone comes flying in at the very last minute and that's Taylor that looks like Taylor came in no it's actually Ross 44 not 45 Taylor Adrian Ross Jones overthrew his man J Murchison who was open he had him he had him open inside but he got the ball up too high he was afraid of throwing it lower because there was a defensive player in front they wanted to get over the head you see this man right here he wants to get over his head and he wants to drop it in there but he gets it up to high and Murchison can't make the play in the box the man in the middle with the silver hair Gerry burnt right there there he is on 2nd and 10 west inside the 30 a gain of about 4 brick crawl who is back in the football game made the stop which I think that Missouri is in the area where it's to down territory and because Jones hasn't been throwing the ball very well I don't think they're going to put it up here I think they're thinking about running it twice if they need you to pick up the first down and go ahead and run the option probably with Jones Ernest Blackwell in the game he's in front of Devin West layman in motion its rash and he's short of the first down by a bunch good play by Colorado State for the sidelines Chris Marlowe you're looking at Beth Crowell the very relieved mother rickroll she was so concerned about the injury the way it looked she came running down out of the stands found her boy on the sidelines said are you okay and he reassured her that he was indeed okay happy to report that Rick Crowell just got his bell rung got hit in the head little groggy but as you reported back in touching a little episode back to you Rick apparently giving his mom permission to stay on the bench nickman 47 yards this one not going to get there maybe it should have been four down territory right Gilmore game all season long invites them again 21:17 Colorado State National Car Rental poleward continues as Wisconsin takes on Georgia in the Outback Bowl Wisconsin Georgia Thursday at 11:00 on ESPN I above San Diego Colorado State 21 Missouri 17 the Goodyear blimp eagle with these aerial pictures they'll be transporting rod Gilmore myself and Chris Marlowe to Memphis we're at Liberty Bowl bound after this one about 12 of the crew going with us hopefully they can get that blimp going fast the games in a day and a half moisés Moreno in the football game although a little bit wounded and Damon Washington with the carry rod Gilmore Colorado state high scoring team but not in the old WAC fashion they do it in a lot of different ways a wide throat when you don't have to and why do anything when you have key plays with a key player I mean this half it has been the day the Darrin Hall show first half touchdown 14 yard reverse that gave Colorado State the lead what's he do in the third quarter to get it going how about taking a punt back all the way for a touchdown when he just smokes everybody on the field 85 yards to put Colorado State back ahead in this ball game Moreno on second down and eight Missouri shows blitz wait on moving real well and he throws a low and outside fastball ball two he's actually limping out there third down what's not hurting on Marino right now we talked about his elbow we talked about his hand he's got the bad ankle going right now as well he might have a toothache we don't know about right now he everything is going on with him you see him he looks like he's having a very tough time and when you're hurting like that it affects your concentration against New Mexico remember he was unable to throw the football Sonny lubic chose to keep him in the game and keep it on the ground and they won the football game handily I don't think they can do that against Missouri they need him to throw the football successfully and he does right near the first down Cory McCoy the catch flag is down they're looking down there like it's gonna be pass interference I don't know if that's some Missouri or on Colorado State but it looks like Missouri is going to get flagged for the pass interference we're holding call the initial signal is just that holding against the Tigers the catch appeared to be right on the sticks Harold Pierce Lee was on the coverage rich the problem for Moreno holding on the defense on a fast across the line is for just ten yards for the but right there chef Chris is number five and he's just going to mug his man right now he is all over Turner he's grabbing and holding on to him and that's the holding call that they flag him without their back to the point about Moreno as he is hurt he's going to have trouble really stepping into his throws he's stepping off that sprained foot both teams very disciplined this year and they've shown it here tonight you turned out those few Penry's throughout the season well let's see how fast he is now Moreno trying to get it going the hook slide and he's inside Missouri Territory he's got a first down he got the adrenaline going and then he got his legs going he looked out there saw man coverage there was nobody in the secondary watching him so he just decides to best play is to take it off just take off and get going there nice slide at the end but you have to be concerned about the kind of punishment that he's going to keep taking as he leaves the pocket you could see the knee brace on the left knee the right ankle is heavily taped the right elbow which we talked about so far has stayed in tenth it has ballooned up but the bursar sac problem he's had this last month the rain was going to go for it all touchdown Dallas Davis 47 yards is he captain courageous or what that should make him feel a whole lot better Moreno with every part of his body aching step back and launches a bomb that just explodes on Missouri Dallas Davis did a nice job of adjusting but Moreno hurting standing in there tough and tall manages to get this out here and look at the adjustment by Dallas Davis I mean he's the center fielder going through the wall to catch that ball he's a hometown kid he's out of Fort Collins and the Rams at the point down at the half Colorado State back on top 28:17 Dallas Davis from Moses Moreno the WAC has it won this game since 92 on top right now 28:17 Colorado stayed on top of Missouri on two big plays the last one a touchdown pass from Moses Moreno Dallas Davis Ricky Ross and Ricky Ross is into Colorado State Territory at the 45yard line and Ricky Rob delivered a pop at the end of the run on the kicker he says what I had a chance to go all the way here and a kicker he's got to get in my way hurts number 19 this is a nice run but watch the way he finishes the run watch the end and the blow that he delivered right now he sees he's not going anywhere BAM right there take that if you want to try and stop me and Hearst gets in the way and watch him again BAM right over him he drives him back four yards yeah but Hearst will always say you know in the Holiday Bowl I made a tackle on a kickoff it was a big hit baby alright let's see now if Missouri can answer they've been able to do it all night long Corby Jones will keep it Jones inside the 30 and down he goes is a big pickup first down Missouri Erik Olson made the stop 24 yards on the pickup the Colorado State over plays the option so much they fly out of here you'll see them run this way they're thinking about taking care of that Corby Jones then takes advantage of that over aggressiveness and gets outside the contain man once he's outside boy is he dangerous Olson makes the tackle but not until they're way downfield CW apparently is okay he was never heard Jones again this time hit my big Kwame the junior linebacker gang of about 7 or B Jones gets up a little gimpy yeah you know he's a big guy and a tough guy we've seen Moses Moreno play tough play hurt well we know that Corby Jones has done that in his career as well he goes at about 227 pounds so you have to breathe something to get something from him on the ground he's over a hundred and eight yards there you have it nine and keratin you know in college football when you're sacked that's negative yardage as far as rushing you take away his sacks this year he's over a thousand yards on the ground a great point but second and four another first down Ernest Blackwell Erik Olson made another stop but Missouri is Sh that man Myron Terry's a free safety and you've got to read things in the middle and you have to see keep drives wide open he's right there he sees him coming at him does he close his eyes you tell me you can't close your eyes Blackwell even though he's 235 is very quick he's a big man you won't miss him but you can't close your eyes you got to keep your eyes wide open can't be a matador back there first and goal inside the 10 broccoli ball inside the five down to the three yard line you know we talked about these backs from Missouri that they're big that they're strong and that they can start to wear on you well my aren't Aries in the middle of that secondary and he has to come up and deal with this we saw him miss that last tackle here comes again there's Jana hope I don't want to to keep taking on these big guys they the five yard area six three two oh six he's a big guy himself but when you are regularly running up against back that outweigh his toll on you Oh leave all into the end zone touchdown Missouri team and his touchdown brings Missouri back within a score and that was all physical football by Missouri they're tellin Colorado State yeah okay you got some big plays on them but in order to beat us you're going to have to be physical here's a punch in the mouth and that man right there Brock Olivo delivered it coming right at you good blocking once again reading 76 inside but the finish on the run against Brock Oliva the kick is good what else would you expect from the plymouth Holiday Bowl Colorado State 28 Missouri 24 ESPN continues its Boeing coverage Thursday at 11:00 in the morning big Ron Dayne leads the Wisconsin Badgers against number 11 Georgia the Outback Bowl Bowl week continues Thursday at 11:00 on ESPN broccoli bow in the middle of that group the special teams player of the year it's the first year they've given that award it's named after mostly to to pou who was a great special teamer and played where USC and we've been doing Patriots but Olivo is just an I mean he's a selfdescribed nut he does not eat red meat his training regimen is incredible watch this man right here there's your Center hats ready watch the job he does nice job getting in there creating space taking care of the nose tackle when your Center can play like that it makes it easier to get the touchdown even his teammates thinks to think he's a little bit nuts it might Morris the offensive guard four years ago I guess challenged him to eat as many big macs as he could he ate four of them Olivo got sick and from that point on he is not eating the red meat who's already punt return will scamper out of bounds at the 42 and its first in 10 Colorado State at the 42yard led their own 42 Yardley but Bronco levo is it he's an incredible story yeah great story you know the story I'd like about him most of all is the time that he was challenged he was dared to run outside in the snow when it was about 15 degrees naked he ran naked and he actually did it do you like that story great story don't you Ben he plays on every special team except kick block team and that's because the coaches said they just run out of time they can't get him on every specialty corby Jones right now getting a little attention to that right ankle and that's not good news for Missouri but he's got time to get it patched up before he comes back in both these quarterbacks have taken an awful lot of tapings and he'll tape the inside they'll take that and you'll put a sock over and then a shoe over and then they'll take that so he'll get a job with eight job as Moses Moreno has three and a half minutes left third quarter Colorado State is scored twice Missouri once here in the second half and Moreno go right back upstairs his tight end Eli workman to midfield a gain of about eight it's been a big second half for Moses Moreno yeah he's been a tough guy but he's been the quarterback that he's been all season coming in winning touchdown passes nine pick he gets two more in the second half this one right here to his man McCoy he wasn't finished then he came back again with another one to his man Dallas Davis for another touchdown so the Rams have been getting it done with Moses Marino 14 of 17 61% on the season McDougal straight ahead he said his goal next year moreno is to complete 68% of his passes that would be 68% to some NFL team his quarterback ranking this year his rating 10th best ever in the history of the WAC Conference which is saying something in that conference well you know you think of the WAC and you generally think about BYU but Colorado State has been dominating this conference for the last four years coming to this game last time really struggled when he was here as a sophomore not tonight dereck yielding motion on third down McDougald he's got a bad ankle head down has the first down remember mcdougal turned an ankle Sonny lubic saw him on the sidelines they had to tape him up and send it back out we've talked about the size difference between Colorado State and their offensive line and the linebackers from Missouri well you see it again here you see the charge and by the offensive line taking on the smaller linebackers for Missouri and then you got the back Madhu go finished MacDougall getting in there and finishing it off afterwards once again it's that power that physical game player often sugar time to the 41 barky Simpson with the stop remember how we talked about Gibson and his ability to rush the passer and you need to get him away from linemen where they move him out this time and he's sort of a spy he's got to drop back into coverage he doesn't quite get to the area where he needs to be so he isn't able to make the play on halt he has the speed to get it done but he got caught up too far inside to make the play that time Gibson just a junior 218 at 62 on second and five it's me he's short of the first down ball is loose Gibson had a piece of it he's not real big but Marquis is pretty active very active he's got a lot of speed people tend to run away from you can run Adam but these big linemen you're gonna see baby right here he's gonna lead the way inside there and he's getting a good block right there when those guys are getting off and they get a chance to run three or four yards before they have to make a block it is really tough to get out of their way 3:10 mic Steve Dundee 305 Moreno complete Dallas Davis couldn't hold it I'd say one thing you have to have a lot of courage to run that round Dallas Davis is running a slant over the middle right into the teeth of where the safety will be he knows it he know that there's somebody there looking him up when that happens you have a tendency to shortarm in a little bit just a little bit of the old alligator arms I like that you dropped that one on me last night yeah you know about those alligator arms you don't stretch out all the way because you can't it's a fourth down and two and Sonny Lubich will punt the football Ricky Ross is back nice job on the special teams which have been there all night long for Colorado State and the Engelstad on the punt by Preston Lowe's fire on ice tomorrow night 7:30 on the deuce Tony amante and the Blackhawks head to Jersey where Martin Brodeur will stand on his head at least that's what we expect 7:30 on the deuce tomorrow night the Blackhawks and the deaf 2824 just five seconds left on the clock in the third quarter as for Pete Jones are going to confirm when they put some time back on the clock it's been a well officiated game so far on the next one job out there but then the calls are a lot easier I think when you have a running attack going and both teams have been running the ball up and down the field bill Hoenig making sure the eyes are dotted the T's are crossed and the clock is set Ernest Blackwell on the final play of the third quarter three quarters in the books 2824 we're back after this state champions of the wack Missouri out of the big 12 if you've just joined us too bad you've missed a great ballgame so far through three Colorado State 28 Missouri 24 what else do you expect in the plymouth Holiday Bowl yeah what do you mean just joining everybody knows you get the rack in the big 12 together and this ballgame it's excitement for be Jones in a hole a zone 6 and down he goes at the 10 and we talked to Larry Smith about Corby Johnson he told us that Corby Jones reminds him of another great quarterback that he had at USC Rodney Peete he says the only difference between the two is that Corby Jones loves to run the option Rodney Peete wasn't too thrilled every time that thing was called Larry Smith pacing the Missouri sidelines Sunnie Lubich has been a master in ball games in which he's had the lead he's up right now Jones and I think it's short hop Jakes to be incomplete and so Missouri must punt Colorado State under sunny lubic three WAC championships and one of the reasons why rod Gilmore in ball games like this they usually find a way to win sunny lubic twenty five and one when his team is leading after three quarters that would suggest that they're in line to win tonight that one lost to Wyoming last year in Wyoming of course went on to play in the WAC championship game and lose to BYU not a good punt and Colorado State will have excellent field position just a 30yard putt from Vince SIBO the RAM is here now how did the RAM get down here when you bring the RAM do you bring the RAM on truck or fly it down take a look at this graphic colorado state has lost 11 games in a row the teams that are now in the big 12 remember the big 12 was only recently formed so all the teams there now when they play them they lost to him they last beat one with 20 beat Colorado in 86 Bendis or games into the season Marino back on his feet Darren Hall made the catch and he's possible to the turf Air Force beat Colorado State that may not even be a good way to describe it they annihilated of 24 nothing shut him out and since that ballgame Colorado State has been on a tear yeah they won eight games in a row but you know the other thing to think about is that if Missouri loses his ballgame what impact would that have on Nebraska's title hopes it seems to me that if Missouri loses there's even more of an argument that that lost maybe that win for Nebraska over Missouri was not that impressive and so you may see some voters shy away from Nebraska if Missouri loses for thought fourth quarter the defensive stop in the pump could probably coming back as Washington is bounced out of bounds I'll tell you one thing the wagon needs a win ride there Owen in bowls this year Air Force was waxed by Oregon 41:13 in the Las Vegas Bowl Arizona beat New Mexico 20 to 14 and Sonny lubic told us that two days ago he has said hey look we need to win a bowl game the WAC needs to win a bowl game like this if they go oh and three in the postseason the WAC will just get ripped by the critics across the country because they're number one team at ten and two would have lost and everyone else lost as well let's take a look and see if we can pick up the hole in there it looks like I said going to occur right there you see that left arm draped around sterling it looks like it's Anthony Cesario who Borden to midfield again with time and he comes up short looking for quarry McCoy but remember we talked about his not being able to push off of that bad foot he's framed bring the foot so it's a little bit tough for him to step into his throat at ball skips it was a short hopper and that's I think directly related to the fact that he's not healthy right now let's watch his feet see how he sets there he's got to plan off that bad foot he doesn't do a great job of it he knows it but watch the nice blot that Daymond Washington gets on sterling when he comes in right there he sticks his nose right in there and just takes sterling to the ground watch during a 236 was quite a temp down State has done it on the ground in the air not this time though Kevin Ford with a big play a stop on Damon Washington now remember Missouri wanted to be physical too and they're being physical right now his game is up for grabs at 28 24 with a lot of time to go and Mary Smith always has believed that his teams are more physical and they can win in the fourth quarter Preston Lowe's will punt good punt coverage all night long Colorado State this one is a high floater Ricky Ross and rich as we talked to coaches around the country they've all told us the one statistic that is so meaningful is turnovers if you win the turnover battle you typically win ballgames Missouri right now two turnovers Colorado State only one broth just simply lost his ball tried to get going mighta heard some footsteps there but lost the ball nevertheless bulit to a Tele at the bottom of the pile came up with a fumble this is a sudden change situation for Missouri their defense wants to get a stop here no more than a field one should be but he can't get outside you can see his mobility is really limited Barry Odom dragged him down and I think that's a bad decision by Maury no I don't think he has any business trying to make something happen right now by running the football I didn't throw the ball away and come back the next down because if you get him hurt then there's really no chance I don't believe of Colorado State hanging on for a win and he's out there in the open where the linebackers are and that kind of a hit could be the final straw to put him out of the ballgame he loses yardage flag is down probably a whole Paul Turner with the catch at the 18 but even Turner sees the flag back at the 32 yard line but it's not that surprising those linemen know they have to protect Mirena they have to keep him in the lineup the Anthony Cesario is an allconference player he's got NFL potential and he's only a junior he and Mike Newell coming into this football game had not allowed a sack all year long ten yards from the play and Mike knew Mike no doesn't allow a sack here he's a sinner right here just keep your eye on him you'll see the takedown right there he is way behind the guy and he just absolutely wrestles him to the ground that's taken one for the team protecting your quarterback but it's also a holding penalty the second down into second down and twenty nine four times Missouri has sacked Moses moraine to the sidelines that catch by Davis to the 23 he's still short of the first down it said it's not a 20yard pickup and that's a heck of a throw that's a long throw that ball is in the air of long time but I am amazed how Moses Moreno can hang in there and still deliver this ball I mean he's been knocked around and he's got to be concerned about pressure but nevertheless he hangs in there and he throws a dart and gets them in position to get a score well you could see him grimace yeah when he threw that football that ball has got to be knocked down or picked off when it's in the air that long as you take a look as Martez young the defensive back who was down on the play you know you watch Marino get knocked around and grimace every time he throws it there's a holiday bowl that stands out in my mind and that's Robbie Bosco at BYU when when he was injured I think it was 1980 or back in the early 80s and Bosco could barely walk and somehow he hung in there to win a football game you and I were watching some of the old highlights at ESPN this week with the Holiday Bowl Steve Young and Robbie Bosco as you mentioned and he was his beaten up in that ball game but hung in there much like Moreno is doing tonight sweet revenge for Moreno he was manhandled pummeled by Kansas State he completed just 5 of 24 passes two years ago in this game who's 18 of today which they're down burritos incomplete Corey McCoy did not make the catch intended receiver Corinne you see he's limping a little bit more right now I think he is still trying to push off of that that sprained foot a little bit and every time he does it it tends to hurt him a little bit more it looks like and they had the guy they want at this time he's going to get inside defensive back allows him to get underneath and inside and that is a rule as a corner in mantoman coverage you don't let happen you have to keep that wide receiver to the outside CW Hurst his long this year is 34 we've seen a little bit of everything tonight and Esslinger will stay on the field Larry Smith can't believe it Sunnie Lukic talked about special teams play in this ball game the extra point good Brian Esslinger the junior at a Pueblo on a fake field goal has put Colorado State up by 11 it's the Plymouth Holiday Bowl with the Rams on top the plymouth Holiday Bowl is presented by Plymouth more fun more car backs Plymouth and in part by San Diego call one eight hundred seven oh one wage for a free visitors planning guide an entertaining stage Qualcomm Stadium has been tonight yeah Ricky Ross at the five then Ross's out to the 34yard line Ryan s leader gets the score but there was work upfront yeah their work up front but watch him on this time he'll do a good job of waiting patiently before breaking into the secondary to make this happen he has to pause a little bit he finds the home and then he shows you he's a tough runner you don't expect that from quarterback he's got some open field moves there in fresh of on that first hit he would not have had the first down after that he'll watch right here Tim Stuber is going to get what should be a great block but it's actually a hold this is the key play right here the key block that opens up the inside and it should have been called a hole a break for Colorado State Harvey Jones perks one great it finally runs out of room make Kwame made the stop Colorado State has had some huge place tonight on special teams on offense their scoring drives have eaten clocked this one about a 2minute set up by the defensive stop in the short punt by Missouri yeah and the thing is that when you stop them and you force them to go for the field go it is so demoralizing for them to come back and get a score a cheap way so it's going to be tough for Missouri to overcome that right now to get back in the ballgame second down Jones going nowhere Willie Taylor made this stop and what a great job by Larry Kerr the defensive coordinator he understands that right now Missouri doesn't want a panic so they don't want to draw back and throw a three state three straight times and come out so what does he do he plays for the option and they take away the option and now it's a trouble time for Corby Jones there's Larry Kert right there man who was an assistant at Stanford UCLA working sunny move it San Jose State northern Arizona as well and he's a guy that many people feel will be a head coach and a good one when he gets his opportunity third down down six than a scramble might have been past the line of scrimmage was about the 38 yard line and I think when he threw that ball he was about at the 38 and a half or 39 tremendous effort by Corby Jones and Missouri must punt the rule is very simple you can't cross the line of scrimmage therefore throwing the ball we're V Jones is looking to make something happen and it's a great athletic move here and it almost works but the end of the play you'll see 35 36 37 38 he's at about the 39 yard line when he throws the ball he's over the line of scrimmage very close Vince SIBO to punt remember Darren Paul has an 85 yarder for a touchdown tonight the fair catch flag down yard cushion you've got a have I don't think he had it Chad Chris got right in his face and you have to give the punt returner two yards to catch the ball and he didn't do it it's like the cone of silence you can't go inside it you got to let them catch it 35 24 Colorado state that man was a player in his day Rickey Hundley he's an angry assistant coach right now from the 3524 Colorado stayed on top 50mm acquainted Arizona played for the Denver Broncos and NFL for long time among other teams seven years in that league played for Larry Smith at Arizona now coaching with him he's part of the specialties that's been a difference than I coming up after this plymouth Holiday Bowl Sports Center with Dan Patrick and Steve Levy Peyton Manning update Curtis eNOS me status reports and Jordan goes for a record at SportsCenter that's tonight Peyton Manning with the bursar sack problem with the D and we have Moses burrito with the right elbow now the feeling Dan Patrick might say that Moses Moreno you can't stop and you can only hope now in Washington to the 35yard line all of a sudden grande Blanca factor and a Colorado State can move the sticks and keep the clock rolling they'll be on their way to a bullwhip well big factor because you're the big offensive line that has been doing the job tonight and again Anthony Cesario 72 again leading the way with the great block and a nice cutback by Damon Washington but what you're seeing from Colorado State is physical football they threw the ball just enough to keep Missouri off stride but they're coming back and they're pounding again saying hey we could play some football in the WAC Moreno is going to call a timeout play clock was down to a single second and he'll burn the time out we've got a few left we'll take one as well 7:44 left of the plymouth Holiday Bowl Colorado State on top was late Friday afternoon when the call came in someone needed service on their garage door quick that's why they called me I'm Craig Gander Daffy gander garage doors it's what I do I answered the call that same evening and had their door operating in no time six months later they called me when they wanted a replacement door for three generations when the question was garage doors the answer was standard it still is it's an openandshut case gandered garage doors Graham the name stands for savings and selection and here at Graham Ford we've never seen such great values in new cars and trucks lowest prices

only eighty nine ninety five you save over five thousand dollars don't wait hurry into Graham Ford now unless our names on your car truck you pay too much hey rich how'd you know just put it on my size and everything that looks good thank you looks feels good thanks happy holidays happy holidays man even the Goodyear blimp has enjoyed this one Colorado State 3524 on top of Missouri and the Rams have the football their own 35 faced with third down and one Washington big hole he's got the first down after the 42 yard line pickup by Damon Washington speaking of them let's go down to Chris Marlowe you know Damon Washington was a high school star here in San Diego he was recruited by all the biggies UCLA Nebraska and Washington however he ended up at Colorado State the reason why is the biggies wanted him to play defensive back from Washington said no I want to play running back and the coaches at that time Dave Leigh and steve fairchild said hey come before College you can play running back well three years later 3,000 yards Colorado State has a keeper game in Washington back to you Chris he's only a junior and MacDougall's only a sophomore this is going to be a good Colorado State team for a while right on gingerly slides across the 45 to the 46 how sterling made to stop nice move on his part to get away from Steve irritant 94 Erikson who's in the back building had a shot at Marino but couldn't make the play even with the bad football Moreno was able to get away from and if you are boozer e you have to start thinking about run flipsies than the line to try and stop the running game and get the ball back as you see Colorado State averaging 37 points a game tonight they have Tencent Washington Washington again these been a big hole into Missouri Territory they were close to another first down Terrell Piercy Kevin Ford made the stop this is a play that Barry Sanders just that inside stretch play you'll just see them stretch out and then you'll get Washington cutting in behind it what a great variety John Cesario doing a great job of getting there burying people with the line of scrimmage Washington getting in behind it's finding the soft area and cutting back off of it that offensive line has been stellar tonight that's a young unit as well just two seniors on that offensive line Washington and he's very close how sterling did a great job that time xlviii inside linebacker he shot up in there and took on the big linemen and he won sterling is a great story he came to Missouri as a an outofshape nose tackle and he was on the scout team and he just sort of won the heart of Moe Ankeny and Larry Smith by hard work great work on the scout team and all of a sudden an injury here an injury there he starting at middle linebacker yeah well you know he actually quit the team okay he went home had girlfriend problems and the coaches were a little bit bummed and upsetting it and get back right away came back he worked his way back up mo Anki now says you know he's a real great story I love the kid I'm glad he's on the squad Sonny lubic looking out to Moses Marino on fourth down and short Marina will wait for the play clock to it's come close to expiring and call a timeout so the Rams have burned two of their three timeouts here in this series Larry Smith and the Tigers need to find an answer down 11 after a conference sunny Lubich and Moises Moreno and the rest of the rams have decided to punt the football a fourth and one colorado state with an 11point lead just under five minutes left in the football game question Lowe's we'll cut it Ricky Ross who has fumbled a return tonight let's it roll out of bounds and now the Tigers will try to get it headed in the right direction speaking of that the man who got the Tigers going in the right direction who's Larry Smith since he's been at that program he's done a great job turning it around coach of the year this season hey you know what he had a year out of football after getting fired by USC he was really at a crossroads in his career yeah one of the things that he did was he went around the country visiting friends and coaches guys like Joe Paterno and actually my colleague and friend Phil curry that he has been and they helped him they talk through the things he had done riot at USC and confirmed for him that he was teaching the right things and not to give up on coaching Jones is out to the 33yard line and when you've got Corby Jones you're not out of a football game area and Ross made the stop as Larry Smith went around the country what he found was that basic football blocking and tackling him the way that he was teaching it was still the focus and it still worked and was he relating to his players he found out that he was and so he was able to take all that into consideration and then wait for the right opportunity at Missouri and he really feels Missouri is the right opportunity the catch actually it was West and he's short of the first down to the sidelines Chris Marlowe man cam the RAM never flies from Fort Collins to San Diego two days it took that 12 hours is that right guys 22 hours and he ate alfalfa all the way this happened a happy day back to you you know you can get that at some Drive thrus but you got to look hard Eric Vaughn made the stop and I would expect that him the RAM will do a little celebrating tonight before he heads back to Fort Collins if Colorado State can hold this lead Missouri on the move or be Jones running out of the pocket to midfield and in the compound state territory ball is loose but Jones was down and Missouri will hurry it up you can see Larry Smith trying to get him up to the line of scrimmage SportsCenter coming up after this Holiday Bowl Colorado State on top from Missouri is standing around a little bit too much they need to get to the line of scrimmage and have a sense of urgency as they need to score just a lot of scrambling and boy does he take a hint Clark Higgins and Larry Smith wants a timeout with three minutes left the Tigers at Corby Jones with a lot of work to do they trail Colorado safe in a Plymouth Holiday Bowl well SportsCenter is next divine intervention might be needed by Missouri to leave has the first down the clock will stop as they moved the change well they're having a little bit of trouble with their passing game Missouri is watch this is two plays ago they have throwing two guys running deep brows and then one guy running a short route and there are seven or eight guys back in coverage you can't run a twominute offense with only three guys in the pattern you have to get Corby Jones more options down the field Jones throws it down the field and misses that time they had five guys in the pattern so he had a few more options they were spreading things out but you just can't run the twominute option and expect three wide receivers to beat six guys in coverage or seven guys which they had last time second down at Ted Sunnie lubic in colorado state looking for their first holiday bowl win he told us that getting a win tonight would be a huge relief a chance to get a win in a bowl game that has been elusive for him he is one of the more candid head coaches you'll meet in college football Ramson yeah yes he is the son of the former tight end and dandy would be proud of that hit yeah dad played at the 49ers for a number of years before heading over to the Denver Broncos dad was a tight end this is a corner he's a big hitter he's played well tonight you haven't heard his name a lot because when he's been in coverage he's blanketed his receiver four of ten on third down not necessarily for down territory because a field goal would get them within a touchdown in a twopoint then they need some yardage to get themselves in field get some yards from Olivo but for the second time on the draw play may have picked up a first down they'll mark it at the 30 he's just short and how surprised Rondo has been the heart and soul of his football team his work ethic has established the tone for this team so when they need to get it done they go to him late in the game and a difficult spot rod because it's fourth and short but they don't have time to stop the clock and huddle up and call what they want Jones may just keep it here Shin has the first down block we'll stop briefly we're under two minutes Jamie Bennett made the stop rock management's so important here clock is stopping they have timeouts left two of them so they really need to get in the end zone quickly and had at least one timeout left if they can convert an onside kick to try and get in position to tie the ballgame we've seen it done this year rod and I did the Purdue Michigan State game Michigan State had an 11 with two minutes left and Purdue came back one that football girl is it incomplete and it's second down in 10th in fact when sunny lubic was an assistant coach starting out at Montana State one of his co Patriots Joe tiller the head coach at Purdue tiller was one of those guys that was touched by Jim Sweeney along with Mike price what sunny booping once out of tonight more so than just a win for himself is a win for this team and a win for the WAC conference it wants to whack to get some national recognition as being a good conference and a win tonight over Missouri would certainly help they got a little last year with BYU's Cotton Bowl win but at bowling so far this year this is the final WAC team in a bowl game watch the draw Levi inside the 25 flag is down back at the 30yard line clock will stop Eric Vaughn make the stop coming up next Ford Center Steve leaving Dan Patrick all the highlights they'll pick up the flag and Missouri will burn the time out a minute a half left of the Plymouth Holiday Bowl Larry Smith is running out of time 3524 Missouri burning that time out and the Tigers have one left lay man in motion for being a bullet that's 80 books and the omen and a heck of a throw he threw that in between three defenders and Corby Jones had to deliver and he came through that time bought stop it starts now stays on his feet might just be down according Johnson tried to make something happen was an illadvised throw he didn't have a chance to get anything done he was hoping for hitting the grass call more than likely he should have simply thrown that ball away when he had the chance for taking the sack and hurried back up to the line of scrimmage but you'll see in here right now he's going to figure out he doesn't have anything to do because Taylor is right on top of him but he tries to get out of it and then just throws it up for grabs and Olsen's right there and Larry Smith knew that that was just the wrong thing in Colorado State can run out the clock down mcdougal straight ahead and the celebration will start in Fort Collins the Rams for the first time in their school's history will get their 11th win in a football season and for sunny Lubich the third time is a charm before they came here to Michigan it came back in 95 and they lost to Kansas State tonight they face the team from the big 12 in Missouri since Sonny lubic will get his first holiday pole victory nine straight wins for this football team who was too and to rot after losing to an airforce and in losing bad to Air Force they lost at Colorado by 10 Missouri's what a rollercoaster Missouri has been on emotionally this year yeah but they have every reason to be proud of what they've done this season almost knocking off Nebraska being in a position to get a win in a bowl game should be a great return to respectability for Missouri and of course the Tigers are a young football team their leader Corby Jones he'll be back Missouri can't stop the clock mcdougal is out to the 30 and the Rams will have to snap it one more time if you are with us at the outset of the broadcast sunny Lubich told his team essentially two things number one we can be physical with Missouri they were number two special teams can win this football games and they had a big hand at it Rob absolutely and the man who was really huge for them in the special teams there but it was Darrin hot and came up with some big plays but took away the punt return of 85 yards for a touchdown and this holiday bull winding down 3524 sunny loving and the Colorado State Rams the champions of the WAC the champions of this plymouth Holiday Bowl three win championships and finally a bull win one of the good guys in coaching two of the good guys in coaching Larry Smith at sunny Lubich at the 50yard line 3524 the final score the export center the blimp tonight provided by who else goodyear aquatred this has been a presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports for Chris Marlowe and rod Gilmore I'm rich watts a win for the Rams a win for the wagon Colorado State beats the Tigers
