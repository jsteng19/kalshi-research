============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC on a wintry night blooded rematch for the 10 east supremacy the reigning champs from Michigan st. look to make as strong a playoff statement tonight so do the Buckeyes who come calling for revenge in the big 10 on a big stage under the bright lights pathology has roamed from the broad battles of the Big Ten in these two schools our Titans in it their last encounter was the conference championship a year ago I had this game circled personally since the minute I stepped off that field last year now everybody was down this and we know we can go out and play this game but we have to take this one in order to get what we need to get a lots at stake we know they're coming for us we're coming for battle and aply who's the best in the big 10 this is a new year new dreams we're still chasing our success Saturday Night Football and welcome to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC the Big Ten's longawaited showdown Saturday night arrives rest appropriately in parkas hats and gloves already important things have happened with the playoff bracket out a month from today contenders like Baylor and Arizona State have made strong statements the committee barber has separate second looks forests eight finds itself in a battle ax this game is a big part of that playoff chase welcome Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit you're fans of the sport this is a special night this is a big part of it in a conference it starved for respect curt michigan's sake can sort of reinforce what the committee thinks Ohio State can reshape it no question about it but I think if you talk to Urban Meyer Mark Dantonio on the field right now this is about tonight yeah this is about trying to be able to put the right foot forward and try to get ahead in this division and try to get to Indianapolis and win a Big Ten championship and think about that down the road meanwhile at Ohio State offense tonight that scores quickly and scores often faces a stout Michigan State defense in a tough environment better defense Pat guard uzi the defensive coordinator plays a lot of mantoman on the outside they call it building a wall with their defensive line and linebackers attacking down hill you can see it there Ameer Abdullah one of the top backs in the country nowhere to go that's what a high o state will face when they run the football and then if Michigan State gets you to third down they're very creative they give you a lot of different looks they love to blitz you try to put the quarterback in the offensive line in a very tough position so for the Buckeyes the big thing for them will be avoiding third and long they need to have success on first and second down try to get to the third and manageable situations to help that line and JT barony yeah JT Barrett faces a big test Connor cook from Michigan State has passed some big tests but he's got this guy to worry about he's got to worry about Joey Bosa come on is one of the top defensive ends in the country amazing hands and look how he gets skinny here with the pressure and athletic ability to close in on the quarterback to get home so they don't always have to blitz here's against Penn State fourman pressure there's the power join the back right into the backfield so tonight against a very balanced attack from Michigan State first angle high OH state's going to try to do is slow down the running game with an aggressive line backing through and the safeties coming downhill they're gonna leave their corners on an island Joey both has got to get pressure for the Buckeyes to hold up against the Spartans on the road but guys good road team they've won 11 straight the Spartans have won 14 in the big 10 Eastern Division supremacy and a lot more at stake tonight here at East Lansing the Nissan pregame rush is next after this message and a word from our ABC stations mr. football something you'd like to share this is silly we all know how to say bowl game play off bowl game play ball welcome to the Nissan pregame rush Nisa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy John Saunders Danny Cannella coach Mac brown playoff yes the playoff has already started they may be down to the last four teams in January but guess what week to week six matchups today with ranked teams on both sides of the ball this is a fumble Nick Marshall trying to hand it off as they were going in for a touchdown to take the lead but they get it back can't control the snap and Luke crazy finish to this game you see the center snaps it up textin my zli jumps on it one person on this set called this upset and it wasn't the code to the former player oh nice you give me that one Danny came out when you're in a Florida State uniform you look like this right ah never Jameis Winston to the Enzo got another incredible first half so far for the state looks like they're taking control of the game Notre Dame against Arizona State and coach Everett Golson was the key you said they got to get to him and they did turning the ball over a very tough day for a Notre Dame team that fought back hard give credit to Arizona State and their defense they kept him in the pocket and forced turnovers to win again it's a blow up TCU against kstate trevone Boykin looking for David Porter gets it down to the two and sets up a Boykin touchdown TCU's banged up on offense doesn't matter with that guy under under center quarterback he is a really good football player and he's gonna be a guy that's tough for Kansas State to stop to so if the playoff had started then who walks out of tonight's game Ohio State Michigan State a winner I think Michigan State's the best team in the Big Ten I think they've proved it tonight Ohio State's young Michigan State's old old beat young tonight at East Lansing it's relative not that old we'll see you at halftime right now let's return to Chris Fowler Chris there crowd they have not beaten a lawless it here since 1999 in the Buckeyes get payback well the Spartans reaffirm their status as big ten top dogs kickoff from East Lansing is coming up next but first a look inside Nissan's Heisman House to spin the pregame rush you're watching the duck of pepper Championship Drive game of the week we'll go swinging from a tree we got a feeling kickoff temperature east lansing just above freezing the windchill makes it just below freezing but no chance of precip tonight and their with a ringside seat with this ruffle urban Kurt thanks so much coach tonight you face a team that ended your national championship hopes a year ago and what an elimination game what if you said to your team about what's at stake tonight this kind of game is all about preparation it's gets a very good team and we're a very good team so it's about the fundamentals of winning a game in these kind of games never changes it's a line of scrimmage to take care of the ball you have a freshman quarterback and JT Barrett that's also dealing with a sore knee what do you need from him tonight in this environment it is to manage a great game today you know they're very good on defense but there's weaknesses they need offense identify the weakness and manage the game Meyers last visit here was his first big 10 win in first road win a couple of years ago the Knights aerial coverage provided by Goodyear whether you're going for it from a few yards out or from miles away go with the tire with superior performance Goodyear more driven Urban Meyer pumped up on the field beforehand Mark Dantonio all business but his team extra inspired in a pregame smile from Dino who has deep roots in Ohio it might be the last smile tonight got that one out of the way early before the kick did I look there JT Barrett Buckeyes fast starting offense will get the football 1st Michigan State won the toss and deferred until the second half a lot to deal with for a redshirt freshman quarterback who's filling Braxton Miller's big shoes this season dontre Wilson at the goal line driven out at the 25 JT Barrett's knee feels okay against Penn State that double overtime win Kirk he tweaked it and just played through pain very well they thought at halftime that might be it they thought he may have to shut it down but he showed a lot of courage and toughness and leading Ohio State to win and in overtime actually put the team on his back and ran the football despite that MCL sprain I think he earned a lot of respect from his teammates based on the way he played in that game and it toughness that he played with Big Ten total offense leader number one and passing efficiency empty backfield on the first play Barrett roles short row nearside catch made by devin Smith who's the big play threat again for a first down tonight's chickfila impact players Kirk you start with Taylor Decker a big night for the Ohio State offensive line the only it starter from a year ago has to provide leadership and give JT time dontre Wilson you'll see him tonight and a Michigan State defense will put a lot of pressure on they fake it to Ezekiel Elliott Barrett comes out firing completion again to Smith in two plays the Buckeyes are in Michigan State Territory Ohio State on the aggressive here earlier the first couple plays they move the pocket on the first play here attacking the midrange in the Michigan State defense and that's something that they feel that JT Barrett has a very good feel for against his style of defense from the Spartans Marit far side this time batted down Ohio State has scored in his opening possession six consecutive games Marcus rush from Cincinnati bowler fourth year that he's been playing for the Spartans got his hand up on that football when you can't get the pass rush to a quarterback you got to knock it down that's what he was able to do there for the Buckeyes again aggressive with the kick quick throws against the mantoman coverage for the Spartans it's a free play the Spartans jumped into the neutral zone but Barrett escapes and darts inside the 42 yard line and looked like Joel Heath 92 may have jumped a little bit early it's a very good Michigan State defensive front defensive ends he mentioned rush Chile Calhoun their job to contain Barrett on those zone replays right outside defense fiveyard penalty the defense is so eager in the early going yeah it's you know one of the good things about playing in on the road in an environment like this it's tough to play against a defense that thrives on creating pressure and confusion is take the fight to them sometimes it you know Tom Harmon and Urban Meyer this offensive staff they have a lot of experience on the staff lot of film study a lot of preparation to get ready for this defense and it's interesting here early quick up to the line in attacking the Spartans defense second and five right there looks far side another inaccurate dark just short of the first down marker is Michael Thomas top receiver on the team when you play Michigan State it puts a lot of pressure because of how much mantoman coverage that they play receivers got to be able to get separation meaning Michael Thomas devin Smith bounce rate will sent Jalen Marshall Evan Spencer you see a lot of defensive backs in their face Patton are doozies adjustment to this up tempo is he's tightening up his coverage his path tightening up his coverage and taking away the cushion from the receivers but this look Kurt empty backfield on third in the half yard higher minutes light in motions in Barrett with the keeper dimes Pollard pushed out inside the 35 yard line Buckeyes Kirk since week two the best FBS team at converting third downs yeah going back to the way he played 11 days after the entry to Braxton Miller he was indecisive he was hesitant when it came to running the football how could you blame him he had played in two years he had four new offensive linemen such a different runner and from the middle that sees it on making quicker decisions and just getting enough yards to be able to move the sticks and showing some physicality now when he runs Evan Spencer comes in motion whistle before the play the left guard there Billy price might have been leaning for Ohio State false start zip line for ohio state which had to replace for starters he struggled early in the season they've been getting better as it's going on think about what they lost from a year ago a lot of experience tailored Ector 23 starts was on the right side last year moved over to the left but price born the FL fine Baldwin all these guys making their first this year their first year as a starters and I think you're seeing more and more continuity on 1st and 15 Barrett in the pocket throws down feeling over the head of Evan Spencer who was well covered there by Darion Hicks it's an example of what these Michigan State defenders will do we've we've called a lot of games with Panthers easy at Marc Dantonio and I really believe nationally they set the bar with this scheme and I think people were starting to copycat what they do and it's just very different from everything you see in this era offense offense offense you come to East Lansing it's about the defense it's about being aggressive and literally begging you daring you to try to beat them in mantoman coverage they're very good at it play option on 2nd and 15 incomplete that was late through the hands of dontre Wilson the speedy slot weapon third along last year when Ohio State played Michigan State they really struggled on 3rd and 4th down in fact there are 1 of 12 in the average distance was almost third and 9 it was like 8.6 very very challenging we talked in the open that they want to be in third and manageable because of the variety of blitzes and because they are so multiple how they can confuse the offensive line but guys not in field goal range the wind's blowing from left to right so Barrett fires short Smith did not break it's a cold drop at the 30 by ryley bullet or to the famous bulla family here at Michigan State so we'll see if the true freshman kicker Shawn Nurnberger trots out he's a pretty good kicker from distance this would be a 47yard ER again working into a slight win Ohio State on their opening drive eight plays seven passes with a lot of tempo and going up against Michigan State interesting that they could have aboard the running game on that opening drive that false start penalty of course setting him back when the first down so Nurnberger from Butler Kentucky from 47 yards for the early lead just short it was on the edge of his range because I have a better time kicking left to right than this direction tonight just short yeah literally about a yard short from hitting the crossbar it's talked as some of the kickers on the field in warmups and especially the Michigan State kickers they talked about that this stadium with the changes in the scoreboards how it's getting it's gotten even tougher to try to figure out sometimes the wind the wind tunnel that's it's out there so here comes Connor cook from he play Ohio the Cleveland area who hasn't had a career in 300 yard game until the Big Ten championship game backed it up again in the Rose Bowl yeah he'll engineer balanced attack very confident with everything that he sees because of the experience he gained from a year ago and the success especially against Ohio State and it's Stanford in the Rose Bowl high formation handoff to Jeremy and Langford the feature back for the Spartans Ohio State strings it out but Langford gets about seven yards it's like about a match up on the edge we're gonna keep our eye on Joey Bosa has been a sack machine but Jack parkland in two years has not yet allowed a sack C 0 in his entire career and now he's a sophomore but you know he weighed 330 last year as a freshman and he dropped 30 pounds it's allowed to be a lot quicker now he lines up on the left side Joey Bosa will move around and right now he is lined up headtohead a ride across from Jack Conklin 7 on first down who can take a playaction shot on second man looping down the field they run the football on the opening play look at the protection we just talked about Coughlin does a good job on those up and in these the receivers Tony Lippett gets most of the attention but here it's montre the senior with great speed he goes right by Connelly safeties uptight expecting wrong they get behind him in coverage and a great throw by Connor cook here early he comes out looking very shut that was a beautiful throw 44 yards to mumphrey from the 19th langford fix his way or also running actually they thought they had him stopped he muscles free for about for that play got a little bit ugly because Michael Bennett got penetration 63 from Iowa State looked like he may have blown the play off and it went for a lot of credit that offensive line for not giving up on the play Langford is a top physical runner and really does a nice job of giving this offense balanced cook and the receivers get so much attention but with the offensive line in layman language ability to run makes it very tough on Ohio State defense to try to lock in on one area five receivers empty backfield unusuallooking powder cook a most fell backwards right to keep his balance Langford makes the catch that will incomplete now Darren Lee was there to deliver the blow but that bet play got off to a weird start yeah big play by Darren Lee you know he almost made non sense not to not top 10 sports center right there luckily they got the snap off but a good play by how about Darren Lee played quarterback in high school high school near Columbus in New Albany didn't have a lot of experience playing defense he shows up at Ohio State as an athlete and Urban Meyer the staff move him as an outside linebacker has stepped in very nicely at 6 to 228 pounds plays out in space and plays well 37 Rory sure has a man open course down oh my oh say defects that never misses tackles missed one here and mumphrey has a big opening drive he fights through a backup foreigner hearing calmly and into the end zone had the big reception to get the ball deep in Ohio State Territory he was in motion there Conley could not stay up with him and a nice stroll again by Conner kokkonen first drive is the way Michigan State want to set the tone in his hyped up football game monfriez CU who had 10 catches all season coming in makes the big catches set up this touchdown reception he sure didn't Krissi they put him out in motion you can see Conley a freshman trying to make a play he was slow to get there to begin with montre I think recognized that instead of giving up on to play lowered his shoulder and he puts the Spartans up by a touchdown here early after a Miss Buckeyes field goal the Spartans marched 70 yards in five plays two minutes in two seconds honor cook to keep mum free the play that sets up the touchdown and the one that finds the endzone Michigan State which jumped to a 17 nothing lead against Ohio State the conference championship game on top here again quickly dontre Wilson from the one Myrtle's a man nice return out near the 30yard line back to this touchdown with mumphrey who goes in motion right here now he's got a freshman carrying Connelly on him because Eli Apple right now the starter is out you see he goes back he's got man coverage Conley's already behind it but right here lipid does a good job of kind of using a screen to give mumphrey a little bit more room to be able to get out into the flat and then that's just raw toughness there by mumphrey took over top of the freshman conley but Colley's in this game because Eli Huff will the starter number 13 has a hamstring that he's dealing with and is on the sideline so not only the starting Nickelback reads out but now also it's starting corner Apple out of the secondary as well Ohio State's defense missing just 32 tackles all season that's the fewest among all five teams but a big miss tackle by the freshmen so Barrett now in the 7nothing hole blank by Ezekiel Elliott he gets the pitch and gets the quarter out grunts Calhoun finds the sideline out near midfield so Elliott the sophomore from st. Louis a nice game and there's mantoman on the outside and a great call here is a speed option you get the ball to the outside see the corner staying with the receiver now you've got an alley around the corner and you can see what Elliott at six feet 225 pounds he's got great speed to be able to get to the edge the captain Mouse between Urban Meyer Tom Herman on the offensive staff and Patton r2z who's upstairs communicating downstairs and out to the defense names it on Eliott ones nearside again gets the corner a big games to one against I'd to 30 cuts it back Elliott in the scarlet and gray strike back very quickly great call here with the counter that's going to start this way and come back see how the defense is overflowing it's designed to cut back nice job here welldesigned they brought the right tackle round as well land fast on first and goal barracks swung out fires over the head now Smith so two running plays by Elliot and Ohio State very quickly threatening well you remember this game last year Braxton Miller and follows Hyde as a combination gave this Michigan State defense fits now JT Barrett doesn't have the explosiveness that Craxton brings to the running game and a lot of people wondered who would Greek plays follows hi this year he have a true freshman Curtis Samuel made a start last week against Illinois but seek Elliot this is his kind of game against the physical Spartan defense he's off to a great start with the freshman from Brooklyn Samuel is in the game now to the white of Barrett one second and goal quarterback keeper design Ron and burns into the end zone Ohio State answers a championship type of atmosphere in game you get down on the road seven you're gonna find out what you're made out of it JT Barrett steps up and leads Ohio State down to a potential gametying touchdown and how about the true freshman you talked about Curtis Samuel checks into the game pivotal block to allow him to get around the edge and into the end zone talked about the defensive personalities for both teams is 9 Berger ties the game of seven but both of these offenses capable of both scoring very quickly and grinding out long drive yeah this is a big run the counter to be able to come back he follows 76 the right tackle Baldwin shows some speed out the open field doesn't go out of bounds keeps the play alive almost takes it into the end zone he goes out catches a breath watch for get a block right there on the corner gets him into the end zone for the touchdown of the guys had tied it up at 7:00 Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by Nissan choose nissan today for great on our most exciting lineup ever shop Jews Nissan calm Taco Bell sometimes you gotta live mas and Northwestern Mutual proud to be an official corporate partner of the NCAA Tom Izzo Spartans ranked 18 preseason exhibition game last night they showed Saint but say who's boss 97 56 is so is the man always always no matter who he graduates always has a team that's potentially capable of making a run and I love how challenges his team with some of their early games that they play in November and December gets him ready for conference play Iowa State excellent special teams a huge emphasis for Urban Meyer Isle Clinton to kick it away deep in the end zone will be no return talked about Connor cooks success he was trusted by the Michigan State brain trust there Dave Warner allowing him to throw the football a lot against Ohio State he rewarded that trust he sure did he had a big game and I think this is where his confidence started to release or when you're announced as a MVP most outstanding player carries over into the Rose Bowl against Stanford in a game that was hyped up against the great defense found some receivers and again all offensive MVP with goes into the offseason becomes truly the leader for this offense and has had another great year this year for the Spartans offense he's a junior who will get some attention intends to sort of come back for his senior year so far that's his plan anyway Lang for the first time Kari said her step hits the edge and Sprint's not to the 44 yard line and he said gets the edge because of a great block here by falling 83 sets the edge there he's able to overpower Steve Miller and for Ohio State again so much talked about Connor cook they better be able to get physical and with Eli Apple out continue to watch 19 the freshman Gary Paulina looks like apple looks like he's now back into the game actually unless his headset apples back into the game now at the bottom of the screen he's a firsttime throw cook pressure Josh does get it away complete Darren Lee the linebacker got there quickly into the quarterback space only sack five times all year it's the biggest difference that you see now with Chris as helping out as a codefensive coordinator they blitz 43 he's almost partners is acted at getting after the quarterback as Joey Bosa is three and a half sacks he's physical he's one of they're known as one of the Blitz here begins Rabia safety that's up playing as a linebacker he cooked make the Buckeyes pay for blitzie he's very very good when opponents try to pressure in that way there's a handoff in motion McGarrett Kings a receiver into the backfield flag comes down as he's knocked down at the 46 have a hole there by Travis Jackson left guard holding up 63 10yard penalty second down Jackson of 27 Ohioans on this roster cook and a couple of offensive lineman plenty of guys on defense extra inspiration whenever they face the scarlet and gray interior the Michigan State offensive line has their hands full we've talked so much about Joey Bosa and even Darren Lee but you've got a couple veterans with Michael Bennett and Adolphus Washington so these guys have played a lot of football Jack Conklin kind of leads the way Jack Allen in the middle Travis Jackson some veterans but they'll be tested tonight probably more so than any game they've played up to this point other than maybe the Oregon game early in a year right tackle folks from Cincinnati on a second down cook has good protection delivers a strike now incomplete that's a rare drop Eli Apple was defending on Aaron Burr Bridge but Michigan State can leave this game only four drops all season and how about they talk about this is considered a drop or as much as Apple they're to be able to help encourage to drop but this is this is something to keep an eye on from Iowa State Apple's trying to he's been out early Michigan State's taken advantage of it but Eli have bought freshmen from New Jersey trying to tough it out inflate corner the other thing you're seeing right now is Duran grant is following Tony Lippett the top receiver from Michigan State all over the field whether he's to the left of the ride he said I left this town Kirk top of the formation number 14 in green as protection fires a strike near midfield flag down again near side right at the line of scrimmage naval formation offense so a couple of penalties on Michigan State's second possession making things complicated you got to get all the way to the Ohio State 48 to make a first down and they're paying back more than four players in the backfield fiveyard stare down there very good on third and long this counter cook but I'm about third and 25 no no and the Ohio State defense right now it's interesting to see their approach I think they want to put pressure but you get a team to third down now it's about just trying to get the ball back to JT Barrett but with a veteran like cook you don't ever want to let your guard down here and just assume it's a draw or a screen but guys rush for conceptor airs bowlers loose they fight for it now donovan clerk the tackle jumped on it players hesitated didn't see the ball come out Donovan Clarke headsup play because there are about three white jerseys all over that football and that ball was live it came out Chris you talked about it you don't see this very often they get pressure with four Joey Bosa is there but like I said Bennett also the ball come down it looked like before his knee touched there's two of their boats is there Steve Miller Darren Lee got his boast of sitting on the ball but it continued to move around the Spartans give up a rare sack but dodge and turnovers Jalen Marshall is back ball bounces in traffic now there's a scrum at the 33 the short punt by Mike Sadler in some of those blockers her Marshall inattentive down there didn't see it Spartans say they have it if it looked like Jeff Green we're seeing some rare things Curtis sack allowed by the Spartans a special teams turnover for the Buckeyes big mistake in the young man from Columbus Ohio Chris Frey who is pretty excited about giving it but it's Jeff Green 89 he just did not hear the Peter Peter Peter Paul to get out of there ball bounces off of me tries to jump on a bit Chris ride I'm back a true freshman again from Upper Arlington Ohio heads up chunks on the football gives it Spartans great field position really hasn't done on special teams this year not only was Jeff Green there but you had two or three other Ohio State players in that territory and talked about the importance of special teams in these kind of games big mistake thanks for breaking free the 10 touchdown 3300 for number 33 turnover Brickley cashton you talk about a reversal of portions in the last minute Ohio State could have had a turnover in scoring position fumble the punt and suddenly this birds back on top the Ohio State defense thinks they have done their job they forced a punch then they gotta go right back on the field watch Jeremy Langford right there that little jump cut good job in alignment coming up all the way up to the second level looks like Josh what Perry was slow to react to Conor Cruz went right up there made a nice block but give all the credit to Langford with division to jump cutting into the end zone three touchdowns in about six minutes here Kirk Spartans buck gun top yeah it would come into this game it's cold it's wet it's damp you thinking okay there's gonna be a lowscoring game and these two offenses have come out making some big plays and some miscues and some opportunities we've got points up on the board Langford his eleventh rushing touchdown of the season big night he could go over a thousand yards there's a low kick bounces around field it finally by Wilson entre Wilson loses the ball again Ohio State covers it but nearly another special teams disaster for the Buckeyes can't even imagine an Urban Meyer if that would have been recovered by Michigan State damn burros got him after Wilson yet hit the ball just punched out that time by a helmet yeah helmet on the football ball is loose Ohio State fortunate to jump on top of that it is Camp Burroughs fumbles loss for Ohio State coming into this game during nearly a second one Eliot in the pistol formation you pick a tool pressure off the edge Smith makes the catch but cannot escape sure time go by RJ Williamson and a corner blitz from the bouncer into the Blind Side JT Barrett great recognition of feeling it by Barrett also nice job by the receiver and kind of a board and his fake got out of it just got the ball out quickly to the receiver North gets all ready for Smith Barrett now chased escapes he's a physical runner not as explosive as Braxton Miller but lowers his shoulder gets the first down there's been a lot of talk about his knee because of the injury against Penn State and a lot of people watched him play last week against Illinois and thought he missed some throws and he's a little tentative is he going to be okay watching him Thursday in practice he didn't appear to be anything slowing him down watching here early in this game as you said he is a physical runner doesn't have that Pitts playability the threat of that the way practice to Miller does but he will lower his shoulder and get yards trae Waynes one of the serving corners lost his helmet he's out of the game as they handed up inside Elliott to twist across the 45 yes PN's got the Quicken Loans race for Heroes 500 from Phoenix again from Michigan State defense board enter a lot of movement from the Michigan State deal I'm Elliot makes his way in midfield he'd be third and about three Marcus rush on the time the movement is to create confusion whether you're stunning or you're glitch they remember the last time oh hi Oh state was truly tested they get a tested Happy Valley against Penn State but was against buck foster week two when it gave up seven cents per raise on JT parent as a nightmare was a nightmare and this is really the first challenge since then against this kind of defense and up to this point here early they're doing a very good job of communicating and picking up a lot of the different looks that the Spartans are offering him up front third and two Ezekiel Elliott moves to the slaughter predictively keeps the ball you know it's coming but still tough to stop and you see the strength of the Texan tough legs to tackle artha they are a good tumble team on the right side there you see corn and elf line they do a nice job of giving enough of a crease there and again he may not have that quickness and that big play ability but he has enough quickness there to not just lower shoulder for four or five yards he's looking to continue to run for 10 even 15 yards and you're seeing that empty set clearing out the secondary hitting the numbers to the advantage of the Ohio State offense with a quarterback that's basically a running back at times it's tough for the Spartans to stop guys that they have more rushing yards at Michigan State usually gives up an entire game ten more in fact there's a first down throw and some confusion there here comes a flag it's going to be interferences Evan Spencer was working against Darian Hicks he grabbed ahold of Evan Spencer and Hicks really didn't have anything else to do because he's beaten on the play cuts back to the inside and right there grabs ahold of him Paul's in the air fischels all over the call pass interference defense number two Spencer his dad Sam was a great running back here later a running backs coach now does that for the Buccaneers but Spencer grew up going to Ohio State practices as a kid he's living his dream playing for the Buckeyes no question he used to see him when he was about seven or eight years old his younger brother out of practice all the time over to Woody Hayes facility he said live in a dream and how about Tom Harmon saying he's the MVP of the offense because of his unselfish attitude and his willingness to be a great blocker for pendulums on Michigan State here's a pitch to Elliot in the backfield thought we might see a flag no neutral zone infraction and a big play from Shelley Calhoun for that look to me like that was offsides by Damon Knox at the line of scrimmage right Darryl to the left guard surprised that that was not called here's Calhoun making his presence felt just use his quickness there to get to the outside because not letting Ellie get outside of him Baldwin didn't really have much of a chance there but I think David Knox got away with their or the won their first content of a fiveyear friendly they lose five Calhoun this is his kind of game he loves the bright lights a big game player that defensive end their steps up the leaders across the little catch made that inside the 10yard line devin Smith has been active there are flags down after the throg did a rough Barrett perhaps might have been hands to the face by the left tank personal foul hands in the face he's Taylor Decker erasing a big game then inside the ten yeah Taylor Decker got his hands up really both he and the Michigan State defender both right there he grabs ahold of his facemask they're both grabbin each other's face masks but I think initially he saw the left tackle initiate the contact row hi Oh state another penalty so instead of picking up the first step and they continue to go backwards but that's the matchup that Ohio State is going to try to attack inside receivers against safeties in mantoman coverage they've got to win that battle so second and 30 they have it off Eliot nothing there another stop the junior from Middletown New Jersey Pennington bro yeah future prowin a guy who started a little bit slow this year and he admitted that to us on Friday that for whatever reason things just weren't clicking he felt maybe some pressure to live up to the year that he had a year ago and the Nebraska game he just started to kind of relax and just play football and not for stands his teammates Dunham played like you can play bring the old she leak back and he has lately Berra pressured again tried to desperation Heath to the sidelines Demetrius Cox was there was a side with his throw look inside the tackle box Danelle throw a flag and a first ad at the Michigan say 22 and kept moving back back back to their own 45 and here is the pressure they just overload the Ohio State left side who you can't see he's been coming from the outside with Demetrius Cox the back Elliott can only pick up one of them the Ohio State offensive line slides to their right instead of to the left and Elliott had to try to pick up two Blitzers for Michigan State because me might have even been down before threw the ball away on the run Cameron Johnston the Aussie who does this as well as anyone but guys down at the 6 yard line Chris Connor in the studio for an update Chris all right Chris time for Taco Bell's studio update LSU strikes first in Death Valley Anthony Jennings finds Malachi Dupre originally ruled out of bounds they reviewed it said it was a touchdown send the nothing Tigers and they're squarely out playing Alabama in the first quarter meanwhile it's as good as we thought it would be at Fort Worth Kansas State trailing TCU by 7 Chris busy busy night Chris will kind of you to keep us posted all these games of course interconnected in this playoff chase month from tomorrow the final bracket is revealed so Spartans are backed up as the Buckeyes down the punt Langford he's trying to get yet another 100yard game in conference come in and his streak is 12 in neuro pulling ahead of Virginia now by 15foot LSU is their more improved team from Oak not at all you talk about the connection of all these conferences with with the playoffs rankings in this stadium they have these big jumbo screens they're showing the end of the Auburn game and when Oliver finally fumbled in the game was over this stadium went crazy as if the Sparty's had just scored a touchdown it's a function of the new era isn't it they're very aware of what's going on around the country Auburn with a second loss just like Notre Dame hit the figure a to lost Tiger team a long shot at this point yeah pretty much sit on it down their way on the outside there's the screens and the entire stadium was filled up it was quiet because everybody's watching like they're in their family room watching the end of that Auburn game and after that fumble they as I said they just went berserk and I said I thought was the last time Michigan State cared about the am Auburn game now they're gonna care about TCU no inside of a minute in the first quarter and third and eight good it's good protection delivers but it's drops it's a couple drops that was an obvious drop by liquid whose the dominant receiver on this team and it's fourth down and third down they have soft coverage from Ohio State corners are bailing it's an easy throw some personality holds a first down it's something that I forget to term that that Connor cook told us that you know when the coroner's bail he has a term that he and his receivers have where they're gonna take advantage of that every single time Vicki said free access maybe was the term he used because when corners bail on third down one take the first down move the sticks but that time limit dropped it Sadler from his end zone he boots it away pretty good punt into the breeze and Marshall makes a fair catch at the 48 Urban Meyer of course thirteenth season as a head coach did some damage to the big ten when he was the Florida Gators head coach beat this Ohio State team of course for a BCS title as an underdog when a pair of titles briefly retired and then took what he considers really his dream job at his home state was a broadcaster I think he really thought he was gonna be doing that for a number of years the Ohio State job which was his dream job opened up and retirement was short there's going to be a different approach I think you can for the time we've been around in the bowlinggreen Utah Florida it does feel different he's still intense and competitive but has things in perspective I think how do you mean different he's wants to win as badly as ever different in a way where it's not every single moment of his life and day has got three kids he spends a lot of time with them he goes back tivities with her sporting events he's still competitive he's still crazy but he still inspired up as he ever will be 15 and again you can see both these outfits at the defensive lines so anxious to get off the ball quickly few penalties like this already in this first quarter we've seen about nine to the nine penalties left side defense under for contact in the neutral zone fiveyard penalty first a few open like that they got away with one that wasn't called these big games miscues whether it's turning the football over penalties think about that penalty after that nice pass Ohio State had deep into Michigan State Territory the hands in the face personal foul that was called back to be the difference in a game time at times back we started first and 10 at the 49 and another flag and a whistle comes in control the adrenaline up there I take the speed of the game remember they've been playing Illinois and Rutgers and Maryland the speed of the game is very different and I think that time it was just a simple fact that Zeek Elliott knew he had to be able to pick up pass protection and he started to lean a little bit and sheet a little bit there's a little bit of a different tempo right now for both these team that they're adjusting to compared to the rest of the conference that they're used to playing Barrett wrapped up dropped Joe Heath the tackle got him his first full sack of the season but he should give it a system a leak McDow because he ate up a double team on the right side and opened it makes it one on one for him against Billy price and he just used his power with his shoulder but also quickness to go right by him that's the thing with Joe heat a chilling 66 290 pounds he's a big man but has great quickness in the inside for the Spartans pass rush he's another Ohioan from Cincinnati that's he imposing good looking off the bus defensive line for Michigan State admit already impacting things in this first quarter 147 for the guys at all Green back after this message and a word from your local ABC station 14/7 our sport at Michigan State on top we begin the second quarter an eventful if somewhat sloppy first quarters the teams try to settle down flush out the nerves get used to this best fast tempo as you said four very strange first quarter when Michigan State has 14 points in Connors book has two completions both the Keith Humphrey Lippitt doesn't have a catch yet yet they have 14 points now state running the ball well in the first quarter its first and throw for Barrett delivers far side diving play made at the 45 that's Michael Thomas high estate has a lot of respect for tre way in the corner into the boundary number 15 but they're gonna have to try to make plays against the sophomore from Solon Ohio they take another peek at that Gary Hicks time Thomas against hits to the field his world states so far trying to make a lot of completion that's against the safety Thomas is the nephew of Keyshawn Johnson as bad as he shuns brother of course comes from Los Angeles and they'll now stop to see if Thomas held on to that football he's trying to grip it as he fell to the ground previous plays on the further review the role in the field which would plea to pass this is a this is good at the look as you're gonna get we all got into his chest kirk and then seemed to come free as it got here his right hand gets under the ball I get squirts free good effort laying out there but he didn't make the hand sketch he sort of bounced off of his body down toward the ground tried to sell it a lot of times officials will look to see if you have possession of the football because the ground can the ball can actually touch the ground as long as it doesn't help you possess the football dave khatai is our official here what do you think that the repaint booth is next door Steve Newman taking a look at it day well well said you guys because it looks like he does have the ball but the ball comes loose bounces back to him so he doesn't have secure percent possession of the ball just because the ball hits the ground doesn't necessarily mean it's incomplete but the ball moves okay he's had the one hand on the ball it was touching the ground even if the I was gonna say Brazil 3015 yeah third 14 they do show the replays in the city exam around the country the crowd here is pretty convinced that that was incomplete but they've not been completely unbiased for maybe eight percent of the stadium this feels almost balmy now I feel good this morning no coat and gets first for the first wheel opportunity's getting the madrasa for the cool weather so the call of catch's overturn we move the ball back to the 36 a really long third down boy 23 yards now completely different Paul obviously from third and 14 where you have a shot to third at 23 against this defense which is third in the nation third down defense only giving up 26% of the chances on third down his pressure Duggars farside smiteth Thundercat to the 20 and they convert a confirmed a mile the placement but have flipped the foot back here by JT parent he just drops it right over his shoulder they outside look at Hicks I'm surprised he didn't try to make him work to get around him and if you want to try to run strive for stride with Devon Smith you're not going to win that battle very often he's the fastest player in the Ohio State roster didn't get challenged at the line of scrimmage and the ball the way it was thrown away towards the sidelines gives Smith a lot of credit for waiting to get to the outside and let the ball come right down to him as a wildcat look as Jalen Marshall number 17 comes into the game play clock at four runs right Tyler Marshall scoring down inside the 10 here's a wrinkle we expected to see Jalen Marshall played quarterback in high school at Middletown down in the Dayton Cincinnati area was a great dual threat quarterback plays now the H position here behind dontre Wilson but comes in goes back to his old roots here as a quarterback and a threat to throw it as well Marshall Rowling Loused Elliott lead blocker dragged down inside the five you know Barrett's a good runner but you can see the difference Marshall accelerates quickly completely different feel it's reminiscent of last year when Braxton Miller had his hands on the ball but every other play running it remember down here with the background of Urban Meyer he loves to run the quarterback and also the jump pass first and goal Marshall carries for a third straight plane not down by rush at about the two such different acceleration visa Ethan H he's an hback he's a wide receiver will be checking out of the game now but when he gets his hands on the ball it's it's a tailback or a receiver with his hands on the ball gets to the perimeter in a hurry she leaked Calhoun fine defensive end we've been talking about slowly get up i they cannot afford to lose our doozy sticks with his starters liens on these guys to play a lot of snaps including number 89 who'll leave now on third and goal good to see him walking off such a big part of this this defense now again not sitting here first guessing or speculating but all I know is you and there for two hours watching practice there's a lot of time spent on the jump pass down inside this 5yard line Ohio State Barrett is back in the game Eliot to his left third and goal Willson motions into a wing position hands it straight ahead and stop short of the goal line taijuan Jones and that Davis linebackers combined to stop Elliott now a decision coming up and they attack downhill pretty good leg drop here by Zika Elliott to try to get the ball into the end zone but yet linebackers and also the safeties are Jay Williamson and Curtis drumming helping out as well inside that oneyard line we've been waiting the entire season for November 8th for this game how about this moment a goalline stand 4th down here with a lot on the line in this football game here early a lot is shifting in the play clock was winding down for the night expected down the call time so a big play coming up early second quarter but guys trying to tie it my assay took the ball at midfield they've driven it to the one now right into the teeth of Michigan State's student section Urban Meyer as the offense on the field going to the touchdown man the time three receiver formation has to tighten higher than along with Eliot Liat motions out now farik keeps it dives muscles to the end zone a fourth down conversion and Ohio State within a p80 of tying things great leg tribe there by JT Paris Michigan State once they saw Elliot motion out they knew exactly what was coming they were there to stop it they held their point the held the point there at the line of scrimmage but at the end of the day of Sue's JDT parent 225 pounds lowering his shoulder and driving the Spartans into the end zone about the third and 23 conversion hearing the 43 yard pass the beautiful throw to devin Smith setting up the touchdown this was the king devin Smith does a good job as staying at the numbers opening up the alley this is third and a mile see the outside he waits to the last moment to break away from Hicks balls perfectly prong sets up this fourth down where he's going to try to just overpower the right side behind Baldwin and elf line wasn't necessarily great blocking but it was kind of a stalemate there it's a line of scrimmage here's a great look there's contact before he gets into the end zone and there's the legs right there pushing him into that end so to tie this game up has 90 yards passing 86 of them 5 receptions the guy who admitted this week that he cried for about two days after Ohio State lost the Big Ten title of Michigan State launched their chances to play for a BCS title very open about his emotions have devastated he was makes a huge catch that set up the tie down here I did do it away it's a short kick directed to one of the up man at the 15 cutting it back Trevor Pendleton not the natural return guy but looks like a fullback with the ball up to the 35 yard line here's that Big Ten championship game Braxton Miller and the Buckeyes a 24 zip run to take the lead Connor cook to place 27:24 blank for the 26 yard scamper that Michigan State scores the first 17 and the last 17 to head to the Rose Bowl they of course beat Stanford game has been on the minds of both of these teams config it helped take Michigan State to a different level of respect I think it added a lot of fuel to the fire of Urban Meyer and Ohio State to try to get back into those kinds of games of getting another opportunity for sound throw good complete city shortgame we check in a couple on the couch guys Connor cook was a very honest about that Ohio State win and that rose but win change to rising it's so unreal there isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about it and think about those two wins and where some might get complaints it just the opposite for him he said it gave me more confidence maybe want to work further thanks ed that was interesting to hear him say that unlike pushing things in the past focusing only in the moment that he everyday thinks about that that moment in past the Dean of it Bucks performance against the Cardinal for a guy growing up in Northeast Ohio and didn't have a ton of offers to be able to play quarterback at Michigan State was such a proud tradition a quarterback play and to be able to come back become that guy he is living a dream he doesn't take it for granted third and three quarterback keeps it he takes a big shot but at six for about 220 Cooke who ran over a Wolverine defender here in the last game two weeks ago to ignite the offense not afraid to pay the price what he needs to know in any speed can surprise who is deceptive with his athletic ability to speed because he's six for you don't necessarily think he can take and run the ball that well but he can sugar you see that some points and I'd be able to run away from a defender too and get out into the open field her memory has two completions tonight Ohio State has Duran grant following Tony Lippett all over this field on the delay the handoff but sworn in the backfield his Nick Hill is Michael Bennett the senior tackle got through quickly the Centerville elk is had a great career last year he was banged up Henson stingers he said he basically was playing with one arm I asked him if the idea of a procedure done and he said you know I guess the only thing I could really do is rest it but he has incredible explosiveness there in the inside nice job to slip the Centreville Healthcare undefeated right make sure fiveyard loss played by Bennett no SIL in the game the cooks drop it straight back pressure throws of the hits but complete underneath Josiah price the tight end is hammered right near the marker first catch for price nice chop by price but how about Connor crook here's to toughness looking down the barrel here Washington is closing in he beats his man he's about to get its act and how about it being six four and keeping your eyes a great look in his eyes he throws that ball before price even turns around anticipates it had to get rid of it because of the pressure from Washington there's the experience at counter cook nice hands for a tie it into twice we had that go ahead touch down with your shogi against the Buckeyes whistle before third and one like Dino call that from the sideline Michigan State's first of the half be a full charge turnout so back and forth the Spartans with a key third down play coming up when you come back Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by dr. pepper always oneofakind jarred the gallery of jewelry truly unique designs that you won't find just anywhere that's why he went to Jared and Buick five expectations shattering models another reason to experience the new Buick both schools but especially Ohio State Representative the Armed Forces with Veterans Day approaching ESPN salutes America's Heroes all the men and women who have served and are serving our country in the Armed Forces no doubt many around the world with ties at these two schools looking in at Michigan State facing the 3rd and 1 at the Buckeye is 46 it's Nick Hill and a quick snap and the Spartans move the chains comes into the game not Langford snap the quickly change of pace Hill comes in different styles oh hi Oh state usually plays a boundary in a field corner but because of the respect they have for Tony Lippett who's one of the best receivers in the country definitely in the Big Ten they have grant just following him all over the field when he is in the game now in the game sophomore tailback his first carry of the night falls Porter for a night I quite a short defense so far Kurtis we used to sing this year no not at all that time Carrie Darrin leaned with him for about another five yards after the initial contact is being made on differently I mean Langford is a slasher and a veteran guy who has great vision Nick Hill comes in five eight about 195 pounds a little bit more of a guy you want to get out in space and his guys alone here 230 pounds he saw right there he just lowers his shoulder still in the game blank put his back emotions out to the right side they handed again the physical young back they're just hammers forward first X at the 31 and what right now what they're doing is Bennett is getting such penetration that they're trying to use that against it he gets a feel if they're now using their offensive lineman just to let him go up field and then the facts are cutting up underneath of it that means when that happens the linebackers right now would you have a true freshman rake want McMillan also Darren Lee and Josh parry they've got to close in when they undercut the Ohio State defense a line like that first down this is Williams again Delton Williams hammering through Ohio State's defense we had 36 carries this season coming up watch too much Bennet right here getting up field and watch the linemen what they're doing ik nice pole right there they just pushing him out of the way he's getting Heat beat his man very often this time they pull the right tackle Clark and a nice trap that pushes him out of the way again keep an eye on Michael Bennett he is beating his man because of that they they can't block him right now so they're finding different ways to offset his quickness foot there make that tackle seven yards on first down promotion Shelton hammer the first 10 that's a mono six front standing up there's Raekwon McMillan Urban Meyer I'll tell you he was recruited by every school in the country out of Georgia a lot of people thought he might go to Alabama looked at Clemson ended up going to Ohio State and is the future of the Ohio State defense he will become the face of the Ohio State defense playing more and more for the veteran senior Curtis Grant but he's a difference maker at the middle for the Ohio State defense he got four have tackles for loss he does not look like a true freshman is a little better 40 pounds Langford back in the game it's an option look cook fakes it picks his way dives for a first down so for the third time on the drive moves to change with his feet yep does a nice job of following his blockers Cody Keeler is in here 79 he's just gonna follow him out here and then he's going to become just patient watch how he just kind of lets his play develop waits he gave a little bit of a ball fake there to get Darren Lee out of position but there's the nifty feet from Connor cook as it's been a typical passing night for this four of nine for 77 yards in three first down rushes for him still got it fires near side complete Shelton that's a dodgy tackler lunges to the a it's a first and goal Vaughn bell stopped him with the Spartans and playing with tempo themselves threatening to take the lead again a little bit of confusion I think in the Ohio State coverage Darren Lee kind of came up shrugged his shoulders looking over in Eli Apple and maybe not quite on the same page but it's a matter of time with Connor cook and his group of wide receivers the but guys have done a very good job of containing them up to this point but at any moment he gets into rhythm they become explosive on the passing game to offset the pressure on their run again Connor cook keeps it again and of pinball's down inside the bars Jarrell guard and quarterback muscle showing the strength pushing the pile backwards how about the spin move this guy's from Northeast Ohio playing the Ohio State Buckeyes he'd beat him last year he knows that they want revenge he's got those legs driving he's trying to take it all the way to the end zone he is leaving his heart literally on this field tonight a little spin move here initially at the contact he doesn't give up on that play I thought he might be down there but he just continued to carries Buckeye defenders all the way down to the oneyard line wholesale subs as the Buckeyes bring in fresh herbs for that line on second and goal langford perils into the end zone Spartans reclaim the lead they're gonna first you go Kirk they score a touchdown 95% of the time here power down there at those big offensive linemen two Titans they go heavy they dare you to stop they just get physical inside that 5yard line but what a drive there by Connor cook the leadership they're making some throws making a few runs and making some great decisions we've seen some quick strike touchdown drives that was oldschool methodical Big Ten seven minutes and 50 seconds 14 plays to cover 66 yards a little bit of everything here kept the drive alive with his feet but when it comes to scoring a touchdown for the Spartans they get the ball to number 33 they get heavy up front with that offensive line they get the surge and a push that they wanted again jump out on top of Ohio State eager to see but John Saunders Mack Brown Danny Caine they'll have to say at halftime about this game and all the other show downs that are going on around the country Capital One halftime report coming up Alabama has tied LSU at 7 apiece in Baton Rouge CCU beginning to impose itself at home against Kansas State wicked just scored a touchdown dontre Wilson from the goal line knocked down short the twenty ball comes out again another special teams fumble by Ohio State and those burdens are setup Monty Nicholson made to recover what's going on with the Buckeyes special teams dontre Wilson is not taking care of the football there's initial contact right there he's still up but Chris Frey again involved and knocking that ball loose 23 there is the initial contact and dontre Wilson who's undersized as a return man doesn't get down and protect the football it balls on the ground again and the Spartans take advantage of the opportunity to turnovers now for Ohio State not just turnovers but special teams turnovers you you fumble a punt like that or a kickoff like that it is usually disastrous Spartans up 7 set up in the red zone a first down throw delivers over the middle into traffic a dangerous play trying to bid it in there to McGarrett Kings junior Vaughn Bell in the coverage Chip Kelly and the Eagles hosting the Panthers a good one on Monday Night Football 8:15 Eastern Time you're right about Connor Cook trying to it was a tight window he tried to squeeze that into remember the last drive three for three in passing he ran the ball four times all four times he ran the football resulted in a first down you see tonight Kirk Heather reported to us that the Tony Lippett appeared to be limping a bit didn't look quite right doesn't have a catch tonight he was the dominant weapon typically for cooking handed off inside this is Kings and the receiver darts forward dives down to the 11 yard line it'll be third down and short Kings as a receiver but is basically as a receiver lines up out there and has the ability of a running back but they'll they'll motion around they're very very multiple whether it's jet sweeps handing the ball off to wide receivers or motioning them as they did there with Kings back into the backfield because of that explosiveness they'd like to get his hands on the football mumphrey motions in they handed coming back this way don't Langford brush down and touchdown flag is down though if flag is down at the 13 yard line this may come back to hold by Jacqueline the center who is pulling around the left end he got ahold at a corner Eli Apple holding you don't see sinners polling very often but Jack Allen has that kind of athletic ability usually very very sound and does a great job here he is right here he's going to pull around and this is the man that he gets locked up with Eli Apple who's trying to contain the plane not let the play get to the outside he grabs him around the neck and pulls him down pretty easy call for the official we will drill sure was very well drilled offensive line marks Staton is the offensive line coach it's a smart group don't often make mistakes like that taking the touchdown off the board so it's third and 13 cook has time goes to the endzone beautiful for laying out trying to make a diving catch with Josiah price crowd wanted interference as prices flow to get up fourth down we talked about Tony Lippett up to this point having a quiet night but Joey Bosa haven't seen much of him at all and it's not just been against Jack Conklin Donovan Clark also doing a good job of holding up in pass protection but we have not called Joey BOCES name at all especially on those third downs when Ohio State needs pressure on Connor Cook that line is doing a good job of taking care of for the most part anyway Connor cook so a field goal attempt from 39 from the slumping Michael Geiger who certainly has the coach's confidence as missus have been narrow this one starts left and stays left they get a problem that kicker now for a guy who missed only one of his 16 attempts last season now he's just 7 of 13 ohio state in the kick off it looks like Michigan State's going to be able to capitalize probably a touchdown and very least a field goal and they come away with nothing Buckeyes ball Chris Connor in studio with the doctors tephra conference Upstate let's start the SEC Amari Cooper beautiful after the catch spin move at the 12 yard line he goes into 23 yards out 7 to 7 Alabama and LSU in Baton Rouge meanwhile in the big 12 you've got TCU and kstate trevone Boykin up and over the top he scores his third touchdown of the day 24/7 for frogs on top guys whereas thank you what a cartwheel play by Boyken he's a rally to wheat West Virginia last week Merida first down throw on a slant complete wedding phrase medical Thomas middle 40 a foot race and Thomas 79 yards for Keisha Johnson's nephew his seventh touchdown of the season Wow they Calhoun is down again for the second time talked about how they felt they could attack there in Hicks to field corner you to go after the safeties or you go after the field corner here's Jalen Marshall he will take his man with him and that creates the oneonone opportunity for Ohio State feels they can make plays Thomas who's been coming on this year has really grown up the quick slant to the inside Hicks misses the tackle in the open field and how about Thomas 325 pounds he outruns Curtis Drummond to get to the endzone but how physically was there a nice route to the inside a missed tackle by him and there's to speed by Michael Thomas I'm sure he'll be as good as his uncle Keisha but he is an imposing impressive looking guy 79 yards Kirk the longest play this part have given up this season it's the longest catch for Thomas of course Nurnberger a chance to tie things again Michigan State keeps jumping in front by a touchdown Buckeyes keep tying to back up 21 apiece go to Chris FeliCa the bear for Aflac trivia question Chris when you got this gentleman it's time for tonight's Aflac trivia question with the win tonight Mark Dantonio will improve to 3 and 3 versus Ohio State is Michigan State head coach who is the last Spartan head coach to have a winning record against the Buckeyes wabash against a head coach Tuffy Doherty bear that's going you know the answer to all things like that is Duffy Doherty could be one of those trick Ricky Williams played once or twice Sabin had a big win here in 99 I wish you could say that was the last time Michigan State was the highest ranked team in this match up first what is the answer the answer is indeed prevents a fleckeri question Nick Saban choo and won three games so I was hoping I was gonna get a big Iman guest before what happened a couple of weeks ago yeah put good job became partial credit for you crew only two and one I only know the big was in 98 or 99 the big one where they beat him in Columbia was the big one in Columbus there so official when you do that he's writing the script isn't he I mean he is officials get a sweater on he looks the part looking good fair 3:19 before halftime you could say keep surging in front Ohio cities and certainly when you play mantoman coverage and you just kind of live on the edge your corners better hold up on an island and right now darien hicks is becoming an issue for patton are doozies defense Lankford a stutter step speaking of the island you just wonder when is Tony Lippett couldn't shake free make a player is that leg not a hundred percent tonight's aerial coverage provided by Goodyear whether you're going for it from a few yards out or from miles away go with the tire with superior performance Goodyear more driven could be a combination of see if lipid and whether or not that injury is causing him to be a step or too slow or Durant grant a senior with experience matched up with them and has been again following him all over the field doing a heck of a job go delivers far side white into traffic and right on cue Lippitt makes his first catch grip was wait with him that's a perfect ball or it's an incompletion up at the top of the screen Brandt is right there stride for stride that ball is thrown to the backside shoulder which is why limpets able to hold on to that football and it came out in a hurry before I think he even came out of his break they're throw it's a screen batted down getting the big hand up was Michael Bennett Lippitt is the best big play receiver in the big 10 finally on the board but only 11 yards there Heather meanwhile a note on on Michigan State's defense defense eventually Calhoun has pain on the interior of his left knee they thought about putting the neoprene sleeve brace on he shook them off he's testing it right now hoping to return when Michigan 60 offense takes the field eager to get back out there on his feet shifting around my guys show pressure on second and ten cook steps up deliver is over the middle incomplete tried to get it to lip it again Durant with close coverage this is outstanding coverage by Durant grant with the right hand again he's locked up against one of the better receivers in the big ten comes around with a right hand he was physical on the route led him to be able to run his route once he cut to the middle but did not interfere it all with lip it got around Lippett and knocked the ball away with his right hand grant from Akron is good buddies with Connor cook they've trained together as high school players played in an allstar game together but he broke up a nice little dart from cook to set up third and ten father played at Michigan State as well Ted Jones a wide receiver for the big grain but guys seem to come across the line of free play fire incomplete would be third and five now it was Joey Bosa trying to get a jump again we talked about him having a a quiet night I think he may have offside defense under 97 fiveyard penalty no tackle she had Kirk but a penalty yeah that's that's not necessarily a great first half again it's a 60 minute game but he's probably frustrated trying to do the best he can on third down to pin his ears back and try to get some pressure and just jump the gun there Michigan State will get another chance here at third down let's tape Ohio State brings to blitz typically when they do on third down they'd like to bring it with Darren Lee third and medium hasn't been a real good situation for this Barnes off and suprisingly cook in the pocket delivers again incomplete for some reason although they're great on third is short and really good on third and long plays like that have troubled this offense this year they sure have and I don't know if he just doesn't look settled in the pocket I found it interesting that Joey Bosa who's a defensive end is lined up is a middle linebacker right here and they blitz him up the middle they moved Aaron Lee up to the outside trying to give the Michigan State offensive line a different look and maybe try to create some confusion with their protection but nonetheless that time Connor cook felt the heat just could not find a rhythm there the ball goes throwing him it's balls thrown to the ground but guys get the ball back Sadler they only had 10 guys in the field ran a man out late on fun coverage the boots it down low angle taken at the 10yard line by Jaylon Marshall Marshall cuts it back still winning Jalen Marshall showing the strength and the speed finally wrestled down to the 35 at about a 26 yard return final two minutes before halftime get your NFL SUNDAY set it on ESPN 10:00 eastern time Sunday NFL countdown presented by Snickers Chris Berman and the guys news updates predictions right up until kickoff also on the watch ESPN app so Connor cook was a 61% pass here only six of 16 in this first half and good news is that Shelley Calhoun is going to give it a go back out there well hi Oh state has scored a couple times tonight in a hurry a minute one and also another drive in 11 seconds so they're taking about points here with just under two minutes to go in two timeouts play action fires near sideline nobody there dontre Wilson that time just did not run around that's a problem he's having a rough first half my estate unable to get the ball to that HVAC spot part of their plan tonight and anybody who plays Michigan State that inside receivers got to make plays up to this point most of the receptions had gone out to the outside a devin Smith and Michael Thomas in fact all of them have second and ten brush you're off the edge Buckeyes pick it up but Berra delivers a strike receivers knee was down Michael Thomas right when he made the catch so it's third and short nice job of picking up the Blitz right guard as he said crisp at elf line came over thought you might see a sign adjust but this offensive line has really grown up from where they were in week two against Virginia Tech with four new starters to come in and almost the season under their belt a lot better communicating especially on the road empty backfield on second two Spartans pressure up the middle Barrett rolls out and fires complete Evan Spencer the steady senior as a first down good idea by Tom Herman Irv admired have moved the launch points move the quarterback away from the pressure and again there's soft coverage from the field corner Hicks he's had a rough night tight in coverage they're trying to help him out by getting him off the line of scrimmage now he's up tight against Michael Thomas who he gave up a touchdown to Eric rolls get the ball on the run the fireman minute see before halftime a house say it has a couple of timeouts along our dues he's approached a defense his corner to the field has had a rough night tonight instead of changing or giving up on him he keeps him out there continues to play his defense you beat him for a touchdown for a big play it's not as if he's going to abort and say hey guys we got to get out of this defense he's going to stay stick to his guns and look up here how tight that coverage is what guy was already with more yards in this first half the Michigan safe gives up on average for a whole game 288 total offense playaction Barrett loops downfield J T Barrett with beautiful touch on deep balls tonight that's what you've got to do against this Michigan State defense you've got to be able to take some shots downfield and you got to hit him last year and Indianapolis they had these same shots and they missed him whether it was a drop ball or an errant pass the way you attack Michigan State that gets mantoman coverage as you got it take some big plays and a lot of times to the inside wide receivers matched up against the safeties some of these Spartan defenders said this week he beareth tougher to defend than Braxton Miller might raise some eyebrows the Buckeye fans but these are some pretty throws tonight from number 16 but guys in front here's the matchup right here with RJ Williamson against again a fast wide receiver in devin Smith he's going to go right by him the safety will not have time to get over there it's a great throw by JT Barrett because of the way he used his eyes to freeze this safety right in the middle and now he gives it has enough room there for devin Smith and the ball has got to be thrown on a line he can't put it up in the air to give Drummond time to come over he puts it on we're devin Smith perfect timing with the speed and again he's probably the fastest receiver on the Ohio State roster matched up against RJ Williamson who's a safety and coverage it's by designed by Tom Herman the Urban Meyer to get that matchup at that time they were able to capitalize what a first half for Smith targeted seven times he's caught six of them for 129 yards Barrett only has ten completions but averaged 23.2 for completion couple of touchdowns that one was 44 yards they played from behind the whole first half now have their first lead it's a short kickoff they can at the 8yard line by RJ Shelton who's wrapped up quickly great tradition of receivers at the Ohio State University that's amazing look at these guys Ohio State over the years there's a lot more receivers on that list I'm my good buddy Joey Galloway I got a throw on that list but Santonio Holmes devin Smith he's gonna pass Chris Carter before he's done this season you know ways to go to catch David Boston after the play personal foul Michigan number 22 Michigan they won't like that here you don't want to say that so with 51 seconds before halftime Dantonio he's got the scowl back on the face likely to be conservative they'll get the ball to begin the second half but boy some lightning strikes by Barrett to Smith and Ohio State in front now JT apparently has Tom Herman what would you say now that he's about nine games into his freshman year what was his strength toughness and accuracy the two things that he pointed out think we've seen a lot of that here in this first half from JT berry Langford spins ahead news fans just not used to seeing this at NAR doozy in the booth watches his guys give up 332 first half yards to Ohio State again they're only allowing for a whole game 279 coming in they have not faced an offense other than Marcus Mariota who had an ability to attack them vertically downfield Ohio State with JT Barrett and this group of wide receivers that was their plan and that's what they've done so far in this first half timeout Jansen took him with Chris Carter in the studio Chris time for a get it done brought to you by Wells Fargo at TCU Zaire and Green get it done in the stead of BJ Catalan who's out at this game green takes the handoff around the right side cuts it back left 65 yards later and the horn frogs are starting to look like super frogs right now 31 14 over K state getting ready to start on ESPN Marcus Mariota the Ducks and Salt Lake City taking on the Utes then it kickoff just after 10 o'clock we'll keep you updated as this game progresses throughout the night Chris great job Chris the Ducks of course in that bracket position moving in ahead of Alabama and TCU but the Horned Frogs making a statement trying to match what Baylor did earlier today hammering the Sooners in Norman of course they have that narrow headtohead win over TCU Langford break 3 has a first down after the 28 with 41 seconds to go what the Spartans spend the time out to take a deep shot here brought up an interesting point which would be a big topic over the weekend and into Tuesday night people forget that Baylor TCU Baylor beat TCU and a shootout was it 60 150 and 21 points down in the fourth quarter they came back all the focus is on TCU but as the bear just whispers in my ear the nonconference scheduling that Baylor is opted for could come back to backfire on them Lankford breaks free zero first down with 15 seconds and see if Michigan State does spend a timeout not a great deal of urgency here trailing for the first time tonight take a look at this week's rankings from the committee brought to you by Capital One and earlier we talked about Auburn losing for a second time two fumbles in the closing minutes they usually win games like that in strange ways they lost one in a strange way the ball snapped off of Nick Marshall's leg as they were trying to go down a kick a time field goal Alabama now in front of LSU after trailing 7 nothing what's crazy we knew this was gonna be a big day and we still have four weeks to go and usually in November that's when you see things you think might this might happen and the other thing happens we're going to still see upsets all along the way but even tonight Oregon's plan Utah in Salt Lake keep an eye on that game as well and an opportunity for the winner of this game Michigan State in better position coming in but Ohio State if they would come in here and beat Michigan State on the Spartans home field that's a massive uptake I think in the minds of the committee if you like Michigan say it's sitting there at a why wouldn't you put Ohio State in that position if they get the win here 30 more minutes to go I'll see what happens in it but if they do you're talking about going into their Stadium at night and I think the committee's been sitting there waiting to see Ohio State playing another game since the Virginia Tech game we they haven't had an opportunity to really show their talents cook flush out fires diving attempt but it's incomplete at the 40yard line with eight seconds to go price could not quite come up with it really for both of these teams they've been sitting back and waiting for November 8th to go up against a quality opponent to be able to state their case winner comes out of this game in a very unique position and a pretty good argument by the time it's all said and done perhaps still need some help but again help is arriving for your beef if three Ohio State players on the goal line three deep zone all the way back there see if Connor cook who's got a tremendously strong arm tries for a Hail Mary lots of crazy things have happened in the north ends on the new stadium they celebrate them on the wall of the recruiting center here take a quick timeout with eight seconds to go that's what the Hail Mary down there against Wisconsin that's right by cousins I was standing in this very spot when that happened I had a ringside seat very enjoyable we talked about Joe Thomas Barrett what he brings the skillset he's had it all on display tonight he sure has he got to the corner for a touchdown he showed his leg drive and his power but I think laid here this first half you've seen him be honest throw the football around he's 17 232 yards made some big players one to Michael Thomas to last sit devin Smith as Ohio State has kind of exploded here for 21 points in his second quarter and JT Barrett one thing about him see a look in his eyes he is a calm cool customer considering he's a freshman on the road in this environment keep in mind that Ohio State with a seven point lead here surviving two uncharacteristic first half turnovers Spartans able to catch one in for seven points a missed field goal by Michael Geiger part of this story here in the opening half but mostly it's been about Katie Barrett my estates three defenders have moved up to the 25yard line no longer waiting at the goal line as cooked steps up delivers throws into an open area with two seconds to go cook went down after he threw the ball five state actually got some pressure rushing three that time I don't know like Michigan State has the ball at their own but 40 yard line those guys that initially we're all the way back at the goal line it makes a little bit more sense to move them up or they might be in the action they're about 20 25 yards now Michigan State just shuts it down very exciting first half seven combined touchdowns Ohio State with the yardage edge of almost a hundred 332 total offense averaging almost 10 yards of play Wow let's go to have the Cox with Mark Dantonio Chris thank you coach your defense that's given up over 300 yards in the first half where do you need to tighten things up defensively in the second well you know too many big plays we go from being up by 14 all of a sudden being down now you know so the big swing on the thing so you know just got to get it done we got to regroup we know B you'd be a big push here got a push back that said what is your message to your team in the locker room keep playing coach thank you Chris succinct as you might expect in Michigan State gets the ball to start that second half indeed but Lankford Ennis barns in a 7point hole after these messages the Capital One halftime report you're watching the duck of pepper championship drive game of the week and welcome back ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit and Heather Cox JT Farrah distorted of an exciting if somewhat sloppy first half the quarterback for the Buckeyes two touchdown passes two touchdown runs three times Ohio State was down seven take their first lead late in the half unbelievable performance by JT Barrett and what we're learning here is when he has time to throw the Ohio State offensive line did a great job there in the first half he's got the receivers to try to be able to exploit mantoman coverage from Michigan State on the other side I think for Michigan State look at Connor cook he's not been able to get his main target Tony Lippett the football one reception in the first half I think you'll see them go back to what they did early in the game balanced attack with Jeremy Langford running and getting the ball oneonone to the outside but in the first half Duran was granted so those deserves a lot of credit for the way he defended lipid in that first half Spartans seven penalties including a costly one that nullified a Langford touchdown run eight surviving two fumbles on returns he booted away to begin the third quarter type formation for that coverage team and it contains Shelton who takes it at the goal line in process to the 23 Pacific Life game summary 101 passing yards for the Spartans offense but Ohio State grinding out 332 again that's more the Michigan State typically gives up an entire game and they knew coming in they would have to try to hit some home run to their passing game and as we said coming back here in the second half Barrett's had time to throw and they've been able to exploit that coverage one on one and how about the speed Michael Thomas and devin Smith really the two receivers that had the big first half let's go back to cook it's about Langford and about balance and trying to slow down the Ohio State defensive line my crew takes it you wore down Ohio State's defense in the second half of that Big Ten championship game at 106 yards after halftime Heather Chris Urban Meyer is very proud of his freshman quarterback JT Barrett especially in this environment seen our own line has done a great job giving him time and protecting him to make smart throws he said but we've got to be careful we expect Michigan State is going to quote blitz our tails off in the second half and a quick note guy that guy's michigan state's Tony Lippett I talked to their head athletic trainer Sally Noble he was good to go in the second half play on cue makes the catch mussels out to the 40yard line they hope he's good to go and much more productive than he was in the first 30 yeah grant again who isolated oneonone with him keep in mind lipid in 63 about 190 pounds that time bran just lost his footing good job coming back to the ball and keeping his footie by Tony limping he is going to become a big factor in this game whether he makes receptions or not Michigan State to do what they need to do we'll be going to him quite a bit here in his second half chemistry with cook built over summer long hot days in the summer throwing and catching again and again Langford spins still running hard charging back still alive gains about nine on first down great effort here but it's also a very nice job by the offensive line on that right side Bruce Jack Alan Donovan Clark creating some seams there to give the elusive Langford and the powerful Langford a little bit of room to wiggle through but you can see again when he gets that second level you better wrap him up you better get after his legs because if you're gonna go up to his upper body he's going to carry it for another three or four yards Kirk it's a 13th consecutive conference game that Langford has gone over a hundred yards and it to him again in the backfield ball comes up scramble for it and Michigan State dodges a bullet Allen fell on at the center preventing a turnover Joshua parry knocked it out of the running backs hands yes I think Ohio State one of their defenders it might have been time as Powell tried to pick it up it's scoop and score instead of just jumping on the football it's out 23 comes in here late and tries it scoop and score instead of just bouncing on it left the ball on the ground and the big Center saw the ball looked up just security but dive is Powell had a chance to jump on top of it right there it was Washington who forced the fumble the recovery instead of third and very short now third and nine play clock ticking down on cook it's at three pressure in the pocket he delivers strike caught first down at the Ohio State 40yard line Aaron Burr bridge cook stand in there and deliver protecting the state did come with the Blitz he has just enough time see how he went over top of lipid I mean a ball goes right over top of lipids head right into the waiting arms of Aaron Burr bridge for the first down I get 19 and third and nine they took a while to develop against the Blitz cook showed his toughness in his vision again downfield looking past the Blitz to his receivers first catch for Burt rich rook still got it delivers in traffic another strike it's a short games here at Kings and we're seeing Connor cook after a struggle in the first half come out sharp at that is going to come back a hold on the Spartans offensive line first time tonight we've seen Joey Bosa have an influence on his football game the right tackle matched up oneonone against beau sub osa using some quickness to the edge and the big right tackle locked up and brought down beau so to prevent him from getting to his quarterback why at night again for Bosa at that time just just the fact that he was out there putting pressure on the quarterback which could state ended up having to hold and it pushes him back it's a second costly hole that Dantonio made reference to the one that nullified the touchdown run by Langford play clock at two got a hurry they get it off and on first and 20 right between the 1 and the 3 with lots of green grass in front of them I don't know Luke fickle tells us he likes to recruit guys who play baseball because they could catch I don't know what I is thinking I don't he's thinking about going to score and touch or a buzz you got to make the play before you take off and run with it right as you say Chris that hit him right between the 1 and the 3 Kirk were beginning to see Bo's to make an impact he was off the edge we're sharing cooked that time second and 20 over the middle pot trying to make a play is Burbridge at inside the 40 sober birds has gotten involved as well as lipid here early in the third quarter it's still going to be third and eight time to actually drop Joey Bosa in coverage and it looked like they were gonna rush for but I'm just trying to change up their looks they try to get both kind of since and in almost a spy position to try to catch maybe an underneath pass but Connor cook doing a good job of singing him and getting the ball in the hands of the talent and receiver Burbridge third and eighth but guys rush for cook pastime delivers a strike first down McGarrett kings and we're seeing a different Connor cook here in the third quarter plays a little bit more service and he's getting rid of the football Michigan or Michigan State does a good job of going out to the middle the Ohio State defense they had a line back from McMillan who blitzed there was nobody left at middle good throw Langford here let's face it he got very lucky cooked it with Apple dropping that easy interception but you are seeing a more assertive quarterback here so far in the first five minutes of the second I also think that you know a lot of times when you when you get up to the line of scrimmage and you get a quarterback who's maybe had not quite the first half he's used to having used to making a few more plays a little bit more urgency to getting in and out of the huddle and getting up to the line of scrimmage going on a fast count that sometimes can help the rhythm of a quarterback to try to get him back into that flow find that zone again lip it to the bottom of the screen the left of cooked empty backfield the emotional Shelton in and give it to him the traffic drives for about three it'll be third and long again Macmillan on the tackle a heck of a battle kind of game which in the game is at michigan state experienced offensive line big in physical led by Jack Conklin the sophomore left tackle going up against this Ohio State front not just a defensive line Washington Bennett Miller and bowsub even the linebackers involved Darren Lee Curtis Grant Raekwon McMillan Josh berry it's been a physical night in the trenches on his side of the ball just made a third and nine needs seven yards this time book in the pocket delivers incomplete excellent timing there Duran grant got there broke up this good buddy cooks pass it sport down an instead of playing man which they have played quite a bit tonight when we talked about grant following limp it and playing a lot of mantoman this time is a changeup Chris ash goes along with Luke fickle goes with a zone and it puts Brant in a position to be able to make the play earlier Michael Geiger from this same position the left hash missed one and Mike black are our spotter here former Boise safe kicker points out this has been a trouble spot he's missed four times on field goals from the left hash in recent games that ton makes the correction and makes the field goal Spartans back within four Midway third quarter tonight's aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear Goodyear is in is the proud sponsor of the Goodyear Cotton Bowl and the college football playoff the gear and the blimp have been associated with so many top sports events for decades it's fitting they should help inaugurate this exciting era of the college football playoff Goodyear more driven Michigan State driving 56 yards methodically in 12 plays six 22 to cut in to Ohio State's lead Barrett will get the ball for the first time in the second half now Wilson spins hammer down across the 30yard line well Ohio State got going always playing from behind a four plays 71 yard touchdown drive after a punt at eight play drive they had a third and twenty three conversion then you had this 79yard slam to thomas threw a touchdown and the goahead draw of a five play 5064 yarder three possessions you see they've scored touchdown and they have picked on the michigan state secondary most specifically Darion Hicks and RJ Williamson a mantoman coverage that's a patent our doozy makes any adjustments to try to protect against that mantoman coverage they got again exposed a bit there in the first half Barrett still got it buyers for sign a dangerous throw tried to get the ball to Marshall but the senior safety Curtis Drummond was there and Curtis Drummond is there Penner covering safety they went after Williamson the other safety quite a bit in that first half but Boyd Curtis Drummond is a great player is senior another Ohio player playing for Mark Dantonio in East Lansing ball was behind the trumpet got a great jump on it got a hand on that knocked it away with five Big Ten sparks last year in that defense Eliot muscles ahead Ezekiel Ali almost broke free they finally wrestled him down at midfield period Hicks the corner prep save the touchdown a nice chalk five job at the right guard fat elf line but also tailored Decker the left tackle comes up and does a nice job of picking up a linebacker there's the tough there's there's the physicality from Ezekiel Eve he's not just the back was speed at 225 pounds he has the ability also to be able to break through those arm tackles and carry defenders 11 yards a carry tonight for Elliott against this tough Spartan run deep Barrett pitches farside which made by heuerman that tight in this first Darion Harris knocks it out of a boy Tom Arban Kirk had a nice play calling rhythm here it sure is and it's not just trying to have balance Chris it's a variety of formations it's a lot of different looks it's moving JT Barrett from from left to right sometimes from the pocket I think at any time you're going after a Michigan State defense you have to have an ability to be versatile with the run in the pass and in different looks right now they have trips three receivers into the short side into the boundary up at the top and look they haven't shown all night second down handoff Eliot cuts it back kind of bumps into a blocker there the tackle Baldwin at Davis drops from third down and about two and a half sometimes when you give a different look like that late the game you're just trying to see the reaction and the coverage from the defense and you might be setting something up the next time later in the game and just kind of getting a feel for an unusual formation that you might use because trips into the boundary is not something you see very often from in Ohio State all offense did he chew on this third down just a quarterback one game typically out of empty on third and short Barton's ready for the Barrett cuts it back and makes the first down it's so difficult to stop even when the entire city knows what's coming and you know it's coming does a nice job of following the block there that tied in heuerman but just really division there the natural running instincts of JT pair remember he ran a very similar offense in high school down in Texas for an ACL his fourth game as his senior redshirt at all of last year was expecting to be a backup this year to Braxton Miller and Braxton Miller gets hurt with 11 days until their opening game he hadn't played in two years for the most part as just getting better almost with every single rep that he takes my action merit as time on first down loops it downfield for Evans bent to knuckle two receivers converged it was Spencer and dontre Wilson in the same spot Wilson dropped it at the three well and we got a Michigan State defender down may have been the defender that was with dontre Wilson you're right Chris I Wilson I think was spooked by Evan Spencer he tried to still catch the ball but the play took so long because the coverage was so good that Wilson broke away late from the defender who actually went down and he's still down frustrating night for dontre Wilson a couple of drops he's the returner that had problems and that punt return when it hit the ground yeah it's RJ Williamson who had him in coverage again good to see him up it's been a rough night for jr. from date and he'll walk off very slowly you see a true freshman now Monty Nicholson you have to jump in fill in he's played a lot of football this year so there's a lot of reps under his belt but the coverage was so good I think JT Barrett was fortunate to have the amount of time that he had to be able to give the play even more time to give Wilson a chance to break away eventually from Williamson but should have been caught down there Trey was it couldn't hold on to the football that a first and goal and second ten Bharath ducks back takes off gets a nice bottom Eliot dies down three yards short of the first down third and short Tom Hartman told us see Kelly at 15 what do you like about Z Kelly the city he's the most physical back I've ever been involved with without his hands on the ball whether it's picking up a blitz pickup blocking for a quarterback like that on the quarterback draw he's a physical runner but he's even more impressed with what he can do when he doesn't have to hit his hands on the football how unselfish he is of the way he blocks that broke his wrist and camp played right through that he's now in a slot to the left of Barrett on third down JT steps up delivers nearside and coming back for the ball the Sun collecting it as Wilson first down at the 16 you had to Michigan State defenders get caught up with another receiver Torrey Smith seeing that they both stayed up towards the front of coverage JT Barrett went to the last second for dontre Wolfson to break free from the coverage two defenders stay up tight he's reading that plant defender who came up in coverage went right over top of it an easy throw in that time Wilson holds on to it he's finally on the board with his first catch that was a tougher one that he had down at the two yard line a minute ago Wilson's going to take the direct snap they've used two different players in the Wildcat formation it's a reverse Smith's gonna throw it now Evan Spencer pulls it down was looking in the end zone for another receiver but turns it into a positive play going back to what you said about top Herrmann really dialing it up I think they knew coming in a lot of different looks we've seen Jalen Marshall now you see dontre Wilson in the Wildcat trying to potentially throw the ball off the reverse there with Wilson at the quarterback spot Barrett back at quarterback now Elliot first and goal at the to use the Buckeyes offense continues to roll trying to make it a doubledigit lead here late in the third quarter they're gonna go tempo here gonna go fast with JD baronet's own Reid has been very effective all year for the Ohio State offense I think parent feels at ease running that and stays on the ride very long and he's patient with it there it again follows blocks knocked down at the 1 this is a crowd tough defense at Ohio State trying to make it 5 touchdowns in the last six possessions teenies Lansing talking so much about Barrett and the skill Chris we cannot say enough about the Ohio State offensive line in a way they have performed tonight it's a different unit from where they were at the beginning of the year these guys are playing as a group in his one hammer at that time right at the line of scrimmage by Shelley Calhoun is planned through some pain tonight and very slow to get up it'll be third and goal that's how you use your hands as a defensive lineman and your speed Calhoun known as it passed rusher that time he just went right around Darrell Baldwin used his hands in a hold laid him and made to play dirty play the Buckeyes first drop in this second half footandahalf from the goal line Eliott and Ohio State stretches the lead and a shrug BOCES style from the running back they're gonna shrug about just marvel at this offensive performance by Ohio State so far down about it is equally at almost averaging nine yards of carry that was a 13 play drive that took over six minutes off the clock and instead of settling for a field goal the Buckeyes get it touchdown and have a chance to go up 11 this crowd is stunned and silent Nurnberger makes it 35 24 the right car now flying Daryl Baldwin a good job you get the left guard Billy price pulling around and think everybody knew there's a good chance at Elliott would get his hands on the ball physical offensive line from Ohio State controlling the line of scrimmage and there's the shrug Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by AT&amp;T mobilizing your world as Lac ask about it at work and Cadillac Spartans lockerroom the truce and military paraphernalia that this from the US Marine Corps quote the motto of the green jersey is earned not given Tuesday night on ABC don't miss the allnew episode of Marvel agents of shield 9:00 Eastern here on ABC Ohio State underdogs here in East Lansing came to play they fell down by a touchdown three separate times in the first half finally took the lead to long drives in this third quarter car one by each team with the Buckeyes find the end zone up by 11 now up 11 to 18 remaining in the third quarter and it's an urgency for Michigan State's gonna have to be on display with that clock winding down that's for sure because the defense is not stopping Ohio State at all so far there's a fun day watching all these playoff impact games and said they all stayed sat on that football bus get out of the Allstate it's good sweepstakes for a chance to $100,000 plus a VIP trip for the college football playoff semi final game at the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game as well as weekly prizes those games we played indoors this one is not 0% chance of precipitation tonight Kirk so obviously it's snow always begin to fall here in the last few minutes just a light snow snow can bring you got a little snow here in Big Ten country Langford when I first outrun gains five and you said it they're not used to playing with great urgency at Michigan say because the defense is usually controlling the game the opposite is happening here so now cookin company back to work all of a sudden only two minutes left in the quarter yeah I think urgency is important but it's the same way he's at a rough night his face was crushed in there urgency but not necessarily getting away from the playbook and getting away from what they're trying to do by still having some balance with the run in the past Langford breaks free Langford has the corner midfield knocked out at the 41 yard line so very quickly on the ground the Spartans are threatening that's what I'm talking about you want to just all of a sudden started to panic you're down 11 is he closed it on the fourth quarter how about the job and offensive line there Travis Jackson really open that hole up but again as we see time after time with Jeremy Langford he doesn't need a lot of room and a lot of times had holes designed to go off to the right and he'll bounce it wherever he sees brass and if you don't close your gap and you're not sound he's gonna find a space and he's gonna get some big yards rook drops back pressure spins away and now is dropped in finally a sec michael bennet the tackle got him they lose about five say Michael Bennett has had a huge game tonight in the middle watch this watch the quickness that he uses just doesn't give up on the plane and who gave up when it was Conner Cruz I don't know what he was taking there he kind of gave up on it and the effort tenacious attitude from Bennett who again is much healthier this year we've called his name quite a bit whether it's been rushing the quarterback or being able to get penetration against their running game their top sacker post has been shut out but the Buckeyes have two sacks against an offensive line that's given up only five all year coming in 2nd and 16th Cooke delivers nearside a strike catch made out at the 35 yard line spun down is placed the tight end put cook at Michigan State offense in that second and long now they have a chance on third down very different this year with their third down package with the addition of Chris ash to the staff they've been a lot more aggressive with how they blitz and how they try to affect the offensive line at quarterback today sit back with an 11point lead or they bring pressure again the Spartans in one of those third and medium situations is given in trouble this year put the rolls Adam again just misfires and get an experience good quarterback some weapons but that kind of play has just been a problem all season long for a good offense just a poor decision and that's one you don't see a lot from Connor cook he just kind of flipped that ball out there his receivers cover pretty good but he just never really gave him much of a chance mumphrey that time tight coverage on the outside for the Ohio State deep we gotta go for it Eli Apple they have to five seconds in the third quarter and an important play Spartans desperate to cut into this lead it's mumphrey in motion end up on the reverse hill not going to get there gets nothing Eli Apple is that kind of a tough night drop the obvious big with the freshmen on the big fourth down stop and the team pursuit Apple sets the edge on the outside keeps contained gets around the offensive lineman and the rest of the Ohio State defense is there they felt it surprised maybe by the call to to run but the Ohio State defense wasn't fooled at all they get the ball back potential upset brewing here is Ohio State up by 11 beginning the fourth quarter in East Lansing another potential top 10 team suffer a second loss and take a major hit and their playoff chances that the Spartans can't rally so dr. pepper championship drive game of the week Michigan State's defense has to do its part here they got to get a stop get the ball back five touchdowns for Ohio State in the last six Buckeye possessions million that's the corner dances out near midfield is not down Zeca draw a flag yes it comes in get out of bounds by Michigan State will improve Ohio State's field position a loss of poise mistake no doubt about it after the play personal foul but Taylor Decker the left tackle does a nice job of pulling around and then the speed again this is a poor decision by the true freshman Nicholson just throwing Zeke Elliot to the ground but that was a welldesigned play up front left tackle pulled around his high o state got to corner in Elliot boy he's got some great quickness and acceleration over 100 yards Kirk 109 went one for Kari Barrett nearside to hire a man who collects the ball takes his shot immediately from hips Urban Meyer talking about the pain that his team felt in Indy as favorites mission she could save valleys from behind dream ripped away from us remember they would have in all likelihood wanted to play for the BCS Championship against Florida State Auburn got that ticket urban there's a 20game winning streak in the Big Ten regular season games alive though one second and five Marshall first down down to the ten whatever Thom Hartmann is coupling this offense is executed they right now I've found a rhythm they found some weaknesses to get the linebackers out in space toin Jones is out there trying to make a play against Jalen marshal break blocks downfield by Jeff heuerman another receiver downfield doing his best Evan Smith to help out Ohio State the one thing they've done Chris is get their speed out in space against a very physical Michigan State defense you got a sub out Marshall who may be cramping up over there he comes off first end goal knows the ball right at the 10 alien Falls 43 in Michigan say the way things are going really needs to find a way rise up force a field goal attempt keep it at a 14point game even though there's lots of time to go a lot of time what did she find the last six possessions for Ohio it's been a touchdown this possession right here for Michigan State they if they don't hold a high o state to a field goal to keep it a two possession game this game could be over err at making a check use it off and leave it hammered right away it'll be third and goal Taiwan Jones septum Michigan State knows exactly what you and I are talking about they have that same sense in Urban Meyer's not in any hurry at all working that play clock as much as he can with Barrett really really impressed not just with JT parents numbers tonight but his poise for a freshman and the way his seed season has gone he has made countless good decisions for his team and played with tremendous poise throughout the game Ezekiel Elliott the running backs split out way to the left was uncovered momentarily now this part into the man on him Barrett rolls delivers far side high throw touchdown done Trey Wilson he has had a rough night but it's turning around for him hioh state stretches the lead what placement by the quarterback we just talked about his decisionmaking how about the placement of the football by an undersized receiver dontre Wilson's about five nine or five ten it's a small tight window for him to be able to make that throw gets the ball out on time away from the defender and Wilson as you said has had a rough night holding on to the ball secures potentially the clincher for Ohio State's offense so the third touchdown pass for Barrett to go with his two touchdown runs looking very much like the 10 quarterback in a well designed play gets to get the oneonone matchup against RJ Williamson to safety we've talked since the beginning of the game an advantaged Ohio State would have the inside receivers against the safeties advantage they hit another one well tomorrow morning 10:00 a certain sunday NFL countdown presented by his Snickers also available in watch ESPN app both these teams were launching guys in the NFL and overlooking in tonight what Wendy benefit lock herbs have Spartans and Buckeyes and the jiying owned by those Michigan State alums ever since last December it's turning around my I say that by 17 making a very strong statement this was a team not considered by the committee a real serious playoff contender before this game take off Shelton latekka knew one of the craziest place you'll ever see right now to Chris Potter in the studio all right Chris the day gets even crazier 18t inside the headset over on ESPN Utah's Kailyn Clay is taking it to the house but he drops the ball full yard before he gets into the end zone Oregon's Eric Dargan picks it up he fumbles it eventually it ends up in the arms of Jill Walker and he has a caravan down the sideline because all the huge Sikhs are celebrating touchdown Utah scores and this really helped turn things around for the Ducks they were down 7 to nothing about to go down 14 nothing now they lead 14 to 7 plays one of the best return guys in the country most of the ducks of course in playout position based on this week's rankings serious urgency now for Connor Cook who delivers to lippett out across the 40 they must score in this possession and it would help the score break well now you're talking about almost a twominute offense approach with Connor cookin again that's where his experience will have to pay off for Michigan State they've got to find some matchups that they like they've got to be able to move the ball down the field and again it's when you're down by this many points late in the game things like getting out of bounds and getting first downs and every chance you get a chance to have that clock stopped you got to work with that clock and also at the same time move the ball down the field and the throw far side gets made spending more of first down at the 40 as the tailback Langford to the plays to start to astride and you know for Ohio State with Tristan and Luke fickle you wonder what the mind said that they'll have is their goal has been all along not to give up a lot of big plays through the air but at the same time do you get in prevent mode with Luke fickle or do you still maintain that aggressive approach that's worked quite often tonight for the high state defense but fires far side patient completion Darren Burridge Ohio st. LED 2114 so it's been 8:28 three run for Ohio State you combine that with the fact of Auburn lost for the second time Notre Dame lost for a second time ASU and Baylor making big statements Bama and LSU locked in ten late in the fourth quarter their big statement for TCU as kstate drops out and how far up will Ohio State zoom if they could hold this lead here that's what Buckeye fans want to know the completion limit tiptoes how short of the marker at the 38 it will be third about a yard well if you're sitting in that room with the committee and you're listening around to people talk about each team and you get to Ohio State you look at the resume okay they're undefeated the Big Ten they've lost a Virginia Tech who's one in four in conference play how many wins do they have against the top forty none their best wind was against Maryland now it becomes a different story now the committee gets together on Tuesday and they talk about this if Ohio State holds on to win now you're talking about going into a top ten type of team in their Stadium very very impressive if they're able to hold on here our formation for Langford and third and one picks up the first down Michigan State again eight Ohio State will make a case that if you come in dominate the Spartans why shouldn't we be at least at night they're never gonna win the argument on the loss the quality in our loss is up no contender is gonna have a loss like Virginia Zack but but you know you have Arizona State out there that's going to become a trendy team where they give up 62 UCLA Hail Mary to beat USC they beat Notre Dame today convincingly but it's the entire body of work and look what I owe States done against inferior Fonuts they've blown them out cook frozen back far side catch made by price that I then has a block or two and gets down inside the red zone this is this is always a threat and Michigan State's Arsenal is that throwback they've run this very very often price again who scored the goahead and eventually gamewinning touchdown last year against Ohio State Indianapolis on a delay play down side that 20 yard line so that's a lot of times where he makes boast it is opportunities Spartans do what they have to do to keep their hopes alive here two and a half minutes so far they've marched in 59 yards and first down cook platter so the end zone has a man wide open and price collects the touchdown after setting it up so Michigan State Sylla absolutely you know one of the things Ohio State did here is they brought pressure they get inside a 20yard line Ohio State brought the linebackers picked up perfectly left by Jeremy Langford and how about price at six for about 250 pounds out up against the defensive back and gave them a little shake to the inside and back outside and cook put it right on the money for the touchdown work that's just now from price of the season Geiger to make it an 11 point Ohio State leads so Michigan State cuts into it but can they stop the Buckeyes now you say it's four five seven plays 75 yards little under three minutes and as we said price with some nifty moves out in space against a corner off the play action they pick up the Blitz cook since that urgency got the ball into the end zone for the Spartans Saturday Night Football on ABC brought you by Pacific Life for insurance annuities and investments choose Pacific Life the power to help you succeed your next truck Ford f150 and the Home Depot more saving more dewy that's the power of the Home Depot a chilly night nice one to fly in the Goodyear blimp or the you're going for a few yards out or four miles away go with the tire with superior performance Goodyear more driven great briefing so shower is about a three minute that's no shower that's moved on how's quick so Michigan State the quick touchdown drive and that now makes this the most combined points 75 of them use Lansing in this rivalries history to short oh boy bringing it out sinem knockdown if freshmen ended up getting into the 22 yard line not what you want to do Browns protecting a lead Pacific Life game summary looking at the big night for JT Barrett so far JT Barrett a couple touchdowns on the ground but it's really bent his arm tonight making some great throws in oneonone coverage three touchdowns on the night he's been in a groove and now he takes the field with this 11 point lead late in this game and be interesting again with Tom Herman and Urban Meyer and how they plan to attack with a little over nine minutes to go after Michigan State scores that touchdown today work clock or they try to continue to score touchdowns they run war zone replays for more yards more bit games and more touch sounds than than anybody in the Paula five conferences Evan that as much of that tonight they've been focused more on sub runs built in for Zeke Elliott 112 yards on the night they've gotten him on the outside on the perimeter against this Michigan State defense and of course Barrett throwing the football question for Tom Herman how cautious will you be now Kirk as you mentioned it's another run for the quarterback race safe play but barrett breaks the tackle gets a block gets the corner JT Barrett down the sidelines what a monster night with a cooker back down to the 22 remember again Braxton Miller does it in the different yjt parents a lot nifty and people want to give him credit how about that move right there corner had a plan of any outlines to freshman safety kids around him as well but right here he's trying to just get a first down right there's a first down gets away from trae Waynes runs Montaigne Nicholson to continue to keep moving but JT Barrett this continues to impress everybody watching I sit into word house that left MCL sprain they've been braced up there the last game it looks fine just fine 55 yards on that carry Eliot nice straight ahead ok this is a Michigan State defense with Braxton Miller you're talking about maybe one of the most electrifying players in the country last year with the ball in his hands this is what he did a year ago 142 yards on the ground you can see what Barrett's done through the air also on the ground almost a hundred yards himself in that game against a more veteran Michigan State defense to be fair a was one of 10 on third down oh and two on fourth down much more efficient tonight with Barrett's skill set second and six Eliot cuts it back Zeek zipping to the end zone and I could do it for a last date people that have not seen Ohio State play since Virginia Tech take they're somewhat mesmerized by this Ohio State offense Zeke Elliott running the football we've seen a decisionmaking by JT Barrett the big play ability from the wide receivers and let's not forget the much maligned offensive line after the Virginia Tech game they've stuck together they got tested they went to Penn State got tested there they've come together as a group they should feel very good about the way they've played tonight JT Barrett set this touchdown up with a huge run we wondered if they'd get a little bit conservative when they continue to be aggressive they got aggressive but they kid it by running the football they're up 18 again on Michigan State mother 12member selection committee for the cfb playoff a lot to digest to head down to Dallas for the third consecutive weekend convene on Monday and Tuesday then on Tuesday night can find out who's in who's out as of now 7:30 Eastern Time presented by Vizio also on the watch ESPN app this fellas been hanging around he was at her said on game days kind of a fixture for how state fans it he expect to see seven Buckeye touchdowns tonight in eight possessions they hunted once against this defense now but he gets more airtime than Brutus say what this is the kind of statement that goes beyond just to win on the road against an eighth ranked team give me the has to recognize offensively and defensively shelton following blocks gets the corner good return driven out a flag comes in very late Evan Spencer was throwing a block over there for Ohio State didn't need to because maybe a pushing the block there against Evan Spencer holding a 37 it's the first penalty on a special teams return all season long for Urban Meyer's team conference breakdown on the rankings as of last week the CC was six but that SCC cannibalization is beginning to happen in that in that West offer and went down at home too and they got two losses Bama and LSU late in the game LSU is trying to drive and and get a win over Alabama big 12 statement wins by Baylor and by TCU tonight cook delivers incomplete over the middle his team came in with supreme confidence we went to both places I think both sides gave off an air but they thought they'd win this game but I thought particularly here in East Lansing the Spartans brought a little swagger in off a bye week up a bit down of Michigan on this field and I take a lot of that has to do with the way they played last year in Indianapolis and then carried it over into Pasadena and won the Rose Bowl I think they feel very confident who they are and this is a team that it's been peeking they feel they felt very good coming into this game this a cook Michigan State team Ohio State came in with a plan and they've executed as time fires down the middle and just over the head of Keith my free smile from cook but it's been a frustrating night because he's been in the unusual position of having to play catchup and Mark Dantonio said this week to us about when you get into these big games especially in November and the big ten in any game for that matter in the NFL it's typically one up front in the trenches think about how iost eighths offensive line is played as much as we've talked about bear and it played readily well also Ohio State's defensive line with Bennett Washington Bosa even Steve Miller they've held up there into the bargain as well third and 10 they bring four good fires over the middle complete at the 42 yard line they'll move the chains Kings made the catch Michigan State's 14 name big 10 win streak deep trouble so hyoe state continues to play very well as an underdog again Kings makes the catch there at the Buckeyes 40 the last seven times Ohio State's been an underdog very well maybe six they've won four of them this will be a fifth upset in that span Urban Meyer does a good job of getting his team yes play with a chip on their shoulder sometimes he invents reasons you think ahead of it up another week times pict diving pick my thymus pound now they're gonna really complete and the key thought he had it cooks leg was being grabbed as he delivered it what an attempt by Powell and looked again that defensive line got pressure on him as he comes down it's a matter of whether or not he got his hands under that football before it hit the ground the ball did appear to the ground and the ruling incomplete so I'm not sure those Phatak evidence to overturn that but these Ohio State DBS have had one heck of a night they have great hands Apple did drop a sure pick early this would have been a circus pick yeah yeah but you're right about the pressure Bennett in Washington both got in there that would have been a heck of an effort but Cook had to get rid of the football because of that defensive line applying the pressure again you look at it you look at Connor cook and he's put up some numbers at this point he's actually 276 but it doesn't feel like that typical Connor cook night when you look at Tony Lippett who has four catches for 48 yards they've targeted him nine times and he only has four catches Sask our rules expert Dave kotahi is watching the replay that Steve Newman is looking at next door Dave what do you see enough to overturn this or you think it will stand I think it's going to stand as an incomplete pass the bottom of the ball hits the ground you can see the ball move a little there certainly in my opinion isn't enough evidence two reviews reverse it to an intersection I think it's going to stand in the very least you watch these hi Oh state DBAs if you look at taping you see guys who have great ball skills they can track the ball and when they get their hands on it despite apples easy drop before they usually make the pick at the further review the ruling on the field stands so they can plea pass second down it's also a defense curcuit has limited big plays small opponents I know the competition hasn't been that tough but at least 17 20 plus yard plays all season that's an FBS low and they've been a pretty good job limiting Michigan State tonight in that department and second it's n cook stays up delivers into traffic catch made first down at the 26 yard line mumphrey good job holding on there Tony Lippett has been limited just 48 receiving yards and his four catches so far cut steps up flips it short flag is down and as Langford collects it that was certain upholding zone it has not been a good night for a very heralded and accomplished offensive Baldy saw offensive line has talked about the sacks only five all year which is third in the country coming into tonight when you look at film and people with blitz always seem to give cooked time to be able to make throws and tonight again I think they've lost the battle for the most part up front not a big number of sacks Kirk but that's their third holding penalty they'd be disappointed in this effort for sure did a great job Joey Posey hasn't had his came into the night having two cents in the last three games at Leeds so yeah it's like six that have seven sacks in the last three games tonight he's been pretty quiet I think it's been more about Washington and Bennett in the middle doing most of the damage to the interior of Michigan State's offensive line so second twenty cook delivers far side it's made Burbridge can't escape tackle at the 30 by precon Macmillan third down well out of the crowd has emptied out here in East Lansing there's a flag after the play personal foul face mask defense and I'll move this you can say closer urban won't feel comfortable yet no and that goes for any coach let alone orbiting his intensity Bennett's trying to get off the field is slow he's you could see him he headed took a knee and get him off the field cook delivers Kings retreats still alive fighting Gareth King on his feet down near the goal line to the oneyard line slippery play by the receiver they had him trapped in the backfield again he's plays wide receiver but he has the ability of a running back and he gets out there and like a couple high o state defenders thought he might have been down and he just kept going Langford cuts it back barrels into the end zone and while a bunch of Spartan fans have headed to the exits Michigan State still fighting PACA will cut the lead to 11 522 play you think they'd have the trend onside kick here the defense certainly hasn't stopped Ohio State and they have might as well give that a try you still still have three timeouts remaining it's almost risky to kick it away it's still a two possession game no down to 12 try to get it to 10 there take the DAT to make it a 11point game the Christian decision got it down you just kicked the point in a touchdown twopoint conversion in the field ago would tie it sitting on 12 now shadi Fraser batted that pass down you're looking at two touchdowns yeah this touchdown again the heart from Michigan State set up by Kings here not giving up on a play can see him wiggling I thought he might take it all the way to the endzone they get the ball back to the sure hands of Jeremy Langford and that big offensive line this Michigan State team the defending Big Ten champions Rose Bowl champions will not go away Monday night Panthers and eagles served by Applebee's you seeing Andrew Norwell former Ohio State offensive lineman one of three Buckeye rookie offensive lineman starting in the NFL part of that group last year that came up short collectively at Indy against this team and now this rebuilt offensive line with the quarterback Barrett filling in at the last minute before the season begins for Miller he's doing something that veteran group could not do Spartans kick it deep no onside kick so Barrett the company will take over with 520 in Alabama now trailing LSU delle Lucy with a field goal second to go to give the Mad Hatter a threepoint lead the top ten would go down Alabama doesn't come back and the Spartans can't stay so furious rally here a state losing to another top ten team in TCU but if that holds Kirke Mississippi State is got to go to Tuscaloosa the only SEC team without at least two losses potential he imagines they get waked up today the potential of Auburn and Alabama both getting knocked off I mean there was a shot of course with Alabama going to Death Valley Eliott hammers ahead why will the committee evaluate that Mississippi State goes to Tuscaloosa next week they gotta win the Egg Bowl in Oxford doesn't even really matter for the division title for Mississippi State right that's right hugely 5:15 to play here in East Lansing hammering up Chris Connor in studio you heard Chris talk about the field goal hat attila who see get in range to kick it for LSU TJ Yeldon fumbled inside his own 10yard line LSU recovered they kicked a field goal Bama has the ball an outlet trailing by three whisker let's you doing it their way well who's scoring upset as underdogs that gives Ole Miss same blueprint trying to finish off BAM oh just trying to to drive and tie it perhaps that was fun night Oregon beginning to pull away against Utah that crazy play you could have taken a 14nothing lead reminder that the semifinal games in this new format take place in Pasadena and in New Orleans the Rose Bowl game is amid Northwestern Mutual the Allstate Sugar Bowl a doubleheader on ESPN on New Year's Day the two winners feeding into that national championship game AT&amp;T Stadium January 12th so you have one in four and two and three playing and I think a lot of people are surprised when we are talking about this if let's just say for argument's sake of the Big Ten Champion doesn't get into the top four they're so used to going to the Rose Bowl you wouldn't go to the Rose Bowl no either be looking at the what fiesta bowl is out there the wartorn pulls out their Beach bowl peach big difference though right playing for a spot in the championship david pasadena perhaps again we need the big ten and not going for the rose bowl c'mon state trying to convert on third and three what else berrak straight ahead and of course he converts it's remarkable this guy I mean every every Ohio State ban was deflated disappointed Miller goes out you figure there goes the season right hardly this guy think he's the offic send quarterback without a doubt the way he's playing tonight look at his eyes for a young guy he's got a look about him with again it's the numbers that are impressive but it's the way he's doing it the poise in which he's playing in this environment it's almost you dick he's a senior just the way he plays in a way it carries himself every third down he seems to have the right answer offensive line giving him time to be able to execute whether it's been the runner the pass has been a big part of his success as well Eric pitches a nearside Marshall gets two nice blocks on the edge and falls down at midfield he's been lies ahead for Ohio State Minnesota weighing good football they hammered Iowa to win Floyd of Rosedale that's up next weekend home games against Indiana and of course team up north things play out India the Big Ten championship game against perhaps Wisconsin or Nebraska for Ohio State they had tonight and they have the game in India is to show the committee who they are and whether or not they're deserving Eliott Minnesota will be considered a quality ring the Gophers did go out of conference to get hammered by TCU but they played good football in the big ten season they seem to be getting better and better with Jerry Kill well coached team you have to look at how they've improved themselves where they were against Navy think about losing four offensive linemen three of which are now starting in the NFL as rookies and you know you lose your starting quarterback you've got eleven days to try to get it together for Navy and then Virginia Tech think about how much they've improved from that chaos and that disappointment of losing their leader for your starting quarterback to Braxton Miller one of the most improved offenses from week one or two now into November anybody in the country Michigan State's spending a timeout talk about a contrast in emotions on this field couple weeks ago Michigan came in here and the Spartans just absolutely dominated the rival make it six out of the last seven if she didn't land a little stake in the field Spartans took great offense and dropped the hammer on him two weeks later the anticipated collision Michigan State fans feeling good about themselves so was their team humbling loss tonight yeah no doubt about it this is the game that everybody was bracing for because there just hasn't been that big competition and the opportunities there so in the SEC you see them weekly in the big tent you got to wait for for a few weeks and this is a chance Michigan State came in chances for them to say we're tired of being down there hitting that ceiling at eight we're going to show against a good opponent like Ohio State who we really so they put their best foot forward but Ohio State and Urban Meyer came in with a plan on both sides of the ball I'll tell you they deserve all the credit in the world for the way they came in and the intensity which they played tonight they're nice to get the corner again it's like everything all season long they've been waiting for this moment to show what they can do they had to survive a double overtime game at Penn State and the Lions squirts 17 in a row to force overtime and and then scored right away in the top of the first in overtime but guys don't get a touchdown the dream ends there and Happy Valley basic I really believe because the way they had to win that game collectively the offense the defense the special teams ever been a hand in it talking to some of the coaches and players at the postgame celebration in that locker room pretty emotional there was you know the offense and defense guys hugging each other they really felt that that was a turning point even though it became a scare and because that game went into overtime in his second now say it makes it six first six in the second half Gordon wrapup shell after the game with Chris Cotter will detail what's going on around the country Barrett 300 yards passing even the three touchdowns he's run for 86 yards and two touchdowns he can't ask anything more of a quarterback calm poise leadership on the top of that I would say almost a flawless performance like I said get it again remember this guy didn't play football for almost two years until this year with that torn ACL in his senior year redshirted last year again I his face and that and how mature he he kind of approaches the game Eliot doesn't really want to get out of bounds falls down the mic continues to roll here it'll be third down that might be his greatest quality actually is is how he carries himself without having a ton of a ton of reps and ton of experience as a freshman he's just become an extension of Tom Herman an herb admirer and what he's trying to do is understanding he said what are the keys for him being able to go out and play so well preparation they said he strives to be so good he wants to be excellent he didn't just say it he preps Monday through Friday to try to put himself in a position to have answers to every challenge that he might face from a defense was about third string in the spring but he be the holder this season thought that would be his big responsibility holding for the kicks with Miller of courses just trying to make sure he'll Jones to Braxton Miller I also thought when Tom Herman said he's gotten to a point where he's figured him out he said you know I'll talk to him about what's important and he'll say hey don't be perfect just be you don't be perfect just be you because early in the air he felt he was a little hesitant he was trying to overanalyze trying to be too perfect so now he just has a little ritual that he does with him talks to him about his reads his keys literally right before he goes out for the for the beginning of the game then he says just don't be perfect just be you it's a lot of Buckeyes and Hellmuth had to be pretty clean before the season he's earned every one of them dad 25year career in the army but he said his mom was really the disciplinarian in the family Joe you gonna miss Joe if you knew him in grade school is that he got to high school and became JT JT the MVP tonight out playing Connor cook was Ohio State's collective effort here makes a resounding statement of the committee Aaron throws it downfield stop the clock it'll be fourth down 39 seconds to play Alabama by the way we tell you this as a service of the viewer after LSU took the lead kicked the ball out of bounds on the kickoff drove down kicked a tying field goal so they're headed for overtime there Chris Carter we'll keep you posted on all that stuff at 339 seconds from now what are the odds of that with the way they're kicking game his Causton in some big games last few years had no timeouts yeah McCarron did it a couple years ago down there in Baton Rouge that heroic touchdown drive late Sims with no timeouts to work with it's the tide in position to kick the time field going don't put a fork in Bama just yet now meanwhile for Michigan State tonight that began with such energy in this place and for the mostly empty stadium will be a 12point loss where do you move Baylor up they hadn't had a road wound against a ranked team since 1991 fell 14 three down and a forty five zip run to close it out Arizona State but 55 on the Irish with helped with some turnovers they go back to work and try to win the pac12 South so some challenges ahead for Arizona State yeah yeah no doubt about it Florida State slow start again today against Virginia but pulled away and win 34 to 20 I think a lot of people are still wondering if that won't ever catch up to them they've played these meetings next week athletically anyway that'll be probably the toughest game that they have left on their schedule Don is up by 14 and a half thousand CSA Duke Johnson indicates brachii has become a a different guy you want to give me your top four right now you know it so I was don't look now but Cameron Johnson is in the punt the kick we haven't seen him in a long long time I thought they'd let him shower this is second effort of the night and Urban Meyer arms in the air and a big smile hey they can't erase the pain of losing that big game and indeed he didn't talk a lot about payback but this is very very satisfying but guys still unbeaten in this Stadium since 99 the emotions from Urban Meyer it's been waiting a year for this matchup to take on Michigan State told you he gave me a forearm shimmy on the field before the game about knocked me down you could tell there was some intensity at him earlier at this game cook the price and they pitch it off big pitches it off again and Langford finally ends up with it after all that he making the 26 yard line Michigan's April points away holding penalty the nullified a Langford touchdown run that would have put them at 14 points at that time in the second quarter that's right really we talked at a break Michigan State self scouted and felt that they needed to break some tendencies and some uncharacteristic mistakes from the Spartans today for sure just the penalties but just some of the decisions we saw from them because not what we've typically seen in it it's partly Michigan State and a lot to do with the team that they play the Ohio State front the defense the secondary during grant locked up with Tony Lippett higher state defense even though they gave up 37 points they did a very nice job in some key moments in this game a defending Connor cook Ezekiel Elliott we saw the hug with Meyer there 154 yards for the tailback and two touchdowns cook delivers or first down what are the what are the Spartans go from here they had that loss in Eugene had been perfect in the Big Ten it isn't over but the Ohio State would have to lose a couple of games right right final play lipid very very quiet evening just shoved out of bounds liar that's the bath he won't mind that in the chilly night what stuff JC Barrett was the handshake might be brief the warmest to friends not the warmest of nights execution to direct hit under ferret did that that was perfect execution ladies wet and sticky but my hair is better we're trying to get four coaches how the coach in the meantime congratulations what does this victory in this environment with the stakes so high save at Ohio State great environment I guess excellent football team and that was I make the comments before about when you get two teams that control line of scrimmage like that to sledgehammer so I want to say I give credit mr. state Brock has played dirt tails off tonight in what ways does this win sort of help eventual loss and erase the memories of last year's Vick ten championship loss oh yeah you'll never forget that and but once again I mean that's part of the game you have two good teams playing and but we'll never forget tonight you admitted concern this week about your young team your inexperienced team how did you get them to excel in this environment that the future is bright at Ohio State there's a young team that just played a pretty veteran team and they they came on top so future is real bright and what about your young quarterback JT Barrett came in I mean what sort of maturation process did you see before your eyes I just don't grow up and he's a good leader he's a tough guy and I love him to death coach on a night where I won't let you enjoy coach congratulation let's get you a talent get that orange Gatorade off JT congratulations so much talk about avenging last year's loss you said you felt helpless last year because we were a red shirt now this is what to you you're the leader how did you help erase that memory for your team you just gonna just do my job that's who I'm talking about all week don't worry about your job make sure you have a trusting them that they gonna do their job and I've got to do mine how did you come in with so much on the line so much pressure so much talk all week play in this environment and really lead this team and not clay at all like a freshman where did that confidence come from just preparation we've been going at this for a long time preparing for Michigan State so he's been since like the spring said just preparation and having the confidence come out and play I know you've been focused on this game but just to let you know a lots gone on in college football today half the top ten down major shakeup what kind of message does this win send the playoff committee I'm not sure I think the just now recognizing that we were able to play football with the best of them and that's all we tried to do each and every week JT what kind of advice did you get from Braxton Miller this week about tonight's
