============================================================

suppose you look bigger and stronger and fatter than everybody else this kid is playing on a different planet Leonard fournette going after his fourth consecutive game of over 200 yards rushing rod he is an indomitable force right now on the field drawing comparisons to earl campbell bo Jackson Herschel Walker do you see the numbers there if he gets a buck 36 today he'll get to a thousand yards and beyond the tenth player to do that in five games and man he dominated September 1 the September Heisman there was such a thing question is what will he do going forward leading rusher in the nation almost 900 yards already meanwhile folks LSU winning the toss deferring to the second half so South Carolina will receive Burnett will sit temporarily as the game console will get the football for Steve Spurrier the head coach of South Carolina in his 11th year right now this team a little bit sideways trying to snap out of a three game conference losing streak there are two and three overall and the quarterbacking situation hasn't gotten any better in the last week either getting ready for the opening kick LSU was won the last five in a row against South Carolina barson watches it go out of bounds and we out to the 35 yard line and Perry orth is going to be the starting quarterback making his second start of the year his last start was a 50 to 20 loss against Georgia there is a look at the numbers on in 4th completing just 49 percent of his passes on the season one touchdown against two interceptions try to get back on track after Lorenzo Nunez started the last two games at quarterback Nunez coming on the heels of Connor Mitch the number one quarterback coming out of camp but he suffered a shoulder injury against Kentucky and still will be back with few more weeks well so parasol continues to spin yeah and the big change the big issue for Perry orth is finding a rush Nunez was the eating Russia at the quarterback spot David Williams isn't a tailback and that's Pharoah Cooper on the jet sweep arguably the most dynamic player offensively for South Carolina wanted a bounce by today be aligned and so when you lose Nunez you lose a lot of your zone read quarterback making things happen so you need guys like Cooper to get involved with the rushing attack he's the Swiss Army knife of this offense he can play receiver and he can play quarterback he can line up in the backfield a lot of touches for him today right I would think so second down in seven coming up for for reward we receive this amount to the right and he's going to fire I intended for Terry gujja and it'll be third down and long for the Gamecocks coming up Devin Tolliver providing the coverage that time dimension or start at the Georgia games struggled in that contest as his team lost 50 to 220 former walkon looking at third down and seven he's a pocket passer LSU knows where he will right out quick drop and it's going to be Cooper Cooper and more Cooper today first down on the catch Thomas makes the tackle brought how do they make it easier for the quarterback today well you have to have a lot of high percentage passes short passes try to get him some things that are easy for him to do remember confidence we're talking about a guy who had a six for 17 game against Georgia so get his confidence going at the shore past we receive us out to the left this time that stick protection or cause to squeeze it into a very tight window incomplete intended for Gaucher who caught the earlier pass it'll be second down and ten Jonesy he earth is facing a defense that is loaded with playmakers a lot of speed a lot of guys who can get after quarterback a lot of corners and safeties who can play mantoman coverage and press you all over the field so the windows will not be large by the son of a 50t there on the screen Kendall Beckwith real impact David millions on the carry yeah he's on the carry but I tell you Dionne Jones got there in a hurry from his linebacking spot you mentioned Beckwith and Jones together that tandem inside does a tremendous job very fast both of them able to really run sideline to sideline loss of one on the play part a third down and 11 steve spurrier with a reputation for innovation on offense Ferro Cooper will push down got him behind the coverage of Dwayne Thomas and no flags on the plexi there is a flag down I think they got LSU our penalty is declined is awful to play first down well that was a wellthrown battles gonna say how about the throw by or drops it in very nicely Cooper out of the slot beats right off the line of scrimmage Dwayne Thomas he was playing him and what a perfect throw by Oris or so 42 yard pass people remember a firstteam allconference plick pcs want is the one Brunswick reception in his career first attack orthe completes it out of the backfield that's David Williams and Williams stopped up immediately just inside the 10 yard line at about the 9 remember Brandon Wiles was supposed to return offensively this week he's the usual starting tailback number 22 right now in the sidelines though did I did I remember you saying early Cooper Cooper and more Cooper he's already had with three touches on this drive has been the pick factor alongside force great roll and that's 42 yarder we got a flag down on the play now rot how many different places you think we'll see him lineup here today he can play every spot except the offensive line we'll see him everywhere probably lineup the quarterback running back wide receiver tight in slot he'll be all over the place he's the SEC is leading returning receiver from the season ago about 69 passes for eleven hundred and thirty six yards second down energy or buyers confirm the pressure up front by God job number 57 with some good penetration you know Jonesy Cooper's gonna get a lot of attention watch Thomas manhandling him got that left arm wrapped around him Cooper might be welladvised say hey mr. official legal official was that illegal as long as the balls not in the air he put his hands now but he hadn't wrapped up pretty good that arm gets around the backside then sets holder well another third down and long coming up for South Carolina they've converted twice already on his opening drive or if is going to take off got a lot of room pulled at about the three yard line looks like he may have gotten enough for the first down Kendall Beckwith prevented him from launching and going airborne it looks like he might have enough for that first down you have great decision to take off there was just a huge Lane their fourth not gonna run over Beckwith he's a 252 but that's a first down first and goal for South Carolina or throwing out tryna hit the corners incomplete intended for Pharaoh Cooper broken up by Dwayne Thomas well head coach Les Miles of the Tigers asked the fans not to cheer quite as loudly against South Carolina because technically this is a home game for South Carolina but I wonder how long that deals gonna hold rowdy with this opening drive I don't think his heart was in it when he said that he might have said it to be politically correct I don't think it really meant listen it Shawn Carson in the backfield now second ago pper the inside receiver that the top your screen incomplete for Belton matric Belton was wide open and Terry or through it behind him got excited he had him wide open at 6foot for Belton and orth overthrew him now Jonesy we've seen on tape during the week that orth tends to miss his passes high even though he has tall receivers gets a little excited gets it up there a little bit too much well that was six points you know he's six foot six those it incomplete metric Belton was the closest receiver Lewis Neil in hot pursuit and in comes the field goal unit on this opening drive for the Gamecocks a good stop for Kevin Steele's defense really kind of getting tough down there inside the 5yard line within South Carolina had a first and goal little surprise South Carolina didn't even and he's tried to run it in at some point down there play selection of incomes Elia Frye 10 to 14 on the season knocks this one through from when he arts out it was Fri that said he's excited to play in the quoteunquote real death valley here that Clemson fans back after this your daughter's gonna let your place stay thirsty my friends get you back to the game momentarily Adnan burka our college football studios Georgia and Tennessee Nick Chubb the last week broke Herschel Walker school record 13th straight hundred rushing games suffering that injury there your discretion because the replay was tough to look at right now crying on the sidelines awful the st. mark back to you well you think about Chubb here and then Gurley last year yeah close it backs getting hit and suffering hopefully not a serious injury here and a thoughtful yep but this is the first time that LSU has trailed all season South Carolina the first opponent to score any points in the first quarter against LSU this year and Leonard fournette starting tailback looking for his fourth consecutive 300 yard game and he's getting some good help from the guys up front yeah how about a couple of freshmen up front 75 Maya to Hammond and 64 William traps they hunt linebackers which creates big running lanes and big runs for for net watch him here against Auburn watch and get to the second level knocked off some linebackers and the huge hole that's created great vision there he sees the big lane Hey and when those shoulders have pointed toward the goal line not a lot of guys want to get in front of him with that 10.6 100meter speed a look at those numbers one of those numbers say to you exactly well that number on the left edge that offensive lines doing a great job and number Wright says he's doing a pretty potent combination but here to come out passing to fournette on first down just his holy reception of the season so I guess he could catch to run a pickup up 9 on the play yeah talking to Les Miles yesterday in Cam Cameron one of the things we have seen about was hey how complete a back is he I mean he hasn't caught that many passes he said hey trust us he's going to catch the ball a lot more this season goes along and they opened up with that and for over a thousand yards last year averaged 5 and a half per pop second down and one for LSU and on the toss into the boundary they pick something first down gaining three yards Jonathan Walton on the stop he runs Angra Burnett runs with an attitude he's not a guy who's going to slow down when he sees you or necessarily try to Juke you he will outrun you or he will run you over the guy that has been the subject of Louisiana football lures since the time he was a freshman in high school as in talented freshman offensive line enough for two between the tackles brought the difference between what we saw earlier on that toss and him that time shoulder square going north south is what exactly well I think this is just me personally if you want to deal with him you need to have his shoulder pads facing the sidewalk when he goes side to side he doesn't have his Superman house you know but when those shoulders have pointed at you that's when it's all him and you get every bit of them and so if he's going sideways that's when you attack and if they do it by choice you like that set that at nine he's got the fullback JD more out in front of him Gaston Paris under duress and escaping Myers incomplete out of bounds at the 44 yard line intended for travin dural good heat up front by mark way via slowest in pursuit as we go downstairs for more from Quinton well a critical third down for LSU here they're passing offense cranking a hundred and twenty third in the country and if you're Steve Spurrier in the Gamecocks you've dialed up a good start to this ball game this is where you want to put LSU for net not as much of a threat in the running game right now and we'll see how Brandon Harris can handle this third and long this has been their Achilles heel all season long you're right Quinn and now you can play coverage the first couple of downs they were trying to take away the run now you can see if you can actually steal one from third down in Long Harris has time at the 45 yard line by Durrell and first and 10 for the Tigers if there's anything that can hold LSU back as Quint myths mentioned it is the passing attack they've only thrown for more than 100 yards in one game this season so at some point Harris is going to have to carry the team and today is as good a day as any for them to get some work on the passing attack and take a little heat off of for now was down in ten just inside the 45yard line unless he's Norris possession of the ball game Cornette crosses the 42 the 39 good straight arm as we go back to the studio and Adnan vert thank you very much Joe to the top studio update Georgia Tech and clubs this is Wayne Goldman here the 66 yard run have that one block and after that he was sprung all the way of the house body of BCAAs p.m. two punches up tensed nothing Josie all right partner six yard gain on that play by four net ended the game averaging almost nine per carry see that fullback in front of them at the 37 yard line rod you don't see a lot of teams with a fullback these days almost extinct and he's shaken up on the play too well and he is a huge component of that rushing attack he delivers crushing blocks and really kind of Springs for net and for net really appreciates them a great deal yes so much so that after a game earlier this year when cornet was given the MVP award of the game he gave the game ball to that guy right there is fullback more will check on him on the other side of this couple days to learn the music study those sheets and this was the scene pregame as they played it for the visitors from the Columbia and throughout the state of South Carolina that made the trip a wonderful and warm embrace Minh and gesture by LSU third down and three for net on the sidelines now take the jet sweep Harris he can take off but he does to make the first down at the 32 yard line another dimension that Harris gives you a 5 yard game you know Jonesy be LSU offense to me is that it's best when it's running it's too bad offense with more and with 4 net yeah that's when they show you their attitude they can come at you they run downhill now they go to the one back set to me they're a little bit more spread out as you see right now three wide receivers for net not in the ballgame had guys in the backfield behind quarterback Brandon Harris or beside him Harris to pass pumped in a couple times that overshoots his receiver Malachi Dupre had him open to oh he didn't overshoot him Chris Clemons number three got away with wicked oh it looked like that but nice set a little trick the left hand down low he grabbed onto his receive on this receiver sounds like a DP that's done that before beside me folks and tricks out there got away when your hand is down low they didn't always see it up around the shoulder pads you'll get flat so that's low 2 3 down I'm sure it is just enough tenth play the drive coming up now for the Tigers most of the ball resting at the 32 yard line a whistle timeout and a timeout called by LSU with time running down on the play clock with 701 to go here in the first quarter the mad hatter gonna think this one over and we'll be back after this khau Utah tonight at 10:00 on ESPN be more being worked on by the athletic training staff of LSU we appeared to suffer some sort of leg injury we've got Quint on the sidelines finding out what exactly is going on meanwhile Mouton and pull back right now we'll head on the sidelines this is guys tipping the toss and he picks up the first automation down to the 17 yard line so the old lead play works 16 yards as we go down to quick athletic trainers and doctors down here doing stability tests to the left knee of JD more their fullback one of their most valuable blockers on this team in fact after the Auburn game it was for net who gave his MVP award to that fullback and see if Cam Cameron is forced to change some of their personnel groupings with their number one fullback on The Pines he's an important part play first down in ten and still in the sidelines dice gets to carry and he stopped up almost immediately how does it change things now for offensive coordinator Cam Cameron I don't think it's a coincidence that Cornett is just now coming back in he had been out since Moore was hurt he and more clothes that's his guy that's his blocker and I think he was probably a little bit affected by that injury as well they gave him a couple plays to kind of gather himself give back this is the first time for nets been back on the field since more got hurt interesting kind of tough finish yeah that guy that close to you go down like that his buddy that's his running mate second down and nine Cornette back in time and sprung loose by William clap the center and its first and goal for Neto and out of one six one six feet tall 230 pounds and a stiff arm that is gorgeous that is a gorgeous stiff arm actually was pushed out of bounds after a gain of 11 down to about the 4 where they spotted those offensive linemen the hunting linebackers right yeah you hunt linebackers a guy like Fernet gets to that second level gone run it touchdown Tigers Williams doing the honors Williams with his first rushing touchdown of the season in the fourth of his career that exceeds and plays a little smash ball to go up seven to three a little Smash Ball in Benson that offensive line chess smashed them back into the endzone from LSU scoring a moment ago rod what was the key variable on that last that's that offensive line they're fantastic watch the doubleteam here that you get from POSIX 77 in clap 64 great job opening that ho Alexander gets one and you see the rest of it there it's a clean wide open for Williams to just kind of walk on it as we go back to the studio and Adnan vert Thank You Jonesy dr. pepper championship drive update Michigan and northwestern right off the hop opening kickoff is Ju Chesson 96 yards to the touchdown northwestern leaves the FPS and scoring defense a Lionel in seven a game but already it's 14 nothing for the Wolverines Josie sorry thanks a lot and then we're here at Tiger Stadium Baton Rouge Louisiana home game for the University of South Carolina technically against LSU on Mark Jones alongside rod Gilmore Quint Kessenich his football game moved from South Carolina the massive flooding believing that area thoughts employers continued go out to the people first and ten for the Gamecocks and a nice run by David Williams close to the first down Jonesy we should note that none of the South Carolina players were actually affected they didn't have their living quarters affected but many of them have family and friends who were affected none of the coaches were seriously affected a couple of coaches had some minor flooding they said in their homes but by and large the teams are there the community devastated most of the 10 into a tight window complete to Pharaoh Cooper brought down immediately by Kendal Beckwith a gain of three on the plan further to that point about what this Gamecock team has been through this week classes were canceled for the week in Columbia but the players it's not like they get a chance to practice the entire day because there's still the mandated number of hours that they're held to by the ncdoublea rules and you don't know how this affected any individual player everybody is different some were more distracted enough formation with karo Cooper lining up to take the snap heats it and is brought down just shy of the 40yard line no gain on the play Beckwith once again and it was a total team effort in the truest and literal sense of the word as the football team got out into the community to help giving out water and other essential supplies to people in the various neighborhoods in and around the state to help provide what little comfort they could you mentioned water I don't think a lot of people realize that that they were struggling to find affordable water there are those sites discussed a famous book called Charlotte but sort of first down at the 44 yard line Shamir Jeffery picking up five on the catch but it's going to be fourth down coming up let's go downstairs to Quinn coach Spurrier asking his assistant coach is actually to clean out their lockers and grab all their old game cockier and donating that to the American Red Cross the team went through 98 cases of water this week Megan bunker here Clint on 4th and 2 has six the gate on 4th down so far this year six on the play clock incomplete not even close and LSU will take over on downs Pharaoh Cooper was the closest player to that pass well tonight on ESPN college football primetime presented by Hilton Pass Arkansas taking on number eight Alabama at 7:00 Eastern then at 10:00 in a PAC 12 a good battle between number 23 Cal and number 5 Utah game day at Utah but back to that earlier game we saw Arkansas last week rod we talked about Smash Mouth football with Alec Collins and they line up in Smash you say yeah yeah they bring it out Alex Collins and that offensive line the biggest offensive line in football college or pro that'll be nice but I think Alabama has kind of kind of found their rhythm back so many people had written Alabama's obituary going into that game last week that Georgia the toss changes his mind rehearsing field as only he can but he's brought down at the 44 let's go down to Quint for more on that Arkansas game yeah we had the opportunity to watch the Razorbacks last week winning in Knoxville I thought they were a little banged up at the end of that game Alex Collins minor ankle injury he didn't practice on Tuesday wide receiver drew Morgan dislocated his shoulder in that game he will play but you guys mentioned it that Arkansas offensive line averages 328 pounds going facetoface with an Alabama front four that is NFL ready then is quite a matchup not one tonight on ESPN second down and 11 aerosol the middle wide open the 35 detention run by Darrell and he's just about a yard shy or a little bit less from a first down I'm a little surprised that Spurrier did take that fourth down gamble fly well 7 to 3 in the first quarter you showed you could move the ball to first drive and to give LSU such a potent team than number 7 team in the country a short field early in the ball game that's risky at this results in a touchdown it's that's a tough tough deal early to put your team behind like that the defensive coordinator for payments expected anything and everything can spur stop them not sure that he got enough that's gonna be real close let's see where they spot this we got Leonard fournette in the backfield I'm not so sure that even if you are short you just go for it anyway you do absolutely to bring in the chains and measure to see if he got enough you're in that noman's land where you can't be certain that if you punt it you'll actually get it inside that the 15 or 20 like you'd like and it's a long field go so you go for them throw it down here for net had 228 yards rushing against Auburn 261 against Syracuse and then 242 last week against Eastern Michigan they are that much short of the first down no doubt unless you hasn't gone for it on fourth down yet this year yeah well yeah I mean when you got a guys getting you dying on first down you don't get a lot of fourth and once that's our stats can be a little bit misleading fourth and one J team or not a difficult first man through that's Darrell Williams who picks up the first down remember if you're just joining us JD Moore was shaken up a little bit earlier we were looking at that left knee of this Tigers pick up the first down Jonesy the South Carolina game plan really defensively has been hey anybody but for net don't let number 7 beat you so if you got load the box but eight guy got to bring run blitzen's do that make the quarterback number six Karras make him show that he can consistently throw the ball down the field that's the game plan loaded up now on first down let's see if Harris can deliver a good pass on first down they're gonna call a timeout with the play clock running out on them almost la 13 seconds to go here in the first quarter and LSU leading 7 to 3 we're gonna take a short timeout along with them come back to Baton Rouge right after this Tomcat kills mice fast what will we do with all of these dead mice presenting go to vault and make a difference for teachers and their students go to college football playoff dotcom first down in 10 for LSU Les Miles trying get his team to avoid some of the lethargic lapses they've had in the last couple of weeks in particular last week against Eastern Michigan they think the fly sweep for net going that's good news for the Gamecock defense run yeah that that's the way you want them you want the one back set you want them to send him toward the sideline east/west zone read stuff because it doesn't have a Superman powers it doesn't have more the lead blocker when they go one back that's the better chance you have of stopping the LSU offense in my opinion a lot harder when they've got the fullback right so it's just a better opportunity but not quite kryptonite for Superman right sure okay because that is number seven repping the seventh Ward where he's from is block in New Orleans on this unique Saturday the second one in October South Carolina in LSU burned the whole whites but then the guest became a little discourteous and welcome back everyone to Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge Louisiana on this second Saturday in October underscored by its unique circumstances South Carolina displaced by the massive flooding this week in and around the state playing a home game here at LSU the Tigers with the lead as we begin the second quarter Harris gonna pass Whitlow intended for travin dural and that's your typical SEC crowd here today moving this game not many folks had sufficient time to purchase tickets and obviously folks from South Carolina a lot going on down there he couldn't expect folks to show up for this ball game ourselves we didn't find out until midweek where exactly we were gonna go anyway trying to trying to get through to ESPN travel was a little bit of a chore this week those down in 14 Narus buyers hi in that passing game get to click consistently for the tiger something that we brought up a little bit earlier intended for fournette usually you see rvs lining the entire area this is what the parking lot looked like unusually empty usually a hundred and two thousand folks in this stadium less than half that today but South Carolina will take a big they've done a nice job defensively for net only 17 yards so far on seven carries a long of 11 so I think they'll be pleased so far with the defensive effort they've had in this ball game what is it about their scheme that's worked so far for eight men in the box really force LSU to think about throwing it good open field tackling they have on the penalty is declined fourth down they haven't tried to front up go head to head with Burnett they've really done a good job of tackling any midgame tackling baby gene into punt and right at midfield this one inside the 10yard line and come back out let's go back to Adnan in the studio what's good alright thank you very much shows it Georgia has won five straight meetings versus Tennessee this is Jalen Hurd fumbling inside the five and what a predicament Geo Leonard Floyd is gonna go all the way to the house vans and Knox aren't gonna like that right now it's full dogs leading it seven to nothing mark Wow you talk about a crazy swing there as we look at the numbers on Leonard fournette 217 yards rushing but he has the type of unpredictable talent he can break out at any moment yeah but that's why eventually LSU will need David Williams into Tilden for South Carolina if anyone Brendan was he hasn't gotten onto the field this is Williams on the carry straight down near the 25 yard line Brandon wilds number 22 was to have returned this week after missing the previous two games with a rib injury but so far the starting quarterback Perry orth they can do with David Williams let's go down to Quinton you guys mentioned Pharoah Cooper 11 and white he is the Swiss Army knife as rod called I mean he's got nearly six touches already in this ball game he's been targeted three other times he's in the slot right now 11 Williams again it'll be third down coming up after that gain of one Lewis Neal making the stop hey Quinn I wonder if you're feeling down there what I'm feeling up here in the sense of this is kind of South Carolina's mo this is working okay they handled coronet they've moved the ball a little bit and the crowd hasn't really been affected for them yeah short passing game Steve Spurrier emphasized Rose chewing up the top does just that but it's broken up with ya and rot and rot from field level the tackling stands out I mean we've watched a ton of tape on Leonard fournette this season just for a training guys wet weather it's his quickness speed or power this South Carolina team has come with a tackling mentality very impressive from field level yeah I agree and they've been mentally tough you know Spurrier dodged that bullet of not converting that fourth down in one situation LSU did not get points out of it so credit that defense for being mentally tough and hanging in there on that sear the davyous right good open field tackling it'll be first in 10 for LSU after the 41yard punt for net trying to get on track when we come back coming at me I'm gonna get trucks okay so I want to be going in at an angle Iowa if your angles and I got your shoulders to the sidelines I got a body I can go up here I can go down there but when you're coming at me oh I better go low and so far whatever they've done has worked on the tackling standpoint first down in ten and four net damn tackled they talked about getting 11 guys to the ball well they got eight guys nine guys even line of scrimmage guys are getting off blocks and getting to him so this is working so far the plan for South Carolina defensively has been a good win so if you're LSU is it just a matter of keeping the defense honest why you would not have his shoulders Square to the line of scrimmage most times well I was just running them straight ahead second down and six when it again rock down but a nice gain picked up seven yeah Jonesy I think if you're trying to deal with it you know LSU will keep running for net inside but South Carolina wants to get them out of a to back offense now Harris can help by completing passes down the field and getting that eighth man out of the box and make them play with two deep safeties but that hasn't happened yet first down in ten on the toss winnette well you talk about taking cornet head Amon that time rod that's exactly what you were talking about Jordan Diggs Jordan Diggs went low just as you demonstrated on me a moment ago with him coming straight at you well I didn't talk to him this week it's exactly what I would have told him that they're the shoulders straight at you you cannot stand up when that truck is coming at you you've got to get down I don't know if you really win when you take them straight on like that that's the lesser of the evils second down to three pounding away off the lunch side of that offensive line behind to Houma and post it picked up a couple of yards you know partner wasn't easy hitting you upstairs you've been in the weight room I usually call for a stunt man when you start talking tackling so you know did that hazard pay this week third two thousand one coming up for LSU LSU Tigers coming in undefeated at four no South Carolina at two and three Les Miles his team number seven in the country according to one poll five in the other but with four consecutive runs on this Drive they took five straight ones that keeps those legs moving and his forward momentum will give him enough for that first down just shy of the 45 foot rod let's talk about LSU as a team they're ranking a you had them up at number one this week why I think I was really frustrated with some of the other teams Ohio State Michigan State they certainly so little frustrated so I shook it up a little bit but there is a missing link with this l LSU team it is the passion attack I love their defense love their quickness love their rushing attack offensively but it's the passing attack that is the missing link and if they get that squared away I'm not sure who could beat them right now though they're 120 third out of 127 of fiesh teams and the passion game Williams brought down as the 42 it was interesting we had these while not these two teams but we had LSU in their bowl game last year against Notre Dame and Brandon Harris wasn't the starting quarterback that was Anthony Jennings at the time when coach miles talked about and coach Cameron talked about Harris getting more reps and getting used to the nuances of the position and improving subsequent to that well he needs more reps throwing the ball in games second and six throwing wait through the hands of Malachi Dupre they had five drops last week right and this one looked like it should have been tough well there are a couple things I mean it's not all on Harris this ball is thrown a little bit hard and that makes a bit of a problem but you got to come up with this one but you see that was a rocket but Dupri's got to catch that ball the five drops last week but also you've got to have a little bit more Paris was just four of nine dice in the back who had decided on third down and six here it moves in the open field for the face down tiptoes out of bounds at the 28 men the game's hot defense that an opportunity to get off the field but could you mention the drops last week guilty that this is what we're talking about you make a perfect throw you got to have that so it's not all on here here's another one in zone got to have that one that's be pretty you have to make those plays now when they start making the catches Harris will start making some softer throws on occasion I think and his anticipation you know throwing before the receiver makes his break before the receivers open throwing him open to learn to do more back now he's gone first down in ten guys and Harris loses his helmet comes off and the flag thrown on the play as a result well if he ripped the helmet off if if that was ripped off by Moore he will not have to come out see what the caller's here personal foul face mask on the defense number 10 20 is past the distance to the goal automatic first down they call it against kinda okay yeah that's on sky more and so Harris stays in the game because war was hit with the penalty for ripping the helmet off with the facemask penalty and Moore is a key player their leading tackler and he's giving away oh man 80 pounds or so when he runs up against those linemen he's only about 215 or so and those linemen are coming out of him putting him down punting linebackers dicing the backfield loose on the third back could even away basket bleep guys as momentum took them towards the sidelines we're gonna mark this right at the 10yard line Jonathan Walton making the tackle for South Carolina or net on the sidelines right now well he shouldn't be not for long no I mean you're in the red zone here if you don't have your money man in there now LSU and the purple jerseys at home for one of the few times second down in English let them play the drive in the end zone we put touch on that ball let's see if it stands flagging the endzone and a flag at the line of scrimmage but what a wellthrown dog by the harris and he's had a couple touchdowns called back yeah there are three files on the play pass interference on the defense the penalty is declined result for the plays a touchdown actually the play was over unsportsmanlike conduct number 77 on the offense unsportsmanlike conduct number 95 on the defense those penalties offset the try will be attempted now you got the story touchdown Malachi Dupre his second one of the season seventh of his career he's one of the playmakers they're really trying to get untracked yeah well I'll tell you what he made a fantastic catch but what an even better throw you might have hurt your rod Gilmore talking about getting some touch on that football as he laid that one right in the basket right in his kitchen please for South Carolina Gamecocks playing here because of the massive flooding and our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the people from the state of South Carolina from the for expect sitting trying to take cantock nation how do you like that touchdown 96 yards and a dash Jonesy you talk about special teams and big plays and the things that you need when your offense is not explosive its South Carolina just got one tremendous blocking right around the 20 yard line and that hole opened up Big Shot Benton those 96 yards almost untouched for the touchdown and that swings the momentum right back into Gamecocks yard and it's a 14 to 10 game yeah raise your hands up if you hear taou Utah tonight at 10:00 on ESPN back here at Baton Rouge it is 14 10 after Rashad Fenton just went 96 yards take a look at this kick return and Lane integrity gets lost by LSU they've got eight guys who are converging to the left side of the field they lose their Lane integrity and then take a look at the lanes that open up over here you've got a great Lane that's gonna open and not many defenders there it only takes a couple of blocks to spring it right there Fenton sees it and he is on his way there is nobody there in position bad pursuit angles and great speed by Fenton untouched his first career touchdown at a Carroll City Florida in the Miami area as we go back to Bristol Connecticut in that Denver thank you very much Mark SEC action Georgia taking on Tennessee this is Grace and Lambert to Malcolm Mitchell 28 yard touchdown pass for touchdown of the season it's Tennessee's largest deaths of the year now 14 3 we want to see more demos though of you Arad lurks you know what Edmund I didn't just hope that rod doesn't have one of those flashbacks when we're doing those demos because if he gets the flashbacks yours truly could end up in emergency care I don't know you're pretty jacked up I think you'd be all right the Mississippi River this morning great day here in Baton Rouge or net in on first and ten but with dark down to Malachi to the 46yard line check that it's Traven Doral for the first down so Jonesy that's what hares have to do if you're gonna open things up for Annette he has 12 carries for 38 yards you're talking about a guy who's gone three straight weeks for more than 200 having a subpar firsthalf for him anyway ah Smithfield is forward progress going to be market the 49yard line you know interesting story with him and he probably heard it already before the fact that he was offered a scholarship by Les Miles as a freshman in high school that's the first ever in the history of the program how about the parents here petition to keep them out of Pop Warner he was too aggressive I think there's some good coordinators who would sign a petition now good good try it's like in 2004 we can laurie wonderful parents testing that game pong crush defense again here the Ornette gonna be stopped up short we've seen that a lot frequently here today yeah yeah we have it's the eightman front they get eight guys in the box here you just see all those white shirts in the line scrimmage they get off their blogs this is what Burnett is facing and this is why Harris has to find a way to throw the football that was little biased play watch this right here look at all the white shirts this guy's getting off blocks at the line of scrimmage making tackles gang tackles too many guys the line of scrimmage Harris has to back them off he's got to throw the football to get some more Running Room before now they've got some talented was he was told third down and two the toss straight ahead and as he almost came out the back end of that scrum and picked up the first down Chris moody limiting the game to just fine I don't know if he was he was hanging on for the ride I've been in that position where you've come up to some big backs and you're hanging on waiting for a teammate to help you out toughest back you ever tackled when you were DP at Stanford ah I know there's a list you talked about Marcus Allen 100 player that's Alan Freeman McNeill you can either one of them could run me over take your pick that's Gerald Hawkins the starting left tackle a little shaken up on the play about five and half minutes to go in the first half we'll be back after this our new app will revolution his numbers that board was shaken up earlier but in need JJ Malone coming in the ballgame for Hawkins and he's gonna block the number 7 therefore net who has added uncharacteristically lower than average for sound the bar is set really high this is his second a section of the ball game couple flags down Cornette brought down at the 38 Mouton was out there trying to block for him a little bit chatter now on the 6 yard gain and after the game weren't very much a leader of this LSU team and known for his humility talked about him giving his Player of the Week honor JD Moore is fullback did the same a couple of years ago in high school when he gave his high school state Player of the Year award to a rival he is a tough guy but appreciates his teammates there is no foul on the play for defensive pass interference the ball did not cross the line of scrimmage however we do have a block in the back number 47 on the offense penalty is 10 yards replay first down that's against bright even Mouton Oh Jonesy a couple of things here you see this play here with the block in the back right there that was Mouton but the the big thing here is really noting for net in that he's been bottled up inside so now LSU they're looking at ways to try to get him the ball get him in space get him on track he has 49 yards on 15 runs in one catch for 9 yards and we're in a four point ballgame a lot of frustration LSU seven Harris had it knocked down at the line of scrimmage they've got a rule that incomplete Gerald Dixon Jr was there to make contact and knock the ball out of his arm you know talking to Lorenzo award the Cody coordinator for a South Carolina before the game he said he wanted to see if number six could win the game he knows number seven Cornett can he wants to see if six can do it and he wants to frustrate LSU he wants them thinking about have you given Burnett the ball enough our offense isn't new that he wants that mentality for the LSU offense and his defense is creating it like that right now it's guys from the ball game and he takes he doesn't take the carriers Paris keeps and falls down at the 47yard line picks up six let's go downstairs to Clint for more rod you mentioned frustration I don't quite sense that yes you know this games had a different feeling with the fans here it's kind of a sedate compared to what typically is but from this team it's kind of like they're in the right lane on the highway driving the speed limit you know it's kind of doing what's necessary you know not not willing to swing out in that left lane and hit the gas not going ultra slow either but just kind of just driving the speed limit when it's nice and safe you already make of the impact of the loss of Moore and Hawkins within their longterm it could be huge more than 13 passing situation play that's going to be short of the first down by a couple of yards good catch by deshaun Smith and they're in that area or the field fourth down where maybe you think about it a little bit especially a guy with a proclivity to take risk and gamble like Les Miles has in the past yeah I would think that you would go here now the issue is that South Carolina has done a pretty good job against your rushing attack but I don't think that will keep Les Miles from going ahead this on fourth down and he believes it is often he's not gonna back away from the challenge of trying to pick up the yard control that was on the sidelines Williams in the backfield out in the I formation and a flag down delay of game on the offense number six five yard penalty fourth down well that changes the equation a little bit now Leonard fournette even said that last week during Eastern Michigan week they were a little bit too lighthearted they were joking around a little bit in practice and said that coming into this week that they were putting their serious hats on so to speak and kind of maintaining and staying on point but so far south carolina has negated all that well keep in mind LSU had slow starts against Eastern Michigan against Syracuse and it was the third quarter in which LSU kind of tended on dances at the yard and it may have gotten this down and it's gonna be a touchback nope it's gonna come back out as we go back to Adnan in the studio all right mark thank you very much coming up on the Alexis halftime report a tough week for Charlie Strong as Texas have been off to the worst start since the Eisenhower administration but a huge performance no Longhorns today also Nick Chubb injured we'll have the severity of that for the Georgia running back and also Michigan one of the defenses of Michigan and North question showed up in a big way we'll tell you who Joey Galloway Danny canal and me coming up right at 9:00 is Leigh place of all the 20yard line that was a close call one a surprisingly close game South Carolina completing them first and ten after the 27 yard line to Pharaoh keeper one more look at that punt yeah you know Jonesy it is the ball not the player as long as you are in the field of play and it looks like he is you can do this it's the ball not the player and that ball look like he got his hands on it before it is right up the middle to shine Carson a spirited run by Carson for the first down a pickup of ten with 214 to go South Carolina with all three timeouts remaining so that's a good situation here berry oil making a simpie start of the season takes the snap and fires complete nice catch and run by Shamir Jeffrey a missed tackle on a play by white precise passing by orth short passes kind of keeping this defense offbalance a yard gain second and 2 will stamp it by Shawn person the 5/8 senior well interesting scenes when you're here in New Orleans yeah little voodoo around these there something else working for South Carolina kinda pregame sprinkle a little imaginary deaths but cooking up something special today Rob breading it around let it fall on the quarterbacks let's see it is picked up here incomplete in and out of the arms of Pharaoh Cooper so whatever that little ceremony was that ritual they went through didn't work on that pass but very interesting nonetheless I think it's been working for him no remember in his first start against Georgia he was 6 of 17 he's been much better today then here ladies you can find somebody that puts bows on people and stuff you know you think because it's a home game they found some of that second intern and picked off by John battle a great lunging effort by battle to scoop up the interception we talked about it all the time than is dark and full of terror you have to be careful throwing over the middle and when you have a tendency to throw high as we mentioned about fourth before that one gets batted up and battle makes a great catch but just when it seemed like South Carolina was moving into field goal range Ricki Jefferson might have tipped it a little bit too high throw over the middle you cannot have high throws over the middle like that they tip off bounce off and they usually wind up in the hands of the guys with the wrong colored jerseys LSU +5 in turnover margin and one of the top teams in the country in that category their sixth interception of the season until talking's we liftoff a moment go back on the field hits coming off the corner and he got it off in time to number seven for there Hera's hopped on that seven train a little bit late but enough for a 15yard gain just intend for the Tigers just shy midfielder 249 111 ago here in the first half LSU with one timeout remaining let's see how they manage this clock he was looking at porn net seemingly the entire time right you just want to go back to one thing we were talking about that possible touch back down there had a nice little note from Rogers reading coordinates officials said from his perspective that broke the plane and when it does break the plane it is a touch back so even if the player reaches into the endzone well yeah can't let it break the plane the head lining up as a receiver here's with wild Paris over the middle Meritage employee and 10 at the 23 well the middle of field didn't have a lot of dark terror that time rod as he found an opening 20 rail gain throw by Harris fearless first and 10 as complete at the 20 yard line to Dupree again rolling against al Harris jr. only two catches for four net before today and a concerted effort by LSU to find another way to get him involved since the rushing attack isn't working so much in second and the scene almost picked off a major collision involving three players to Prix Smith going head to head there well DJ Smith had a chance to take this off watch him come over from his free safety spot go high and he just couldn't hang on to it but that was his football he ran into teammate Rico McWilliams as well third and seven coming up 24 seconds to go in the first half Cornette lining up as a wide receiver at the bottom of your screen harris at some time at the 13 yard line by Johnson I Ron Johnson the freshman is 16 seconds to go we have time you can down this we have a timeout you can run apart you got option here he's gonna down it and spike it but the second and ten coming up one timeout remaining all of the 13 would he make the Harrises of boys on this drive I see some growth I enjoy that I think this is the kind of thing he's needed to do LSU's need to give him the opportunity trust him build some confidence he's managing miss he's made a couple of really good roads today no Leonard fournette on the pill right now there is meanwhile 13 of 21 passing for 135 yards that they swing it here guys in the other bounce good decisionmaking don't take a sack don't take an unnecessary risk come back to play the next play one more slay than a field goal attempt perhaps yeah and even he preserved that by throwing that ball away save some time save the timeout save the possibility of one more play but for my money I'd like to have number seven on the field from the 12 yard line today's giving a battle here from South Carolina in the first time Paris and has to throw it away again so the Gamecock defense any which way you look at it from here this is a win on this drive the first half is a win not just this drive they've shut down for net they prevented a touchdown there they're gonna be in position to have a shot in the second half of this ballgame you looking for a net 3.3 yard average three catches he came into the game with two catches for the year so South Carolina has made LSU do something different to try to get Fernet into the ballgame nine yards out it's good dough Magnox it through to make it 17 to 10 at the end of the first half of plays a surprisingly competitive and close game and Leonard fournette held in check gotta have the right ingredients like Dumbo in these parts Annenberg time for the Lexus halftime report you just can't throw anything in the gumbo though at that and called but to the people of South Carolina for enduring the massive flooding during the course of the last week Mark Jones alongside rod Gilmore Quint Kessenich downstairs bill G joining us in just a bit big news of the first half partner just 49 yards rushing by Leonard fournette but the good news is that his quarterback Brendan Harris is spreaded around line to seven different receiver I think you're right for a net hat trouble after his fullback JD Moore went out and Harris kind of picked up the slide he's throwing more passes in the first half and he has an inny game all year 23 13 of 23 in the first half and this is in a way good for the LSU offense they need to perfect their passing attack they need to get better at throwing a day Burnett's so much this year it's time for Harris to get involved and they used him in the first half but that man I think he seems a little bit lost without JD Moore his lead blocker out there as you mentioned only forty nine yards in the first half and most of that you know was before Moore got banged up folks if you missed rods tutorial and how to tackle Leonard fournette and the physical demo you can catch a copy of that online at watch ESPN or watch espn.com not sure that's what South Carolina was using in the first half but whatever that he did schematic wise was working South Carolina gets ready to kick off LSU to start with possession of the football here in the second half out of the end zone and take Jackson he's one of the faster members of that LSU team does a flag down right at the 20yard line though remember in Ellis Eve's game last week against Eastern Michigan it was surprisingly close in the second half during the return holding number 48 on return team penalty is half the distance to the goal first down they're gonna bring it back well Leonard fournette remember last week against Eastern Michigan as I mentioned that game a moment ago on the first play of the second half he took it the distance on a handoff for a touchdown and that kind of gave LSU a little bit more breathing room we'll see if he can duplicate that same magic years now let's do look to make it six consecutive wins against South Carolina there's fournette unlike the first play of the second half last week where he went 80 yards for the touchdown this time stopped up behind the line of scrimmage and actually got a couple of yards pardon me did you sort of expect Superman to come out of halftime with cape on and go about 75 yards he spoiled a lot of people us included second and seven coming up South Carolina trying to get back on track oh and three in Sec play Doubleday and three in Steve Spurrier's first year at South Carolina his cornet coming down still for a touchdown so rod he didn't do it on the first play of the second half he waited to play he still has the Cape what a tremendous block inside by his tight end coming across to make that happen that was holding too really opened up that Lane inside and you just don't catch this guy when he gets going it is not football once he gets beyond it's track and field she said before he's out there just running track and unfortunately for the Gamecocks on this last play all they saw was his shoe size the bottom of his cleats it's wearing a 12 back up to this really came out because not because I was something yeah this one this one's a tough one folks get back to the answer I think it goes back a few decades yes and that clue load help you of folks Leonard fournette 187 yards for a touchdown when over a thousand for the season in the process in 2004 his career all in one quick dash the pooch kick that's gonna be a win for South Carolina as they get it at the 32 yard line first and ten one more look at that touchdown run well part one the offensive line does its job on this power play watch as you get the kick out block and the block up filled by the guard number 64 clap now once all that happens it's time for Burnett to go to work and he works these two defenders perfectly a juke and speed shoulders squared toward the goal line and when that happens you're in trouble it's over nothing but exhaust fumes for the defenders after that 39 yards on the day in a blink let's see what kinda response the Gamecock side on the fly sleep fellow people are trying to get to the edge but brought that LSU defense we watch them on tape all week they are so quick sideline to sideline feed you Jeff saw number 33 Adams Jamal Adams go from the middle the field to the sideline comes off the field looks like he's had a little issue there no school has more players in the NFL going back to opening day NFL rosters than LSU LSU number one University of Miami number two remember you tonight against Florida State but Reggie cocacola not dipped to become second 11 mass is gonna be incomplete at the 38yard line as we go downstairs to Quinton Steve Spurrier admitted to me that his offense is lacking rhythm right now and we've watched LSU on defense enough to know this year the only team that's really moved the ball well on them has been Mississippi State in the second half of that game through the air I believe you need to have a sophisticated passing attack to attack this LSU defense I think they're most vulnerable if you can air it out of it not sure that they have that damn it still in the show ten of the 35 as Davy Williams by Deon Jones good tackle and I think Quint is right you know LSU loves to play man coverage on the back end and if you've got a sophisticated passing attack with with good receivers who can really battle mantoman coverage that's where you attack them they're uh there's a lot of talent on that field as Kelly gets ready to punt here but Jonesy I can only think of one team in the SEC with a sophisticated pass the attack right now it's a short list is at the pump out of bounds at the 20 yard line of the B first and ten on the 45 yard punt let's get the answer to our Aflac trivia question let me point out leading up the SME rushing what was the last time an SEC back led FBS in singleseason rush if you had john dot lee you're the winner 1949 i had no chance none whatsoever a different era I mean I like on Billy cannon Adele here but that was my closest guest to first down and ten for the Tigers stays on his feet falls forward to gain about four you talked about having a sophisticated passing attack to go against LSU's defense while we're talking quarterbacks Brandon Harris North the South Carolina those two today Raji said it quarterback played down this year in this conference I think that's right I think once you get beyond Allen at a NN really high level quarterback plays this part the funny I mean Greer seems to be coming on in Florida but that's only been for a game like I don't know that there's great quarterback play in this College have you seen it second down was six a nice completion they are out near the 32 Malachi Dupre working against Rico Williams we're seeing improved play by Brandon Harris today and if he continues to improve that will help LSU in their their bid to win the FCC because that is the missing component and if they can air it out on a consistent basis man this offense really becomes is he ever gonna get to sling it a lot though with number seven to the backseat he doesn't have to swing it a lot he just has to be able to be good enough West on the third down passing situations in a red zone take a little pressure off is down in ten from just outside the 30 a pass taught at the 48 yard line by Trey Quinn his first catch of the day but will it stand 17 yard game but the officials huddling back at the 29 yard line well if we're going to talk about the lack of proficient quarterback play we must add conversely that it's been a heck of a year for running backs in this conference as we get the call here from the official illegal shift number eight fiveyard penalty replay first down and you look at for Ned and chubs who was injured and it's Collins at Arkansas near the running back we may be seeing a transition from the quarterback heavy Heisman campaign to a more balanced with multiple running backs on the there's down in 15 after the penalty that straight ahead most of the 35 man rod he takes some blows though and he gives some growth I mean when he's running with the football it is falling forward shoulders lowered right arm now he's got the ball on the left arm right arm watch the left arm he's gonna give a blow he's throwing blows it's not just receiving hits he runs with attitude he runs very aggressive or maybe yard game for four net years again first down at the 41 yard line picked up seven downstairs to quint mark he is a powerful young man to see him in person up close you watch him on tape whether it was high school last year as a freshman or this year I have never seen him lose the oneonone battle he and the defender he is always winning that battle and always falling forward you know Quint we were looking at him before the game and sizing him up and I don't think he's quite as tall as Bo Jackson maybe not as tall as Herschel Walker but certainly built like those guys and I think ro Campbell is a more apt comparison for size but not with speed and quick quickness you have an injured player down in the field for South Carolina that's Isaiah Johnson he's down in the bottom of that that's pile and it looks like he got it twisted a little bit you need counted about three different guys that took to bring down four net that time you know when we were speaking with four net prior to the bowl game against Notre Dame last year when we spoke with him rowdy had one of the greatest lines I've ever heard someone asked him about being fatigued with all the carries he says I don't get tired I sweat now that South Carolina defense is the one that I'd be concerned about getting fatigued they played 48 snaps in the first half and this wears on you can't play that many snaps against this different disciplines Harris wisely steps out of bounds with it that's gonna be a loss go back to the 38 yard line DJ Smith there to run him out of bounds they lose three bad snap good job by Harris to just get his hands on a little wide or right and speaking of wide right who do you like tonight Florida state of mind it I like Florida State Miami to me is is still kind of inconsistent in struggling and I think every Golson is getting a going of course there Wilson likes you a banner or to fly 13 flags down a little motion up front second down against two Houma talked about it here it is Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo tonight Miami trying to snap that fivegame losing streak against Florida State we saw the Hurricanes against Nebraska a couple of weeks ago and Brad Kyle was really a fantastic slinging that ball around even though it came down to the dying seconds you know what else is fantastic you know you mentioned those planes how about folks trying to get a gofundme came out of that Florida State people yeah saying that's why more banner we want to keep out golden in place in Tallahassee let's move that guy's got a nice block on the air dice out here the pros down and a slick run as DJ Smith finally pushes him out of bounds but not before he picked up 17 change of pace kind of guy he he changes direction very quick a little different style runner than four net zones another weapon to the Arsenal how stable of guys there yeah they remoted back there bernetta sophomore williams a sophomore guys of freshman to the first man through it explosions run tell me about the fact if you're running back coming out of high school right now or if you're a receiver what are your prospects of going to LSU albeit they've got great talent that gets you ready for the NFL if number seven is there how does that affect your decisions I think most most high school running backs will figure he'll be gone in a year okay and that opens it up but it is interesting the receivers at LSU spoke about the few opportunities they've been getting in there's a little frustration there and you can cam the nail coordinator said you know what hey I don't mind they should be hungry we go catch the ball first and ten a little playaction Harris is looking down let's and then back at the 39 yard line by Mark Cuevas Lewis I sack on the play is South Carolina's defense rises up not many receivers in the pattern that time and Harris pulled the ball down and just couldn't get away a third down now and a second down in a long long way to go here is the 10th sack of the season new you're mentioning the wide receivers in Cam Cameron said you know what they're just divas 22 we'll receiver screen this is Johnson with nowhere to go we'll brought down at the 37 we'll do two wide receivers kind of have a reputation for being a little temperamental you say deep I'll try I'm sudden dress it up a little bit well yeah I mean as a former defensive back I thought they were two divas you know gotta look pretty you know don't touch me hater alert hater hater alert third and long to go I will tell you this they've got a stable of guys on this team at LSU that are really quick and going fast but South Carolina has hung in there pretty pretty well within this afternoon third and 20 a casting situation deshaun Smith was the intended receiver there it was 89 it was tipped right to Doral always good to be in the right place at the right time but always good to have your quarterback hang in there and take a shot now who was in the wrong place was that Smith 89 in the wrong place and he tried to catch a ball was he supposed to or was he overthrown that on Sunday or Monday when they watch the film for now Doral with his first touchdown catch of the season attentive his career sometimes as they say it's better to be lucky than good sometimes you vote 31:10 when we come back flood disaster they've been experiencing over the last eight days now in the state of South Carolina and all our thoughts and prayers go out to the people Paint Pots with the kid bringing it out to the 35 yard line you know we've seen devastating images and heard the heartbreaking stories from the floods and the Carolinas all throughout the week the Walt Disney Company ESPN's parent company makes a 1 million dollar donation every year to proactively fund future disasters so critical dollars are available as soon as those resources are needed an ESPN committee additional funds to support the South Carolina central Red Cross we continue to hope for a recovery in that area prayers and the college football community certainly responded the right way LSU they went through it themselves ten years ago with Katrina and they stepped up to help out South Carolina advocate is down in tank whoa this came to Tiger Stadium Shamir Geoffrey make the catch but there's a flag at the 40yard line those good guys we're going well I guess you could say backhand or run with the pushing there's a lot of contact down the sidelines between the receiver and the DB Kevin Tolliver the second here's the call you want to sing that as he go back and forth back of this yeah they're locked up they're pretty clean clearly and a great while and handed catch foot down in bounds doublecheck that yep left foot down a 22yard gain on the plate out of the 38 with a double reverse here two people in front of them but he's run out of bounds just shy of the 30 at the 31 yard line and seven yard gain on that play Ferrell Cooper the allconference selection first team preseason took plenty of Wildcat with him last year I'm around a lot in this game a couple of explosive plays by LSU have really put South Carolina in a bind their offense is not equipped to respond quickly and another flag thrown illegal substitution on the offense fiveyard penalty second down and pushes it back just outside the 35 see I'm going on it two and three over all coming in oh and three in conference play and uh the way things are going they set up and well under throne fujur did not find his target I mean that wasn't even close well autist was out there all he had to do was give it some air and let him go run underneath it he probably didn't see him but you saw that graphic earlier only 31 now 32 plays to South Carolina in the game and that just really hurts the South Carolina defense they've been on the field way too long and that pounding rushing attack of LSU I think is wearing on Sam Carson in the bathroom keropi play the inside receiver the middle receiver we talk or if fires behind his target incomplete intended for Jeffrey fourth down coming up the way things are going I wouldn't be shocked if he went for well I think they have to go I mean given where they are and given the the time of the game and the score you're at the 36 yard line this is a very long field go out of his comfort range I would think and not by the fill go would do you a lot of good they're over 1/4 down today now to keep this dog alive right down on the scene complete took me a score touchdown Adams and the Gamecocks with a bigtime response to close the margin Jerell Adams is sixsix senior an imposing target write down the scene nothing other than straight down the field wide open Adams came over a bit late couldn't make the play and look at their stuff Carolina comes up with a big third down and gets a score a two touchdown game now big fourth down they came up with that was fourth and seven fourth and eight Madame is one of their leading receivers was his 13th of the year and his second touchdown big fella staying upright for the score back up a great answer to that last score by LSU by the Gamecocks Adams right there with a touchdown catch and run to make it a 14point game South Carolina trying to snap a threegame confidence losing streak looking for their first conference that's what they started in Spurrier's first year and they were able to salvage the season well tonight on ESPN it's college football primetime presented by Hill Arkansas taking on number eight Alabama in a 10 it's a pac12 tilt number 23 Cal taking on number five Utah both games on ESPN and watch ESPN I love Jared Goff the quarterback at Cal this is his opportunity you know big time big chance on a big stage to show he's worthy of Heisman consideration remember last year when we had Utah against UCLA and Hundley was their big star in UCLA gave up ten sacks that night Utah is capable defensively of putting that on you how much of this surprised you this year you know it was all the policies if blouson was going to play well they were gonna be a good team without that that's been their support back but first and ten this is guys guys puts up about 14 you know what Leonard fournette seemingly has spent more time on the sidelines tonight I think than any other time that I've seen this year I think that's right and I'm not sure exactly why you see the numbers he had one really big run in the second half to really kind of boost his numbers up he lost JD more his fullback and I think that affected LSU offensively in the first half we've seen guys that built more a change of pace but Fernet has not been what we thought there is more and again once he got banged up when it came out for a few fights there's been 10 misses dice again broke one tackle books limited to a oneyard gain clock running with 420 to go here in the third quarter now let's see you looking to remain perfect on the season more is so important I mean the entire coaching staff has said all along and and Cam Cameron emphasized it yesterday as did Miles hey they need 40 for the fullback he is the guy that really makes so much so in their rushing attack and he is a comfort guy for Fernet he relies on his blots they have this way of communicating to each other that works really really well when I walked on put on scholarship that the beginning of the season by Les Miles LLC family member that both attended school here on the handout no to go the Thyssen that he escapes moleculus Lee he got his piece were down to the 36 yard line rocking his little Odell Beckham boos were pebble this tackle by Griffin on the play watch the work he does here buying a job I mean this play is going nowhere how many break make pizza missed three right there there's another one one more for good measure yep for miss tackle he turns a wall into a nice game try to Leonard hey Leonard you can chill a little bit there I got you yeah Williams down the ball game dice on the sidelines getting a breather that slums down the 28 yard line Rob you notice the other difference offensively it's not a two back said anymore for LSU once more went out of the game there was much more of an emphasis on the one back set for LSU and for me personally I think they're at their best when they use two bats when they have a fullback in there so clearly they're not as comfortable in the one back set and they're running more of that now no more no to back sets the smaller packets may be Devin Moore eastwest running second and two they're gonna market at the oneyard line look like he had gotten in I'm gonna mark it at the one instead got a good block though Williams did from tyronn Johnson for the 27 yard gain here's a look at it yep step the left foot left foot stepped out great job by the officials yep right on it left foot right there see if they give it to him here they may be curved on the last way Williams chasing the job for the score Tigers back up by three touchdowns in less than two minutes ago in the third corner the running backs doing a lot of heavy lifting today it's Maryland enough the buckeyes rod you and I were talking about it almost plane like a team that lacks motivation down at the 39 yard line fielded cleanly by South Carolina will be first down in 10 from there let's go down to Quinn Leonard fournette 100% healthy and fine just a spectator on that last Drive as LSU they flex their depth muscles basically the throw Williams out there and guys out there and you really started to see fatigue set in on the South Carolina sideline poor angles poor tackling body punches from LSU all day have them right on the edge I think you're right Quinn 48 plays in the first half we talked about that wearing them out 255 yards for LSU in the second half things have to stay on the field to help the demons those a dark complete out of the 46 yard line mattress Belvin they'll be first down in 10 nice game Jonesy you felt like in the first half South Carolina defensively rallying to the football tackling well no big plays allowed in the third quarter a lot of big plays just worn down downtown impacts themselves but also playing for an entire state today has had a very difficult time over the last week nice cutback move by son Carson was communicating with a good friend of mine Frank Martin the head coach of the Gamecock basketball team he characterized it as a major major disaster another friend of mine John Avery in Clinton South Carolina good friend of mine said they've gotten an actual another additional three four inches of rain today well any way you want to spin it it had to impact these players all his back and second a seven complete and a change here capture touchdown South Carolina defeat Rickey Jefferson on the coverage and for the second consecutive time hey the game cots have answered a tiger touchdown with one of their own we talked earlier about man coverage and a good passing attack and a good receiver challenging and beating mantoman coverage Cooper just did it with his fourth touchdown of the season the 13th of his career and it's back to a two touchdown game you see the middle of the field he beats Jackson right off the line of scrimmage and then a move on the safety Adams man the man coverage press coverage at the line of scrimmage beat it and then great speed hey you keep telling me the middle of the fields filled with darkness and terror when you have to bear there you gotta have people in the middle that's the fun zone when you play the mantoman coverage you don't have anybody in the middle of the field ok there's your explanation alright but typically the middle of the field is dark and full of terror be wary of it with 39 seconds to go in the third quarter Cooper with 105 yards receiving today that's his seventh game this year part me in his career with over 100 yards receiving and courtesy of the pass from that guy orthe and you see Nunez there beside him he did not practice this week because of a shoulder injury and obviously not going today well and it changed the focus of their offense they've gone from a quarterback running offense to a quarterback passing attack today with 4th throwing the ball around much more than South Carolina did when Nunez was they try to go to the outside kick and it's recovered by the kicker and NRT and it seems to yes it has gone ten yards well they caught LSU napping Steve Spurrier rolls the dice it's gotta go 10 LS you not prepared and it looked like it was the kicker who recovered how about the heart if he ran alongside it just waiting for it to get to the 10 yard now they're saying it was touched before it went the mandatory 10 yards I think well he was running alongside of it let's watch closely does hard touch it didn't hit him he's awfully close to it they called offsides on the play that was the official call so otherwise executed pretty well by the kicker that was a perfect kick all for naught since someone was all thoughts for South Carolina officials said offside 24 white so forced to kick it long and this is Darryl Williams Williams out to the booties of the yard line a great opportunity for momentarily for South Carolina first and ten for the Tigers the smiles the 2011 national coach of the year won a national championship that year that great visit with him yesterday at the LSU football offices miles because of the pork and the change of venue had a chance to go watch his son play football last night for another older son that actually is on scholarship playing football at North Carolina very athletic family nice nice wicked quick today into South Carolina territory at a nice gain he's had some huge holes to run through he's done his work once he's gotten through them but that offensive line can really underrated really underrated 20yard pick up there but he wasn't touched the first 78 yards seven seconds to go here in the third quarter that offensive line some big fellas up front they run it again 305 327 pounds 309 303 320 pounds across the front running backs got a lot of help we talked about that offensive line huge red beans and rice didn't miss those guys back for the fourth quarter third quarter various dice getting a lot of touches here in the second half and another spirited iran down to the 37 yard line close to another first down rod when you look ahead to Florida next week as we look at an injured player down on the field for South Carolina as number nine or 90 Taylor Stallworth do you even think about easing back the throttle on for net with Florida next week well I think you will at some point but in a to score game not right now and remember you know LSU likes to get him about 25 touches he's at 23 today with 20 carries and three catches so he's probably going to come back for a couple more touches mr. Williams brought down by Georgian boots minute it's a to score game so right now you don't assume that this game is is on ice for hell that's you LSU's because of the fact that they get to play this game here in Baton Rouge we'll enjoy a nice long stretch of games at hey Raven still in the backfield beside quarterback Brandon Harris a state became it actually had the air then they get first avail for the Tigers let's go to admin and in the studio all right Jonesy thank you very much up to deal what's happened with Georgia and Tennessee is bald tears a store back joshua dobbs here and all of a sudden were tied up in 24 mark back to you with what Jones did really use a break how about that how about Tennessee not giving up getting back and then taken a big lead away from somebody else after having blown three doubledigit leads to last few weeks for the first down and goal dice in the ball game they line up out of the eye and a little motion up front it was Kelsey Griffin encroaching how about the job this LSU offensive line is done today both side defense number 94 penalty is half the distance to the goal so first out you mentioned the yards that fournette has already about guys dice is also chimed in he's it's a hundred and two yards on nine carry so this offensive line and we talked about them at the very beginning of the show have two freshmen up front miss Maya certainly doesn't lack for talent first and goal dice and Mouton lining up out of the I is going to be dice straight ahead touchdown partner watched this hole on the right side that the offensive line creates pull the guard kick out block I think I could get through though I think we both can get through that hole that offensive line just wearing out South Carolina in the second half dice now over 100 yards rushing with 106 they back up to 21 backtoback moves after this who's the hottie whose Twitter not hawk were you hit just out what french fries not in my house young lady dad there's just no stopping true love chicken fries are back at Burger King a little mystery can go a long way I suggest you have it lead back to your place stay thirsty my friends after the Allstate it's good suit

for 140 $9.99 or this backpack blower for less than $300 but hurry these deals won't last the stock market ended down sharply today despite early the energy sector is nosedown how's it feel ever in here along with Stan the manor dare I say animal now let's take a look at winning traditions driven by Goodyear Mike the tiger the live LSU mascot since 1935 he is a mainstay at home games unfortunately for him today is considered a road game so SEC rules prohibit a live mascot from being in this contest he's busy putting down his 25 pounds of meat a day mark and rod how do we sneak a 500pound tiger into the stadium for this football game dress it dress them up like that you won't get any help from me you're on your own q you are on your own I would have liked to see the tiger in the ballpark today we ran one back with touchdown earlier stacked up about the 25yard line take a look at today's 18 t's strong performance that strong performance is really on the LSU side the running tremendous job Cornett third quarter of this ballgame we'll help inside there are Williams big Russian attack dice over a hundred yards as well today the running backs for Ellis he would have had a very strong supporting today push down in town they responded this pass hi incomplete intended for DJ Neil and/or took a shot remember if you're just joining us Perry orth got the start today his second start of the season well and he's played pretty well he's played much better than he did in his first start against Georgia replacing that man right there yes got a bad shoulder and I think in general you have to you have to acknowledge the fact that the South Carolina players have played hard and generally have played pretty well just giving up a whole lot of big plays in the second half or if it's 13 to 26 for 195 yards and a couple of touchdowns they take off here and the C Senate at LSU defensive speed Jamal Adams the strong safety running him down to make the tackle on to play this is a school that has never lacked for players with a lot of speed I think about trendin Holliday the former kickoff and punt returner here former worldclass sprinter actually when a 1001 and hundred meters as a member of the incidental championship track team here third and two nice cutback move by Williams and Williams with a first down and the 41 there will be a huge ball game next week for LSU surprisingly Florida Florida has become a thing they've worked out their quarterback thing deal huh apparently you knew they had a good defense coming into this season the question was could they do enough offensively first down and ten the backfield complete Williams have been nice move and got about six here's a look at that Tigers schedule coming up next week they'll take on Florida who opened up a lot of eyes with that win in the swamp against Ole Miss and then take a look at how they end things here Alabama Arkansas Ole Miss Texas A&amp;M wolves that is a physical deal they've got week after week after week very physical teams of Alabama Arkansas illness defensively and then AM has really grown defensively so the finish of it is tough they get some games at home and that's that's the good thing Tyler to make it a nice long stretch of games although at home but give mr. Carson who keeps to himself in Boston and brought down right near that first down marker they're interesting to note about that schedule though they've got LSU has Western Kentucky up by and then Alabama how much does it help them the bye week and it's an opponent that isn't an SEC appalled at the unexpected home game today extra time they don't have to be out there traveling and whatnot they've got their routine they're here so they've had a stretch or they will have a stretch of three weeks or so including the buy that works out pretty well for them to be rested and ready for Alabama with that much short of the first down two to go here in the fourth quarter what about the future for Steve Spurrier a tough year this year so far oh and three start in conference play and we tried to add up you know six seven wins it's gonna be tough right now to South Carolina you know and there were there was a lot of talk about Spurrier considering retiring last season last offseason that ended he's back and people still wonder how much longer he'll be around and all he says is hey I'm I'm enjoying it I'm not going anywhere but this has to be a tough year he expected this year to be much better young quarterback and Nunez Hana Mitch was injured early he's Kentucky New Year's to question it takes the snap and mortgages the first down Connor Mitch started the season is that the win against North Carolina then was shaken up against Kentucky's suffering a shoulder injury and then or started the Georgia game they lost 52 to 20 he struggled 6 of 17 Nunez that the previous two starts and then hurt his shoulder against Missouri forcing North to come back in and mop that one up that brought us to today and sundown at the 45 yard line by Shawn Carson but this is a South Carolina fence rod that is just right now anyway devoid of that that big play dynamic two or three or four guys who can make it happen I mean it burrows yeah it's Cooper he's the one guy and the other part of that though Jonesy is they can't control the ball and that leaves their defense on the field too much their deepest played 48 plays in the first half of this game yeah it is no accident that in the third quarter they gave up a lot of big plays or fourth time and now forced to throw it out of bounds a little bit of heat coming his way from ardent key the true freshman and really one of the best past rushes right there number 49 on your screen for LSU young man out of Atlanta Georgia six six 230 pass rushing specialist right now wait until he grows up wait until he is full grown but he has a very quick first step as a pass rushers he's very athletic very long and he's just a pump third and seven and sacked back at the 48yard line Lewis meal with his fourth sack of the season and it's fourth down coming up for South Carolina this is a defense that was not really aggressive and didn't make a lot of sacks last season this year that's changed better pass worse from the outside with some help from the man who talked about Adams but that time it was on the other side good job up front Lewis Neal 92 getting that sack Arden key 49 on the opposite side really third point of the day two down this inside the five well done by Kellys devs in almost 42 yards per punt it's not called for net all the time this defense right in its name and signing off on this game our new app will revolutionize cars serve it that's not the real Mike the tiger but a reasonable facsimile as we welcome you back to ESPN college football presented by cars.com with 833 to go here in the fourth quarter LSU comfortably ahead and Leonard Burnett on the sidelines got in the eye they put it on the ground and Gerald Hawkins recovering it for LSU back to Adnan in the studio who always has short hands oh I appreciate Jones you know you know how we do Georgia and Tennessee it was twenty four to three Georgia a minute left in the second quarter here they come Dobbs to Kamara 31 24 volunteers back to like we said Butch is trying to flip the script on those in game situations for Tennessee ask any fans how you like me now huh yeah they've been tough on him but when today against Georgia would endear him to the faithful the vol nation second down and four dice picked the edge and hit me the circle kicked in and he makes it out to midfield before I say it Johnson finally pushes a lot of bounds but a nice added dimension he brings that will help LSU not just today down the line great quickness great speed change of direction a little different than for net not as big as for that a guy who can really kill you in space big knives as a leader with these guys these these are serious players but you know you know this players respect players who can flare this and you can play you can get their attention in a leaseback games in the backfield takes the handoff topped up at about the 45yard line unless miles like that on the play my smiles had a chance to be at home for an extra week and his wife Kathy was heading up to North Carolina to visit their son that plays football up that way University of North Carolina his wife Kathy former basketball coach collegiate basketball coach holding number 77 on the offense 10yard penalty replay second down his daughter is a swimmer at the University of Texas some Manny as I mentioned a football player Ben is an hback junior in high school and coach had a chance to hang out with him last night as a perk of the change in the schedule second and 12 as complete to Dupree use brought down immediately at the 43 yard line by Isaiah Johnson you know you mentioned earlier South Carolina and finding enough wins for a bowl game that's gonna be a challenge their schedule is a tough one the rest of the way out take a look at what they have down the road there Texas A&amp;M Tennessee Florida the Citadel Clemson what do you figure you can pencil in maybe what one win with the Citadel maybe Tim with Vandy the rest put out various guys running third and 13 I see you're gonna punter yeah tough year for the Gamecocks and I wouldn't even pencil and the Vandy game is as a wins that that's a competitive game there the good news is they played hard today their defense did a good job in the first half and you saw some growth with Perry or Thor at quarterback he played much better today than he did against Georgia a couple weeks ago what does it mean for them rod if they get Nunez back or even if Connor Mitch comes back as it is it at a point where things can be salvaged a little bit more I think they'll get better some depth at quarterback to different style bouncing at the 16yard line works down first and ten coming back the other way for South Carolina from a busy day in the mat major league baseball postseason in sports an art night on ESPN and streaming live on watch ESPN and I know that one Hugh Jones is upset that the Dodgers and Kershaw got beaten last night a little bit of a surprise there skaar Nekia in a quarterback for South Carolina and what about the Toronto Blue Jays down two games to nothing right out of the box stunning that home teams would would drop two at home in the playoffs they gave up two gave up the crib look at the numbers on star Nekia 64 freshman lightly recruited but then he impressed furrier at a South Carolina camp at all that's all it took the 25yard line that Haden first he is more of a dropback passer folks around the program as you take a look at fourth with some ice on his left calf it looks like folks around the South Carolina program have talked to glowingly about scar Nikia his arm ability and Spurrier certainly impressed them they wanted to get him in the game and get a look at him son Carson got enough to the first down interesting that we didn't see Brandon wilds today and he was scheduled that we were told to play he was healthy enough to play but obviously not the case South Carolina barring a miraculous turnaround here will fall to two and four on the season conference play therefore important and the Tigers will take over on downs yeah he didn't he fumbled it for but didn't get it enough of it to pick up the first down I think you're right I think LSU comes back on the field and while we had that moment as we take a look at this just didn't get the snap yeah let me ask you this about Leonard fournette with all the talk about County coming out early should have come out early should have just not played his junior year we've heard some of that talk about Fernet miles jack for UCLA got hurt and he's not coming back to UCLA from his senior year what do you make of that should it should a guy sit out I don't know how you just shut it down I mean what do you do to maintain your football skill and and your your sustainability and you know just remain a football player yeah what do you do in the meantime how you replicate what you would do and if it each innings in a quarterback's relish guys let's get back to fournette do you ship honey how do you shut him down I don't think that talked Ludacris yeah I don't think he would do that but I think at some point we will see a running back and he's had a great freshman sophomore year shut it down for his junior season or back away after a minor injury because the name Marcus Lattimore will come up a guy who was a surefire firstround pick got injured in his junior year drafted in the fourth round but never made it back to the field and that story still is out there now that people talk about well I think at some point when you talk about running backs not other players but because of the weary tear in the risk of injury think it'll happen at some point apparently you're gonna take the risk and let's go back to adnan who never shuts it down all right thank very much by the way let's stay positive when it comes to the Blue Jays and all that chatter on the road they're gonna be fine Georgia Tennessee how about this play Greyson Lambert to Reggie Davis over to allpurpose yards for him only one all in Knoxville mark hey mad man from Scarborough to Etobicoke up and steals Avenue all the way down to Lake Shore Boulevard they're they're upset about what's happening with the Blue Jays to nothing man in a hold of Amy Donaldson 2 to go off any he hit one the last last night looked like it was gonna get out didn't happen could end of the ballgame they need Josh Donaldson to get on the roll Joe Carter ain't walking through that door nope third and fourth let's cut that back dose still on his feet it's finally neck tied back at the 20yard line well folks not quite the 200yard de+ rushing that most people thought for net might go for today so that streak ends at 3:00 still pretty prolific in a 158 rod and he becomes the tenth guy to get to a thousand yards in only five games that is remarkable he has a shot at getting a couple thousand yards plus this season which definitely would get him to New York for the Heisman ceremony whether he is the guy who wins it or not we got a few tweaks to figure that out guys stops the clock with one second to go unless you can improve to five and OH on the season and the guy from the seventh Ward his neighborhood his block when it ferment doing a big part today offensively how about that offensive line mmhmm that offensive line did a great job couple hundred yard rushers 350 yards yourselves a name pole boys got to be on the running backs today he's taking the offensive linemen out forty five to twenty four the final as LSU makes it six consecutive wins against South Carolina and let's go down to Quint with Leonard fournette
