============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC welcome to a dark night at the Shu Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo a soldout black town crowd here at Ohio Stadium welcoming the Buckeyes to be wearing all black for this border big ten East rivalry game the undefeated number one team and the dotting of the Ohio here at Ohio Stadium the lifetime for a sousaphone player kirk what these fans are waiting to see is will the Buckeyes have a breakout game will they look like a dominant number one team we knew if they clean up two areas turnovers still minus two and red zone offense that would go a long ways and they're doing it with an unusual quarterback setup now they are in Urban Meyer when you talk to him he talks about efficiency his quarterbacks need to play efficiently when they get into the red zone they need to score touchdowns and not settle for field goals and last week that's exactly what he got from the combination of Cardale Jones really being the quarterback and then you saw JT Barrett come in into the red zone that will continue tonight and we'll see if it has the same success as it had a week ago and of course you know all about Zeke Elliott we could talk all you want about quarterbacks but Urban Meyer makes it very clear this offense get started with Zeke Elliott and if they could establish him in the inside against his Penn State very talented in front it'll occupy a lot of their attention and could open up some big plays potentially in the passing game the personality of Penn State's team is a defense they're going to count them to limit guys like Elliott it was a double overtime loss at home for the Lions last year the good news is for Penn State they get two running backs back who could play a part tonight a key Lynch will start and then seka Juan Barkley the talented true freshman their best back he comes off of a high ankle sprain to give them a chance in the running game I think Barkley has a chance to be the best back that Penn State his hag going back maybe ten years he has talent he has quickness he has size at 223 pounds they say he runs a for four he can make people miss he would be a difference maker if he can hold up with an ankle where he missed last week's game so the other backs they have were pretty effective but Christian Hackenberg really needs I think Barkley to be able to step up try to make some plays and then if he can make plays it takes a lot of pressure off the offensive line and Hackenberg in a very hostile environments that offensive line has really struggled in five home games much less in this environment here the last year pier was ugly for Penn State not that many a veteran guys have experienced something like this we'll see if that o line can hold up against Joey Bosa incoming well that's the whole thing again if they can get the running game going that could take some of the pressure off and you're right they've never been in this environment yet this year we'll see how they hold up Urban Meyer emotional his team geeked up for this rivalry will see a Penn State and pull off a milestone upset or if the Buckeyes look like a number one team tonight Ohio State's always the team your circle one in the big ten where you find out if the Dolphins gonna continue to work classic Big Ten football Penn State wants that scalp on the wall this is why you play college football the Buckeyes and the Nittany Lions definitely a rivalry game keeps it himself runs it straight ahead dives into the end zone come on whiteout doubleovertime a filler last year in Happy Valley a blackout here at Ohio Stadium a little bit like a Marilyn Manson concert people dressed in all black Kirk James Franklin's first ever trip to the Horseshoe did not bring his team yesterday so many of these young Lions getting their first glimpse of urban hires placed urban merely forty four and three at Ohio State seeking the fourth twenty game winning streak of his career incredible the Heil state will get the ball first Penn State won the toss and deferred the freshmen' Joey Julius all 260 pounds of him will kick it away he's a big kicker that's right to reach the end zone Kurtis Samuel the sophomore is back deep for Ohio State at the oneyard line here we go it is Samuel with a Chance from the three and the Lions with the Pats popping knock him down at the 22 yard line so once again Kirk Cardale Jones gets the start but we will see JT bear in the red zone in certain other situations tonight yeah 6 5 250 people know all about what he did at the end of last year and really I think last week maybe had his best game as far as efficiency 21 to 28 to 91 two and no interceptions which is the key and making quicker decisions which is what Urban Meyer and his offensive staff want to see from him no turnovers last week for Ohio State Jones has thrown five picks on the season the workhorse Ezekiel Elliott of course number 15 almost no other running back to Ohio State has carried the ball this season this breaks a pattern typically Ohio State has thrown the ball on the very first play of the game this time they run Elliot and no game there the chickfila impact wears yeah and I think when you start with Ohio State as much as the quarterbacks seem to get the attention it is II Kalia we talked about that in the open they've got to get him going Penn State they're blitzing they did a lot of that last year Michael Thomas will get some oneonone opportunities on the sieve for the great stories for Penn State already 12 tackles for a loss in 10 sacks in the middle there Jason Cabinda who's a nice inside linebacker they moved him to the middle with some other injuries he's doing a nice job of leading the Penn State defense the wild dogs is what this Penn State defensive line is known as a fine closeknit bunch of characters up there but they can play football he looked at mmediately for Thomas to the right the pass is deflected by Anthony's Ã«til one of those wild dogs to see you got the big arm up they do that very well they do and I think that Jones saw him down thinking he was gonna rush and then he kind of drops out and gets in position to be able to go up and time it he look at him he's physical he's in a guy who last year had a great game against Ohio State but I'd say he is a tremendous athlete one of the more explosive defense alignment you'll see for his size in the Big Ten Iowa State has struggled the times on third down tonight they need 11 yards here he got Braxton Miller in the slot to the left of the court of equity looks that direction in the litter is a high throw is looking familiar but it was a fastball a little bit while from Cardell and so the Buckeyes go three and out yeah in penn state exactly what they needed to come in on the road try to get a three now to get the ball to their offense and this is a ball where you saw Braxton Miller his own defense he sits down perfectly he's right there the ball is thrown on the money it's a first down he found the soft spot his own and just unable to connect with Cardale Jones so Penn State continues their trend they haven't allowed any points on the opponents opening drive all season the fine ozzie punter Cameron Johnson just boots it deep and the Andrej Tompkins has to backpedal to make a fair catch at the 24 yard line there Cox all bundled up on the sidelines tonight hello Heather hello Chris and tonight marks Penn State's first true road test and it is definitely in a hostile environment which is a huge challenge for Penn State's a line that's been struggling Rd allowing 19 season handle office noise handle the Ohio State defense really hitting its ears back and rush in the past well they've been practicing the silent count all season James Franklin said from the center this is the first time they do they give it to a Kia lens the junior who was a leading rusher for the Lions a year ago he's had a knee bruise he's back after missing the last game they moved the shades on the first one you see six different offensive line combinations in seven games in the offensive line not only is talent important but when you're breaking in some new faces continuity and that is a big factor they're finally starting to get healthy which is so important to what they need to do especially on the road in this environment when they need to be able to communicate Eichenberg stands and delivers a strike and breaking a tackle is Chris Coghlan a foot race he'll be trapped out of the twenty the Penn State strikes quickly and gets near the red zone Gary and Conley saved the touchdown to watch Hackenberg and rhythm here confident in the pocket and puts the ball right on the money the reason that's important in tight coverages Godwin has a chance to make a play after the catch he lowers his shoulder breaks through two tackles and he's off to the races a poor angle that time by the safety time his pal that allowed him to be able to pick up extra yardage this settles it right here puts the ball right on the money see Eli Apple coming over a core angel' by pound pals that last that the last chance to make the play 45 yards in Joshua parry the senior linebacker making his 30th career start one of the cerebral leaders of the defense is very slow to get up and it seems to be favoring the right leg he is a guy that's played in a lot of big games really a leader for this football team and Ohio State has dealt with a number of injuries this year's plays mainly in the secondary comes over and gets involved when attacked I'll keep an eye on their way ankle yeah teammate Eli Eli Apple just trying to make a play obviously to prevent the touchdown he just rolled up on his ankle so Perry helped off the Lions set up at the Buckeyes 21 yard line to plays into their first possession once bounces it outside of the so now estate team especially cooked at that side where Darren layin by belt patrol yeah no doubt about it it's a good job here by the linebackers watched in force since right there they force it to the outside and that's worl high o state speed team speed could come into play but it was the inside linebacker McMillan that did a good job on the left tackle Palmer being gauged pushed him back into the hole there's really nothing that Lynch could do except try to bounce outside that's tough to do against the Buckeyes dependents think if they're gonna run the ball tonight Penn State's got to go northsouth have to have to find some creases Brandon pulled the speedy true freshman never attends in the back he gets the swing pass very dangerous with the ball takes his shot at the 16 yard line as Dante a Booker who's filling in for the injured Perry makes the stop it'll be third down you know the true freshman polo has really known at this point in the season more for his ability to make plays in a jet sweep but they just want to get him the ball and Spacek Chris to me talking about their running game trying to get vertical and go north and south what it's really an extension of their running game just flipping it to the outside and relying on some blocks by the wide receivers and said has been a poor third on offense but this area third and five actually quite respectable they've won a lot and thirded medium Hackenberg instead the litter is alone for a really no chance for that play to succeed say black nah was the targeted man but it's worked down and here comes the field goal team as good as Hackenberg looked on the first Road back into the boundary this is great coverage by Eli Apple he actually had inside technique and it was just nowhere for black not to go to be able to get inside so the Java hiyo States coverage they're on third down nothing to do for Hackenberg other than just throw it down and throw it away from the defender who's big Joey Julius 33 yards turned down soccer scholarships to walk onto Penn State's football team eight of nine in the season didn't miss a couple of PA T's last week put the Penn State offense with the big play connection to Godwin gets three points out of their first possession London at football Eli Manning the first place New York Giants against Chip Kelly's Eagles closely bunched Division I and that is far from over I mean everybody's within a game that the Giants have 815 money that countdown sure Mike Applebee's begins coverage at 6:00 you don't want to count Philly out just yet my bad Chip Kelly don't get the start don't count those those Eagles out just yet they're coming so Penn State and 61 yard field goal drive in six plays the big play Hackenberg to Godwin Julius will pick it away again to Sandoval julius min samuel in the corner had a crease their trip down at the 30yard line as the kicker was down there defending so the Buckeye is back to work after going three and out at the first possession come off the most complete game yeah I think so when it comes to what Urban Meyer is looking for and again he wants efficiency don't want to have turnovers he wants to be able to take care of the ball Carnell Jones getting the ball downfield for the first time in a while JT of course into the red zone he had opportunities he ran for three touchdowns over six at six as a team in the red zone trying to find Michael Thomas one on one and getting Braxton Miller just get his touches and try to get him involved because he's such a dynamic playmaker 28 ship run against the Terrapins after the game was tied at 21 Midway third quarter wasn't appropriate performance but showed excellent signs in that second half cuts it back and gets to the secondary takes a hard hit for a nineyard game as we check in half city Hubbard the studio for our force update I'm dr. pepper championship drive update number six LSU hosting number eight Florida Brandon Harris to Malachi Dupre nine yard TD pass to add to 11 for net touchdown run it's 147 LSU in the second you can see this game on ESPN and watch ESPN 8 is at an early 7nothing lead with the Bayou Bengals in front thank you second and one Eliott hesitated but does die over for first down yardage at the for teach for a reader the junior linebacker knocked him down outside of Virginia Tech week one when Ohio State went into Lane Stadium and I know Virginia Tech they've had some injuries but to talent on their defensive line was pretty good outside of that game this is by far the most talented most physical and athletic defensive line this is Ohio State offensive line were faced all year Jones straight back delivers incomplete it was behind Thomas and very nearly intercepted by Grant Haley the corners a little miscommunication yeah it's a miscommunication and it's a it's a rhythmic thing it's it's Cardale Jones taking what he does the practice field into the games and it's you know you can look at it and say you know by the way Haley a great effort there almost comes up with the interception but the ball was behind this has been a kind of ongoing thing for most of the year where there are times when Jones looks great there are other times where he and his receivers just don't seem to be on the same page Jones boat for three passing in the early go and so on second and long they'll feed Braxton Miller that's often the pattern bullying in the game Ohio State will treat second along like a running down yeah and I think you go back to Jones and whether its second long third long I think the reason they treat as a running it down is I don't think they have a hundred percent confidence in the decisionmaking of Cardale Jones and I think they err on the side of seek Elliott in the running game of the offensive line as opposed to just being free willing and taking chances the way they did in the last three games when he played quarterback so the Lions will rush only three and third long Jones has time deliveries complete battling but not getting the first down is Jalen Marshall said the Lions gang up on in there good collective effort Jordan Lucas the safety in the Ohio State will punt again it really goes back to that errant past and Michael Thomas on first and ten they ran the football and the Penn State defense they they are in a really good job with their plan and they're very very fortunate they have a defensive line that is so strong they can get penetration without always having to blitz and you can keep two safeties back to prevent the deep play through the air by doing that Johnston again to punt it away Thompkins makes the fair catch signal out wanted it 30 times this year teams have had positive returns at Ohio State five times that state pin back but in front at throw 45 yard kick Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Coke Zero all days zero calories try a new game day tradition Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking done and nissan premier partner of the Heisman Trophy advance of both schools got a peek at the trophy up close at the Nissan Heisman house here in Columbus this week granted to Troy Smith the most recent Buckeye Heisman Trophy winner this afternoon he was all pumped up for this game crowd try to get loud as this young in experience Penn State offensive line and a true freshman tailback say Quan Berkeley makes his return after missing two and a half games to the my ankles Brandi's behind Hackenberg monthly immediately no game Adolphus Washington knocked him down well currency saw one of Ohio State's leaders on defense Joshua Perry limp off the field he has a right ankle injury head athletic trainer Doug Callen tested strength mobility then retaped it that period couldn't put much pressure on it so they've taken him out on the cart into the locker room Doug said though take all that tape off to an xray he didn't say if the xrays are negative they'll retain but and you soft mattress dante hooker filling in for Hannah Barkley's first Gary so empty backfield on second in town machan berg chased he's not known as a runner but in recent games kirk he's been taken off quickly at least making a positive play of it you know he will surprise you with his athletic ability they told me he's about a four seven forty which is pretty quick for a guy at his size 6 for about 230 pounds and I also think Penn State told him this week hey listen you're athletic you've had some success if it's not there hioh states had some trouble in recent weeks with quarterbacks running they gave a hundred fifty yards scrambling last week to Maryland something he's looking for and if he can take off against man coverage he'll try to find first downs since at third and six the guys rushed for again Hackenberg fluffs rolls deliverers in complaint he fir it in the direction of Berkeley but into traffic as Joey Bosa got after him yeah what's Joey Bosa here he's just going to go after Andrew Nelson he's right here he doesn't necessarily come up with the sack he'll watch the pressure watch how he's able to get after him flush him out of the pocket and force Hackenberg to throw it away see that's look that's Joey Bosa in a nutshell it's not going to show up tomorrow in the stats he didn't have a sack all he did is force Penn State to have to punt deep in their own territory and flush the quarterback out of the pocket it's Chris Dula in this last week's game with injury he made a tackle covering a punt against army and missed the last game and a whistle before the punt Ohio State their first so the Buckeye spend a timeout before the pun figured to get very good field position for their third possession that is hioh states defense you know you everybody wants to compare them to where they were a year ago you know the offense to a year ago mainly those last three games the defense the expectations are so high it's almost as if they have to go out and just dominate every single game that that sequence of plays was very big to try to pin on Penn State back deep in their territory no Kurt before kickoff they ran a play on the scoreboard here and the crowd enjoyed it the most improbable finish you see Michigan State but the punt is bottled and Sparty runs it back triple 0 on the clock they make up for a terrible day on special teams with the gamewinner 27:23 for the quoteunquote what is it seven of an eight now for Michigan State and not only Chris was it a crazy finish but what was its take for the two teams right there that's all a Michigan had to do to win the game was get the pun away that Marshall nice return busts it down to the 35 yard line so hyoe state struggling so far on offense will be set up at the Lions 35 a 39 yard pen is punking Marshall to get back 16 yards the left the last five games for Ohio State this has kind of been the way they start at games they only have three offensive touchdowns in the first quarter in the last five game so I don't know if it's just a matter of getting Cardale Jones in the offense and rhythm or they're getting comfortable maybe these defenses each week give them some looks that they're not quite expecting because of Ohio State's firepower whatever it is they have been starting very very slow most of the year it's really a home run offense isn't it lot see how productive play is enough game 50 60 70 yards for a touchdown on the pop pass Braxton Miller is smothered in the backfield tries to escape make something of it but still loses five yards well how about Barney this time to Rome Barney number 91 he's gonna come right here he's just gonna shoot a gap does a really good job of shooting right through there there's a miscommunication and Ohio state makes a mistake they have great field position and Penn State's defensive line I'm telling you right now early in this game they are setting a tone it's a line of scrimmage they've got depth there it's the best position group on the team Barney's a backup Jones rifled and batted down this defensive line again does a terrific job that was Austin Johnson the junior from new jersey you got a hand up yeah NASA gets most of the attention with Zito but Johnson is a force on the inside but Chris he brought up a great point and it's something you see from a lot of great defensive lines they rotate a lot of bodies they'll rotate as many as 9 or 10 and the reason they want to do that against these tempo teams is they want to stay fresh they want to keep the defensive line fresh and in this and this this arrow James Franklin inheriting this roster the one spot they did have some depth the defensive line so it's 1316 the Lions rushed only three Jones's watched out flips at far side complete to Elliott but he's far short of a first down see if they consider going for it here they're right in that area walking down taking a peek see were exactly where he is a neat 9 yards they don't really have Jack Willoughby or the distance field goal pedigrees he's missed a few over 40 Thursday in practice he made one 457 so you know I think they they're confident his leg strength there's the leg that he has but it's also a little bit of a game a field position here early so you can mix makes sense why they would bring the punter out Cameron Johnson on for the third time so they pass up of would have been about a 52yard attempt cutter once again in the Lion Steve Johnson is so good at this tremendously accurate punter I mean that's just that's not an accident don't tell him aim the ball the 8 yard line bounce it there and we'll cover it and the sauce he could do that you know it it's amazing you watched so many games on a Saturday there's somebody punters and kick it through the end zone seems pretty simple when you watch him do that that convert pin back again the Lions still up by a field goal by Kitty Mitchell camp Johnson the 8 yard line our guys we get down there get behind the ball let's see how close he gets to that 8 yard line Oh seven and a half Bryce Hanes the long set for Kim down and covered it but so far the punter is the the best executor on the Ohio State team by far yeah Mike black who is our expert spotter but the kicker and punter expert says he's one of the best partners in the country we've seen him down the last couple years doing those sales so against take one Berkeley to the white American burg they handed to the true freshman Hicks a quick cut Emily is either fastest back he's also their most physical at about 225 pounds but the Buckeyes will be all over him tonight State has been packed up now deep in their own territory the last couple drives the last Drive starting at their own eight Ohio State a great field position but unable to do anything with it now starting this Drive of course at their own three yard line in a game where you're going the way you want it to go you cannot allow bad field position and then to make them the state deep narrow territory to affect the not just that the outcome but also the momentum of this game Berkeley shows you his skills he's about a yard short of the first down but what they love about it Kirk is with a struggling online this guy can get more than the play was really blocked for well he he can make people miss you see the great backs in college football watch the safety top right come down boom you see that little move right there that little stutter step the jump cut the great backs do that they have to make that safety right there miss and pick up another five or ten yards neither team has yet converted a third down play the one my formation Buckeyes crowd the middle we're expecting and run right up the gut we get it Buckley's spins and you can see the strength of this young back he does move the chains for Penn State out to the 17 you know I think there was a quarterback sneak called originally because of how tight the splits were and the Ohio State defensive line saw those tight splits they're anticipating so look at the quarterback Hackenberg he sees that and look at the room to the outside he decides to bounce it outside away from where all the defensive linemen wore that is great recognition by a quarterback and experience at Hackenberg now has as a junior CY Barkley is the feature back at this offense even though he's a true freshman that converts straight back to first and rote takes his first downfield shot Godwin is tackled and here come the flags so already he's gotten deep on the Buckeyes at that time Conley just got tangled up with him it'll be past interference he got behind him and once he got behind him Conley was trying to play catchup and got physical pass interference defense number eight 15yard penalty Godwin is probably the more the most physical just a tough wide receiver had a great bowl game Krista game I think you called he gets downfield he actually gets behind Connelly and Connelly as he's trying to play catch up his hands and not only the feet but the hands got physical up at the chest and brought God went down and an easy call for the officials all of a sudden they go from being back at their own three now they're out outside of their own 30 yard line he does but he'd be the first one to tell you he needs to be able to become much more accurate as a thrower only completing 53% of his passes coming into the night they fake it to Berkeley and that is it relatively easy throw but Deshawn Hamilton had no chance and when you look at him and you talk to his coaches is he throwing off his back foot is he is he offbalance what is it they said you know we're just trying to make sure his footwork is is is locked in and he's stepping to his target but you know you look at it he's more often than not what he misses it's over the receivers head after the play was over unsportsmanlike conduct defense number 11 Wow van caper and our referee indicating that von belt juniors safety guilty of unsportsmanlike after the play that's the emotions the game you have to be able to control von Belle as a junior he's played in a lot of big games I think he was taunting the Penn State sideline after the play after that ball sailed over top of the wide receiver Hamilton he had some words for some of the Penn State players or coaches and here's an official right there and he threw the flag on Bourbon we'll have some words for him oh yes back to the sign oh yeah lose the ball near midfield take it to poke in that jet sweet motion Berkeley with a stiff arm bounces it outside poke blocking forth and he picks up ten more and the Lions are marching well that is a heck of a run here by Barkley here's the end of that play here's 11 right here pop out it continues on he keeps going over to that sideline and continues on even a little bit more that's what the call was but now that Penn State has the ball Chris we're starting to see what these coaches are talking about was safe Juan Barkley there is a different gear with him in the lineup coming off an ankle they held him out of last week but he doesn't look right now that he's infected at all and slowed down at all by that ankle they spot him with the key Lynch who also returns for Matt tonight Hackenberg who steps away by the time I get sick II was wide open and backpedaling couldn't hold it they take a shot and it's still only 31 Hackenberg does a great job is stepping up into the pocket to buy a little bit more time but he has his eyes down feel the entire time to see Kazuki who gets behind there in lead and I hope he's thinking about gonna catch his ball and turn on field but he has to secure the ball you know pink states had a lot of drops this year and that's a big one right there that could end up being costly because now it's a third down they missed a hold on it off his Washington it was passed where she kept time so now Nick Scott is in the slot empty backfield on third and one play clock at three and the time running down Lions call time yeah James James Franklin sprinting down to make sure they got that time out with your Taco Bell studio update Florida and LSU Brandon Harris put it on a show here with the get off me to the defense and says a bullet to Malachi Dupre second time those two linked up for net also has two TDs LSU up 2814 this game on ESPN if you posit a meant game of course the first for the Gators about two suspended will career the road penn state now after the timeout needs a guard here on third down got Berkeley back in the game you got a quick grasp and use their best short yardage back it's been a real area of weakness for Penn State with Berkeley out of the lineup but he makes a difference it catch him touchdown Penn State but a flag is down so hold on a second but Berkeley took off got the corner this one may come back it's the right guard Brian Gaia his goals will call back the touchdown run Sam coming right here right in front of you right there he's actually locked up with a linebacker Booker who is in preparing and you know even if he doesn't hold on there that cut was so sharp that Berkeley is again we're starting with PC for a young player in this environment special qualities from this young back he's only played about three and a half games so that's the truth person misses two and a half games goes and faces this defense and in this environment and is sharp from the start yeah it is rare think about wasn't last I start to think about this after was the last great Penn State Bank I mean great pity Larry Johnson back at OU to another timeout by the head coach James Franklin he is but he's he's frustrated that they didn't get that play off a crucial third and eight play that Finley moved them back to their own forty nine this is really where Penn State needs to show some poise they had a chance to go up ten obviously a penalty brings it back they're distraught they're frustrated but they can't they have to shake that forget about it and move on now and try to finish his drive off that hold was pretty clearcut but Franklin had to see that it was beer at her sideline or pinch date night say whatever you want this team has come in with a great deal of boys with an offense you know they've come into this environment all the talk about the offensive line and they've given up a lot of sacks the last couple years they look really confident plant with he's only here in this game Heather mentioned freaky that was going to be the big challenge that was the but that doesn't prepare them for this I understand he would not have expected this old line to play this well early Scott and Hulk are in the backfield on third and 8 now it's almost 8:00 that's gonna spend the time out to think about their play faggins her to me this is gonna be a heck of a third down play the suspense is building here it sure is now Kirk it was a it was an eventful day we showed you that incredible incredible bobbled punt Sparty meeting the Wolverines in the last play Alabama went to College Station and won by 18 the Alabama team has been able to definitely bounce back after loss early in the year Oklahoma boy they looked impressive after loss last week to Texas and all of a sudden you start to look at the Iowa Hawkeyes and their schedule they're going to be favored probably in every game that they have remaining coming out of the Big Ten West it was an impressive performance today by them in Evanston absolutely c.j pets it has brought a spark to that offense this year now the favourites out of the West would be big underdogs probably in the championship game against a member they face went a long way off though Scott and the tight end number 11 Brett Wilkerson in the backfield after all those timeout polluted to get cookin here on third and eight that convert pressured and sack for the first time as Joey Bosa beginning to heat up show some of that 2014 form the high estate defense Luke fickle Chris ash they always want to try to find oneonone opportunities for Joey Bosa and he gets that matched up right here against the right guard Brian Gaia and when you get it oneonone matchup you better hold on because ninety seven much like he did last year and overtime against Penn State it's either power or speed and he's coming right through you so gula punts it away it's a very short pick doesn't get a roll in the Lions will down at the 30 the holding penalty calls back Barclays 44 yard touchdown run him in a sack and the drive fizzles talked about all the great action today don't miss any of it every Saturday on the go with the watch ESPN app stream all these games live just downloaded Nevada watch espn.com boats only had a half a sack coming into last movie he gets the bear we've got his first full sack he's been getting closer the hurries but not getting home last year no and it's a lot of them because defense are all offenses now are accounting for him to chip it into double teaming and very rare ladies he hit a one point one opportunity what he does you see what happens see if this Buckeye offense can get going they pitched it to Elliot he Turtles into the secondary takes a big shot but gets up first down it was pray read her delivering the blow but Zeke does move to check has he mentioned that this week to some reporters that he had some experience running track running hurdles and he's kind of added that to his arsenal plays he's known as a power guy but he can elevate that time he feels like a lot of defenders especially in a secondary or trying to go low on him so he's going to over top of him they kept Elliot pretty well in check in last year's double overtime game he's got it again and they string it out Elliot not able to cut back there was excellent penetration by Garrett sickles one of the wild dogs it doesn't get much time he's also a fine defensive mom he's a great player he has now four tackles for a loss on the year you have Austin Johnson in the middle but he's out there in space and he's up up against Zeke Elliot and because of how Sutton and how quick he got off the ball his eyes were right on his key there's nothing as good as he Kelly it is there's nothing he could do get sickles at 6 for 260 the 1yard loss second and 11 in the back with the other way Jones was faking to air and then again another misfire rumbling a little bit all jaylen Marshall I think the back went the other way because he maybe he felt the penetration Zeke Elliott goes to the left here he actually is able to help out on a chip of Anthony's Ã«til but another thrown you can see a point after the throw from Cardale Jones he kind of pointed to jail and Marshall saying I was expecting you to slide to the outside which is again another route or the quarterback and the receiver are not on the same page Buckeyes have 17 yards passing the quarter so far meet 11 on this third down Lions drop 8 into coverage so Jones a have all day and now delivers complete for a first down that was Braxton Miller diving and the Buckeyes are at the 43 quarterback to receiver that's an example how far he has come he was he's proud on the left and that he sees his quarterback in trouble and he has to work all the way over to the right to eventually get away from the defender but that is a great job by Braxton Miller getting away from the defenders you see if they buzz down and take another look at this bill Simon's is the replay official site might have been Bob Lanier tsys under further review did the field at aid and his control of the ball did the ball move after it hit the ground that's what they'll look at here Dave katana what do you have his daughter is getting married Dave we sent our best we'd love to have him here to help us out let's see but you're right it's the ball touches the ground but does it help him as you say Chris and making the reception call the fielders and reception so those kind of three grabs the back of the ball the front and hits the ground and does move the NFL standard is supposed to be the same as the college standard they it seems that they're more conservative on Sundays about get on catches like that that last angle was a really good angle to see it would surprise him back does the ball move after it hits the ground up into the possession or up towards his body terrific effort as it wasn't an accurate throw after review the play stands as called on the field so instead of 4th and 11 of the Ohio save 40 it's a first hand of the Penn State 43 I think it's a little bit more of a liberal interpretation of that in college and NFL just my opinion so Miller really got more involved against Maryland last game after three very quiet games and I don't know if it's a no many they missed it out on his jersey these black out too early yet if they had it 1l now they've come back and added the L he's taking us in direct snap for Miller who gets around the edge and flashes the speed Miller still jerking and diving dad inside the 30 just elector quitting has the ball in his hands this is just an athlete making a play when he jumps in to the line of scrimmage as it comes off the the faith to Cardale Jones you can you can see right here right there he jumps in look at all the Penn State defenders and then he bounces it outside Mena that's that is just a special athlete who can pour the entire defense in and then jump out to the outside and accelerate away from the defense so there's a a chain that is broken on the far side that's where we'll have a brief pause zero fear Braxton comes out on these blackout jerseys and they had it and it hastily put him together and it was miler he's a sprinter he's on a miler but they had mi l ER their hoops someone caught it didn't find the extra L exactly chains are fixed in its first and final 30 seconds of the first quarter Jonas fakes it Elliot keeps himself hid behind the line so the Lions jump up there and tackle for loss by Curtis Katherine a thirdstring defensive into getting the depth for the Lions of them yes but I tell you what he does an incredible job of fighting off of a block that time from Billy price he just fought through it and ended up making the play four tackles for loss by Penn State in the first parade lead it by three now to your local ABC station is that and welcome back to Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo beginning of the second quarter Penn State need to get 3.not the Ohio say just 57 yards of offense in the first quarter and JC Barrett you net quarterback Kirk talked about this not quite the red zone de magellan struggling they bring in Barrett in on second and long from the 31 they hand it off to Elliott muscles forward for a short gain it'll be third and about 7 so JT nuzens excels as a runner a decisionmaker they really trust him in this part of the field what you pick up is the quarterback run game the true quarterback run game is threat of what he can do with a ball in his hands he's not quite a Braxton Miller but he's in legitimate threat he put his team on his back last year against Penn State over double overtime and ended up willing his team to a victory kind of heart and soul truly be up his football team sprained MCL somehow find a way one into the end zone late in overtime 37 there takes off that's why he's at the 14 yard line is pretty predictable but so tough to stop yeah you know that he's going to eventually have a chance that's just a quarterback counterplay you follow the right tackle chase Farris around got a good block from Michael Thomas his 57 lead away picks up a block on a linebacker Michael Thomas worked in there as well when fast and Elliott hands it up the middle breaks a tackle powers down to the five yard line at 16 it's almost a running back it opens up more running lanes brilliant Zeek Elliot just a different tempo when JT parrots in the game it's a French tempo right now lions back sit on defense and Barrett just walks in the end zone specialist strikes quickly guys mark 70 yards in 10 places to take the lead that is Urban Meyer's offense I think there are a lot of people literally estate fans that don't really understand why JT Barrett doesn't play quarterback the entire game why is he just a red zone specialist you can just feel at different energy when he comes into the game that was a zone read he'd read it perfectly walks into the end zone Willoughby senior graduate transfer from Duke Knox through the extra point so Barrett provides a spark immediately we'll see what the quarterback plan is going forward watch the defensive end collapse down on Zeke le a great read the defense is lost and it's just a different gear when JT Barrett and that zone Reed comes into the game JC Barrett 5 yard touchdown run as a redshirt freshman you may recall threw for 34 touchdowns rams for 11 and about 11 and a half games before he broke his ankle in his Michigan sup the guys pre complete quarterback he's had to adapt to this kind of situational role of so far this season he's a captain as a sophomore in 45 touchdowns you just talked about Chris goes down the line he's talking to guys whether he's on the field or not he is again the hard to slow on his team he will become history history of this school to be a threetime captain I think that says it all about JT knocked down short of the 15 as the Lions go to work down by four we check in with Cassidy Hubbard Chris let's take a look at who's getting the dump sent by Wells Fargo and the Trojans get into a bit of a surprise party Jalen green and juju Smith Schuster some trick for a sheen here USC tact out another TD sense and clay Helton sponge tied up at 24 with Notre Dame Chris Harvey back to you thank you very much and say had to feel really good about things until that last Ohio State into a hostile environment they weather the initial storm that terrible field position of game so far hanging around damn for Berkeley and the tailback in the I formation he's got it who's the pile forward for a couple there Raekwon Macmillan our leading tackler on the defense made the stop miss Ohio State defense right now Josh Perry out of the game Dante Booker as you said Chris this sophomore from Akron is in he's played some football in these first six games coming in to this game so he does have some game reps but the leader is number five right there in the middle when Penn State runs the ball Raekwon McMillan who's a sophomore himself and of course Darren Lee have got to be able to make plays if they want to slow down Penn State's run again just a true this finds the ball so instinct' it doesn't miss tackles Barkley though gets away has dropped down a couple hearts short of the first ten and we've got a couple of tailbacks who are telling hurdlers no doubt that time time his pal went low because he's starting to respect Berkeley in his physicality and he goes lump it over I mean he really gotten up in two years six three safety knew he was bending down but that is Lions will trap the convert and what's been a problem area with 26 out of the line if they were they were really struggling in this department we'll see if he can make a difference again tighten in the backfield got there very quickly and then Busiek cleaned it up then penn state must punt it's a great call by Luke fickle and Chris ash they bring the corner blitz from the boundary to get an extra defender into the box to be able to help out and be able to make a play catches he timed it up perfectly completely catch his Hackenberg offguard and especially the running back Berkeley a great job by the coaches and a good job by Conley a timing that and disguising it just in time versus having an excellent first half building on it was his best game of the season he gets Maryland last week Lulla on the planet applying a false start by the Lions will back him up five more false start offense number one fiveyard penalty still forked out he's all turn when that barkley touchdown run was called back on a hold a good call but Penn State has has lost the early momentum and now has to be be careful his Marshall set up at his 45 in a position to really get the Buckeyes great field position again the side of goolies foot and it's not a very good punt and Ohio State will start in plus territory Joseph had a sack earlier now a tackle for loss to stop this Penn State Drive Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo wrote you by Cadillac dr. pepper dr. pepper and college football it's a oneofakind tradition and the home depot more saving more doing that's the power of the Home Depot their previous drive what guys got more yards in they had to up to that point granite seven of the ten plays converted to throw tin Long's and now after a 32yard shank Buckeyes set up with a Penn State 45 it is Jones still at quarterback for now Pernell is five for ten but only for 34 yards hasn't a chance to show that big arm and connect downfield yet see if they take a shot I'm show some pressure breaks a tackle sickles drags him down but a nice first down gain of seven it's a nice job by Ohio State's offensive line see Kelly doesn't need a lot of room physical back runs through arm tackles that time though had some room to work with just a great blend of size low center gravity great balance and a great acceleration as well about what a home run offense Ohio State is they've lived with the big plays and Jones tries to creep one of the far side Thomas with his first catch on the sidelines first down at the 30 yard line it really hasn't been an offense that for the most part as executed methodically it's been a huge chunk plays few times Cardale Jones take what the defense gives him and he checks out of the game and now Braxton Miller not JT Barrett takes the snap to quarterback Miller of course who quarterback wanna say a couple victories over Penn State had monster games against the Lions as a freshman and a sophomore so so far three quarterbacks for Ohio State Marshall in motion Miller is running all the way Braxton Miller gets the edge another big first down Trevor Williams stopped in but it's eight more the running quarterback when it affects the numbers and it also affects the eyes even when as you said you know it's coming you know that he's there's a good chance he's going to end up with a ball in his hands he just out runs you you've got a defensive lineman there you've got many Bowen who was a freshman linebacker there and I think sometimes until you see him in person you just don't realize how quick he gets to the corner here's tricky he rose and Jones was under center then he shuffled out of here and they direct snap it to Braxton who breaks tackles again it gets down to the ten so that's a wrinkle we really have he's scheming up that would have been funny to see him dish that out to the car Coachella let's see what he does well the big lead blocker as sure as he attempted he attempted now get Barrett Rivers seeing three quarterbacks in three consecutive plays in his hands it's a he takes the long a short but adventurous touchdown for the Ohio State offense a little bit of everything as far as a quarterback position but seek Eliot boy that that is a very kind of symbolic of who he is as a fact the speed to be able to get outside and in some house able to navigate his way and run it through some tackles to get into the endzone eleventh rushing touchdown this year for Elliott he could close in on a thousand yards with a big night tonight see already rushing for 42 yards look at the white jerseys the habit bottled up right there you get three white jerseys right there he outruns them and then he's able to use a block that time by Michael Thomas and kind of uses it a shield to get into the end zone but guys building the lead now a 143 later on ESPN's got to get when the Sun Devils of the Utes and then Sports Center follow that game to recap their wacky day in college football SportsCenter at night later on ESPN and the watch ESPN app but guys up 14 three now is short 45yard touchdown drive after the shank punt Elliott the touchdown on Penn State's defense tall with good things they've done this year red zone defense give it up now ten touchdowns in only 13 red zone trips that keep you out of there pretty well but but guys continuing this is Pope the freshman gets the Erickson Brandon cult the fastest guy at Penn State's team and see what they tried to get him touch is pretty nice return the bear Chris FeliCa our longtime Research H down on the truck with her Affleck for be a question for this evening hello bear hello there a little eye history trivia talk to you guys as it relates tonight situation I don't know one the last time an unranked Penn State one on the road unranked as they are tonight okay last ten years you're asking for him okay wasn't wasn't perchance where we're standing right now was it Berkeley takes off and quick bursts in the Ohio State Territory a stiff arm of Apple at the end of the run but you can see the acceleration of this big guy yeah watch the block right here by the tight end Wilkerson it kind of sets the edge here to be able to get to the outside does a nice job there there's just nobody left Ohio State in man coverage so you saw Eli Apple just follow the other tied in Lisicki there's just nobody out there on that edge that's where you use a formation to get players out of position and then you go back to the other way nice call by Penn State 49 yards rushing already for Berkeley and his return to the lineup game he's got it again he's got another little crease all of a sudden the offensive line looks a lot better with number 26 back in the lineup okay absolutely he again we've talked all night about it he definitely has a different feel hioh State that time brought this corner blitz this time you see him coming right here and once he's able to shoot through there good recognition by the left tackle Palmer and that he's able to get underneath that and again you're seeing some similarities between Zeek Elliot true freshman Berkeley where they have some power but also not sadness to go with she runs the game 37 yards was coming up in the jet sweep motion the snap just bounced right off of him he collected the lucky bounce you come in jet sweep how many times do you see it when you watch a college game how close these guys coming in to jet sweep and motion come to the ball hitting him her this time and hit him right in the chest very very fortunate for Penn State that pulp does a good job of being aware of where that ball was it happened to be right in front of it and he pounces on top of it Darrin thing was post five it folks the guy with great hands or he probably doesn't get elect that ball yeah still though Penn State behind the chains now on second and 14 this will be a test of the old line what guys figurative bring some heat they come pressure off the edge Hackenberg throws to Goblin on the far side they got the ball out quickly but a short gain condley stopped him it's interesting the Hackenberg decided to do that because that wasn't the runpass option that we see every week where you're looking at what you see on the inside towards the defensive box area and you're counting numbers how many have committed to stop all running game first happened here outside he fell he wanted to throw it but by throwing it into the boundary Ohio State had three defenders very short game to set up to start long Lyons is one of five aaanthor gunmen very poor this situation so far this year Hackenberg book that he wanted to screen he's got a lot of and you get a block on the edge now he's going to be brought down at the 30 yard line by a Eli Apple couldn't quite get the block he needed so it's worked out he's actually targeting Deshawn Hamilton who's a slop receiver number five on that plate trying to go after Vaughn bailbond Bell had pretty good coverage and you're gonna see Hackenberg here on fourth down they're gonna go for it but Ohio State playing man his feet have got to become a factor and tried to pick up first downs and gets man coverage surely an Apple did a good job to get off the block Lions just 207 on fourth down this year Lake it three they're gonna have to take a timeout sprinting down the sidelines again tonight we'll spend a timeout that might have been about a four 740s he showed some great quickness here when it's gonna be fourth and 13 if you're not quick yeah you're not gonna turn on the Jets he turned it on there they've used all their timeouts but you have your you're a big underdog on the road the momentum is shifting against she knows the importance of trying to trying to make this here keep an eye on there he comes off with the screen yeah no way like a bird veteran didn't didn't notice the play clock winding down well I think he saw a formation he had three receivers to the bottom and only to Ohio State defenders I think he was so locked in on the coverage that the play clock got away from him and James Franklin there to bail him out would he call here coach you don't have one tie down Kyle Carter he's been left home today is sick he had a drop earlier I think the Ohio State corners are pretty tough to beat because of their length and their speed I'm looking into the interior I'm trying to find a linebacker or a safety for a nickel back in mantoman coverage and I'm trying to go after him dials up some pressure for this Buckeye front we've got six guys crowding the line it's in the game that the quarterbacks left it bring pressure Hackenberg steps up thought about warning wasn't going to make it up fourth down Chris Worley makes the stop an Ohio State takes over that is really really good coverage here by Ohio State Hackenberg limping off the field with that that is not a good sign for Penn State great defense by Ohio State they they were aware that he may try to take off that time time his POW is right there to be able to take him away and force the sack by Ohio State one of the tougher quarterbacks in the country Christian Hackenberg has never missed a play according to injury that's what Penn State tells us he's been hit as much as anybody in the country who's not an option quarterback looking at that knee over there after the sack 86 sacks in his career yeah it says huh not to mention knockdowns and do what he does picks up nine on first down this Penn State defensive line that in that first quarter talked about how they set the tone was a good look at active birth looks like spring but you know we talked about Penn State's defense alive just setting setting it toned and playing with an aggressive attitude and getting up field and bio state after their touchdown they seem to be able to settle down upfront Miller in the slot to the right of Jones second and one and take the safe route is running Z up the middle first and into Penn State Territory Marcus Allen knocked down this is in the first quarter Ohio State's running a lot of these same plays and they're running into a wall they were in fact by the time Zeke Elliott might get his hands on the ball there's at the Penn State defensive lineman right in his face I think it says a lot about the brains of the Ohio State offense we course know about Urban Meyer but ed Warner Tim Beck these guys are trying to find some ways to use different formations different personnel groupings and all sudden you get different blocking angles and you can spring free the running backs T Kelly Miller in motion they popped the ball two on Braxton Miller gets the edge dances out of the tackle is hit out of bounds about the 25yard line get the man touches he will get you yards he has great speed but I think the thing that stands out to me here is this guy right here watch this block on Brendan bell that's the block and that you have a great block by Michael Thomas that's why you get a big game of course a nice run great speed by Braxton Miller but an outstanding job of setting that up by the blocks you step down rumbling into the redzone the Penn State defense is getting chewed up right now he boy he did a good chop Marcus Allen his safety came down he was right there to make the play for about a two or three yard gain spin moves away from him and then picks up the first down number two in the background there he's right there to make the play who spin move right around him accelerate downfield another first down Barrett in the game filling this red zone roll Elliott runs 9 9 and 15 on this drive so far to consume again it's just a punishing ground game and all the moving pieces at this Ohio State offense now coming into play yeah and it's when you throw in JT Barrett or Braxton Miller at quarterback it's such a different feel because of the quarterback threat of running that is a defense you have five or six days to get your guys dialed in and you better spend a lot of time on quarterback run with this quarterback in there are you gonna have some missed assignments that really struggled in the red zone for a lot of this year I think they got it fixed and they're settling in here looks like a little bit offensively three for three touchdowns in the red zone against the Penn State defense that is struggled in that department 66 yards and six plays he was Elliot getting him into the red zone and Barrett once again finding the endzone and again this is just vintage Urban Meyer offense whether it's Bowling Green Utah Florida or Ohio State when they get into the red zone you better be ready to deal with Katie Barrett Zeke Elliott and the zone read and I'll tell you JT Barrett reads this about as well as anybody here's who he's looking at right here he's going to collapse down and he rides this long enough with Zeke Elliott so he decides right there because this defender takes away his running back now look at the lane right there he's got some blocks gets picks up a great block by Baudette who's had a great night tonight and also the offense alive and getting downfield up to the linebackers but it starts with the read and it happens quickly but he stays long enough on the ride this is a great look at it watching eyes on the defensive end he collapses comes down takes him away pulls the ball out we talked about how much this is to prepare for a defense I said of offense to work on the passing game of Cardale Jones the zone read stuff with Braxton Miller JT Barrett he only hope you do enough during the week to be ready to go interesting role for bear who had three touchdown runs against Maryland is settle into this I mean clearly he would love to be the starter he'd love to be the guy running the show in all parts of the field not just the red zone to see how this evolves because he has been very sharp and efficient tonight blinds had given up 14 points in the second quarter all season come again why outside scored 21 in the second quarter not down at the 23 all right bear give us the answer to the Aflac trivia question Penn State's last win is an unranked team on the road against the top 10 team you are on to something asking if it was right here and easy nothing indeed it was it was making 64:27 nothing over at number 2 ohio state 3 and for penn state say chris is referring to 1978 arts leashed are making his first career start i was right up there and see dad down I was watching not in 1964 he was down in Miami Ohio but in 1978 our teachers first start five interceptions against that was one of your earlier memories of football again painful one I viewed that game differently as a young beep bark thing again he's been the best part of this Penn State offense so the talented freshman continues to churn out yard to get to the Buckeyes out to the 44 Heather Chris you can see Christian Hackenberg as he gets back to the line of scrimmage is definitely limping Penn State does not give out injure information what I can tell you is that I saw he had a big gash on his right knee the medical staff attended to that blood it almost looks like it came from the knee brace on his left knee so obviously back in but continues to learn through Penn State he's got a very high pain threshold I mentioned that he's been able to stay in there despite getting hit again and he and again at his career but he'd love it at Berkeley could carry the load of his drive to Penn State they fake it to him he fires near side of the caches made bite they shot Hamilton it was the top receiver a year ago quieter numbers so far this season for number five yeah last year 82 receptions on close to 900 yards in the year they put the addition of Godwin late in the game that you called against Boston College in the bowl game it count is carried over into this year and I think that's the area with James Franklin and recruiting that's where you're going to start to see them really go to another level as far as they need more speed and more playmakers out at wide receiver to go along with a guy like Berkeley in Bolton cut passes last year against the Buckeyes for 126 yards the time it's Bosa all over Berkeley no gain it'll be third down again where Joey foe so when he is left alone tonight he is having a field day and he just has such a couldn't feel he got underneath andrew nelson that time the right tackle let's keep an eye on him right here let's see if they use it tie it in or right they're going to use it back to try to help him out Joey go sit down moving from the left hand going up to the top now he's all the way up here at the right side look out they better get hair the left tackle he struggled this year some help boss is going to hit the quarterback again airmail ball incomplete it was tight want Lewis from the other side deliberating the pressure Hackenberg limping off its fourth and five watch tips hidden throw the ball and his followthrough is a concern I don't know what he's dealing with from an injury standpoint there's no pressure as far as the injury but he comes off and just something is not right I know that the knee but he almost looked like he was holding his back there too I'm thinking it change it at punter by the way Manuel Carrillo is in there goula is not punted well tonight left footed Ozzie boots it hi nice job is that Penn State coverage team knocks it down at the three perky reference that 1978 Lions shutout here in the shoe it's Ron Gerald right there Matt Millen is out there somewhere right make it close this was a a huge win for Penn State at the time of course suck it like wait three big tent nonconference game here old are had a tough one we were very different mental mindsets about games you watch said crazy to see those old uniforms from that era it makes some Ohio State fans crazy when they come out in the the new look allblack that at the conservative faction does not enjoy seeing them in the All Blacks players like it it's one and done though right yeah in state trying to get their offense to ball back only a minute five to go before halftime they don't have any timeouts Oh Buckeyes are gonna is gonna chew clocking and go to the locker room up by 18 BMW a halftime report John Saunders mark de Mac Brant in the studio move their thoughts on this one pilots will be interesting not just arrested tonight but the rest of the season with JT Barrett who's in now is he gonna get more and more and more of an opportunity or is he just going to be the red zone short yardage guy because the tempo the rhythm the execution just feels much like a year ago and sometimes it's Cardale Jones it feels like the offense is kind of stuck in second or third gear Eliot Russell damn whenever he's got the ball you can't take for granted they're running out the clock this is a guy capable of going the distance Lyons picked the field goal and a touchdown run called back in then Ohio State got the offense rolling in the second quarter three red zone touchdowns it's 213 net the break in Columbus VFW halftime report Heather Cox will speak with Urban Meyer right after this timeout welcome to the BMW halftime report well you've got a couple of great quarterbacks using both JT bear keeps this one and goes in as a result Urban Meyer hurry happy with his first half he spoke with our Heather Cox coach how would you say that your quarterback system really influenced red zone efficiency oh it's been really good you know we just got to get some passing yards we started so damn slow but I like the way they played that second quarter outside of the red zone how would you assess your offensive performance Oh to start the first two or three series awful but the last last two or three series scored three touchdowns so we're gonna make some good adjustments to get going urban thanks for your time John Saunders alongside of Mack Brown and Mark man I think we all agree that's about as good as we've seen Ohio State look this year in the first half for sure I also thought open had a smile for a change at halftime he said they started slow but it wasn't that slow 21 3 is pretty good first half I think it's the red tie that's making him I'm not shy of talking about the often stick look I know it's a brown suit Michigan State that Goodson Michigan it was an incredible game an incredible finish one that you may not believe if you haven't seen it Michigan with the big guys up front and see own a home on takes it in for a touchdown Michigan's up 7 nothing in short yardage and goal line it's all about attitude and pad level and in that play Michigan had both Connor cook calls his own number go sliding in now Joe Bouldin gets called for targeting guys you didn't like this call it was really unfair to Joe it looks like he's pushed into the play number 1 if he has to get a personal foul yes don't kick him out for targeting now he has to miss next week and has to go off the bill unfair Connor cook meanwhile he was fine and he goes deep to RJ Shelton now at first they say this is no catch mark I didn't think it was a catch but then they looked at it again and they reviewed it and they got the right call he didn't make the cut you got his foot in as a result to keep moving the football and cooked pumps it once and goes to McGarrett Kings Junior and it's a touchdown Connor cook played really well today three and no against Michigan cook avoiding the pressure this time throws it up it's incomplete and it looks like Jim Harbaugh is going to walk off with a victory in his first meeting with those you can stay ten seconds to go all they have to do to putt the ball and the game was over but Blake O'Neal can't handle it pops up to jail and watch Jackson and just like that the game turns the other direction Michigan State has the victory only that how about them being alert on this play knowing what to do and that ball is out there getting the end zone the blockers getting down field coach on special teams to make blocks allowing him to get to the end zone I thought this is a very headsup play by the Spartans yes and young Blake O'Neill who had an 80 yard punt earlier just took his eyes off the low punt and ended up fumbling the ball all he had to do was fall on the ball and Jim Harbaugh would have had a victory both coaches stunned in different directions felt like the best decision was to punt it and told him to catch it upon it there's they didn't have anybody back when they lined up to the punt they didn't have any any returners just a matter of catching it and punting it and I messed it up we just came in here was something that we felt like we had to prove and I don't know you know I guess we weren't on a crazy play but we played hard with conviction and that's what I asked our guys to do what's this win mean for your program hey we're sailing or no we advance that's what it means that's that's in the big picture our dreams are still alive Michigan State's dreams are still alive Michigan's dreams right now obviously having a great season but crushed because except for the final ten seconds and when the clocks had triple zeros on him was the first time Michigan State had the lead in this game mark and this was a battle of special teams that Michigan won the entire day long Michigan State did not give up in this football game that's one thing you can say about Mark Dantonio screw they fought every single play until the last play of the game and it's a great learning lesson it is a great learning lesson and he's a tremendous football coach and that's the way his team's play but what a great game for the state of Michigan for the Big Ten and for college football this is what we need Jim Harbaugh coming back making Michigan competitive again at one of the highest levels that you can play like today it was a great football game good for everybody I feel bad for that young man yeah I feel bad for a man fans leave him alone alright anybody who's gonna go out there and bother this young man leave him alone all right he had a great kick earlier in the game and mistakes happen these kids are human but what a game unbelievable meanwhile there is a terrific game going on on ESPN right now Florida came in their starting quarterback career knocked out by himself rather for the season because of using advanced sub get ready for the second half 21 three the first three ohio state possessions ended in punts the next three admitted into touchdowns DSW bringing you the halftime stats penn state as you might expect on the road struggling on third down ohio state excelling in the red zone continue a pattern the last couple of games kirk they had not been good at all in that department but who the creative three quarterback system doing Braxton Miller they're getting it done tonight well I think their offense has kind of been in their trademark this year start a little bit slow but give them credit they've made some adjustments got their offense going as you said in their last three drives and if you're Penn State you deferred you get the ball to start the second half we'll keep an eye on very close eye on Christian Hackenberg and his health we could see it into the first half he went down it was a little bit ginger on that knee and just watching him already coming out here to get ready for the second half he's still being looked at by the medical staff so not a lot of not a lot of big plays in that off in that first half for their offense and if they're going to get back into the game they need some big plays from Hackenberg and a pass game Brandon Polk trying to create a big play on the special teams but knocked down at the 23 yard line a Pacific Life game summary so far yeah we've talked now it's been six now the last six games they only have three offensive touchdowns and they started a little bit slow but didn't they were able to make some adjustments and really got seat he's been the key he's averaging about five yards of carrying 78 yards and the dip flat when they got into the red zone give them credit they did not mess around JT Barrett's been very very involved in that area they had three touchdowns now he's read both his own reads and both times read it correctly four touchdowns touchdown runs were ten and thirteen yards by Barrett sandwiched around Elliott's touchdown run sake want Berkeley was the bright spot for Penn State's offense in the first half but Hackenberg taking a down field shot into Concord to the down near the 20yard line the second big play for the sophomore receiver we just said that if they're going to get back into this game they're going to have to make some big plays in a pass game there's a lot of oneonone opportunities with the style of defense at Ohio State plays Eli Apple's out there on an island he's a very very talented corner on that particular play doesn't find the football than a great adjustment by Godwin 56 yards they feed Berkeley who's got the edge to the crease sake one Berkeley down inside the tent it'll be first and goal remarkable catch a little veteran move to kind of shove off with just a great effort and determination to come back to an under thrown ball to get this half started the right way for the Lions and then they come right back they've had a lot of success with Berkeley getting to the edge he picks up a nice block by 73 Palmer gets him bounces into the outside that's about the third time we've seen Berkeley untouched accelerating downfield to the outside and first and goal that convert fires nearside Hamilton escapes briefly and dances down dives for the pylon but if he marks hesitation on the signal they'll check this but good effort by Hamilton the one thing was gonna get penned in there it's another one of those plays where the offensive line in the running back they're running a run play but give Hackenberg credit he sees a matchup that he wants that's the key right there is to be able to shake off the man and the man coverage of his Vaughn Bell then he goes airborne and I think he did get in his foot stayed inbounds Prince he goes up into the air and gets to the pylon for this touchdown but he got off of on bail which was the most important play most important aspect of the play but Feder in airborne gets to the pylon touchdown for Penn State Deshawn Hamilton the 510 sophomore Fredericksburg Virginia mentioned when a big year he had last year and a monster game against Ohio State it's an acrobatic move for people that thought well it's 21 to 3 Ohio State scored three straight possessions Penn State's in trouble that's the way of the review ruling on the field is confirmed touchdown that's the way you want to start a second half when you're down by 18 a similar position they found themselves a year ago to Ohio State three plays 78 yards less than a minute and they're in the endzone for a touchdown no doubt James Franklin talked to his team Kirk at the break about that comeback from 17 nothing down at home would be to be a lot tougher assignment here on the road tonight but who said it and they've put into the lead by seven points Joey Julius max if there was a flag on the extra points I hold on a second and for a quarterback who is still sort of limping around that there Hackenberg once again showing his guts penalty is gonna be on Ohio State and decline so the p80 is good yeah he looks like he's almost almost playing with one leg out there but give him a lot of credit the way you talked about gritty guy guy has been beaten up throughout his career but this is what really got it started this is the end of it the touchdown the effort by Hamilton he's able to shake Vaughn Bell and that was recognition by the way of Hackenberg again he saw that the Ohio State defense was lined too much stopping the run flips it outside but when you flip it outside you need a receiver to make a play and that's exactly what Hamilton did they're getting away again from Vaughn Bell who is an excellent tackler not easy to get away from the grasp of number 11 but Hamilton doesn't miss second or third touchdown of the season 82 receptions he led the conference a year ago as a freshman almost a thousand yards mentioned with the success of Godwin the allaround ability we've already seen tonight for number 12 Hamilton hasn't been the featured receiver but still very capable godwyn Hamilton throwing Brandon pulp the true freshman Gino Lewis has some ability young skillful name oh yeah youngest team of the big tent when you add up all the freshmen and sophomores that are playing they don't have a lot of seniors and juniors that are out there contributing so very young guys at the skill positions for a Penn State Cassady Hubbard with an update all right Chris we got some Mad Hatter magic we've seen this before a fake field goal pitch to trick domain 16 yards for the touchdown LSU up 35 28 over on ESPN Chris hurry back you still a long way to go and it's a pretty good football interesting to see in the second half Saints quarterback usages Cardale Jones starting the second half as he did the first of course but this offense has been way more efficient crisper execution with Barrett and quarterbacks so far Eliott hammers forward Jones's 7 for 12 only for 59 yards hasn't unleashed the downfield army at Barrett mentally running the ball that is but I think Elliot's been more effective when he's been to quarterback yeah the whole reason is the quarterback run aspect if I'm with defender I'm a linebacker on the safety and you have JT Barrett back there Manik my mindset changes comparative Cardale Jones is back there photo Jones is back there I'm locked in on Zeke Kelly at the running game and then worrying about the past Elliott's in motion collects the pass scene and gets it first down before sickles can knock him down at the 35 you have to be a lot more creative as a play caller if your temp back in ed Warner and Urban Meyer for Ohio State when it comes to getting Zeke Elliott involved with Cardale Jones without fit the legitimate threat of a consistent deep passing game for Jones where last year devin Smith when he played those last three games that was a heck of a combination with Zeke Elliott they're not doing that this year Elliott Schwartz first down game there's been a shift that it's difficult to actually figure out specifically how it's changed with the play calling Tim back and Ed Warner Co offensive coordinators Warner's the offensive line coach on the field he was really the principal play caller at the beginning of the season now it seems as that shifted and back as the the voice to the signalers from the press box quarterback coach action Jem's thought about looking downfield now must throw it away as he was chased very quickly by Brandon Belt an Jordan Lucas the safety I think Penn State they're gonna have to take some chances and remember early in this game they were blitzing they were confident they're taking chances and I think when you see Cardale Jones back there because the lack of mobility you're willing to take a few chances in that time they brought a couple linebackers and got pressure they got penetration got pressure forced an errant pass there's been some collisions down there in the pit look at the black paint that's come off of the Ohio State helmets onto the helmet they're all nassif haven't called his name tonight he's got ten sacks on the season number 95 now whistle they did not now that everybody might have to spend one timeout Ohio State their first what's going through cartels mind he he has the unbelievable run of a lifetime to go to a national championship and the wins the competition to be the starter but I know he hasn't performed his standard but he has to be careful of it's starting to press he is when you press say you force issue sometimes that could even backfire on you you think the guys in the flip good year providing aerial coverage kick off your dry with tires that return superior performance Goodyear more driven our official hero provider on Saturday Night Football after the timeout call by Urban Meyer buckeyes set up here third and six Eliott in motion they look back nearside catch made Thomas often running into the secondary first down and the left more to the Lions 40yard line Penn State deciding to bring linebacker pressure and really good time to call this for Ohio State watch the pressure come right here and there's nobody left right here big thing here for Cardale Jones get the ball out of your hands once he gets it out of his hand there's a lot of room to run cosplayers have been tough to come by for Jones in the sawn fence so far tonight it was an important one moving the chains on third and six and now Elliott muscle forward for a few Jones got to be thinking though unless I can create a touchdown from outside the red zone I'm not going to get the fun part again to pay this off because it JT is gonna be trotting in there here comes Braxton Miller he's lined up Cardale Jones is now lined up at the bottom Braxton trashed to a Hurst field number one there is a predictability factor to it it's a big loss about Marcus Allen trying to keep contained there and knowing he has a lot of other white jersey he just can't let Braxton Miller bounce to the outside number two comes down right here and watch him he's got to get outside you cannot let loose contain does a good job of leveraging the football and by staying to the outside everybody else can come in and chase down Braxton Miller II knew Allen was going to be essential tonight keeping an eye on Ezekiel Elliott the safeties aren't they always crucial when you play a good back like that but he's also got some quarterback responsibilities too so I'm throat and 11 Jones back at quarterback empty backfield racks it in the slot to his right there goes in motion but gentle flicks back to the left trying to escape cannot knocked down by Anthony's Ã«til and the sack for the Lions its fourth pound as settles there and how about nasod not giving up on the play young man who's having a great senior year this is a nice job of coverage down good and loud said oh there's NASA there at the end to clean it up but that was coverage downfield they rushed for at 7 in defense to be able to defend the pass and there's nowhere for Cardale Jones to go with the football give that sack to NASA by Vicky's the national leader with 11 one of the most amazing stories in college football Hawaiian affair catch made at the a NASA first arted a game in my school never once hit leading the nation is stark was again simple life Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo wrote you by Ford we go further so you can Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go

Keith Jackson it turns eightyseven years old tomorrow happy birthday Keith how good it is when Wayne woodrow hayes ohio state buckeyes look a little bit different back then didn't yeah so Penn State 1871 you may be watching this gamble another game I'm sure he is third time Penn State's been pinned back inside their 10 by Johnson to start a drive empty backfield for Hackenberg who's continuing to nurse that that scraped up me doesn't look very mobile there and he'll be dropped you could almost see that comin Kirk there was adolphus Washington but that could Burke was not the most mobile guys even more a mobile right now yeah but it's not a great effort here by the Penn State offense a line the left guard Brendan man Triscuits really because we saw Washington use his expedient acceleration he just went right around ten but what we're seeing with Hackenberg is a guy that was trying to be mobile in the first half just doesn't have it with his knee hurting him he just almost just submitted to say hey that's live for another play give a man an empty backfield with something they may not use a lot more folks they give it to Barclay instead of towers after the 8 yard line if you don't have a tight end or a back to help that on line it's going to be trouble with number 14 Heather the way where his knee is right now yeah you guys been talking about it quite a bit he's still definitely limping heavily he's been on the bike in between series I talked to James Christian's been in this situation before he's never missed a snap due to injury he is good to go state's defense Chris sit down there Joey Bosa into the inside probably looking to get that match up with Brendan man number 70 that left car it's the it's the rush man package they get very quick on these obvious passing downs and the Lions do what they have done a lot this year they sort of just hand it off and punt Berkeley a short game and William stopped it you gotta believe for John don''t in the offensive coordinator it's impacting his play call he's got to be ultra conservative especially deep in his own territory with his quarterback is playing out there on one leg Ohio State's play calling challenge get all the playmakers touches Penn State's plate going challenge work around their weaknesses and it's a big difference there is a low pass gorilla is replaced gula who struggled and that's another shank in Ohio State's going to take over again and in Penn State Territory as they try to build the lead cassadee hovers with your studio update we've got a game in South Bend CJ Prosise with a spin and scored his second TD of the game also over 100 yards rushing were tied at 31 Chris hurry back to you South Bend shootout thank you ESPN's got a great way to get you going for NFL Sunday's 10:00 a.m. the insiders liban o'clock boomer in the boys for Sunday NFL countdown so on the watch ESPN app and Saints having problems punting tonight an adventurous day for punters in the big ten that disaster for Michigan in the big house and two different men safe hunters have struggled to Ohio State and by 11 takes over at the 41 yard line second time they've been in plus territory after a shank punt Jones pressured hit dropped again and off the edge it's the sack man it's Carlton Asset perfect he's an amazing guy he shows up as a 212 pound freshman gains 54 pounds to his senior year yeah I mean think about the commitment in the weight room that he was always capable of doing this they've had some pretty good defensive ends in front of him finally the door opens up and he just steps right through it and has had one of the great stories individual stories this year in college football that's a love a guy he went to Bob Schumann's has invested me coach I'm a good investment Elliott breaks free gets some of the sack yardage back before Lucas tackles him so he sold his coaches a plan admit that the word backed it all up yeah watch how fast he is at 672 275 pounds he was about a 7foot wingspan so he's really long but he to me he's relentless his first sack tonight was more about just effort zetas was getting in there and chasing after Cardale Jones but eventually it was the effort of NASA that brought down card out Jones on his first one that time he just used acceleration and go right by chase Farris I don't care that who is he put that fourpoint stamps like using the starting blocks right that's an unorthodox position there jug's this time was very close to being a lateral I'll call it an incomplete pass at that time it was Anthony's Ã«til the tackle who got in there with it they might take a peek at that I don't it it was see where he is standing when he throws his football looks like he's at about 44 he'd get his sack there because of his height it's six seven he forces that high throw by Jones so see if Johnston could be as accurate he has been and pins Penn State back inside the tent for a fourth time it's uncanny the guy is at Machine Christian Hackenberg has to be looking at this singing can we start a drive and Blake the 20 it does it so routinely you ought to travel the country and just give lectures on this to punters because the college football this is a very hard thing to do if you watch a lot of games these punters punted into the end zone all the time this guy's mastered you know I love the Aussie punters because I'd like to go down there for the tennis I'd like to talk to camera the games are beamed down stroke they watched it win a championship people all over Australia have Buckeye jerseys on the part because of that guys well Hackenberg Zin the end zone again trying to get some room with Berkeley who does get to the outside he slumped down late and that'll be a flag the official hesitated for a second but then throws the flag out there and that's going to be Conley guilty of the 15yard penalty urban cannot believe it that was right in front of him watch Barclays stiffarm he gets ahold of Connelly and Connelly obviously his momentum ends up throwing him and that's not much no but I think would win urban watch the stiff arm get into the facemask and he kind of throws colleague but just just to the flip it's not necessarily how physical was it was where he ended up throwing him he's about five yards out of bounds moves the ball to the 22 mark shows his skill kind of sidestepping in the hole picks up eight more by the way that's the third 15 yard penalty in the Ohio State defense tonight before they can run Berkeley it's still very very early in this game before you can run Berkeley and get the attention of timeis pal number 23 is safety in vaudeville before eventually you can try to go back room to the first play to start the second half they went down field to Chris Godwin you get oneonone opportunities and Godwin's got to make plays barclays again gets the first down adds to his total he is having a night and again his first action in two and a half games coming off a high ankle sprain get a buck 54 you get caught up in and the jump cut and the acceleration but what I'm seeing is is the same thing the coaches talk to us about what we miss with him not being in is the yards after contest he has an ability not just to use his speed but he runs through tackles and instead of getting games of three and four he'll give you games of seven 12 and 15 give it to him again he was huffing and puffing before that play because even talked about how tough it is to come in as a freshman you haven't played in two and a half games and then and be this sharp against a good defense I'm talking about 20 carries you want to make sure if you're Penn State coach you want to make sure he's getting as many touches as you can at the same time not at a risk of any point of APRI entering that ankle but so far he looks really really good obviously gets his breath you little drink of water Nick Scott will spell him on second and five Hackenberg it's a lateral skycontrol it thought about it pulls the ball down and dives forward for a short gain so Scott the running back has a good arm it wasn't open though well not only was it not open nobody went out for a pass watching him I could tell when a ladder on I'm thinking okay who's he gonna throw this ball to here's his guys watch these guys who's going out okay I'll say later Hamilton kind of caught up in traffic there never ticket third and to Berkeley back in the game he's got it the Buckeyes that time stuff him got about a half yard heavy traffic there Raekwon McMillan joined the dline and it's Ford and we'll see if James Franklin isn't a gambling mood he comes upon tonight want McMillan cleans it up at Taekwon Lewis is one who made the play for Ohio State he just pushed Brent Wilkerson back into the backfield and his his and his ability to get through and and get inside there and that Penn State offensive line was really caused to play mister ello the punt the Lions Ozzie lefty not quite as skilled as the Buckeyes Aussie by a longshot that one out of bounds at the 25 yard line another reminder that Monday night over on ESPN just the Giants and the Eagles Monday night countdown a sixth of the game kicks off at 8:15 Eastern Time they contested NFC East thirty yards on a pot that has been a real problem area for Franklin Steen JT Barrett coming into the game and the crowd reacting this is not the red zone it's not short yardage it's JT Barrett getting a chance and in my opinion this could be an interesting possession not just for Ohio State but an opportunity for JT parent to see what he could do with this perhaps an expanded role in just the red zone specialists has hardly thrown a pass in the last three games and hands it to Elliott for a short gain I think we forget what an accurate effective passer number 16 was we have just haven't seen him really throw the ball much this year only has 219 passing yards when he has come in I think if anybody has struggled with this situation it's been JT Barrett not being able to be in rhythm at least now he's in rhythm because he's getting some playing time in the red zone but earlier in the year to stand there and they've come in that's tough Elliott hammers fourth again he's now got his 12th consecutive hundred yard game as we check in with Patti Hubbert Kris Herbie Herbie you said this game was going to be closed in South Bend on game day and that it is Deshawn Kaiser the Corey Robinson first touchdown of the season for David Robinson son it's 3831 Notre Dame back to you guys Wow Everage France and where was the catch like that by Robinson against Clemson you know USC with everything they went through this week they would they would come together as a group and play their hearts out they certainly have who runs it 16 or 15 here in third and four that's going to be 16 their picks his way and he does get a first down at across the 36 yard line this is where you pick up a first down typically this is where you start to see some tempo but they they still don't seem to quite be in that fast ball mode after after the first down is generally where you see a quarterback with this kind of off this style offense try to pick up that tempo and get the defense on it to you and it's a signal they're still not really clicking isn't Barrett's got it he's got the edge a flag comes in very late as barrett bolts down to the lion's 30yard line the flag was thrown across the field in the secondary did not have much of an impact on the run this judging from where it was thrown holding offense number 84 you got Marquez bought the tight end there see we could pick up where it was and it didn't have anything to really do with the play at all he was Braxton Miller or Treaty Barrett was pulling away it's an obvious hold but a great read again by JT Barrett what is JT Brant barrett bring to this office besides an ability to throw the ball an ability to make reads like that it was almost like the previous first and second down the handoffs to Ezekiel Elliott they were setting up eventually the zone read where he kept it on the spot foul ball moved to the 40 a first and ten and Barrett to flow for the first time tonight it takes off slips it's a comb man ducks down for a first down gain of about four Penn State and great coverage and that's how we have some pushing and shoving here another flag alongside actually that may come from maybe the sideline the official over by the Penn State sideline sideline warning charged against Penn State second time it will cause Franklin and the Lions five yards final minute of the third quarter here what JT Barrett did there with great coverage from Penn State is what they'd like to see Parnell Jones and gkt Barrett do and that's pull it down and instead of throwing it away try to take off and use your your legs and pick up some yards here's a keeper he's hittin the backfield by a mashup Ryan's not just the sack guys terrific it penetrate in the backfield and Nassif's been the guy he's been reading in that time that's it kind of gave him a finger point as if to say huh you're not gonna get me this time he's reading him and if he commits down he keeps he actually miss reads this one comes down and it bounces out so he fooled JT bear at that time he made it look like he was going to go after Elliott and it came back out in full JT Barrett on his own raid good play by acid it's a great spot he's arranged you guys six seven with long arms not easy to fool Barrett on that read it at all so the Lions get a touch scent of the third quarter cut into the lead and two free back after this message and a word your local ABC station this Buckeye is 50th birthday Kirk but this year's also the 50th anniversary of hang on Sloopy the ohio state band likes to play this song it was a he's a numberone hit back in 1965 you and Darren brown is an ex Buckeye your spotter here by what recording artist was responsible for hang on Sloopy as true but guys I feel like you should maybe know this which which recording acts the bear Penn State brings pressure they bring the house and drop the defense event NASA look at it right there NASA but a zone blitz out in space cannot make that play against JT Perry not many defensive ends can now one in seven yards it's not especially last year creative it's almost predictable but it's so difficult to defense you when you run a zone blitz you bring pressure from one side and then you drop the center playing mantoman you drop a defensive end out into the into a spot mate in this case out in the flat so you have your eyes on the quarterback so you see him scrambling he got away from the Blitz that was off to his left but it like you said it's you see him coming but now you gotta try to tackle him that's a tough thing to do second and six Lions crowd the line Elliott has nothing there Elliott again with a hundred yard game and he's got 106 right now so it's 12 in a row you got to 3,000 yard rushers on this team with Braxton Miller of course and Elliott not even to talk about what a good runner Barrett is it's very hard to find in the history of this sport to active thousand yard 3,000 yard rushers I should say team another third down here Penn State last time brought pressure see what they do here Eliott in motion in the flat can he make a man miss no not that is one heck of a player there by Christian Campbell who's a backup corner fought off the blonde they think he has a really bright future watch how he leverages the ball gets to the outside of Jalen Marshall right there just by getting out there and not letting Zeke Elliott get away from him and get outside clean he got his hand on him he got off a Jayla Marshall got his hand on him actually ended up tripping him up well short of the first down so Jack Willoughby on to attempt his first field goal tonight six for nine but hasn't made one from longer than 31 this year this is from 39 it's got to feel pretty good he's got plenty of leg but hadn't been accurate from that distance until now what guys up by two touchdowns early Curtis of the whole state Saturday that football bus always on the scene enter the Allstate gets good sweepstakes for a chance to 100,000 bucks plus a VIP trip to the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game Plus prizes that's our Oasis yes is kidding me that is heaven on they all stay if you like college football that's for you you want to hop on that bus because we're yelling and throwing things going crazy in there watching the bear around let's attack Hill dives at to the 23 yard line Lions still in this game in the fourth quarter but they all need something out of this Drive another reminder that over on ESPN after the ASU you saw a game Sports Center at night I'll have your baseball highlights as well SportsCenter also available on the watch ESPN app pitch Lions this is great field position compared to what they'd be usually had the 23 you mentioned that Penn State's not out of this game they're just a couple possessions I mean you know they've score remember that starts his second half they scored in under a minute so they're thinking to a field goal still just a two possession game of the middle Berkeley breaks a tackle gets away as loose in Ohio safe territory gets a block stop at the 20 buy a bone bail but if he didn't know safe one firstly before tonight you better get to know you better know him and it's a great block by 88 his sick he does a nice job right there sealing that inside and this guy has such a feel for this play they've been running this play the entire game and inside zone play he does a nice job there there's de strength to run right through the tackle a potential tackle by Conley but the eyes division and the power and acceleration on display yet again to say quad barkley no running back has had a run like that so Heine State all season long partly in the traffic even up to long runs two quarterbacks but Ohio State's defense coming in it allowed exactly three rushes of 15 plus they've seen too many backs like this forget about the guise of a true freshman didn't he's just special he's coming off of an ankle injury sat out last week he's in 22 carries so far tonight not showing any any sign at all of an ankle injury and I told you the Penn State's still thinking they were a couple possessions we're back in this game they they definitely are still in a position to compete in this football game into the red zone which has been a problem area for this offense we'll see if Berkeley can fix that they fake it to him folks on the end around gets up and gets eight yards before Conley Corral's him see what they have going right now is that inside running threat of Berkeley is freezing those linebackers so it's a it's a nice compliment to run pulled off of that save one and then you get him accelerating around the edge Ohio State caught up in the middle worrying about Berkeley and then pick up some Bagwell yards then around the edge there because of the safeties and linebackers locked in to the middle yes really need to convert this certainty which has been a a tough situation for this season Berkeley quick penetration Bosa was involved joined by Washington so now a decision for Franklin down 14 often still on the field he talked about both up being in ball tease known as a pass rusher how about this technique looking on the far right comes down blocks up wraps up and puts him on his back that's why he is weighted by so many people he's brain against the past and the one huge play Nicci to keep this drive alive Hackenberg in the pocket does not get the first down as Tommy shut shut the door on him he's really limping off the field and again it's easy to see this but Ohio State lost Berkeley right here then lost him coming out of the backfield absolutely nobody stays with him as he slides to the outside if he dumps it he walks into the end zone for a touchdown at

on third down tonight as the troubles continue exactly ten minutes to play here back in his knock down at the 34 by Brandon Bell this is the time of the game Kirkwood as you know Eliot tends to get free for this huge run tshirt dollars and this is where the offensive line from Ohio State really has to say this is a huge Drive at just under 10 minutes to go in this game they need to be able to say we need to take things over up front help Zeke Elliot out keeps it around the left side and is chased out for another first down near midfield it's a great feel here by JT Barrett then it's again a zone read the defensive ends coming down corner also on the blends he feels it senses it and by reading that again Chris defensive the you have to be concerned about both of these guys they bite down he picks up huge overs in here at the end looked like the Ohio State fans felt the he would spit maybe a little bit late but you got to worry about both 16 and 15 makes it very very different to defend the offense 200 yard rushers nap tonight for the Buckeyes mrs. Elliott breaking free running game really imposing itself now Chris a great run by JT Barrett on the previous play consider me spent the entire last series lain on the ground behind the bench getting his calves and hamstrings stretched on both legs he was still wearing his headset had his jacket on was still involved then got up was pounding the electrolytes trying to get the cramping in the flags under control ripping on a very cold night here in Columbus Elliott a short gain but runs of length team 13 and 15 yards Burnett landed some body shots in this is Penn State defense and for Ohio State offense it still only has 82 yards passing tonight they have really relied on the running game of Eliot Barrett to get him home an offense that came in averaging exactly 230 rushing and 230 passing through six games have you ever seen anything like that through half a season now it's identical to the tenth of the yard Eliot again bounces free drags a man for a first down Haley the corner trying to bring him down but it's going to be another Ohio State first down and we're gonna talk a lot about Elliot and what JT Barrett can do but just watching this drive Taylor Dekker the left tackle Millie price the left guard even a tight end Nick vennett lot of guys are making some big blocks to open up some running lanes right now the Ohio State running game such continuity upfront unlike men say we just had a different lineup almost every game the oline so you're running and you're running running zone read after zone read and you give them the exact same look look at the linebackers coming up the safeties have their eyes in the backfield nobody looks behind them and that's exactly what Curtis Samuel ran Oh got behind him enforcing go and what guys playing quickly short gain for Eliot so we see JT Barrett as a passer is 2 for 2 19 yards done most of the damage as a runner will he get the the hattrick here tonight or will Elliott get another touchdown well it depends on the way Penn State tries to defend them but this drive again with the running the running and then the playaction that's an identity that that's that is in kind of an identity of who you want to be as an offense and it just feels different when he's in the line oh look guys looking the play clock wind down here and apparently will spend a timeout to talk about this second and goal play as they try to build in a 14point lead 6:28 to play Thank You notredame is beaten USC Buckeyes second end goal after a touchdown Tim Tino and Florida it's Braxton Miller this redstone thing they got got out of a sudden here you're right when you see that play you can't help but think of Tim with the jump pass when he used to come in as a freshman especially in for Chris Leak there it is an oldie but a goodie still effective when you run the ball with a quarterback you can you can show that run he gives him the point that's here that's here ko that's your plan makes the comparison of a Barrett and Tebow obviously the different skill sets perhaps but in terms of what they have meant to the team's and this red zone role and that was our monsters in there and from a leadership standpoint boats are onceinalifetime type of leaders Tim with Florida and of course JT for Ohio State it one day Giants the Eagles of our ESPN six o'clock in the kickoff at 8:15 from Philly to the jump pass from Barrett the Braxton Miller his third touchdown reception season as they get braixen a touch got to keep all the guys involved there had to be fun verb admire it was an oldschool kind of play that beti Bo's successful kind of brought it back again feel arity poor cat the two and the kickoff coverage team closed down quickly at the 15yard line go back to this touchdown the two inside linebackers they're thinking about the run I love to see Braxton Miller and quarterback his entire life watch him to the far right he actually does a good job of selling it to Brendan bell Brendon Bell is an outside linebacker he he's thinking the way Braxton Miller came off the line of scrimmage that he's going to gauge and try to block and Herbie Meyer has got to be excited not just for JT Barrett but the timing and the execution by Braxton Miller it's a nice job stronger contrast in red zone performance for Ohio State between verse five in the last two games Hackenberg get free and lop it downfield and a chance to make a play there Connelly broke it up and as black na was out there and there's a flag way back down in the holding zone enjoy boasting they have burst through they're holding offense number 53 half the distance to the goal dowry dowry just he's trying to take care of his quarterback and he was beaten so badly by Washington right here watch 153 does right here holds him down supposed to give him a shove to the ground way after the play which is close folks that are getting overturned by replay be careful sweetie there he would have missed the first half tonight worse than 17 Berkeley takes the handoff and picks his way up the middle the way Ohio State plays defense they love to the Eli Apple on one side and Connelly on the other literally just on Islands it's the defense that they started a year ago had a lot of success with it and they continue to do that which spawned Bell they're 11 and time is pal puts them in some tough positions against run and pass and also those corners on islands against Talent Group receivers slant incomplete on second and 11 Hamilton was closed down quickly by have on Bell my estate 100 and second week Kirk at number one it breaks the alltime record held by Oklahoma I'm gonna get to looks like 20 wins 27 regularseason big 10 games exist the performance piece fans were more than expecting tonight the Hemery high stick endures they did I think for a lie of state it's about winning and trying to look for beat we think their bands have high expectations just like the coaches do but I still think they're trying to figure things out offensively and we'll see where they are in the next couple of weeks if the quarterback situation works itself out machan burg flips it short Lynch did he catch it and drop it yet to fondle guys have it now inside the 5yard line Jalen Holmes recovered the fumble there's a flag as well it's a bangbang play Minch caught the ball and then it was ruled a fumble kam Williams as it was with the ball carry another talk about the fly if he was trying to throw a beanbag like weird the fumble was her I didn't I didn't see a a penalty where they threw the flag maybe that's what they're discussing prior to the change of possession personal foul targeting defense so that would wipe away the fumble recovery and they'll check it at Ken Williams as the player flagged for targeting before Lynch made the catch in the fumble and see if he got it here this is throw out into the flat here and oh yeah use the crowd of your helmet those official right there that happened so fast it was hard to see him lower his head right there cannot use the crown of your helmet and when an opponent also can't target his helmet but that that looked like a pretty clear case of it right there when you lower your head and use the crown of the helmet it doesn't matter where you hit the ball carrier and she also can't hit in his helmet that's different than the defenseless player that's when they're looking for the contact up above the neck Neil Simon's the replay official waiting for his verdicts that happened really fast I was this is probably he's gonna end up holding up smile from Williams but this would mean no change of position fenced he keeps the ball 15 yard penalty and Williams is out for this game and the first half of the Rutgers game on the road next week another look he definitely lowers his head who's the back up to Raekwon McMillan so you wouldn't say plays a huge role on this defense the targeting foul is confirmed faint fans boo but this rule is in effect now all over football to protect the players it's it's not just that he's going to potentially hurt the Penn State player he's taking a victory lap it's much about trying to protect himself he's his second time today we've seen a player or get Shearer he leaves the field after target not quite the big the picture so losses at Penn State's get the ball now first and ten that kannberg trying to escape loses the ball in Ohio State's got it so Sam Hubbard recovered the ball there'll be no rescuer for this turnover knocked loose by Washington after losing it it's good coverage downfield and it's a twist move that Washington is able to get by Derek gallery again you're looking at Christian Hackenberg he has been basically a sitting duck in that pocket it just does not have any mobility really nice job by Washington instead of just trying to go for a big sack and bring him down he rips at the football jarred loosen to dislodge it away from the quarterback packet Berg collective effort for different Buckeyes it made Saxon Ivan's the game's first turnover means a reverse Marshall long way to go just to get back to the line strip it bit barrels down inside the ten you Chris you're talking about getting everybody there touching is the one guy that's not really pinball much tonight Hasmik Jalen Marshall I think Jalen Marshall could be as good as skilled players they have on the perimeter with all the talk of all the other guys and they have a lot of them Jalen Marshall is physical he's experienced and he has great quickness and feel for the game it's a run on the way by Barrett I agree with you Marshall wants to be the down field threat for this offense kind of taking over the devin Smith role from a year ago and this is a situation where I think you're exactly right they got Braxton Miller a touchdown they get Marshall a touch now just making sure that all the playmakers are involved and still in good spirits going forward yeah and with Jalen Marshall you see him back as a punt returner he's a guy who played high school in high school he played quarterback down in Middletown Ohio really really skilled talented player second and goal Barrett looking for the end zone I think you need to get number sixteen more involved it's my personal opinion quarterback JT Baron putting the ball exactly exactly where it needs to be fade to the corner away kind of a pediment back shoulder there he had so much room to work with throws it away from Trevor Williams to that outside shoulder and Michael Thomas uses his body to keep Williams away from it there for passing two touchdowns 101 yards rushing any doubt in your mind that he's got to be the starter next week for Ohio State I think if I were Orban Meyer I would take the keys to the car I would hand them the number 16 and I would say hey babe go get them it's your it's your show go for it Willoughby makes it thirty eight to ten did Barrett earned the starting job back tonight good year providing our aerial coverage kick off your drive with tires that return superior performance Goodyear more driven the official aerial provider of Saturday Night Football because if I may go back to you when you asked me there at the end before we hit our break Cardale Jones JT Barrett for me it's it's not just that JT Barrett the offense feels different you're talking about the heart and soul and the leader the intangibles or JT Berry a favor JT Barrett and the offense has a completely different vibe and energy to it when he's indicate with inflicted hurt has thrown a little foreign Jimmy then to Michael Thomas see that's that's a nice job there but that's also we haven't forgotten about you Mike I you're the top receiver in this team you didn't do a lot down field tonight thrown the ball but hang with me here stay with it he's got all these talented guys who want the ball he wants them to want the ball sure but he also he also wants them to want to win and then you know if the touches come they come and if they don't they don't it's just kind of how it is touchdown reception for Thomas it's a very short kick double boot and just bounces right into the arms of Scott is gonna be wrestled down at the 25yard line if you check here with cash he hovers again all right Chris back to Salt Lake where the rain is coming down Travis Wilson to Kenneth Scott Wilson second TD pass of the day Utah up 1410 again this game over on ESPN take a peek at that one later on you it's tough at home but ASU has kind of had their number in recent years in the pac12 have not lost to him wolf competition taking care of the quarterback Mike Burke avicii only a couple of sacks let's see if they take care of this quarterback that could berg is back in there they're up by four touchdowns we don't need to get him hurt and a bump be able to see if they feed the ball to the running back Sears Barclay slips as he tries to cut back be careful with number 26 as well when the game appears to be out of reach Pacific Life game summary Ohio State after a slow start on offense the three red zone touchdown to the second quarter Lions got a TD run to get back into it but then a strong strong fourth quarter showing by Ohio State cripple Barclay almost at 200 yards Penn State with 10 points if you would have said coming into this game that Barclay say quant Barclays gonna run for 200 yards you would think Penn State's offense would be in rhythm and they would they would be able to throw the ball but it has just not been the case Ohio State doing a great job of getting after Hackenberg play 7 to 12 for 120 yards could be the first conference loss with Penn State dropped my estate in their 20th in a row Lynch is in the game now third in ten Hanabusa blows it up in the backfield Joey Bosa starting to show that for the made of a unanimous allamerican last year it's watch they move him inside watch him right here takes on one guy that's like a true you do in practice takes on the guard takes on the tight end coming down gets off of both of him using his hands and it accelerates through the ball carrier that was that hold Mel Kiper and Todd McShane would have put that one off to the side for whatever the draft was a draft at a poor man wherever it is they players drafted there will be and Todd's got the different position groups as the punt is dangerously fielded there the 30yard line by Marshall and he's knocked down quickly who's the chickfila rankings Baylor that's your number one team convincing enough win to keep them atop here right yeah it's gonna get a lot tougher for Baylor but they've been the most consistent team they played some teams and aren't necessarily that great but they have blown every single team out been the most consistent team so far the first six or seven weeks in that game in the big house that would be talked about for as long as they play football in the state of Michigan he bobbled punt and Michigan State which had a point two percent chance of winning that game before the play happened in other words Michigan was a 99.8 of ability to win the game found a way to lose it in the last play when you're putting with 10 seconds left which a twopoint lead you liked your chance Exley normally they've given apparently Elliott the rest of the night off when they give a rare handoff to any other running back and this is brillante done saying hey if you ever want to give 15 a rest on pretty good and it's not to midfield that's only as v carry this season well the eventful day Baylor in Waco just whack West Virginia can anybody stop that offense they put up 62 today Alabama ran over and ran through a.m. no answer there for big Henry hardfought Baldwin for LSU and Cornett over a game and hater team which James quarterbacks the stunner in Ann Arbor by the way it is 42 days about a thousand hours if you want to start counting down Ohio State Michigan Harbaugh against Ohio State for the first 7 but a thousand hours from it's really outgoing six weeks from today in Ann Arbor the winner of the Michigan Michigan State game you knew it looked like it was going to be Michigan there for most of that game but if Michigan State ends up winning that game it was gonna show set up a showdown with Ohio State so you have a high owe State at Michigan State late in the year and then the very next week you have a high owe state in Michigan it's amazing how much Michigan is improved in year one under Jim Harbaugh Urban's guys are going to Rutgers for the first time ever he still never lost a Big Ten Road game that's next week in primetime final minute gone again bangs off tackles and he's trying to make the most of his carries the Ford wrap up show with Cassidy huh birth after the game what will be a four touchdown win for Ohio State 27 in a row the regular season Big Ten play 20 in a row and Urban Meyer is going to have his fourth 20 game winning streak of his career no other coach in history has more than two he's got four of them now his various stops along the way Eliott 12 straight hundred yard game Barrett was brilliant doing what he was asked to do second week in a row Ohio State's offense doesn't start the football over second week in a row they're very very successful in the red zone two most important things for Urban Meyer when he evaluates his quarterback play when he evaluates his offense sake want barkley the brilliant freshman showing why Penn State fans should be excited about his play in years to come 194 yards average seven and a half per carry against this Ohio State defense tonight should also mention Christian Hackenberg just a tough gritty performance didn't put huge numbers but he very very easily could have gone out of the game trying to stay out there and try to be a leader definitely did not put up big numbers tonight Heather Cox is with Coach Meyer Chris thanks so much it's coach congratulations 20th the win fans have been waiting for this kind of for a breakthrough game twentyeight point win what does it say about where your team is right now hey Shelly great win and really proud you know the a lot of credit to their defense top ten defense and I think we ran for 315 yards offense line played their tails off and Zeke and JT came in did a great job talked about JT how did the offense change when he came in to really lead them most of the second half yeah he was a spark and you know the threat of the Q run as he came out the other end a couple times in the Zeke rant our but that the the key offensive footballs you can control the line of scrimmage you have a chance that was one of the best defensive fronts in college football I know that the game is just ended but how does JT's performance in the way that the quarterbacks work today sort of affect the way you might use multiple quarterbacks in the future you just want to win one and try to the best thing about 700 is a chance to get the no that's it thank you good job dodging a question that many others will ask they'll want to know I would imagine very soon what the quarterback plan is for next week let's go back to Heather Chris thanks so much joined by JT 13 JT you have been incredibly patient how did it feel to get to come in and finally lead this team not just in the red zone but throughout the second half was just trying to do anything I can to help team win and that's all I tried to do tonight and last week it was the red zone this week I got a chance to play and set up and I just took the planet abet how does your mindset in a philosophy change once it goes from the red zone into what it turned into in the second half it would be different if I just like around the ball and thing like that but I would be throw as well so with that I was just going into our regular offerings and doing reds on to the open field what's the key in your mind to making this multiple quarterback situation where coaches told us for two versus just knowing that the other day is doing what's best for the team and I think man Carnell have that mindset and I really doesn't matter who gets the glory who gets the stat something like that I think that we worry about winning and I think that's our whole team philosophy and that's what we try to do as quarterbacks in the quarterback system we have certainly worked about tonight JT congrats on a great performance per se thank you that's what you'd hope your quarterback would say in that situation but I know that he wants to get back to be the starter the AT&amp;T strong performance looks at the 200 yard rushers Barrett and averaged or the nine yards per carry through the two touchdown passes Elliott again with 153 has hit the hundred yard mark 12 games in a row just really nice job Ohio State having a balanced running game and if there was a jolt I mean you could feel the plant was when I was take out in the red zone maybe they would see more and more JT parent like last week but you saw more of him in the open field and it just does the the quarterback threat opens up so many different aspects of this offense where you can run JT Barrett you can run Zeke Elliott and you can use playaction off of it makes it very very tough to stop and that's really the offense who they were last year with JT Barrett until the injury and when the Cardale Jones stepped in they go to Rutgers next week by Minnesota here at Illinois massive favorites in those three games setting up the end of the season Michigan State and then at Michigan could be very sick down the stretch it's gonna take all they have to stay focused week to week and not peek ahead and get excited about those last two games in Ohio statement here in Columbus tonight 3810 is the final here tonight's game produced by Bill Minelli directed by Derek modeling for Kirk Herbstreit Heather Cox I retire a team here in frosty Columbus Chris Fowler saying good night time for the port wrapup show and cassadee hub earth thanks Chris so many wild plays on this show down Saturday but none crazier than the blunder at the big house Michigan State had a point two percent probability to beat Michigan before the final play of the game further proof you always play to the final whistle 10 seconds to go Michigan punting up two points Blake O'Neal must the punt recovered by Jalen watts Jackson for the gamewinning touchdown Sparty with their first lead of the day coming as the clock hits zero unfortunately the hero Jalen watched Jackson hurt his hip during the celebration had to be taken to the hospital after the game stay tuned to espn.com for the latest on his status but Michigan states with the improbable win little brother once again taking home the Paul Bunyan trophy they've won seven of their last eight over the Wolverines here's Mark Dantonio on the wild wild win you know we just came in here with something that we felt like we had to prove and I don't know you know I guess we weren't on a crazy play but we played hard with conviction and that's what I asked our guys to do what's this win mean for your program hey we're seven or know we advance that's what it means that's that's in the big picture our dreams are still alive thanks coach congratulations
