============================================================

unforgettable plays incomparable players Clemson's Florida State has long been one of the great conference rival for a time even kidding father against son and for the last six years it has been the game in the ACC with national championship implications not just a game they have to win a game they want to tonight is no different more big stars more high stakes bill Tiger vs. Seminole no campbell city event long last lit up the first primetime game here in more than a year we expect highintensity overflowing emotions welcome to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart and the crucial Atlantic Coast Conference collision between it undefeated Clemson hike number three in the playoff chase and number 12 Florida State trying to protect their house one more time against the Tigers roadtest Saturday and college football of the lineup beans 7 and action today all 7 on the road Michigan rolled Washington barely survived in Salt Lake City with the two big 12 teams Baylor and West Virginia fell from the ranks of the unbeaten boise lady wyoming tonight and nebraska is tied with wisconsin which brings us to this road trip for Clemson in Tallahassee welcome once again Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit Samantha ponder will join us the playoffs Committee rankings come out on Tuesday Kirk and already that number of unbeaten teams getting whittled down today tough day for the big 12 we talked about that this whole week the challenge that the big 12 might have West Virginia losing Baylor losing and and now the big 12 is look kind of on the outside looking in tuesday's the first announcement of the rankings from the committee and it's going to be very hard I think after today's results to imagine the big 12 working themselves back up and having a team in the playoff meanwhile Clemson comes in as a slight favorite a place they've lost 11 of the last 12 but symbolic of their last win it was two weeks ago at home against NC State's a missed field goal to allow the Tigers to get into overtime Watson with a touchdown pass in the top of the first and then an interception to seal it by Marcus Edmund reinforcing for Clemson's ability to win the fight games and feel great resilience I think that's really what that voice when he takes away from that is his team was challenged it wasn't perfect they very easily could have lost the NC State but they found a way to win and I think it has a lot to do with being a heart of a champion when you think about being a heart of a champion you think of the quarterback deshaun Watson because he's the guy that you always have to be able to rely on and he'll they'll have to rely on him tonight his leadership the intangibles that he brings to the table we saw when he could do last year not just against Florida State but really all year leading this team week after week coming up with big plays and carried over into this year and I think that's the thing that comes into this game to me that this atmosphere will not be too big the stakes will never be too big for the Shaun Watson that's what comes as a favor they got more experience more proven quarterback and the better defense deshaun Watson this is the kind of game crook you always say he's got to do it with his legs as well as an arm he's going to have to I think Florida State's defense you and I had him the opening night when the Labor Day night against Ole Miss they've had some concerns tonight I think they're going to be challenged in a way where Mike Williams oneonone the Noles love to play mantoman when you play mantoman you leave yourself out in the Highland against maybe the best deep threat in the country can deshaun Watson find the rhythm there to get the ball thrown down feelings you just did Chris if things are taken away it's much mantoman as far as they play is this what happened nobody has their eyes on the quarterback and he can take off running and that's something that he'll look to do tonight especially on third down you want to keep an eye on deshaun Watson the scramble and also quarterback design run against this Florida State defense it's given him trouble all year yeah the Noles defense has played good football the last couple of games they've grown up they played with more passion and they played smarter football they have been incredibly susceptible the big plays all season long it's been an upanddown season did the 33 straight points to come from behind and beat Ole Miss in Orlando opening night that was on Labor Day Dalvin cook would get going after beat down the historic beat down in Louisville one of the worst losses in the history of the program and a lot of questions surrounding this team what would get going he Fez was still struggling in that game and then they lost here on a walkoff field goal to North Carolina tinker doing the tomahawk shop in a victory lap Miami they survived on a block P AC by DeMarcus Walker at the end of the game so where are the null is sitting there with with two losses at this point I think they're confident I think the last two weeks were important for them they were able to knock off Miami a game at you and I saw down in Miami and then against Wake Forest in the fact they were just able to win those games they have a bye week they're at home I think there's a real belief from Jimbo Fisher and his team compared to where they were early in the year to now they think they can beat Clemson offensive line has struggled protecting the Andre francois so you really got to get a big game from Dalvin cook he had one last year in a loss at Clemson yeah that Alvin cook one of the top backs in the country and really does a great job of being able to find creases in a defense that's something that he has done since he's been here something I think you know he's going to have to do tonight when he does that it seems to set up their offensive flow and it really get them going in the direction that they want to go that offensive line though the Andre francois has had to show again and again and again how tough he is the Clemson with a great pass rush can they protect this guy tonight well I think the way you can protect Francois is you get the running game going if you don't have gap integrity that means everybody's accountable for a gap you are going to give a crease up to Dalvin cook and with his vision to me it's the best in the country he'll make you pay for it and if he gets the running game gone it just seems to be able to slow every it affects the eyes and the linebackers in a defense you can see here and then the all axis kind of you see the linebackers are up it's because of the respect they have for Dalvin cook and then it opens up easier throws for the young freshman quarterback Francois downfield and that's what they'll look to do tonight the nose will pull up a Hollywood weekend mild upset as we take you to the side 70 kickoff coming up don't gamble suing them if they see see collisions and I should be a lot of fun the Nissan pregame rush with Stan Barret Mack Brown and Mark Leigh is next after this message and a word from our ABC station your focus and your dedication you play the damn game one is being born way to keep out of the last five years two great teams going headtohead and just want to win he gave me a bigger view he did look forward for any season there's plenty of juice and that's what Manus was clenching Florida State they don't matter what the records are there's a lot of pride involved in this thing some sweet emotions the not so sweet emotions and some salty stuff is expected when Clemson and Florida State collide unconquered outside of his hacks Doakes Campbell's idiom and this presentation the SEC on ESPN the first night games it's Miami visited here more than a year ago this program was built on big exciting night games these fans have waited a long time for this one no say they're not just boilers in the ACC but they would love to spoil London's perfect record in pursuit of a playoff spot Brendan Carter senior engineering major from Georgia is this year's chief Osceola will ride renegade to centerfield no once you plant the flaming spear Davo sweeney expects a very challenging environment for his team tonight his team is preparing to enter this cauldron of noise and emotion about 50 moments ago in the locker room in your lane not out of legs engaging it blocks dominated in physicality this football game that's what we do FIFA's is what's on side one trick what's all the fancy stuff but you do your job and you do your job with defense control a lot of strip down guns immense the grandest entrances forest in their home games a circle the stadium a coward rock run down the field this is the least grand entrance claustrophobic singlefile to get out into this pixel well that's a great look at that if you're coming into this atmosphere that you have to get through on time 11 of the last 12 funds and come up empty and Doak Campbell but really involved that many these players these guys have won a lot of big games looting some big road games in the last couple of years older players telling the younger guys this week what it's like to play this idiom seems to vibrate the Tomahawks outgoing Quenton program has won so many big games home in a way that there is a belief even though this is a tough atmosphere led by that man right there Deb you sweetie and the quarterback deshaun Watson five straight years the winner of this game has won the apt title although meaningful emotional that the public recent years Kirkuk all these games emotion to big part early surviving if you're a road team not making the crucial mistake that sometimes the motion to create has been important to win these games some teams weather the storm other teams attack it see how Clinton decides to go Seminoles have just won the coin toss and deferred so time so we get the football first let's get on to Samantha Panther with Jim though both teams coming off a bye this week so where do you think we'll see your team is improved out here tonight I think it's a better spirit to be right I think we'll be better fundamentally all the way across for a to the week practice they're ready to finish the stress of a this season defensively you know what you're up against with Wayne Gulman back and obviously a proven guy in deshaun Watson so what's the biggest challenge for that group tonight we're gonna dominate the line of scrimmage we got it we got to continue I'm going to make them earn every yard to get running the football got affect the quarterback to get the throw we got to get the pressure with some of your presence thanks guys for days I has been pleased with the practice efforts the last couple of weeks remember both teams have at five weeks to get healthy and prepare for this one now seolin renegade you're a Florida State fan it gives you goosebumps and even if you're not you realize what an important prediction that is in the fabric of house football when the smoke clear is momentarily did the Seminoles and the Tigers you know in a rare position tonight own underdog it meant every year since Florida State enter the ACC 1992 the home team has dominated when 12 of the last 14 kunsan's last win here was in 2006 one of the Bowden Bowl the last second touchdown run from James Davis it was a thriller a couple years ago most surviving an OC here Clemson and a hardfought 60minute fight beaten the Noles at home last year we will sing all the cool toys that the gun watson operate against an emotional Florida State Beach person all this crowd noise just moment at the tiger concede the opening kickoff logan Tyler's a freshman to kick it away CJ fuller our Tabas Scott our deep the pregame pyrotechnic smoker catnaps clearing way for this one to begin the new renovation in a new light show and they run out here terrific the won't kick along the ground that's going to have it there okay this Scott sit back knock down across the 30 here comes John Watson before asleep thirdyear jr. the whole nation knows all about him this young man probably received as much preseason hype as anybody and I think tonight there are three things you have to do number one they're going to take care of the football collectively especially him because he's a triggerman hit scheme has got to be a factor tonight because it can give some opportunities I believe to open up other opportunities within this offense and then big part is I think Mike Williams number seven we've got to be able to locate oneonone opportunities against McFadden and capitalize when they're there a monster game take her 12 catches against 205 million Gulman is about we've got it common the two carries was not unconscious against way for us and not out of the game but he's good to go tonight here's the chickfila impact players I think he is anxious to get back out there we'll keep a close eye on heavies a very important part of it Mike Williams he just talked about Derek nada you'll see him 91 against the run and DeMarcus Walker number 44 in front and especially the pass they'll move him around on second down Watson hesitate takes off and Pyxis go to the 40yard line for Derrick Hopkins introduced himself to the quarterback as well as the Marcus Walker the quarterback run game again Florida State knows it's going to be a factor watch out hot Hopkins works off of the potential block from Wayne Coleman come take great job at getting off the block and then the acceleration through contact to the quarterback as you back field now on third and three not for the formation Watson looked left and finds Williams who take the tackle and has her first down across the 45 involved pretty quickly first I got to give Mike Williams get his hands on the football early now to tempo of course the rhythm starts to crank for this Clemson offense led by the Shawn watson ran this same style offense in high school that's not a good sign for four to stay with all the entries already in the back end of his defense now another one of their leaders cray Marshal Erwin James Wright they're still not able to go he's got a torn meniscus Nader is that behind it and I number 20 on the right ear stream there only took a shot to the knee from a teammate make up to just hustling to make the play there's the reaction goes down now Kirk they sent out number 37 a true freshman kyle myers into the secondary like that right young young secondary to begin with only one starter on this defense and last year God comes in motion Gorman is back overly empty state that was the opponent when he fearing just twice and got knocked out of the game but he came soon the training room had no memory of what is going on but they're relieved to have the violence to get ready watch McFadden come here instead of chasing Scott who's in motion he lets him go on motion instead of going with him he just decides to rush the quarterback and comes up with a big play there on first and ten when you're lost on second down look left takes off and his tackle immediately Derrick Nadia the God that you highlighted in the open made to stop there but Derrick Nadi is now healthy and he's playing at a very different level you see him mostly against the run but also has enough quickness to be able to get in there but that was really about the coverage there's an old secondary the muchmaligned secondary time this year they were locked in all those receivers and Shawn Watson had to hold on to the ball which gave 90 a chance to get there he pen on this third down leans to the right max up oneonone against mark wears white now the corner blip Williams's left to load out there makes the catch flip the tackle and it's close but not quite at first down yardage goes a good call against the corner blitz huh a great call and it's something that most quarterbacks when the asita blips like that you're taught to just get the ball immediately out to that wide receiver it was actually exactly the way Florida State designed it it's what you want you just kind of make the tackle you forced a quick throw because of the corner blitz but the safety ends up missing the tackle there's white taking off on the Blitz now it's just okay it's third and long you're going to make that that catch now you just have to make the tackle or Mon Lane misses him and you open fielder at the punch so that's a great call by Charles Kelly perfectly executed but he didn't make the tackle in the open too the measured ingot for port down out lanes a good story put over from receiver his first start of life is against Wake Forest in the last game but he made some plays against Miami the highly touted receiver who split finds the ball didn't want to make an impact on this team unable to make the tackle and now let's see what we some who does has had a problem all year in short yard and they don't get under center so you have him back at 5 and 1/2 yards that's time they're actually going to get under center so you got to think quarterback sneak refight in I formation you don't see the Tigers win up like this very often and he's just a few inches under Noddy in there in the middle that defense Marcus Walker's moving side to 44 and he is a dog Salman's fighting in will move the stick took just barely you're thinking sneak that heaters and clears enough feet number 9 Marcus Walker kind of showing you some versatility tonight he notice kind of an outside linebacker defensive end they're moving him more and more into the interior and he's got great power is 280 pounds he can move around he's very athletic but you start to move him him into the middle and his quickness and strength can give us better in effect the guards trouble Marcus his feet up tonight he was a late sweat from Clemson to Florida State we're assigning they're watching down the middle boy I get running free curve like it gets the block hit for the quarter on these Bremen out inside apply for the Tigers pressing under opening possession that's a great job of working infant behind the linebackers gift split safety when a safety split you've got a big open hole in the middle that defense behind the linebackers will read a great route by Leggett and an outstanding pro that time by the Shawn Watson led him right between the two slate safety to put just enough on the ball 41 yards catch and run stepped up the Tigers first and goal Domon barrels ahead in breaks the plane when Clinton takes the opening kickoff in March and 68 yards for the early lead exactly how Clemson adabbo Sweeney wanted to start this game Chris he talked about how some teams come into this atmosphere they kind of just one of weather the storm early other teams have confidence and they say hey bring on the challenge we're going to go out and execute and that's one way to show you're not intimidated 9 plays 68 yards and an ability to convert on third down and eventually they get into the end zone you're at Google for the conversion would you say some teams attack it I think them to just attack seal atmosphere Oh without a doubt I play 68 yards deshaun Watson very sharp in the opening drive and Wayne Gulman a tough touchdown run to cap it off in Francois and the Seminoles enter her down early at home let's cut aerial coverage provided by Goodyear committed to honoring Clint were the athletes who demonstrate hard work on and off Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff Tiger is going to make it back to the gospel Paul playoff I mean at seven a no charge in the ACC Atlantic and in front early 7nothing after a 68 yard touchdown drive possession supporters they coming up from it Whitfield gonna bring it out get beyond the 15yard line so the Andre Francois we take any beating at times this year proving his toughness Kirk takes the field down seven now I totally agree I think from what I've seen from any quarterback in the country that this guy has been tested and has answered the bell time after time his decisionmaking tonight against a very complex game from Brent Venables keeping plays alive will be big tonight because of his athletic ability and then that same toughness that we've seen and he would stand the pounding he might take tonight especially on third down blitzes for 16 minutes he's got to be out there to try to lead this team plays drew a shoulder injury suffered against Miami and against Wake Forest clearly not a hundred percent faith Bruce in pain but Jimbo Pittman says he's back explosive throws in practice this week so they feel good about the health of that shoulder tonight he looks at short hair since Nathan Thunder be rapidly improving Titan who gets it out near the 35 yard line is 6x this year brought him from the backside that time really well designed play especially on first and ten just Aiken Dalvin cook and instead to play action with Francois who has great ball skills in a way he handles the play fakes and allowed to tie it in and slip out into the flat nice high percentage throws and Jimbo Fisher for his young quarterback to settle in in 18 yards in the opening part of the sixth sixth tight end from the Bahamas first theory for Melvin cook MCS leader from yards from scrimmage he's been a great receiver look at the determination there they puts the pile he is his physical as any back as you'll see he does leave the power 574 scrimmage yards after contact is the best in the power five when there's tension the ball in the backfield are running and he is vitally important tonight not just because he makes big plays but when they did Calvin cook going that's where Jimbo Fisher really puts his quarterback into that that rhythmic passing game off the play action look those comes in motion now women get up to the fullback that'll be enough to the first young the bad news about that statute is in Gina's book that we have much room before contact I know he's used to having big creases they just haven't been there as much this year he's really had to fight for his yard Ernie talking to Jimbo this week he feels that they're coming up drunk with the offensive line and I take with the quarterback play I think it's been to having the bye week to get everybody a little bit healthier and I just kind of listening to and talked his way I think he's feeling a little bit better about where his offense is even though this is probably their biggest challenge against this defense which was dropped back the shot you take the freshman a flag is down he makes a circus bread that he puts off and I think he may have pushed off on Ryan Carter steep and final 41 supply we look at Christmas watch watch Kate at 6'5 right there to throw him down I don't know for what the world oh I guess Carter guys arm around his waist rate I don't know what them I guess but I up whatever song is a pretty healthy shove to put Carter on the ground axle fashion hand fighting out there in the edge then 23 hard game stands a guy who been a redstone weapon half of his eight catches have done four touchdowns but you get an expanding role guys will have to step up tonight this Bobo Wilson the senior receiver his house got a foot injury so expect a bigger role to take perhaps my quandary Soph always made no impact so far guys what I have to fill the void on empty here balls out little faster here and protection nearside completionist Whitfield Prentice take three guys and get down inside the red zone another first down for foreign state Florida state giving Clemson some of their own men medicine here spreading it out it black in making Princeton have to play in space Whitfield does a good job of shaking free we have to the play a marker came in those are walking backward after the play or through Bob often Roman 69 that's a true freshman Nicodemus take the guard land in dickerson costly motion still running high in this game his two teams typically decide the Atlantic in the ACC and bin Boulware who we called his name quite a bit the night we were in Death Valley taking on Louisville he's not afraid to challenge people's manhood a little bit and you got it everybody's got to keep their cool but where we'll be in the middle of something guy before without a doubt Olmec is a 35 after the 15year penalty Tigers are crowding to ina scrimmage you fake it to cook friends why first time tonight as Kendall Joseph the middle linebacker got him this is what Brent Venables dials up some pressure and up to Kindle Joseph is having a great year he's able to shoot through a gap here think about some of the linebacker play the middle linebacker play the Clemson has has in France wide I think his eyes are downfield surprised by the suddenness of Joseph and how quickly he shot through that gap it got in there but they've had I think about it Stephane Anthony BJ quit said last year and now Kendall Joseph has stepped up into that role and has a monster year so far for the Tiger defense before the friendly the ball was inside the 22 the back 15 who's 10 on the sack and second is 20 to try tunnel screen we took that room what failed to Train just sort of the 20yard line but it's a first down dangerous mantoman across the board and it's time Jaylyn Williams tried to stay with him he's kind of an outside linebacker see he gets caught up in traffic everybody else has their back to the receiver because they're tied up in Madame sp30 right there just not quick enough to be able to stay with the fleetfooted Whitfield and as I said once he made that catch Ian Williams wasn't able to get to him nobody else even realize that Whitfield had the ball I was a quick fitting tunnel strength both quarterbacks to sharp Francois four for four 74 yards in his opening drive on play action beyond Drake steps up fires for the pylon under threw he tried to get it over there to my quandary good coverage Carter and Godard Johnson actually a really nice job by that offensive line of keeping a very talented defensive front away from Francois giving him enough time I think he he just held on to that ball a little bit too late he's got to check that down or get out of there and take off that ball is thrown late to Murray and really didn't have much of a chance Galvan stays down and dropped for a loss by Christiaan Wilkins the sophomore from Springfield Mass by this is vistit of great player Wilkins is known as the defensive tackle has moved the defensive end watch him surprise and shoot the gas gap on Rock ruble this time such it's a combination of a power and quickness for a guy that's 310 pounds I think he's one of the top defensive lineman not just to the ACC but the country because of his versatility you can play inside and can play outside and with the injury early in the year loss can Brian it kind of forced him to the edge inside outside he could play often my little team everything you're right I agree with you and he's a highenergy guy on leader and that defense 30:13 now okay dropped the pass rush get after Francois Leland Farrell with his fourth sack of the season and always go backwards they brought everybody here I mean it this is a tough one to deal with you're going to see pressure here here Joseph comes you're bringing a couple linebackers the Nickelback's in ball to the offensive line did not have a chance and when they get you to third down Brent Venables will dial it up and keep you guessing on where it's coming from the loss moves them back out of field goal range so Logan Tyler who could be there long range field goal kicker the freshman's also the punter will try to pin the Tigers deep but that pass rush again 27 sacks from the year now for Clemson 1 at the top of the country Tyler drops the point picks it with backspin and it bounces into the end zone so a touch back they can't get the lucky bounce there and cleansing the back work is Jimbo speaks to the offensive line that's been in frequent theme in recent weeks here he's challenged their manhood before doing it again apparently Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart this Halloween save on candy costumes and more at Walmart and in part light dr. pepper it's a college football tradition and needs a premier partner of the Heisman Trophy Leeson how serious are Charlie Ward holding forth yes great Cisco back to that the pivotal play here where they're able to get a big game you see the tide in moving create some confusion for the Florida State second they're in the back end here the bra mom Lane is one of the safeties that kind of gets confused it opens up the middle there and a huge game Lane is just playing in his third game since moving over from wide receivers they're going to continue to do some pre snap movements to try to affect the youth in that secondary that stuff that is receiver to safety and clean at this kind of level against these kind of receivers whose quarterback there is hunter Renfro the little slot receiver sophomore back in the lineup if you're a broken hand making a quick contribution Sam it's not a good start for the force and defense there but some good news Trey Marshalls back out there official word for my flooded craters if he's fine good to go we need all hands on deck salmon that secondary dome okay that's Williams making the catch a short game there in front of Tavares McFadden that previous throw it's good to see Park back out there to going out earlier but it appeared to be a shoulder injury at the Chum Watson on that long throw to Hunter intro literally as he got rid of the football he got hit low and was able to still get enough on that throw to be able to pick up the first down Sean picks off looks the tackle and slide down near midfield such a tough quarterback to tackle not the fastest as explosive as gallant Lamar Jackson but what an effective runner yeah very very effective and it's just an extra hat for the defense to worry about when DeSean twats and runs like that I mean that's where you're essentially looking at him as a running back and I've been great block by Mitch hire a left tackle that time getting up to the linebacker to really open that up he's now Dean 335 yards rushing you don't include the sacks this year Stallman heavy traffic but he bursts free Gulman top running down to the Florida State 40 and this null defense is reeling early they paid her to a good job of bottling him up because he has live legs when Goldman is waiting to explode and have a big night and you can see he's not going to give up he was just kind of waiting to find a crease and eventually it opened up right behind the big center at the air mo another first down for the Tigers are on a roll here look about taking the emotion of the building handling a rocket home crowd walking up in the air and falls incomplete Noddy was in the vicinity things that Marcus Christmas perhaps got here think it may have been 1991 get his hand up there and that's what you have to do is he's quarterback to get the ball out so quickly is make sure you keep your eyes on him and if you can't get to it you try to time up your leap and get your hand up and knock it down just this is the sort of state defense they played well the last two weeks but it was against Miami and it was against Wake Forest now you're playing this uptempo offense in a spread attack similar offense it hurt him early in the year and you wonder how the communication the back end will eventually hold up which rolls out delivers to Renfro those two offenses Miami wake forces I have a mobile quarterback tackling and when you add the mobile quarterback and the tempo and the variety of the different looks it just makes you a lot to have to think about it a lot of communication to make sure everybody is on the same page there's so many so much communication goes on to the backend and talking about a lot of new faces in that secondary that's what Clinton wants to challenge that you could inexperience along too needed on this third down some frames of field goal range for google Watson fire is low but complete Williams goes down low and beats McFadden they move to six again again Florida State that time on it on a blitz they're playing mantoman and that's just again the quarterback and receiver having a relationship on third down trusting one another waited til Mike Williams cleared the linebacker the nice drawing Layne put it right on the money our save as' Scott true for tourism in his first down game near the 22 yard line they just got I think a great story this year you know he had to move into that slot spot for Hunter Renfro because of his injury and he did it with an unselfish attitude even though he likes the outside position because of those kind of plays and the quick throws he has a lot more production opportunities but he's now back to his familiar role but did not complain it all had a real team attitude about that switch to the inside Watson keeps it nobody on the edge and he just dances around inside the tencel going down inside the pod it was a run all the way we need eventually saved the touchdown it's run all the way because he is reading actually the linebacker attacking Wang Tom and watched him go down now once everybody's attacking down well that makes it very easy for watching to get outside Tigers playing fast unforeseen though watch see lobster friend crow for a touchdown two drives two scores in a strong firstquarter statement number three uptempo attack mode deshaun Watson and complete control running and throwing ten plays 80 yards in those last two plays I think an example one kind of a microcosm of what Florida State's facing the quarterback run gets around the edge uptempo the very next play they loop on a red phone coverage wide open EB Pro for deshaun Watson to me it's good to have Renfro back and healthy the guy was playing with a pass for a broken hand now that's off and he is the guy that he kind of bedeviled alabama in the championship game good to have number 13 back in the mix Tigers rolling right now but Yun watch them dancing around all smiles he started 9 of 10 from Etihad yards he runs and the Tigers have silent the sellout of 14 nothing late first then last Drive Shawn six four seven twenty nine yards the field will left this one bounced the only incompletion of the game was to pass the naughty back to town at the line yeah I thought the last couple plays as I said really an illustration of what forward is safe spacing here they chasing Wayne Gulman he doesn't have the ball on his own read nobody takes the quarterback they go hurry up Florida State's running players on and off the field not quite lined up got three receivers up to the right there's only one defender in that end zone to take three to fit three receivers easy diffusion easy throw for deshaun Watson Charles Kelly back to the drawing board here with his young secondary and young defense try to make sure they got to simplify and let them play fast and for Florida and for Clemson too red zone opportunities and two touchdowns that's something they really emphasized during their bye week Francois back on first down fire is incomplete and miscommunication there you saw how familiar it is reporters say to be down by double digits the fifth time this year they've come back to win two of the previous four against Ole Miss in Miami but if they're not careful here this is beginning to feel more like a little game yeah you're right and I think you know it in your own building and you've got to get something going without becoming impatient I mean it we're just the first quarter here and Jimbo Fisher knows better than anybody that they've got to kind of stick to who they are and what they came in believing would be successful against this defense robux 63 yards of the opening possession Thank You Francois over the middle hi Braham separated from the football is Travis Rudolph Iban Smith's the safety third down and me this is where again his eyes bring this safety eventually over watch how he he kind of telegraph says he's waiting and waiting and steal the safety kind of just read his eyes and moves over with him saw it coming all the entire way and almost stepped in front of that and intercepted the ball and that's just part of the youth still of DeAndre Francois staring down a receiver they're fortunate not picked off by more of a better they're in van Smith we've seen a lot he's actually seen a lot he saw sophomore thought one of the younger guys and then secondary playing very well this season got a hurry play clock at two on third down man Jimbo Fisher's foxy does his quarterback doesn't and spend the time out here never easy to go against the defense this good and then play from behind in the first possession they took the field down seven second possession count 14 and now strata move the sticks tomorrow morning 10:00 Eastern NFL insiders followed by Sunday

countdown he got but 8:15 also on the watch ESPN app after a timeout the nose face of third and ten and face at fierce Clemson pass rush which has been a huge factor already tonight two sacks on the Nola's opening possession Joseph showing pressure again there's a footage up front oh sorry offense number 71 fiveyard penalty go down little quick out of the starting blocks on the edge there by Brock ruble in the null so line looks a little rattled the reason you get rattled on third down is go back to that Brent Venables and how he could attack and blitz in so many different areas Austin Bryant who had foot surgery and August came back in their last game is lined up across from him Tigers are ninth in the country and third down defense they've been top5 each of the last three years he just flip it the cooks on the screen and Alvin will get knocked down at the 25 Tankersley made the tackle here comes upon anytime you fear the pressure and you're thinking about possibility of some mantoman with a blitz eat great time to call a screen or a trawl and put her down and that time they showed blitz they showed man and then they fell out of it and everybody had their eyes on that screen and they were able to rally to the ball there that plate really didn't have much of a chance rayray MacLeod one of the four flips and receivers who comes from the state of Florida and therefore is extra pumped up tonight he awaits the punt of Tyler final minute of a Clemson dominated opening quarter here in Tallahassee rayray won't want to say a lot about not a very good kick and is it any help deshaun Watson the Tigers offense are going to begin in Florida State Territory they'll spot the ball at the 49 yard line after a 25yard shank Wow and knowing Dabo Swinney and and how his offensive staff with Jeff Scott and Tony Elliott think with a veteran quarterback not a bad time the defense kind of has kind of down maybe on their heels a bit maybe take a shot here if you get a oneonone chance you can throw downfield late in this first quarter not a bad time to try to test them vertically in this series John steps up he's thinking exactly what you are Curt takes a shot down the far sideline just over the head of the on Kate did you watch some tape on the team added I'm just study good call you know I figured I think about Florida State the last time their defense was out there they were discombobulated they gave up the touchdown a poor pine boys perfect time for a former wide receiver from Alabama could say hey why not take a shot at time they try to get it to the youngster Deon Kane yeah but was a long run in Alabama Jeff Scott from Yellin his coke play callers that John Gorman is torn in the backfield by Derek naughty Jeff's got one of those coordinators got grew up in Tallahassee of course the son of Brad Scott who is Bobby Bowden's assistant coach here Derick naughty quickness what he can do disgustin en been back here I met his brother they grew up here he said I've never remember watching Charlie Ward play here is like a 13 year old that can yeah you have a fall into place when I win the championship in 93 final seconds of the quarter well they get to play away and look like it now the tiger is a pair of touchdown drives and the fierce pass for us they dominate the opening quarter back after this message and a word from your local ABC station time for the second quarter yes being Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart Washington and Clemson the two best first quarter teams in the country that stays me Tigers with an 86 sigmaj over a hundred from the first quarter discover field goals allowed that's it third possession Tigers now face the third and 11 from their 49 those in desperate need of a defensive stop here Watson nowhere to run drop right at the line of scrimmage there good pursuit from a big number 90 we talked a lot tonight about how Clemson has a great ability to rush the quarterback on third down one area I really think Florida State has improved now that they're healthy up front they can get down to quarterback as well that time Langley rushed three and Brian burns one of the true freshmen that time getting in there to help out as well he's just a pure pass rusher again great athlete range he kid out of Fort Lauderdale first punt for the Tigers here's Andy Keystone trying to fend anoles back Nikon Murray takes over the hump returns roll with Bobo Wilson out tonight with a foot injury mmm makes it fair catch at six so and reprint swap backed up at the Noles credit climb out of a 14point hole good year providing aerial coverage watching over the hard work and determination of lifts were the athletes more than 60 years good your official sponsor of the college football playoff Seminoles Kirk against power five opponents this year have struggled to get the offense going early this just continues a trend 17 possessions no touchdowns in power five opponents in the opening quarter backed up at the seven for their third possession Dalvin cook tryna break free either set the edge pretty well in a sport game doing a great job so far here in the first quarter now working into the second quarter on Dalvin cook it has three carries and only nine yards he said Chris Daniel here six does a good job of the outside of setting the edge so important to be able to do that against his quickness force him back into the teeth of that defense where everybody is chasing him really good game tackling defense we've now set out wine right on second and seven you see pressure here from Joseph hitches and fire the time he was thrown off and it was not on target Tankersley the corner was the closest to it I think he was trying to get the ball to Travis Rudolph but again the timing and the rhythm is just not there right now for Francois he's still kind of searching he and Jimbo Fisher calling plays it's hard when you when you quarterbacks uneasy and unsettled it's hard to really be able to look down at that board and find something you feel really good about right now he's just trying to find that says I said find that rhythm between himself and his wide receivers his third and seven again manda me Lisa vasoactive at nine Becker him showing pressure trying to kind of disguise some looks there bring it he's coming from the pocket a nice far side throw but it's way over the head of Auden say mark fields was over there and coverage its fourth down and they they feel when they lock you up in mantoman that they're going to hold up on the perimeter and be able to get pressure on you to either get you to get sacked or force the ball before you're ready to throw that's exactly what Brent Venables there for that neon hat that's looking to do purple shirt neon athlete you see over here can you not say D you can't tell me why the energy the way I move is the dude going crazy I don't care who wears all black you could spot him right oh man hit him in the way move it now he on had some new to twisted in it at night the set of curls for the night so I fell attend his own end zone and a lefty get the better punt away than last time when he shanked it but again McLeod makes the fair catch in Florida State Territory backtoback possessions at the 37 yarder and to build on this positive start Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought to you by Goodyear hardworking tires that deliver blimp worthy performance and Pacific Life helping generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years there in the upper right there some of the crew members kids modeling their Halloween choices I love that that's beautiful great shot meanwhile was the her streets youngest son over there an exception patch gonna see still gonna loose she's trying to wiggle that loose tooth out this John from the pocket looks at the Gulman and not I'm not blocking out their short gain is an old bring it out to Marcus Walker on the tackle with the Marcus Walker can run any big band and you talk about what a pivotal Drive this is he's the guy that the Knowles turned to for leadership to make sure everybody knows what they get the big drive this Knowles defense exact of the account on number 44 is 35th career start number two in the FBS and facts but they can't get near deshaun Watson to delivers an accurate throw and a catch may have a trivia on Thompson it will be third and very short now they're spreading this defense out just keep in mind that it's Florida State secondary only one Marc Marquez wife is the only defensive backs in play against Michelle Watson in Clemson last year in Death Valley you're playing whether you're good for TV five or six TVs a lot of new faces they're trying to match up against Watson and these receivers and the scheme that they're facing during James can only watch helplessly from the sidelines hoping his guys can get a shot for Watson thrown in a pickup flicked off by Marquess white and that experienced guy Kirk you just refer to and much needed takeaway for this Florida State defense we just talked about how this is urgency this is a big series and who better than white the veteran the senior to be able to come up with him I think he baited him watch him at the top here he actually bathed him to make it look like he's taking this receiver but then at the last second he drops I think he fooled Shawn wanted completely he thought he'd be into flat he thought he had an open receiver but he baked him watch him kind of sick and they drop plate completely fooled Sean walks in a better reporter back and a great keeps team my bad there he got me he got me on that one ninth pick for Watson second of the year for white they don't pick on him very often and he makes Watson thing out see if the Florida State offense finally be some good field position can build on that Francois want the downfield shot on for salmon throws it down there for uno whose interferes with Tankersley guilty of the penalty there's one down at the line of scrimmage as well so two markers down Leland Farrell ran over Francois he threw it I think they have a whole all finish number 72 no penalties Wolfpack horse down so the repeat the play Farrell came after Francois you stood in there with guts and delivered the downfield throws 25 Tankersley here is beaten badly and the reason of all is underthrown is because Francois gets hit right as he throws the ball but Karim are 72 but I think Roderick Johnson 77 also involved in a holding call there are two holds there from Florida states with negate the pass interference and a big break and a big opportunity to get some positive yards short drop in Francois was too far sake complete again coverage is going to draw flying that was mark field covering tape and another pass interference locked up mantoman and you've got good size advantage there with tape Clemson defenders are going to say hey he's got it he's entitled to the ball but there's no question there's contact there by fields this time they do get the pass interference fall fields whose dad Mark was a linebacker in the NFL so the pick by white and now the penalty sets the Noles up at the Clemson 45 of the first down delay handoff use his right bounces off tacklers top eight yard run Dorian Oh Daniel stop them such a beautiful runner that plays designed to the right but to flow the defense is taking away that play so he decided to bring it back to the left again I think he's the best in the country that having the vision and the patience to be able to let just got to get a feel for where that hole is and which way an offensive the defensive line and linebackers how they're flowing and then he's going to cut back and really test your discipline on that back side this is first real positive run book with 16 yards and in sports catch or four carries and now why in a false start all start offense number 81 fiveyard penalty second out sophomore tight end Ryan is Oh guilty of that flag the third penalty on the offensive line slash tight ends for the Noles tonight done including the holding that nullifies the pass interference flood in tennis is it an unforced and for surgery yeah unforced errors when you're playing Clemson can't happen if you're if you're interested in winning the game and upsetting one of the best teams in the country you can't have the unforced error they got the service break if you want to use another tennis analogy to get the ball back that's the other forcedair makes it second and eight that's why again flag comes out there was diz Oh covered there by Buller the linebacker it's going to be another friendly on funky defense Boulware grabbed on to the jersey that time of is Oh yard penalty first down though as a threat of the tide in a you hoops player everybody thinks he should play one sport when you're in middle school in high school all these bigtime college football players most of them playing two or three sports when they're in high school you see bull we're locked in a far bottom right locked up their skirts grabs the jersey but is oh just keeps getting better and better as it tied in running his route an easy call for the officials lose the ball inside the 35 first down cook from the iformation skorts forward for a short game you didn't hear me slide that in there sports you're just a big fan of multi sports for kids I guess I am i I just think it's it's a epidemic kids are playing one sport from their own home you think you can play multiple chords and that can make cavity remains I think it ends up making you at the end of the day a better allaround athlete and whatever one sport you eventually go on to play second and six Tigers jumping around again and another false start false are often number 15 yard penalty second out you know Travis Rudolph doesn't have a catch tonight he's guilty of that penalty he's getting an earful from Jimbo Fisher it's a tough start for the guy who had a monster game against Wake Forest 13 catches in the last game it's Rudolph that moves with the left tackle also and you see Clemson all this yelling and the movement and all these different things that they're doing when it's a long snap count like that it can affect the offensive linemen and the receivers they start guessing when that snap count might be or when they should take off and Quentin's adding to that confusion with all that free snap movement unforced error again second and 11 and sois incomplete trying to get it on a slant there but mark fields broken up against tape they're down now they get to that that third down which is very very tough so far tonight over three and again this is for Brent Venables is very very and not just gifted but he has great skill to work with but he does such a good job of mixing up the looks it's a different look almost every time with how they try to come after you how they try to confuse your offensive line anybody they look funny confused tonight see that late movement right here they come after Francois night clog Murray makes a play and Rory for running free finally making an impact number 80 head meta reception since midseptember four games at a cab could be thought he might make an impact tonight this is what happens when you bring blitzes if you get the ball out quickly there's nobody underneath nice job by Murray I really thought Fields grab the facemask here at the end of the play as he was getting tackled it looks like he grabbed onto that but a good play wellexecuted good job getting the ball out quickly because of that pressure that you face from that Clemson defense with 22 yards and third and 11 Murray's a sophomore from Orlando and he's really been practicing well lately got to see it show up in a game though and the side step traffic in the backfield lost the ball a strong down inside the five guys still jumping on the pile Tigers point in their direction but the ball is in the hands so an offensive lineman Rob Johnson came out of the pile with the ball and the Noles are going to retain it and dodge a disastrous play this is this is crazy because you have ten bodies and wait please see this look from from our camera here where the ball just ends up in between all those bodies at the end of this watch 77 he's looking at them there's no way the ball still loose but watch right in the middle right watch right there see the ball now he goes down and says I'm going to grab won't you up quickly he comes out with it Kareem are the guard has been diving on top of the pile those are playing quick here at second and three after all that excitement whoops got it again hold onto it and barrels in for a touchdown Galvan dodges a turnover and then reaches the end zone what a to play sequencing it all back in it knows back in it they get to stop they get to score and here is the vision again from down the club play is designed to go right but watch this middle linebacker blown his playoff he has to cut back immediately and make that make sense that that's a very quick decision and then run over the safety for the touchdown review Rio 270 seventh consecutive maybe a fee for Florida State kickers as a funky drive after the pick by white they went 60 yards and six plays a whole bunch of penalties almost a fumble by cook inside the five but he caps it off with his short touchdown and they cut in half miss Benson lead Dr Pepper Championship Drive update number seven Nebraska taking on number eleven Wisconsin and Alex Hornibrook by Robert wheelwright capping off a thirst team played 73 yard drive the Badgers look at the hand of Braska their first loss of 1717 third obviously n Reaper be back to you Cassidy thank you which is early already West Virginia and Baylor funk from the ranks of the unbeaten Nebraska pitted trouble on the road finally two booted away Scott bull wants to sail out of the end zone Samantha what do you have it's Chris after that touchdown Jimbo Fisher gathered his entire office together and he was not congratulating them on the sport yuria specifically with his offensive line really laying into his fender Alec Elbert Everly you can see him right there he's challenged this offensive line throughout this season tonight he's been challenging not only their thinking but their execution saying I'm sick of this I imagine some Knoll fans are too but some signs of life from them early tonight as up to their best Drive of the night by the way and a great report because he would think he'd be patting him on the back saying I told you we can do this instead just continuing to challenge them he's been doing it all year watson fix often dragged down after a short game in by the Marcus Walker yeah in the locker room at last game you would down everyone the offensive line are you a man are you a man are you a man then play like one friend's husband so much I was a different kind of thought there yeah and again he's pushing button he's trying to make sure that they're engaged and he's trying to anytime here in the middle of the battle like this good to be challenged specially those offensive linemen on second and seven the completion Watson yes it's a ray ray MacLeod is up near the 40 if you're an offensive lineman Ellis tickets it's that much fun to get an L and they need it it's good for this game it did my heroes tempo here by by Clemson then we moved to stick you can count on this we receive it to the right for they handed up inside Garmin wax still battling you get about four we talked early in this game about the use of the Florida State secondary and how they're going to be challenged by deshaun Watson and before he could blink an eye it was 14 to nothing but think about it was 14 to nothing there was a poor punt that gave Clemson the ball in plus territory three and out with a third down sack next possession Clemson had the ball plus territory interception by Marquez white 27 that's why did got back into this game this defense has really stepped up here and allowed cut the drive so emotions out Watson takes off we for a gain that will set up a third and three Walker again is eckle Charles Kelly has got to be very proud of his group it's all about adjusting contact work with him with this young secondary trying to make sure everybody is on the same page get back books grab the back of that sweatshirt there third down it comes to crowd noise he dropped in the backfield Lynette Sherman Lane the converted receiver who had a rough start to this game makes a big stock good for armand lane here struggled a little bit early he's going to come from right out here and just kind of get around the edge here with his quickness this time it Wayne Coleman did not have a chance there I think the underestimated or just was not ready for how quick lane would get around him but a poor effort by calming to make the block and a great effort by Lane to give him him in his defense a chance to force the punt Kelly's been impressed with how quickly lanes pick things up yeah he's made some mental mistakes tonight against all that motion but this is a guy that perhaps could be an NFL safety if he keeps that and get another year to try to polish those skills these dolts punt will bounce sideways and out of bounds at the 14 yard line another service break by the Noles Deacon love you Tennyson and I appreciate mine folks ready for the athletic trivia questions you bring in a pair Chris Foley K for this week's edition thanks Chris deshaun Watson looking to defeat Florida State for the second consecutive season who was the last quarterback to beat the Noles in consecutive years this question teams have about starting to get back I'm going to get Timmy Tebow trying to hit that knuckleball now a curveball and a focus on the job here that's a good question Francois from the pocket on first down there's a low throw incomplete alright Chris is my partner right here is it is it Tim Tebow time now to answer that athletic uestion and Tim Tebow wasn't if that Fergie we going to meet but the answer is Landry Jones 2010 and 2011 we were here that 2011 game which was actually the last time the Knowles we're not the dog at home oh yeah remember that game so he anticipated the Tebow answer that he fake left yeah right head leg yeah thinking like who is a conference guy obviously right and I thinking it's going to be out of there honey boy should have never thought a language Oh second and 10 there's a strike in traffic and a nice catch may far side it's Rudolph getting involved for the first time tonight even though this ball is thrown them you would think not as accurate if you like look what he throws look at the anticipation with receiver still with his head not turn now it's thrown behind him but because he its overly and anticipated that allowed Rudolph to be able to adjust back to make that catch so you could say it was thrown behind them and a great adjustment by the receiver but give credit to the quarterback for getting it out early that's why Fisher was in third that was an explosive throw out of the quarterbacks hand to putting the sore shoulder the last game now on graphic looking for takedown bill locks it up in a tear acceptance chadar johnson get acquitted tigers and you will just fall down across the 30 it was 18 verses 18 and by the way Christian Wilkins lowered the boom on France woz he got that ball away absolutely you hold on to that football this is what they want to take away nobody picks up Christian Wilkins and he's just going to hit him right there coming down with 310 pounds but how about the range again a j'adore Johnson boom that's a big hit from Wilkins knocked the helmet off of Francois a quarterback has been hit more than anybody in the country okay Johnson Jonason he he the same thing against Lamar Jackson in Louisville he had such range to be able to close ground and go up and make a play and man humming it's well been a long year for the pressure he's crawling around trying to find a helmet to that pit calming about first and main make a good point about the leaping ability of Johnson he's about six foot again it's a 65 receiver esky and took the football away I mean I think it did secondary from Clemson they lost three starters everybody thought they would take a step back if anything I almost feel like they're even more sound on the back end this year Sean fires it's made by Williams who weaves his way in the Seminole territory by the way you saw a shot of him Knowles trainers talking to Francois who appeared to be yet again in pain after a big shot and Shawn Maguire better loses backup Buffington as well fortunately the familiar role that this young quarterback has been and you can just see is 310 pounds coming down on him with momentum guilty Gizem almost like his ears are ringing this when he's trying to communicate there Matsu keeps it clip slides his way to a nice gain to the 30yard line they've done Watson moving the chains again with a tramble well that is great the zone read great great decision here by deshaun Watson tonight in his own read scheme the outside linebacker defensive end came down and at next level safety that time he was AJ Westbrook just diving a missed tackle gave him another 8 to 10 yards now the chess game must go then carves in the bar cycle all kinds of symbols what the Xiang can make of that but I'm sure he knows with it miss he there's a whistle now before the snap a lot of teams use those cards let me he's got about as elaborate as set as did some dominoes over there number 51 penalty I know Taylor Hearn got confused look at this Superman Elvis young Elvis graduation cab Golden State Warriors new captain's made the car birth Vader Prince Flintstones to file that is decree is worth versatility those scholarship position someone gets the tutu besides we're going to use young elders this week the young Elvis card yeah put a caste hover for a studio update Cassidy career Taco Bell studio update back to Madison and after the jump around the back Nebraska jumped back was in for Tommy Armstrong Jr with the 2 yard run 1714 Wisconsin in the fourth on ESPN much more on the halftime report with San Mac and Mark back to you guys the game that you talked about how much Armstrong has improved as a sort of a friendly to us Kurt yeah I really know not turning the ball over there running still but their passing game is becoming a different part for your starters second year in that Mike Riley system meniscus by the way digit Columbus next Saturday night on ABC worse than 15 after penalty Lawson delivers both grow underneath estimated by a Leggett as they take advantage of the cushion one of the one of the few zone plays that we've seen the Shawn Watson instead of getting greedy and trying to go down to it says his first and 15 will try to pick up 9 or 10 yards and give ourselves a chance here on second down those Noel's corners have said how much they hate twins on both wife and McCloud so we came here to play mantoman that's how we played in high school we don't like playing zone Watson I'll protect the try to get to Renfro who got tangled up and now if white comes in a couple of them frame Marshall and the slot receiver is going to be an old penalty well that is a favorable matchup for the Shawn Watson with Renfro matched up right there just crabs on to him try Marshall known really more for his physicality than being isolated oneonone against a very quick footed punter Renfro and for one of those savvy guys he was a high school option quarterback unrecruited but believed he could play at this level knows every out there in and out of that slump position as an obvious call but he also sold it very well yeah yeah he did he did he just said I'm not going to be able to get to where I need to go I'm just going to fall at contact and as you go down in contact when you're in the middle running around most official is going to call that pass interference and holding after the consultation the determine that pass was catchable so it is a penalty and tigers knocking on the door again at the 13 Watson keeps it yes the quarter and scoots down down at the 6 yard line again as you said a lot of number for running the ball tonight and again it's it's own read he ran one earlier this time he's going to reach out to Sweat right here's his read Josh sweat actually doesn't quite completely declare to Angola but because he is so quick with his decision he's able to outrun him to the corner and still pick up positive yards second and three two tight ends in the game watch the pump fake throwing us a to the corner way with a head of Williams who was locked up with Marquess white sir down you've got to florida state defenders assigned to Mike Williams they get inside at 15yard line and you know that Williams is one of the best threats in the red zone because he is another former basketball player six three tremendous fall skills and being able to go up and time it or say they don't very often leave one defensive back matched up against it this time they bring in a true freshman again live a chance to lamonta Kalin guys about five eight look out at the top of the screen there Ishod spots it no doubt about that and looks that direction and now throws a slam for Williams misfires its fourth down Watson ends up on his back side as DeMarcus Walker got to him because of the experience at Watson has that's one of those if the defensive back is up tight there we're going to run the spade and try to beat him to the corner but when he's at thought save up at the top how soft he is let's try to work the slant because it's easy to get to the middle and they're just not quite on target you see the pressure there from Walker may be a reason why the ball wasn't quite as accurate a good goal he saw 44 barreling down on a great cue go again a big stop there by for Jeff Green great new double credit convert big ship shot field goal with those old school double goal posts here at dokey ml city which chance to love right you see those two many places by the only place I can think of Baton Rouge so have those two double goal posts there I don't know we'd have to do they do I can set a few minutes at 17 7 now Tuesday night at 7:00 on ESPN exclusive reveal of the first college football playoff top 25 rankings Greece and the gang Kirk will join with the coaches reactions as well as a live interview with the new Committee Chairman trivia Hoka seven o'clock Eastern Tuesday night on ESPN a year ago when these rankings came out of course Clemson was ranked number one they were number one in all six editions of the standings Alabama took over number two with week two and of course they eventually collided you get a name your top four before we go off the air tonight is your play off yeah see the results but I think sometimes people panic when that when the first rankings come out and I think last year when the rankings came out you know only one team that was in the top four it ended up being in the top four so teams are going to come off even though it seems like right now there's four teams and they're locked in this hold on there's still some games and still a lot of things that will happen upsets are definitely down the line seemed like Louisville which was one of the nine oneloss teams coming into today which survived an escape in Charlottesville a late touchdown pass they still need to keep more of these undefeated teams to get knocked out Whitfield friends inside the end zone builds up steam quickly and spins out to the 22 yard line a minute 44 before halftime with an almost read of chip on this 10point lead we're bringing you this week's AP rankings Alabama off of course LSU is coming up next brace either their trip to LSU Michigan actually a fairly competitive game today to East Lansing I thought that one might get ugly see the rest of the top ten Ohio State late field goal by Texas spoiling Baylor's perfect record in West Virginia as Mason Rudolph had a big ball game for the folks yeah when in Stillwater with the top two teams in a big 12 go down and makes it kind of wonder how the committee will handle that on Tuesday miss Fisher handle this twominute drill Francois downfield just off his fingertips thus often were covered by a freshman kayvon Wallace and they really like cave on Wallace they think he's maybe their best press part of it okay that time got beat early had a crap onto the Jersey there under the shoulder pad and Marie still got behind him Jimbo Fisher literally has been telling Chris tonight since Labor Day night and we were getting ready for the Ole Miss game that night Juan Murray is going to do some special things throughout his career maybe starting this year and with the injury to Bobo Wilson he's going to get a chance tonight and we've seen him play a lot more tonight than we have for any of the previous games guys mature different levels he's not maybe the most mature guy when he got here but he's growing up quickly and trying to make an impact Francois trying to escape the pressure and he does get out of the pocket just gets tripped up as he gets across the 30yard line and the man who tripped him off is down Kendall Joseph made a tackle that prevented a first down he's up and moving around now when the third is short one of the few times we've seen Francois step up in the pocket and have some room to run they're going to give him the first down there with that effort and you're ready tops on earth and now Joseph is going to limp off there so keep an eye on that key part the leader that defense the ball magnet play is under further review they'll just make sure that that was a good spot but initially with a market it was going to be third down yeah they placed it at the 32 so then as for reading the reply official we'll take a look at this and there look let's see where the ball is when France was knee hits I think it's short I think I think that was a pretty generous but the ball still in the air when the knee goes down and then it lands at the 30 wait what happens is he kind of slides and you know where he touches I don't think he's quite down there but where he ends up sliding is where they actually see right there they swear I think they may have spotted the ball but it still would only be put down by short I said it so often of his Noel's played from behind so frequently in these games you've had if they can get some momentum they can get the points find a way to get something out of his last drive get the ball to begin the third quarter perhaps sweet momentum absolutely that's what Jimbo pitchers thinking and especially with how hard I've said it so many times how hard they work at their twominute drill timeouts minute 31 that's a nobrainer you're trying to get points on the board and get that ball back to start the second half grunts y7 4:16 in this first half hundred nineteen yards did throw the interception to Johnson Capital One halftime report Stan director mark may Mac Brown get you updated on what's going on around the midnight games I like to the day games wonder if they woke way to the real series score I know it's thought short of the line of game it will be second anyone of all be placed at the 31 yard line to be third part and I think yeah they differ with Jeff he sir he's in charge down there but I think it's third down affect the district they got the spot right there going to come over the down marker is now yeah they got a rollover over there the far sideline here we go correction keep going back to the booth to make sure it's there down it was the Clemson defense a chance to arrest both both units a chance to plot and plan for this 2minute drill it's got a place can you call to protect French Watford that's the key thing isn't it this point laughter first of all you get the first down you either quarterback sneak or you run Galvan cook to get your first down clock will stop no need to rush things or use a timeout and then you already have that next play called so you get lined up quickly and I think it's a matter of beer it'll be third down and one correctly thank you Jeff we're that it had to be a bit except for this big third down play and since that that hot start Francois with heavy pressure being a big part of that three for 12 cook in the I formation on Stephenson Davin's got the ball and he's battling he's battling hard it's going to be very close looks like they're trotting in to give him a first down spot it was all it was all down and cooked it wasn't to blocking on that left side he would stop short it looked like other tre Lamar the true freshman got in there but they've given the first down and now it's a matter of getting the ball out there Venables going to come after you you got to get the ball out of your hands quickly and find the matchup that you like if you're Francois kind of open slot receiver to his left throws down feel walking for Murray who makes the catch Jimbo Fisher said keep an eye out this is his breakthrough night and Murray makes a huge play to the 20 silk but he picked him up nobody reroutes him or slows him down he's at full speed what an adjustment back to the ball though advance myth tried to defend it exactly right that was a terrific adjustment a 40 yard gain you still have the two timeouts don't spend one there and Francois fires near sideline gets made and out inside the 10 is Whitfield its first and goal whether these receivers are getting some separation they're actually giving DeAndre Francois and opportunity because of the way they're breaking off away from that mantoman coverage from this secondary offense of Clemson forty yard gain a 23 yard game clock still ticking after they moved to change nose with those two time outs as francois fires to the end zone incomplete murray was wellcovered didn't come down with it 23 seconds left interesting to take a quick peek at dish that is well timed by Francois and Murray ball is thrown now it's a matter of where is that left foot right right toe maybe yeah that's it maybe a touchdown that is a touchdown it's filtered on the big Jumbotron that is a big time for Francois Everly a seed and it was thrown before Murray got out of his break this kid anticipates for a freshman that was think about we should go back and show the hit that he took some Christian Wilkins earlier in this game and then he's going to come back and make a throw like that look at that throw Dennis reading in the booth is ticklish that is the toe down that look the right toe down when he's got possession before the left foot lands out about that's the keys it is the right watch the right toe right there now it's I think it's a nobrainer I think both attacks you look good yeah and then great till it's pill down well before the left foot touch that's a touchdown he's right the front of the official who's looking at possession but it's tough to watch the ball and the feet from where he was positioned there yeah but to me I think he had control I think he completed the process to the catch I would agree and if so it'll be the first career touchdown for Naik Juan Murray and it would cap off an impressive drive from the quarterback after further review receiver maintained possession Chris I go back to this all the time it's because we've seen it Jimbo Fisher's offenses are included is anybody at the end of the half at the end of the game because they work it harder than anybody good against good and it's a inyourface kind of practice when they go in on a Thursday and it pays off put in this kind of situation if the Aquatics it a threepoint game at 23 seconds an absolutely breathtaking array of throws made by Francois in that drive after all he's been through in his birthday think about what we're showing shots earlier and he had it that Danes look he's looking over Shawn Maguire like yeah I got something going on I don't know why I got hit and I don't even know where I am and now here he comes again showing that toughness and to be able to come back this was earlier in this Drive where he makes a big fro seeing his receivers this time is Whitfield getting some separation giving them a chance and then this throw right here is just big time on both ends the quarterback and the concentration from Murray who again Jimbo Fisher has been warning us about the entire year get a fun the guy arrives with potential the hypes recruit he shown things in the practice field but he's been immature so lots of lessons to learn and the coach promises if he has been for a while but that's going to show up one Saturday night and this is the night the night Quan Maria finally emerges as a college football player yeah hey they definitely need him remember Bobo Wilson not in there tonight the veteran is out somebody and it's receiving four had to step up and it's been Marie and again Francois I don't know how you make those throws it downfield adjustment made by Murray for Vista the shorter for than 10% you can see all the things that Jimbo Fisher has been telling us about but Chris I got to go back again and give a tip of the cap to the Florida State defense remember they had first and goal and they forced that field goal only giving Clemson three points doing their job there to be able to keep this Florida State team in this game so as much as we want to talk about Francois and Murray in this offense really it's been about Charles Kelly's defense making adjustments after they gave up 14 very quickly they've really done a nice job here the rest of his tough first half exactly if you touch down drive they had a pick it now they had a free out and I had that stock to force the red zone field goal the service breaks we talked to the health and the Noles you'll get the football and begin the second half now down only three and now you have momentum you score at the end of the half the defense has done their job now not just the offense it's the office it's the defense here at home you get the ball to start the second half now there's a whole different energy because of that score going in at half yeah all the energy and the intensity you've expect from Clemson at Florida State July 1714 Tigers Sam ponder will speak with Jimbo Fisher white after these messages have been the guys the halftime show young well Americans look at me something Lady Gaga's setting us up for that second half PS being Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart and it's ACC collision on ESPN 1714 Clemson John Watson got off to a very fast start that had the Seminoles on the ropes but the home team fights back with 14 points in the second quarter Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit don't worry no no I know it's Halloween I was no zombies coming after you this son or not like this the whole hahahaha the Dell halftime stats Momsen did have those two impressive drives but a little problem on third down they're just two of seven if you want to quibble I've been impressed with it it's kind of been in a game of adjustments Clemson it looked like wow they're all offenses on fire and in Florida State's defense kind of settled in and then at the end of the half I think Florida State was able to gain some momentum they haven't been able to run Dalvin cook at all I mean he is off to a slow start in the first half just eight carries in 33 yards so they really had to do it through the air with Francois almost 200 yards passing in that first half what a difference in last year membered Alvin had 111 yards in his first two carries against Clemson yeah they really bothered him up other than a big bucket a couple teams and he was able to find him Google boots it deep Whitefield robach rental and take a knee our Pacific Life game summary it's really been an interesting first half because of the quarterback play early from deshaun Watson see the first couple drives who strike down the field 19 plays just like that two touchdowns and 14 to nothing crowd was out of the game and then give court a state credit their defense I in there gave the ball back to the Envoy Francois who's just been battered Christian Wilkins they're lowering the boom and he's just kind of settled in and like he's done all year he takes a beating and he just keeps coming back and that toughness is why Florida State's only down three and with the ball to start the second half see if they can build on that momentum Francois was just breathtaking throwing the football and that drive at the end of a half then they get good going just a lot of traffic here on that left end extra Lawrence the freshman combining with middle linebacker Joseph yeah good to see Kendall Joseph back out there late in the first half we weren't sure how serious his injury was but he's right back out there next to bin bull we're such a great tandem in the middle of that Clemson defense those two linebackers especially against the run big part of the reason why Cooke is yet to get on track second intent Francois tries to get the ball to the tight end is oh very well covered by Joseph nothing there anyway to be third down and one of the resolve Sam's report about the center LRV watch the center here get pushed back right into the quarterback that is just physicality from Dexter Lawrence and that's where you got to be concerned if your Florida State with Alec Everly is a sophomore bit undersized against some big men in the front in the middle of that Clemson defense Jimbo says that Clemson doesn't do with a bunch of speedy edge rusher they just muscle you can collapse the pocket with the pass rush this time they feel bad but fighting clawing driving and gets the first down what a collision there with Ben Boulware against Alvin cook two of the best in the country and if you can't get in the ball running get it to him out of the backfield make a linebacker make a play Joseph misses extra effort there's been bull where they meet right at the first down marker that's correct effort and leg drive by both guys but it's cook who ends up winning it just by enough for the first down how great is that battle Curtis give us a first down or punt right there yeah you guys showing their determinants to Bulls going against each other there Alvin's got it again it's been much more effective as a receiver this year than last year really has a complete skill set Sunday ready would you say oh yeah yeah and just tough top guy has everything you're looking for and a running back in the year we have a lot of great individual back there a lot of them who have have a lot to offer but Dalvin cook at 511 about 215 pounds has been playing since his freshman year they've been leading a hundred yards exactly to make it a third consecutive thousand yard season up it gets busy in the second half to get there tonight but you know he's going to reach that this year only seven backs in the history of this conference I've ever had three thousand yard seasons gotta hurry they snap it at one cook cut back gets hammered about three yards short of a first down the Brent Venables made a great point to us this week about trying to defend out and cook he said you have got to be consistent because look they at 30 minutes of great football and defending a nice pension eight carry 33 yards all it takes is one carry where you're out and out of getting admits that gap he'll find it and it's 60 yard 70 yards Jim in the blink of an eye so you can go from having a great night to givin up a big one just like that it happened early last year was it's the second play of the game when he bolted 75 made a house call hasn't had the big run yet tonight and that was Clemson first hard timeout Clemson Venables didn't like something kirk in that free snap look and he ran down called a timeout so both sides talked about it there is the intense defensive coordinator with Tigers those unbeatens are falling on the road today earlier it was West Virginia then Baylor Nebraska moments ago lost in overtime and other whiteknuckle finish in Madison to the Badgers 23:17 in Boise State goes to Laramie and goes down hard to the Pokes by two on a Craig Bohl the job he's done since coming over from North Dakota State that's probably the biggest surprise of the floor Nebraska battled their tails off today in Madison came up a little bit short I don't expect him to fall very far from that seven spots are already at françoise it's broken up this time out there on third down comes his defense yet to stop and ghrelin Ferrell got after the quarterback again the middle linebacker this time comes on the Blitz zone pressure where they bring the linebacker and drop the defensive end here's Francois getting hit but I think what the fans are reacting to is the ball and the receiver the defensive in that time Ferrell dropped in coverage and kind of got tangled up with Rudolph it's a big stop for Clemson's defense the nose that moved in near midfield McLeod standing at his 15 Sylar exists it's one step hoots that deep McCloud left the town and this time the Knowles coverage team will it bleed out at the 5yard line of Watson be backed up his first possession of the second I have a 51yard punt talk about how they drop the defensive end on that third down play create some confusion he gets kind of tangled up and crabs Rudolph after the planning some fans thought it had gotten ahold of this facemask and clearly by the replay shows he did not that's a big man at coverage hidden it when you drop it in zone read at 6'5 265 pounds taking the underneath route that's what the address what they made after the timeout by Venable there works that well Watson standing at his own goal line you still got it and they're all over it obviously a halftime conversation about not letting number 4 hurt him with the Scramble sweat Hoskins were there and his own Reid didn't hurt him a lot in the first half and want something he was looking to do there he just didn't have time with get the ball to Deon Cain who was going vertically down the sideline for a touchdown if he had time to throw Janet alone again members the Marcus Christmas it'll be third down again can't get to him time it up this because of lines bent a very good job we see Nadi do it now Christmas ball you know it's coming out fast with him backed up near his own goal line good athletic play by 310 pounds defensive lineman onca delivers bars what a strike on third down is Cain gets free and they move the chains could have been an even bigger play that ball has to be thrown on a line because the safety that's coming over it's one thing to beat the man on you but the safety coming over if you don't throw that on a line that ball is going to be either knocked away or your receiver could be really hit hard there was a great throw by Watson 99 yards on that one now it's got the walk on the edge Florida State was dead last in allowing the highest percentage of opponents plays to be 20 plus you are dead laughs coming in that's only the second explosive play comes as created and I think really in the first four weeks for the season is where they gave up the majority though the last two weeks where they streamline their package played a little bit more sound on the back end but that was a killer there on third down and give up that first half with Clemson backed up so team we will have 33 passes of 20plus yards this season and that's another completion to Scott for a first down that's one of those plays you get into the fourth quarters you want to remember to put a star next to that one because it's 1714 the crowds in the game if he doesn't hit that pass they punt from their own end zone Florida State the very least gets great field position now not only to get out from their own a shadow of their own in now there's near midfield and got another first down because how much they trust him now he rewards that trust with that throw now here's the downfield shot and it's caught by Kane who just ran right past market Lewis and the Tigers are down threatening again that's the rhythm you like to see from the Shawn Watson he gets back what a great job by Kane using his hands against Lewis he gets back on top of him on the route once he gets around him and puts the ball right there for Kane to make the play get 40 yards now pitch it in your side drop McCloud couldn't come up with it we are airing it out here on this try beginning their first possession of the second half the way they started the ballgame efficient it with number four on target 80 the 25 to 29 for Watson a touchdown and if it doesn't confuse you down here at the bottom only two defenders County work Moxon look left we flee and took off at a flag and a false start before the snap false start offense number three fiveyard penalty David Scott he was looking over you know how sometimes clemson goes tempo they go fast and other times they kind of fake that uptempo look and they all look over well everybody was ready to snap the ball David Scott was thinking that they were going to flash those cards again for the different play so he wasn't even set up tempo is so effective often for the Tigers in the red zone but this time has created a drop and now a false start and they're backed up second and 15 John still got it woof ticket for the endzone read through a jump Austen complete three Marshall recovered to break it up you know that was one of those who don't know they're trying to get the vault and legged who he's matched up against the linebacker or they're trying to get it to Renfro because there's legged and there's sprint row coming back to it obviously hits off of his chest but yet two receivers there somebody's not in the right spot and you got two receivers in the same area just through the hands of Marshall that is enough to perhaps this track Renfro third and 15 the song will be chased down and the null defense makes another red zone stop as the Tigers March it 77 yards of his Jacob few field goal attempt coming up another job another job here by Florida State Quentin moving the ball and this time when nobody picks up you that's what Charles Kelly liked to be able to get pew and sweat also the Marcus Walker all in the field together rushing that quarterback along with Brian burns bugle super reliable inside of 40 34 for a sixpoint lead no problem but I think Jimbo Fisher and Charles Kelly would take that after a promising start to the drive for the tiger is it stalls in the red zone the lead is up six Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought to you by dr. pepper it's a college football tradition chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich and pull we go further so you can Bank of Florida said Alpha Chi Omega 's Gary Hall team captain therefore they're carving last night Halloween in Tallahassee it wants to be a Monday right yeah I'm sure you'd be more festive if the nulls can pull out a victory here it's already started Halloween 10play 78yard drive to 55 Tigers as you go pump the lead up to six Wickfield from his six we get the top speed very quickly that he runs into a bunch of Clemson Tigers and we send it back to Cassidy hover for the studio update thanks Chris as you guys mentioned a couple more unbeatens go down to brass to wisconsin in OT Huskers down six unfortunate launch it incomplete Wisconsin wins abrasca with their first loss now Boise State also no longer perfect but a safety would be the difference Brett rip and fumble recovered by Wyoming and the Cowboys win 32:28 Chris Harvey back to you yesterday thanks ed of the unbeatens on the road one today Michigan Washington now poor have lost and plums in the last one in action here and a big winner there is maybe Western Michigan from the group of five with Boise State going down francois rolls out want the downfield shut now throws and Mike what Murray will draw another flag mark fields and coverage get there a little bit early the official says is a bangbang play with the official standing right there there's been a lot of bad lling on the edge tonight between the DBS and the receivers a lot of flags in that area pass interference defense football be placed at the spot of the foul horse out feel to sophomore at Clemson fields they have four guys as corners that can really cover Tankersley in fields and Edmond and Carter see fields keeps it a little bit early and close really close kind of gray area he couldn't believe it heard what you see in an average college football game that wasn't a ton of time for a flag on the edge it show blitz up the middle just clogging things up and nowhere for Galvin Ronnie loses a yard Sam Chris Sabo Sweeney told me he was really disappointed in his defense specifically his pass defense something that may even be more of a difficulty now because they are playing without strong safety j'adore Johnson who has a leg injury we haven't seen him yet in the second half he's been taken to the locker room I saw him trying to run behind the bench very gingerly and kept only telling athletic trainers no not good so I don't think were going to see him back out here tonight pink lost him he's the guy that made that acrobatic pick of Francois in the first half is the leader back there the playmaker having an outstanding season the senior all start offense fiveyard penalty second down Jimbo's been lighting up the offensive line for mental mistakes just like that it's frustrating go back real quickly chat our Johnson who's filling in this year for Iran curse who went off to the NFL early TJ Green Kinsey Alexander three starters incredible that this defense lost eight starters last year to the NFL off the deep just the defensive side of the ball the sixteen starters in the last two years 14 are on NFL rosters and yet you look at this defense you can make an argument of this this groups as good as the last two years they think they're better you're right yeah why they're trying to find is oh tonight there is a another flag down it's one on the far side illegal shift offense penalties decline slow down you had one receiver in motion while the other receiver at the top was actually trying to set himself and the manage I was right there those are the things we talked about in the first half it's one thing if the team is better than you or your execution is off it's another thing when you're having false starts and mental errors that's inexcusable third is 16 hammer down Austin lion who'd met a foot injury and missed almost the entire season announces his return but it is great to see him back after that foot surgery in August look at the quickness it's great to see that back he's able to get around the right tackle Brock ruble good doesn't have a chance it's a hand smacking rubles hands down that gave him the edge and that bend you know I'm Bryant with the loss of Shaq Lawson and Kevin Dodd he was expected to be their best rush defensive end but with the injury he's had to sit out and wait his time he missed six games and now he's back and making his presence felt Tigers with a fierce pass rush now three sacks tonight 28 on the season you look at no sack differential how many you make for something you give up it's a huge stat underappreciated stat because these are big yardage losing plays Clemson right up there near the top and sack differential rush three on that play and got to the quarterback that quickly luxury and cloud is the returner at the 40 I could feel back to set up a return it's a low kick the bounds could have a chance if he can escape but he goes backwards and is dropped way back at the 32 yard line so a loss on the return and excellent coverage down there from the nola special team now well don't be physical we're going to be violent we're going to be clean but we're gonna play smart the man who can be physically tough and violent but still keep his wits and thinking process the information that's the guy comes out on top your mind control your mind it will control everything else and you gotta water able use the inside access to 3game message from Jimbo Fisher importance of not making those mental mistakes and a big emotional game of cloud around the left end ground for season Kirk we've seen Fischer try to push the motivational putters of a young team the Showtime series is excellent you want to see how hard it is to play this sport at this level mentally and physically it's an excellent program Jimbo coach is hard a bit of challenging year Brandon you said oh yeah especially when the goal is to win every game it's the expectation right here yeah second down watch the throws a pick once again in timorous McFadden the nation's leader in interceptions he's got his sixth pick of the season and a seven over in business in plus territory second pick for Watson tonight the second time a defensive back prick deshaun Watson you don't see that very often white earlier baited him now you're going to watch the corner right here watch him kind of I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I'm gonna blitz and deshaun Watson expecting blitz because of that he throws it right into the arms of McFadden he's expecting the Blitz and if he blitz it's got as a side adjustment where the quarterback gets the ball quickly to Mike Williams but he baited him he faked it and it drops back into coverage another bigtime play by this Knowles defense and his young secondary Lawson will shake it off that's disappointing for him because gives it all the chance to take the lead with the touchdown now the 43 of the Tigers first down watch him set up back block to get to the X distance Dalvin cook and one run who he is sets the block up visit Kali to run through an arm tackle and the speed to be able to take it all the way to the house now while the p80 to give the Seminoles the lead on the ropes early blocked by two first quarter Bunsen touchdowns exhale all night and suddenly with a 43yard bolt by number for the Seminoles have the lead midway third quarter set up by McFadden's six sick of the season right they've destructed okay we'll sit him thanks the Dalvin cook when his first doesn't carry it in a total of 40 yards and then scooted 43 for the goahead touchdown the Seminole skirt has 14 points off of those to be shot Watson interceptions which put him in this game and giving him the lead do not expect the Tigers to panic they've been in so many of these both side games but they are in a battle all of a sudden playing from behind for the first time because his deep and he's got six today what a run huh bigtime run counter action you could have pulled a backside guard and also to tide in pulling around but what I really want you to watch is how patient Dalvin cook is he knows right now he could panic and run to the edge but instead he waits in here to pulled in safety in this linebacker and watch by that hesitation and then taking it to the edge it gives him a chance to be able to get out there and outrun the pursuit of that defense using that upper body strength to pull away from an arm tackle and then his feed to take it into the house the one number for McFadden makes the pick that sets up the touchdown run by the other number four Watson number four let's to shake off that pit and get back to his brew system and running left at times tonight Shawn sets and drives rings perfectly in rhythm right on target but those toothpicks have been very costly exam less I made an interesting point this week he's like in a world can we just kind of we got to finish drive to the red zone we got to protect the ball the two games against Louisville an empty space they had a lot of yard but they struggle in five turnovers against Louisville four turnovers against NC State and that affected their their kind of rhythm and potential those days and I felt the turnovers have been costly against zalman first through first down near the 40 I'll try to reestablish the running game that's what you go back to is not just running away in common but also deshaun Watson who's had a lot of success tonight running the football himself let's write up his own read day fires at dark and Renfro in the Florida State Territory and put a tray marshal and when in doubt you go to hunter Renfro he's got a lot of great receivers but I think the guy he trusts the most on certain routes and I think the guy that he has the best timing with Hunter Renfro you could also maybe say our Tabas Scott when it comes to those short intermediate throw and for walks you want the head to the sidelines here vomit again better for season four in America all around Suns in reserves at the different style receivers weapons they can present I think the depth and versatility and how it fits into their scheme it's probably about as good as you can find and we mixing the potential of Wayne common and deshaun Watson running the football to go along with today include lady the tight end in man Stephen as well sure Watson steps up quickly escapes the pocket a flag is down and he's knocked down that's the 4503 you'd expect the holding ball hope I miss Wyatt the left tackle holding office number 75 in your family second out on up against a Marcus Walker the great defensive end pass rusher will be right in front of you here 44 trying to get the deshaun Watson and Pius locks up perhaps him around the common neck there Walker causes all kinds of nightmares for offensive tackles in this conference another big ball game tonight at the senior making his 35th start so third and 20 the second plane corrected it now Watson throws into traffic it was a dangerous green attempt to Renfro and our third down oh the double screen he had a screen off to his right and he was kind of baiting trying to bait the defense and then blindly just turned and threw to his left timing was off watch him looked at his right our left initially and if it turns it grows trying to get it to Renfro and very fortunate if it's on habeas check the true freshman linebacker in Houston he almost came up with an interception they team could be able to take maybe to the end zone Tigers 3 of 9 on 3rd Watson Pritchard gifts it away but it's incomplete coming quickly with Josh sweat and the Knowles are going to get the ball back up one what an amazing group of pass rushers walkers in the middle sweat is out here they were Walker the defensive end to nose guard what a great job he does burns gets in there wet gets in there rush for sit back and down and you can get after him as if you're blitzing because of the speed and athletic ability those pass rushers the Marcus Walker is one of my favorite players in the country how he plays the effort he gives the leadership such a wonderful guy to talk to he pours out his heart when o'clock Steve shares a lot and he is tapping off his career Porter's day was a tremendous senior season and you'll be seeing him on Sundays high punt and a fair catch made on the third a ticket of Sunday's ten o'clock on ESPN NFL insiders followed by Sunday NFL countdown right up to kickoff and on Monday Night Football the Vikings and the Bears Chicago sports fans are going to need some that think about emotionally the Bears because the Cubbies are not getting it done and Wrigley against the drive down it's gonna be down 31 they are one more wrinkly take them in watt bottom eight the by crisp and then you're down a C bounceback week to the bikes right the Seminoles for the first time have the football and the lead but Francois pressure to immediately somehow a voyage is Sat from from Joseph who barreled in there but then it dropped watch ever lead in center I don't know who he's blocking watch the center he goes to his left then block anybody in was quarterback or Dalvin cook luckily stepped up there to try to slow down the blitzing joseph threw himself at the line deck you know what after the pounding that his young freshman quarterback taken not just tonight but all year we can appreciate Dalvin cook trying to throw himself out there to slow down a blitzing linebacker but the center Everly moves left doesn't see the Blitz coming at all from his right only a twoyard loss could have been worse now Boulware bliss is up the middle they pick him up and once again the quarterback is just back after the throw I know any more shots can this guy play I don't this is Dexter Lawrence another 300 and this time 40 pounds watch him he sheds his block it Street boom BAM that's the worst part of it you get hit and then you can't land it on watch Lawrence true freshman and these are clean hair those aren't blade hits look at trains watch that exactly caresses whether he's landed on top as you can yeah you're allowed to do that then how he dealt well swing it needs 12 on this third down now me back off the only rush three Rory's got it but not much Tankersley drags him down and once again after our disrupting that possession and the Tigers get the ball back that play right there is a great example of not necessarily getting of a sack but Dexter Lawrence who is better than advertised if you can believe that one of the top prep players a year ago he just pushed Alex Everly that time again right to the feet of the Andre Francois and when you can get to the quarterback that quickly boy what what an advantage makes it so challenging to execute come up with a first down the Fisher was telling us sometimes that the kind of full pass works that collapses the pocket is tougher for a QB they're just one speedy guy off the edge you can dodge right in front of you and prints why is it six five and they lift them at six this has been going on all year for him and started right there at mark came back Dale minute back at his hometown on Labor Day night he got a pummeling Louisville almost decapitated him all day against Louisville Miami we remember what happened a couple weeks ago here that was a that was a little bit late which was it called but you can see his face Teredo they when he went out of the game and in tonight because Dexter Lawrence Christian Wilkins has had a few shots on him I mean dude ng for Wake Forest knocked him silly in the last game every opponent is had it's worth a free run Francois now Watson he can't escape he's going to be fast and the Noles pass for a certain to flex sweat get in there quickly again and naughty as well those 20 now here an injury missed a few games was hampered and slowed and now he has tremendous power for a 250 pound ER coming off the edge Noddy came in there and cleaned it up a gift credit the job sweat they're off the edge there's a flag second and 15 complete from the legis and cephalopods came back signaling false start illegal for mixing offense I'm in the bathroom fishers say your mind your mind is gonna decide this game both teams have had those kind of mental errors in this frenetic emotional type game not a surprise really and by the way you're going up against some really skilled guys on the other side of the ball sometimes affects you as much as the mental approach to the game is the physical physical law aspect of the game second 20 gone and fixing inside handoff so battling spinning and fight back across the 30 it will be third down the only about nine here it's a good tough run for Goldman now give him a chance here on this third down breaking some tackles they're good to see him back up to that big head against the Wolfpack a few weeks ago into the concussion protocol and passed all his tests we'll be back out here tonight with this John can make of all those symbols here on third down it's an old fruit the pressure cookers showing it and they back out and watch this down the far sideline over shoots cane they left white on an island the mark was does enough hold them up if that's the throw you're going to give up if that's in oneonone challenge you're going to give to deshaun Watson you work for Florida fake you like your eyes it's third down and long young Keynes talented but it's a senior corner one on one the ball is overthrown and good for Florida State you rather see that throw then you know crossing round at ten or fifteen yards so the series began with a sack and then all's get it free and out here's an eye Quan Murray back taking over punt return duties already made a big impact as a receiver thanks the punt they're hot at the 30yard line final minute of the third quarter there's the Noles who scored the only touchdown in the third try to build on the lead so you're providing aerial coverage is committed to honoring blink worthy athletes who demonstrate hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff as Clemson trying to avoid becoming the fifth unbeaten team to fall on the road today just on the verge of the first playoff committee rankings which will come out on Tuesday night the review on ESPN important for the tight your seat pitch down and get a stop it did last time out what get the edge Dalvin cook off running again they will not back down you can hold them down you can stop them the two home runs now after half done to talk about that 8/8 Gary 33 yards in the first half and now we've seen him get out here a couple times this time 70 yards by the way it's the exact same call is his last touchdown to the right this time they ran it to the left another counter play once again as you pointed out the entire skill set of Dalvin cook on display in one run this place is unhinge down the Seminoles book to be in deep trouble in this first quarter down a quick 14 nothing and suddenly has to be eight but wild can convert the electrifying Dalvin cook again and to counter play with it tight in Enzo is pulling around right here the right guard is going to pull around dickerson watch as they set the edge that's the key here to be able to get this play going is to make this block right there now you can you get a block in the back side there from Travis Rudolph the speed to be able to get to the edge and out run band Smith because of a poor angle and people underestimate Dalvin cook speed you can see watch watch how quickly he gets to the corner right there and now he beats 23 and white Dan Smith students to that end and in grand style Curt Galvin because he takes there to finish line goes over a hundred yards maybe careful we've seen guys drop the ball before to go on 18 hundred yard game Kirk and now his third consecutive thousand yard season on that run now he's up to 14 carries 153 yards and give Jimbo Fisher credit for his patience with that running game he's trying to chase down Warwick's done school running record worked it in four with the Salmons third year got a hookup kicker Sylar booting it right through the end zone what a serious challenge now for deshaun Watson this pungency that's been through so much on so many tough tight games they got to get back to the rhythm they had earlier in the game somehow now this is where as a Clemson play caller you're Tony le excel you've just Scott they'll go off at the coordinators along with Davo Sweeney you got to get back to what was working earlier and you're on the road and you rely on the John Wathan it's run path option zone read quarterback run and got to take some shots and each receiver is going to separate some subjects from an old secondary each element is going to be zero panic from deshaun Watson yet the most important thing is not just the poise of Watson quick decisionmaking has invaded twice and two turnovers but again the plane works in tempo but it's just tacked up it's going to be quickly now third down Frederick Jones the sophomore linebacker defensive line when a very very good job at the line of scrimmage I mean I don't be a patient here once they are third down yeah we better be they let the entire quarter run tried to play the tempo too quick ere is it now take a deep breath talk about it and try to move to sixyear and third down dope gamble stadium is rocking Dalvin cook has electrified this place up as we head to the fourth quarter back after this message and a word from your local ABC station alleged football playoff top 25 rankings show Tuesday at 7:00 on ESPN first edition of the rankings will be revealed Tuesday night and ratico books the consulate athletic director is one of the members of that selection committee so I go back to work down eight destroyers hunters plant almost escaped as a saving tackle by white something that they did early in a game on third down and had success with those quick plants to Mike Williams with his thighs uses hands there to fight off the defender gets to the inside and makes it easy for the chonwati the first looks right pat it down again by Marcus Walker who does that so well I mean quick you know they work on that this week we've seen that now three times from three different guys from naughty Christmas and now Walker and he just stopped rushing he knew the ball was coming out he was just literally standing there waiting and it timed it up and knocked it down exactly you said about the athletic ability for his size at 280 pounds he knows the shunt get the ball out quickly it's tough to second that you could bat the ball down and that sound they're on and there's a runner Walker and the tackle again 44 gets board become quite a battle here two of the better players in the country sets up another big third down we've got the big receiver Mike Williams isolated by himself one on one at the bottom interesting for two safety at the bottom they just checked out white who lost on that last third down also limping around and they put McFadden step one on one the bigger corner against Williams Watson looked at directing her phone to his left he does Williams makes the catch beats McFadden and is knocked out of bounds and now his fly comes in on the tackle three Marshall collided with him and is still down the physical receiver pumps into 225 pounder he's up now personal pas targeting these is number 40 senior penalties for sound that play is under further review Marshall looks like he may have taken the worse today watch McFadden try to jam and miss because he missed then he grabs on to him it made it easier for Williams to get into that hole between the corner and the safety and here comes Marshall there's the crown besides our rules expert of course as they always review a targeting play they're taking a look at this now Dennis reading Dave how did you see this if we take a look at any lowers ahead he gets him in the side of the helmet with the crown I don't know how they can change this that the runner does dip his head okay but the tappers leading with his helmet the targeted route is the receiver defenseless in that position he's already taken a couple of steps Kirk I wouldn't put a defenseless but the key is proud of Alan it's about the crown make any differences because right that's why I was asking if he's not defenseless it's just focused on whether it's the crown well yeah now what they can look here is it forcible contact this year they can review that far okay and if they say it's not forcible contact not to launch not that and make a change after further review a ruling on the field stands further depletes that already shorthanded secondary and he's in the tenth being looked at the targeting rule came into effect to protect tacklers as much as the guy being tackled but but yeah the guy who made the tackle in that case I thought looking at his face and the way he walked off I don't know if he knew where he was he took it he took the worst of that hit he's in the trainer's tent being looked at he's bitten see the ten tackles he's been a heat guy back there at safety remember that was the second third down conversion for the Shawn Watson on his tribe so the Seminoles top tackler tonight is out and Watson with a first down escapes the pocket and dives down after about a four yard game now they're in the red zone Kirk where they had early success but then a couple drives stalled and had to kick field goals down here and that's been a big point of emphasis during the bye week for the Tigers and look great early first two times down there no problem two touchdowns in since then they've not had that same success Vaman bounces and runs into a wall there we throw down again come on his water should mentioned it we know that Marshall has been ejected and also is out of the game but Mike Williams who took that hit and they've gone too and he's third downs is not in the game so Deon Cain now is in that same position down at the bottom number eight and for Mike Williams who talked close to third down conversion got serious true freshman defensive on to the Seminoles on the field right now in the third and four often deliver strike first and goal cleansing hard hit deliver good he held on the corner blitz from the left I thought they might throw to pain instead it's picked up by Wayne's almond and look it's got streaking through the middle of that defense they took that Florida State defense rolled the dice thinking that white might get there with the corner blitz it's picked up perfectly giving deshaun Watson a time to see a wide open are painted Scott 200 career reception that's the Tigers up at Orson goes home and tried to lay in second effort spotted short he tried to take off from about 2/3 right in a second kind of second lock it with the second launch did he land on his feet or was he already down on his knees when he tried to extend it he reached that ball toward the goal line they've spotted it inside the one this angle might be interesting to see he's still up any and take a peek of that sunny I thought he broke the crying for listening to you but his buzz down the runner stopped short of the goal line in front of further ado I thought that effort when he launched that second time it's just about the ball maybe a good effort there's launch number Helio lying he's so on and broke the point n think it's a touchdown earlier there was a aggressive pylon can giving you a vote here so you can see the ball there's an earlier reversal potential my quandary sort of touched down on a catch initially called outofbounds which may be the same thing for Gulman a reversal touchdown this with Tampa 74yard 10play Drive I think we have LJ Scott's effort last year in the Big Ten championship against Iowa Michigan State that takes a lot of strength to be able to hold that football while you're moving in the middle of the defense originally intended yeah and there's a long show okay after that hit yeah well he's going to have to sit out the first half of the NC State game on the road next wait because of that targeting ejection but you're right the bigger concern at the moment is safety the other look can they forget to pile on County yeah pretty clear from that angle it's a good shot right there so Gallman who last year against the Knowles had kind of a frustrating night until he busted loose Gulman galloped for the game clinching touchdown in the fourth quarter ended up 103 yards did a pretty good job containing him tonight 17 for 61 for the top tailback Dennis reading takin a long look at the various angles I think it's fun to have the rest of pile on cam nothing that was a definitive angle I method like the last pylon cam showed it pretty clearly to me it was initially if he was up on his feet when he had that second lunch and once you see once he saw the his he was still on his feet I think it based on all the video we've seen a further review the player broke will go on touchdown goodness to replay and the Tigers now down by soon 11:30 to play and go for two of course and try to get the tire right here see what the twopoint play they've worked practicing two receivers at the top by the way Mike Williams is back into the lineup good to see after the hit that he puts the Marshall he hit the bottom twice back in the game through Port Authority has to use a timeout Wow that could be keep an eye on that could be costly down the road in a game that feels like it's going to go down in the last possession well Kyle Meyers right there one of the true freshman quarterbacks was on the receiving end of that Charles Kelly ran perhaps the mental mistake for the young guy they do burn the timeout twopoint play when you come back Tigers going for two and it's 28 alltime here much on this drive converting three third down passes assisting they're looking over here based on the alignment of the Florida State defense to get the exact call that they want here the laying thing for the offensive line delivered nearside insuk we threw it low and outside trying to get to Mike Williams on the edge McFadden was in coverage and the Knowles now protect a twopoint lead if you wonder how Watson and the Tigers who respond they're back in at a 75 yard drive twopoint game Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart this Halloween save on candy costumes and more at 4:00 mark and in part by viewers proud partner of the NCAA Curtis Wolfram y'all save us a navigating Tallahassee exam for your all State Street credit includes the choice yeah we've been doing this all year all state not handing out the street cred on Twitter each we kind of spotlighting that the team of the week into it today has to be Washington going on the road in Salt Lake City and finding a way to win a hardfought game 31 to 24 Levin straight win Myles Gaskin had a big day and Huskies are proving that they're deserving and being up there in the top four is the first rankings come out on Tuesday special teams touchdown right after usage a fought back ended up winning beep kickoff from Google bounced out of the end zone Pacific Life game summary highlighting Dalvin cook as you pointed out early Kirk you could hold him in check you can pin him in for a while but he's the ultimate home run hitter at the tailback fish incredible that's what Brent Venables told us you know we have to play 16 minutes of GAAP integrity against him got to set the egg and we can't let him get outside and both of his long runs the 43 and a 70 yard run front counter plays where they lost the edge they let him get to the outside and he showed you the speed that he has he took it to the end zone meet again and cook guess the edge again get the block Dalvin cook for offering to the secondary again to 35 number four can't be stopped right now this tip is often Brian there's a plan to bring this may bring this one all the way back personal Bob Watts all the way office number 23 that's the pullback Freddy Stephen ban Smith who was going to potentially make a play ended up blocking him and Dan Smith went by him kind of the back of his leg 23 on 23 again huh 42 yard run no no move it back the spot of the foul is the 34 yeah Dave's waving his hand like maybe that's home I don't know that finger would take a look at this what they called was better known as a crack back block he needs to lie in between boy oh that's a tough one Thomas would you be mad if I yelling if you were down here officiating wouldn't maybe Adam yelled at me I'm already mad honestly Jimbo's laying india down there now that you see it from here that's the question we'll call don't you think questionable remember he's gotta get him in front Jimbo was going crazy I'm obliged doted on Jerry now that the crowd is all involved you make it a sideline warning here and be surprised they didn't we won't cost them any more yards he pointed a clinic very good Wow so wasn't a sideline warning he got him 450 key oh wow here's the block again and Jimbo Fisher went crazy going after the officials and he said a few things they caught their attention obviously but boy you're talking about it I don't had a 55 60 yard run an index finger very close to the official space they don't like that change no they don't Chris he was all the way down 30 yard line now they're back at their own 10yard line they don't have the mark there's a way up the field if that's what got him off to nine first and 25 and cook this time is going to be dropped for a loss yet his third big consecutive home run on three carries negated by that Hall that's maybe a 15yard an orphan life against Jimbo Fisher he everybody needs need to move past this and talk about it later because right now you you're winning by two with ten minutes to go in the game he is still bending the ear of the field judge over there second and 28 Francois from the end zone look Forte nope he wound up I use all of that six foot five height that he come down with it Fields was defending of course they want to call they're right in front of the Florida State bench Heels who got called earlier for a pass interference tries to get up their left hand was wrapped around the receiver that's what Jimbo Fisher was upset about 13:28 in with the nose you convert this Punk is going to get good field position down just to Francois way out fires from his end zone its complete summary but he's waist short of the first down they do improve field position a little bit but for pound that's actually a big big completion because the just field position if nothing else hears that the pass rush again just rushing three they almost get the head there in the end zone if cuts Heathrow with your feet standing in your own goal line third and forever puts it right on the money there gives him selves a little bit of yardage at least to help out of this punt v X tonight for Murray who had five all season coming in so rayray McLeod at Tampa standing at his 40 to receive the punt from Logan Tyler ain't got a 40 state player running on video they didn't have they didn't have this 11 out there that McFadden who was trotting out late there was a lot of confusion Airport instead over for fiveyard penalty for thousands in the Clemson side of the line of scrimmage when the punt was snapped here comes McFadden running out Hopkins runs off now he see McFadden trying to get in position a ball is snapped or a state kind of come apart at the seams here after that that poor call that went against him in my opinion anyway on that that's at block the cloud let's just bounce in front of them it'll bounce backwards in an old one have to stop it there at about the 48 you make a good point you cause and go for you or against you but they did not react with a whole lot of poise after the call was made tiger set up in good shape down to again Clemson survivalist and defeated ball playoff committee watching the finish to this one they'll convene and then they're really the first rankings ESPN exclusively at 7 o'clock on Tuesday through another forefront function takes over there 48 down to Watson bat it down Ikki Anika scrimmage he's a monster Marcus Walker again doesn't even worry about getting in there to rush the quarterback but just sit and wait and look and wait and it goes up and knocked it down watch him at the top 44 he's not even pass rushing he's just waiting like a linebacker Antonius Ricky arrived the very same day as Walker do early enrollee Cup they got to town to see me back we're together he's my guy I like it here remember Jamarcus what for two years was committed he was going to go to Clemson he was a big Clemson fan growing up to flag down they go formation offense fiveyard penalty the markets just at the last minute decided to come to Florida State flips he's making life tough on the Tigers tonight Alabama had a chance clemson had a chance ends up in Tallahassee part of that national championship team one of the few guys remaining to played in that 13 season they write Alabama was in the mix after Kennedy committed some funds and may the lake coils on second and 15 watson protected for a while but then drop DeMarcus Christmas it will be burden law that established streaming of the official now and is all coverage downfield great job downfield by his Florida State deep into back eventually being able to get pressure look like I thought they did look like they got ahold of in Christmas that's real or that's what Davos is frustrated with come on good game get miss Dallas and it's the quarterback and right the middle of the field dancing are there was a OS one maybe them his payback you know burden twentyone locked in by sign delivers below pitch made not a first down but Renfro scooped it off the turf it'll be fourth down less than two but an effort there by Renfro go down and make this catch codes on third down deshaun Watson usually looks for him especially on broken plays he applied that between the window two safeties lineups kabocha days is under further review we going to take another peek see if in fact Renfro did scoop it off of the turf this may not show it one thing to say that it hit the ground there his body's shielding the camera from the football both of these looks yes probably the best look you have got if I could catch a ball i ball never touch the ground but AJ Westbrook was the safety coming across recovers the concentration Ivor intro to keep and ball and what an enormous difference this catch makes it fourth and two versus fourth than a mile and if you thought you would call this a good call in a catch absolutely Chris both hands are under decision after further review the ruling on the field stands for sounds nothing to show that fall hit the ground right now the other thing that happens is instead of going tempo to try to go for it if in fact they are getting end up going poised now with the review the defense came over to sideline Clemson goes over to sideline and now it slows things down for the clamp for the Florida State defense to kind of get things in order we are going for it he's under center here you get got a big line up there with Dexter Alexander in the backfield along with Christian Wilkins jet to defensive lineman the jumbo formation they run Coleman behind it and he escapes and Golvin galloping down near the 30 much more than what he needed what a slasher and what a great job to be able to follow the bit too big fellows Wilkins in Florence watched him pick up those blocks you don't think they have an impact there blocking corners that are 180 pounds guys are over 300 pounds good luck McFadden you don't have a chance before you get him out in the open space for those live legs is a talented pack counted again by the way when they use that jumbo package those two defensive linemen are now four for four converting this season they won for the Big D lineman Wilkins tell me love that they get down inside that five yard line they both are athletic enough we could have talking about this book is get more excited I think for these those kind of package plays and he does playing defensive ends back in a quarterback I think I think it all excites every positive the positive energy and a great leader for this team John Rowland out by step the man it hit hard driven down after a free yard game another play by the Marcus Walker not letting the Shawn Watson get to the corner does a good job of containing him and forcing him back to the inside that's worth Derrick Hopkins is able to make that play but again this senior the veteran making the making the play to set that up wearing Google Earth was connecting from 50 in warmups his longest season is 47 so they're in range they don't take a loss but the John thicken move the chains on third and seven as time delivers incomplete off the outstretched hands of Jordan like it and it will be a long field goal attempt for the lead now coming up emotion him over they got the look that they wanted and it shut over v beyond the outstretched hand there of his tied in but he had exactly the look that he wanted when they motioned him over in fact they ran that play early in the game for a big game this time gets not quite able to connect David Estes to sack the step line Rex Ryan Sun and bugle from 46 for the lead that is a pressure field goal hammers it right through and Clemson up by a point 525 to play your Greg Hugo you make your third field goal and three attempts to give your team the lead he'll step Ryan little regime of the holder there through the holder but now you get the big fella look at Wilkins little dance there full where I come across the head but you know what speaks volumes about the chemistry on this Clemson team you get defensive starters coming over to a kicker given in love like that in Bend radius Google been kicking off about it he goes here but only attempted and made one field over the last three games 3 for 3 tonight you should be pretty pumped up when you drives this kick to the ends on German foot fields going to bring it out Rick be a little crazy and tackled over there at the 20yard line and that's where Francois will take over with 5:19 to play Halloween night the 5 and 1 bikes and the Bears Jay Cutler back under center 6 o'clock Eastern money that countdown kickoff at 8:15 also on the watch ESPN app all right let's see how shortest eight rebounds after that last possession where they had the big game push back after the unsportsmanlike conduct on the sideline of court estate now they get the ball back now trailing by a point go back to that play again this time he runs left not down after a five yard game that counter play has worked for some big yards but you know that Brent Venables has told his team take away the outside both times they've run the counter he got the edge and got down the sideline and Brent Venables and saying I don't care if he goes back up the middle but you better not let him get to the outside he's naked mm Francois rolls out delivers along throughout when a catch made the 40yard line first down I would feel it that's nuts Jimbo Fisher he runs the counter play he runs the counter play he gets your eyes affected and then he runs to boot off the counter look and then it rolls his quarterback out where he's comfortable moves that launch point away from the pressure and then he the timing between Francois the move and his wide receiver we cook gets the running game going that entire chapter on the Claypool on the the plate call chart opened up strong throw by Richert freshman playaction bicep throw our thousand cuts happened downfield and he dropped the football at the 35 he had feedin Boulware did everything but catch to us mantoman with gula hurricanes cook and that's a mismatch it's a wheel route protected just long enough for Francois and this is a big game watch his eyes drift Joe he looks up he peeks up as good as he is he peeks up to see who's coming towards him so he can make his next move he knows he has poured beat but he's trying to see who's in front of him and by peeking up just for a second he took his eyes off the ball and dropped they could just give me a chance to redeem myself for that play they fake it to them again and now Francois is going to fire down the field for uno in traffic it's broken up to flag plan another interference fell on the Tigers and France wall again just knocked down hard after the throw this was big this is a running start by the middle linebacker weird defense number 25 15yard penalty first out since I happen to be watching Joseph the entire time he got a full sprint head start on a delayed flip and keep in mind the hits that Francois has been taken it's the very first opening drive watch 34 get a running start right there just a clean hit right into the siRNA vet he has taken all manner of hits as we pointed out from the very first game of his college career is brutalized by just about every opponent this season here's the depth up from this one here's the pass interference call by Tankersley ball is underthrown Tankersley with the left hand grabbing onto the shoulder of Travis Rudolph see what she looked by the time he looked back to find the ball he's grabbing all into Travis Rudolph College that's probably a good penalty it's not a spot file austin 15 yards with that would have been a puppy if you didn't interfere it's going to be a long catch but the concern obviously as McGwire gets ready to perhaps go in and for Francois it's been common theme throughout this year that was a big hit early this is that Kristin Wilkins landing on top of him along with the big hit I don't think he knew where he was on that one with another outside pressure that went to Martin Bryant big Dexter Lawrence 340 pounds coming down on top of it and then this one a full print by the Kindle Joseph a linebacker the culmination of all the kids taking a toll I want to toughest dudes I've seen play this year a disposition or any position for that matter there was a testament to something is what we called it that road win Miami a forest knocked him around he had two weeks to kind of get this shoulder healthy get back to 100% which he was coming into this game buddy he's done hundred percent right now if anybody can come back from all this to be this kid and I'm now Shawn Maguire is gonna have to go in yes he started against Clemens of the last couple years filling in for jameth suspended here two years ago and then he was chosen to start over Golson on the road game it comes in last year in the law so he's experienced but stone cold because why you take a lot of mental reps throughout the week as a backup quarterback for these kind of moments where you get thrown in and you got to be ready to make decisions you want to do this Bureau back up you've seen the starter gets pummeled again and again you want to kind of finish the job at you can Stephenson the fullback running left has a gap there you see a guy who's lost the Dalvin cook gets loose himself and they break a tendency and they run Stephenson and watch Dalvin cook leading the way here so they go the opposite way and definite cook does a pretty good job along with Ryan is though of locking in Stephenson 6 1 241 pounds showing that he got some speed himself down the sideline hey he just doubled his yardage total coming the year but it's easily the week very 38:38 effort and francois somehow someway is back in the game person go standing up no reclaim the lead the hat trick for cook in an old reclaim the lead up five will go for two gotta go for two here the makers of seven seven point lead the six point lead really doesn't do you any good if Clemson were to go down and score a touchdown obviously with the extra point when we said Kurt Alvin has dropped at that pass wide open earlier miss drive redeems himself with a block on Stevenson's run 200 comes down beautiful keep the happiest guy on that field right now looking to the sideline Tigers aren't their defenses fall here mister is going to call timeout second time we've seen that on a twopoint conversion once it was when a defense was out there and now when his offense is out there and again these timeouts are going to be precious at this game you know goes back and forth here and he's what final few minutes and he's yelling and icon murder the young receiver yeah fresh this time out but a very important play to do again being on seven yeah versus five with and while he's doing how dangerous are what she is look at the touchdown after the big run by Stephenson they go right back for that stretch player he was able to bounce it to the outside has such a good feel Wiggins just doesn't have the speed out there he immediately knew he's going to bounce that somebody got his hands on the ball good effort there by Murray on field to block there was a oneonone play Wiggins up against Dalvin cook he takes a bow and he should after his slow start tonight only 33 yards in the first half he is fire here at his second half up to 172 yards now that was close to ten yards the carry with fourth touchdown the two point play Wow some confusion there Rudolph was at a tough night only one catch he wouldn't turned around some miscommunication if Travis Rudolph would have been stuck with his route and worked to the outside he pulled away from Ryan Carter he was wide open and Jimbo pitcher wants to talk to Rudolph watch watch him he works his way down to the back of the endzone but if you watch him if he gets working on the inside watch him not just a dinner to work to sideline work towards the sideline keep pulling away from Ryan Carter for some reason he had a different call in mind he turns it starts to run there's no more room down the sideline features the other way Kesha we have to do is slide outside and it's an easy throw for Francois sunny you look at Rudolph Kirk last week last game I should say 13 for 238 for the top five games in the history of Florida State receiving tonight just the exact opposite he's going to give it back to the coach there but the bigger picture is Florida State is a five point lead deshaun Watson has 3:23 to work with it's good stuff when the Tigers nose get together it always that Barbara always teams comes down it seems to come down to that last possession and if you're if you're Clemson this is what you want you want to inshallah watch it with his hands on the ball for the game on a line at a touchdown can win it be of such facts you seem to remember the significant for this last seven meetings the winners won the division the last five years they've won the ACC championship eventually and obviously both times and of course that have bigger than the playoff of the championship game the last three years but Florida State holds on to win here that dead streak would probably be broken with the two losses already having conference play at a Louisville in North Carolina but this is it this is it this what it's all about the Shawn Watson 323 to go on the road a noose environment great from the pocket Oh like it freakin for already with one play they are at midfield that is wide open in the middle for the state has only one linebacker a true freshman vontavious Jackson nobody to match him in the middle that was quite open and deshaun Watson immediately knew that he wanted to get the ball to court and Leggett for a big first down to 35 that's true freshman also plays on defense personals at the moment Gulman barrels forward itself five scented three minutes you'll see Shawn Watson who is very very comfortable in this position is highoctane offense with that much time left there is no hurry at all about execution and finding the matchups Watson backpedaling and just throws it away and nobody open you Josh sweat providing the pressure this would be the biggest win the best opponent that these Seminoles out here at the in the last couple years whereas Watson and Clemson they just used to winning games like this used to finding away smoothly when his Davos Nene called a part of the champion we find ways to fight through adversity to win games kind of become their mo is a big third down Mike Williams at the top risk to plays to get these five yards Scot and mochi Seminoles rush only three and Watson has time and delivers a strike for a person to Leggett again mr. reliable one of the best tight ends in the country nobody picked him up safety stump just kind of sunk back in coverage the linebacker came off of him gifted line gives the line a lot of credit for giving him the time to eventually come off and find legacy Shawn fires to a wideopen man a complete bust and Leggett dives the pylon touchdown Clemson less than a minute they sprint down 75 yards of school it's a busting coverage two defenders go deep the freshmen Myers and AJ Westbrook they went with one of the receivers Hunter Renfro downfield two defenders so deep nobody picks up Jordan Leggett and it's the unafraid effort there but when a few bucks we've seen here since early in the game and now yet another twopoint conversion as the Tigers try to stretch it to a three point lead we looked at the chromatic lament by a tight end folks the left hand to keep him elevated before he hits and tries to get the ball extended for the goal line we talked about this receiving core all the options are going to review this but leg it and that drive three catches for 70 yards and Leggett is right here he's going to work here but hunter Renfro takes two defenders with him watch the busting coverage here you've got a couple defenders going right here they get occupied nobody picks him up going out to the corner it's just nobody there so busting coverage and in Leggett for a big guy 260 pounds for the review Stan holding on it'll confirm touchdown I think of all the people on that theme in this situation you would not want to leave alone if you Jordan like especially on that drive yeah you cannot lose him he's just such a clutch weapon and you know when it's when it's crunch time Leggett and Renfro are the two guys that that most often deshaun Watson seem to dial up this is a another significant twopoint play neither team's been able to convert so far but the difference between a field goal to perhaps force overtime or win it that's what's at stake here you didn't love the call the first time in there two points by one I think they're a very different look i okay with it the fate of the back shoulder fade again that going to two wins this time they're spreading about five receivers a lot of times when they run that quarterback to Moxon steps up looks it to a wide open Mike Williams and they convert the two pointer lead by three they spread them out in fact because he's able to buy time by stepping up into that pocket nobody is in the back of that endzone and the linebacker that time Matthew Thomas left his coverage because he was concerned about the scramble in the run from the Shawn Watson where he took off from that's exactly where ah Watson threw the football Dabo Swinney impressed with that effort five plays 75 yards in a minute 17 any wonder today's four to quick as if you would admit the baby welcome back maybe remember those two timeouts I keep talking about the Florida State had to use twopoint conversion down to one timeout now with 206 to go but remember how good Francois was at the end of the first half minute robbing he's at his best actually when they play that way historically Florida State's offense with Jimbo Fisher they are outstanding at the end of the half and in the game before drop of show with Cassidy right after the latest chapter in this Clemson Florida state rivalry which just never did the points get three lead changes in the fourth quarter now it's going to come down to this possession for the Seminoles Whitfield once into his own man and is knocked down at the 22 yard line we've seen the veteran accomplished quarterback Heisman finalist Shawn Watson make his plays and we've seen DeAndre Francois tonight take a brutal beating again just keep coming back does he have one more big drive in them at the end of that has he was just he was decisive he made quick decisions and got the ball out of his hands and also his receivers did a good job of getting some separation and giving him a chance remember Murray 80 has had a big night tonight he's in a slot up to the top Francois finds Bluto this his second catch tonight put the veteran barrels out to the 40 Felix gets back and balls out when he gets them in this twominute mode there's just teaches back there and it's just decisive and it's rhythmic and the ball is out and it's grown accurately and it's grown quickly yep gotta come Francois fires far side of the completion there in Clemson territory that's Naik Wan Murray the guy who was emerged tonight delivering on all that promise Winston thought it was incomplete they think the ball hit the surface but the officials say it's a good match ball was thrown early anticipation there from the freshman quarterback Francois and they have moved quickly Kirk already in the Clemson territory and a couple of plays here haven't had to spend that time out yet and Francois going to go far sideline over the head of Rudolph that grizzly was with him no flag bankers the very fortunate that that ball was thrown over his head and out of bounds if that ball is thrown into play and Rudolph had the chance to fight to get to the football tanker sleeves beaten its pass interference his head was it turned around he caught a break there Travis Rudolph did a good job of getting out around him and feed into the line of scrimmage remember it's not just about the passing game you can still fly Dalvin cook out and still get hit the getting his hands on the ball as well Dallben could be dropped for a threeyard loss Tankersley invaded the back field sure did he recognized that took that edge away and that scored that time the clemson defense was ready for it look at his clock now saving that last timeout down to a minute he got two plays to get the 13 yards going to get to the 37 yard line stay alive Francois wants the ball and it was way over Murray's hitting out of bounds he was pressured and knocked down again and it's fourth down his Wilkins Christian Wilkins Hunnic late flag here in the backfield you're right I didn't see the flag on the field where the quarterback was hit holding offense number 71 and yard penalty slow down Chris Christian Wilkins was going right through drop ruble and that's all he could do is hold on to him that you ended up hitting Francois him locked up there and the chokehold yeah but see Wilkins still gets there that's why the ball sailed so he moved them back and now they get another third down instead of being fourth and 13 is going to get a third down play and 23 interesting decision I thought they would have to find that girl I make the play on full count two players to make 10 more yards than Francois firing farside catched made crudo they've been Tankersley they bogus there I did two plays to go it was out of bounds this time is inbound Tankersley and sees him he's beaten again he can't find the football look at bentonville pimples turned to make him play on it he tried to make a play on it but Rudolph comes up with a kiss a good big tent and a great throw again by the party might go back to that it was there yeah you're going to get past interference are you going to make a catch routine yard beam is third and 23 and they are right at the fringe of field goal range and there's a false start he was a like for right tackle ruble backing out he's a little nervous they're against Christian Wilkins Ricki Aguayo of course younger brother of Roberto Aguayo is the field goal kicker he's made a 47yard er quite has the range of his brother da but still a pretty strong leg and they are right at the edge all start offense number 71 the fiveyard penalty for sounds seemed pretty obvious second these are keeping us in suspense there so still 32 seconds one time out they're going to move it up to 43 43 seconds yep reset the clock pick up 11 seconds there that's what I think Jimbo Fisher was making sure the officials were aware of that's a big big difference with only one timeout remaining Downie go around another 10 yards to be any comfortable field goal range for y ou Tigers showing right here again and show pressure did they come across first right color 69 fog our penalty horse out the freshman dickerson mental mistakes that wanted this offensive line all night after 13 penalties now that was all that free snap movement by the linebackers he dickerson knew that blitz was coming up the middle they're shooting both their linebackers goes up in Boulware and he reacted to it off to the five yards first and 20 don't pressure again they come after Francois who delivers old for the hand of Rudolph on the 39 seconds Chris I don't know about you but I did your Florida State with the way Rudolph is handled Tankersley into the boundary wouldn't you take another shot down that sideline against him try to either draw the pass interference or try to try to come up with a catch maybe he is he's been beaten a couple times over there we'll see if they lay him off for play press he's going up tight against against Rudolph to match up to their advantage of my opinion Bruns was rolling the other way and now lost it down field often Tate couldn't get it even at six pot it was too high for third and twenty coming up now you have to be thinking at the very least about you got to know your kicker you got to know where he likes it not just trying to get positive yards but trying to put him in a position to give him a chance well inside of inside of 40 ago I was not missed he's 9 for 9 beyond a 40yard attempt he's been a little dice here you 5 at 9 Logan Tyler may be a distance victor as well use the pickoff man I will think about 10 to 15 yards instead of trying to get the first half of that left side record immediately Francois is going to be swarmed under cannot take that step and now it's fourth in a mile is Dexter Lawrence and Christian Wilkins got after them one more time it's hurt them all year pass protection and you know they're going to throw watch the big fella that's a true freshman Wilkins and Lawrence together Lawrence at 340 Wilkins at 310 with great quickness and when their games on the line dabbu swinging and also Brent Venables know that they can count on that those two guys to get that pass rush for the quarterback if you know you say you can't take the sack everybody knows you can't take the sack but I think he would surprise with that inside pressure from the big fella Lawrence so they get down in position very positive and start to this Drive couple of false starts back them up pass rush tees off and now they have to get 32 yards on this fourth down play or else clemson is going to survive another one of these white knuckler and stay undefeated they entered the fourth quarter at home gets Louisville down eight bound away back won the game of course entered this fourth quarter against Florida State down eight the three lead changes in the final 15 minutes one play away from moving through eight and OH remaining one of the top contenders one of those playoff spots where they had a big game to rout deep in Clemson territory all the way down to 34 yard line they have the false start that sent him back to making first and 15 and seemed to be going backwards ever since we've got to get all the way down to the Clemson 24 to stay alive immediately pressured again for where we'll end the Seminoles chances and secure Clemson victory with the 6th set tonight for this defense Tigers are going to escape Tallahassee with the W right up the middle again they've had so much success coming into the middle of this offensive line miscommunication up here he moves to the right freeze up Boulware to be able to come right up the middle they brought both their linebackers and again Francois knows he can't say the faculty expected to do by time he gets the ball he's got it he's running for his life welltimed nice job there by threat Venables but I got to go back in first and ten at the 34 and a false target first and 15 they had another penalty first and 20 that's tough to to try to be able to come up with a gametying field goal or potentially winning the game when you're selfdestructing like that from that first down at the 34 we move backwards about 37 yards and Watson and victory formation Clemson Tigers are built for games like this in other words of damn Oh sweetie and his team goes out and proves it once again for just the second time in the last 13 visits to Tallahassee comes out on top of the first time since 2006 deshaun Watson Bros for 378 couple of touchdowns did throw toothpicks and ran for 52 yards his counterpart the freshman Francois playing his heart out and a loss once again back then Samantha with Ayla well coach you know it's not an easy place to play you get your first win in Tallahassee but how would you describe the last two minutes of this game well switch championships are made of you know you just push well you got keep playing it's four quarters I was a little disappointed obviously in the second quarter a lot of lot of penalties I hate what a game I mean you expect anything less go to state Clemson hats off the Jimbo and their staff man those guys played their hearts out to change somebody's got to lose this game but it was our time you know we were doing I mean we our guys just hung in there Oh number four right here he made a boneheaded mistake they fooled us and give him credit cuz it was a great set up on him and kind of got a 30 but he bounced back and what a great I miss what it's all about we said hey it's Wednesday practice 3:20 to go in the game what we're going to do and we go right down the field Jordan Leggett awesome and you know that's when we needed to be in a bed I didn't get that open well just just you know great design of the play and again guys just kept playing great jobs with the protection he works and stuff open and great job by DeSean a couple times he kind of boss the time and allowed him to get a little more open but listen wasn't perfect but work we're eight knows and we're at our best when we needed to be especially defensively right there you know again man that number four I hope he come back next year I'm so tired seeing him what a great football player but you know hats off to the crowd here was a great night college football but at the end of day know this is our night road win in a row at the whole time school record and for that to come in Tallahassee a place where we haven't been able to finish it's pretty special so good to see our guys finish tonight and just handle adversity keep playing and find a way to win that's what it's all about congratulations coach I'm gonna get to the guy who said made a bone in mistake deshaun what's up with your coach calling you out on that I should agree are they you know the person exception they did you know 22 children in the corner kind of beat it on the kick out and I try to throw it right now throughout new I made their own home state and in the last one that I get the chopped corner and went to fulfil around you kind of lady now I had this in the state just a person so I was on naked and you know I wasn't myself but you know I just kind of got the university and I continued start playing between a fireman Dakota guys would be special as we grow so quickly your offense obviously came up big tonight down the stretch especially with Jordan Leggett but can I ask you about your defense a little bit out here the pressure they were able to get on DeAndre Francois first of all do you feel bad for the guy at all taking the hippies here tonight six sacks Emily oh no I'm always drunk them off my be fun so you know we always keep pressure on other other quarterback to make what makes it make decisions and getting frustrated but not because of the great job expression pursue national leaders coordinator $2.00 they're all types of different present pressures and what those guys was working for thread throughout the week as we go down the stretch obviously still got a ways to go to reach the goals that you have for this season where does this team need to get better you know I'll just lose myself well not turn the ball over United States notes internal state Coburn say no time to time but this you know sup you know it's not couple hotels I mean it's kind of a bygone fan page once you get a big lead they've got to continue to fight and you kick up you know put the cutter down and you know you try to dominate and you know what we gotta pound up that you know you know thing we have the McCauley we do die we just got off you know Philomath through most importantly you come away with the win tonight congratulations the shine nine great job Samantha it's no please keeps happening you go back to 2011 game decided by a touchdown or less Benson Tigers have won 16 of the last 18 and wants a big wine couple of home games down Syracuse and then Pittsburgh visit Wake Forest and their ACC finale got to lose a couple of games to lose the division as they have the time break over Louisville had to have they closed out against South Carolina but they'll be a solid favorite to run it out and be undefeated going to the ACC championship games yeah it's a big hurdle for them they knew that coming in to tonight if this is a big you look at the end of their year and who they had to plan of course you have a rivalry game and emotions are out there possibly Virginia Tech and on any PC championship game but this was a big one and it's again it's another example of what Da'Ville always talks about just this is a team that has the heart of a champion then and come on this in this atmosphere and to take for the state's best shot found a way to get it done we've got to really kind of say it tip of the cap to them or for to say there will be a third ACC loss this season the previous four seasons combined they had three HCC losses so it's a tough year a transition year for Florida State big fellas for Clemson got it done this this pass rush is relentless it's it's a weapon really as much as any aspect of this football team where they get to the court about yeah but you know as much as we going to be looking at this and say boy what a great job it is Sean Watson and Clemson and finding a way to win after everything the 40 states been through this year some of the losses the game against Louisville the loss against North Carolina right here for down boat for for Jimbo Fisher to get his team to have the resiliency to keep fighting back for his quarterback to keep fighting back I mean it's a tough disappointing loss this is he's got to be proud of the exist groups part and their character and the way they keep fighting to that tough one at NC State next week to someone else do all right Kirk so those seven unbeatens who played today Oliver won on the road Clemson survives three survived four went down give me your top four well you're going to have Alabama at number one Michigan at number two Clemson holds at three and Washington going on the road and winning I would put it for I you know imagine this if Clemson would have lost tonight and the rankings come out Tuesday you had probably Alabama Michigan Washington who's four don't have to worry about that now but you make a good question who would have been a four welcomes he would say hey head to head over Louisville yeah there's Louisville out there there would have been Clemson if they would have lost with a loss you have Texas A&amp;M is out there Ohio State's out that but none of the teams I just brought up necessarily make you feel like yeah that's clearly the number four team it would've been interesting with Clemson prevails so BAM at Baton Rouge Michigan's got a road game at Iowa in a couple weeks you expect to be there for that when Clemson of course we've mentioned their remaining schedule and of course Washington has test to come number four deshaun Watson for the victory lap in front of the Clemson one more time closing battles back and wins a thriller here in Tallahassee 37:34 you get these two teams together
