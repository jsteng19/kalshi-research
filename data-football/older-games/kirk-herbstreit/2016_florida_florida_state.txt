============================================================

fresh off a facelift hard rock Stadium is energized a sense here of relief after a tenth week in Florida and now release for this big rivalry game welcome to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC and his presentation of the ACC on ESPN Miami worn elegant the suspects schedule and Mark Rick's firstyear favorites tonight against number 23 Florida State Hurricane Matthews dominating the headlines and after devastating Katie in the Bahamas miss Miami by a hundred and fifteen miles skirted the Florida coast the most severe damage in this state team up north near Jacksonville and of course continue to torment those in Georgia and South Carolina our thoughts certainly with everyone affected everywhere by Hurricane Matthew and there is a sense of relief in the city and tonight and certainly many players from this state relieved to be thinking about football believe that their families are all okay Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit Samantha ponder will join us I've had the pleasure recall in the last few of these but I think that the backdrop has shifted don't you feel it in Miami no more moral victories that won't cut it anymore they are desperate to end this six game skid against the Seminoles mark RIT comes in as a head coach he's created some excitement one thing he's very fortunate to have is he inherited Brad kaya a three years starting quarterback then it gets really given him a chance to feel comfortable on how they attack defenses and he's had some success I think the experience that I bring has been a big key but first look at the arm strength here from the left hash last week against Georgia Tech throws a absolute rope here almost 40 yards for a big completion here's the experience recognizing coverage he sees discovered three he knows between the corner the safety he's able to hit that crease and is able to do that to give his receiver a chance they run a lot of the RPO is the run past options here the line backer gets out of position he finds holy and there's a big game so as you said this will be a different chatter challenge in a different sense because of the athletes from 40 state but let's not forget the Noles have struggled this year on defense given up a lot of big plays a lot of blown assignments something that kya and the Canes are going to try to capitalize on yeah it's a run first offense isn't it he's got to the support of a running game and that Noel's defense has been shredded 44 points a game allowed the last three soaked and Alvin cook back in his hometown provide enough points but also in his case early in a year and you and I had a couple times anybody wondered what's wrong with Dalvin cook what why is it Dalvin cook going well he has the last few weeks but I really like what Jimbo Fisher has done with him he's put it out of eight nine man front now here is the set this is Jimbo Fisher does what he wants to do it's hard to run into a nine man front so he's made adjustments Wilkes Claire pads to get him to the outside picks up some blocks some receivers and tied in just another way to get number four the ball with some room to work with their little flip train you're going to cover him take away the run we'll throw the ball to him give him some blockers downfield and you can see what he can do after the catch with his ability to run so unique little wrinkles against teams before Miami it will continue tonight if Miami's determined with their young defense to take away the run look for Jimbo Fisher to again come up with different ways to try to get down and cook the ball because let's say for the last two years he's faced his home team he's taking care of the Canes he's had the gamewinning touchdown each of the last two seasons very interesting backdrop we'll learn a lot about Miami are they for real are they legitimate contender are they worthy of that number 10 ranking and can the Knowles who been already beaten up and heartbroken a week ago can they bounce back can they play it inspired game can't wait to see how this one unfolds hurricanes and the Seminoles on a muggy night in Miami coming up juggernaut is forest operations to put a point they got an NFL caliber quarterback in grad school it feels like I'm used to be able to do whatever they want the Nissan pregame rush with Stan Barret Mac Brown and mark may is next after this message and a word from our ABC station how do you measure the depth of a rivalry how do you quantify football hatred here's how you measure it by the faces by the anguish by the joy you measure by the lines run in the turf the taunting the tackles you measure it by Florida State vs Miami nearly 500 miles separate the campuses but nothing separates our contempt for one another that sphere pierces the ground it marks its territory the Seminoles dare you to beat them that smoke that swagger that practicing difference is Miami personified these two genes are bonded together by decades of history a wide right eye wide left by a conga line of the very best who played the game by the very best who coached the game for more than twenty years it was the rivalry that other rivalry wanted to be when they grew up it had gravitas how do you measure a rivalry you go to Cannes versus the Knowles well Miami has a narrow lead in this series history of Florida State has won the last six if they win tonight that will equal the longest winning streak and ahead brick I was going to say that maybe a slightly different tone under Jimbo Fisher and Mark Richt plot seconds ago the players begin to edge toward good field and jawed each other I told you pregame might feel different but when these two teams got out here in front of this energy it's a rivalry it's going to take over instead energy there are eight game players some of they feel something different it's been a facelift the stadium has been made nicer for the fans it's been reduced but the roof keeps the noise in and they all said they felt something that was foreign Atlantic they're playing much less Florida State so I think that tonight we have a chance to see how both these teams are going to respond KITT this feels a little closer to those old kings Noel's games in the Orange Bowl tennis yeah it does and I think Mark Richt coming back it's a different feel his success is a head coach his experience in his rivalry of course is a player at Miami since the coach offensive coordinator of so many successful years in fala has he and you and I can do him on the field before the game usually most coaches come over talk to you for a few minutes he is locked in and it's you could feel the spirit we've done a lot of these games but it feels different definitely this time around yeah he has taken a different approach than the Kings were used to seeing under Al golden there was no tomahawk shot play drive practice it was extensively opponent number five faceless opponent now we're going to see something different when the game kicks off but that was Rick's approach and again he's coming back from being a head coach in the SEC with Georgia where they had a lot of rivalries and he I think understands how to get his team emotionally ready and he knew the energy of this stadium would take care of that part of it so I don't think he needed any rahrah speech or anything that he needed to do throughout the week even pregame we've kind of look at each other I get a little bit more professional than when we're used to when they came out of the tunnel for the game it's all about Miami and Florida State now chance for the Canes to make that statement let's go down to Samantha ponder with Mark Rix you've been a part of this on both sides you played you coach you something get a little chippy out there how would you describe what makes this game so different I just think everybody knows each other too good that's why the biggest thing and it's an old state pride a lot of history as well I'm going to come to your defense you've got some young guys specifically at linebacker up against the offense you're up against tonight how have you prepared them for that type of challenge and where do you see the most opportunity for success well they were here was three started to the center and heard it as long as anybody else so I think they're ready thank you Jim both pitchers never lost to Miami that's six NL record a winning streak beginning when he took over as the head coach in Tallahassee but his team is three in Sucher they've been blasted by Louisville heartbreaking loss to Carolina last week he has been searching and trying to find the emotional fun supports to get to the respond how fortunate for him after this sluggish start that they're playing Miami in Miami because that will should get his team ready to go if that can't get it ready to go then I don't know what can those one the COS deferred to Logan Tyler will boot it away for the Seminoles and won't see Brad kya and that Cain's offense poteete pickoff guys from Southern California he first became aware of the Kings when they played that Rose Bowl game in blasted Nebraska here he is a few years later yeah we talked about him in the open and the experience and it's really kind of a prototypical drop back quarterback 64 215 pounds poison leadership will be big the run past options his decisionmaking they're going to have to take some deep shot teams have had success taking shots there'll be opportunities he's got some fleetfooted wide receivers and tied in and when kya gets his chance to go downfield he's going to have to capitalize you see last year over 400 yards passing against the Noles that was with no running game to speak oh there's no defense has been sleepwalking through opening series only Charleston Southern has not scored a touchdown and they're opening possession against Florida State four to five game that's staggering I think it's a Walton immediate pressure aspect is long down by shake computer linebacker one of the adjustments in Charles Kelley first in ten they're expecting run so early they set the edge with a blitz from number 16 Jacob Pugh does a nice job Miami tries to catch him off guard with playaction on first and ten but man coverage on the outside and the Blitz that time for the little defense is a kewpie presentation to the game you can slam down hard in the opening play on second and 15 they flip it out far side this is one of the tight end David and Joker the Canes have three talented tight ends all who can catch passes will fill out them tonight they are NFL looking tight ends if the size that they have both of them about six for 250 pounds and can run yoku it really came in more of the wide receiver earned it more of your traditional tight end because see a lot of too tied in close eleven yards on third down further down with a nightmare a year ago for this same pass protection not the strength to diss offensive line you can ask get the ball out Oh rough for from the pocketed slip short gets made that dragged on immediately as Mark Walton Matthew Thomas the backer in coverage and the Canes go three and out work part of the problem for Florida State in a few of their games has been miscommunication as its own is it man if the first series is any indication with Charles Kelly it's you got him and you've got him and we're going to attack the line of scrimmage and offense wants to run the ball and if they throw we're coming after the quarterback but we're playing man everybody got it man coverage on the back end they were lost in that scene much better sir wouldn't it better focus Justin Vogel back to punt Bobo Wilson is Depot will get to hold this one proving kick driving Wilson way back to the seventh and the case that a fan event get back to the 20yard line terrific punt by Vogel and DeAndre Francois the freshman quarterback would begin from the 20 yard line to flag down and pump in 63 yards during the kick personal style in fact I'll be kicking soon Walton the running back guilty of the personal foul metal move all to the 35 deandre Francois the redshirt freshman impressive looking quarterback has great poise and toughness he's been tested already this year I have to use his feet especially on third down remind me comes after you I also going to have to take opportunities were they also they like to get the ball thrown downfield and Miami will play man and when you play mantoman you better hold up on Island because the Andre Francois has an arm and we can get a phone down fear look bad early breakfast a curtain tumble for across the 40 nice gain of six on first down the chickfila impact players tonight record starts with Dalvin cook for the Florida State offense when he is going it says everything else Travis Rudolph he's a big night tonight being able to give unbalanced and look forward to seeing these freshman linebacker Shaq quarterman number 55 in the middle and Cornell der a corner who will be a we talked about earlier he's going to be isolated quite a bit tonight on Travis who it off we'll have to slow well so forth incredible it has three three freshmen starting at linebacker you don't see that one rarely alone three that's why I'd be back field on second and fourth of nearside is though battling back makes the catch and a spot is right near the first down to the 45 yard line interesting you bring that up with the three true freshmen and they have not really been tested against the passing thing you look at their schedule their first four games they dudes have not been tested so these three young men are going to see a very very different look tonight Francois and old Burton short Francois sneaks it and muscles easily for the first down they want these guys to play fast and aggressive but Kirk I mean we're going to see freshmen make mistake like this the challenge you have is a young linebacker is you're so amped up in a rivalry game you've grown up thinking about this opportunity and now it's right in front of you and you see number four about 15 or 20 feet away from you you are locked in and stopped at what they have to be careful tonight is being too aggressive because that's when the playaction pass can hurt them from behind so the heavy traffic and will soon midfield Alvin Smith mentioned growing up here in Miami his good buddy Joe year be running back for the Hurricanes is an extra sense of inspiration he's good or not against anybody but when he gets against the Canes you can you can see it his performance how much you build it include the total yards especially last year a lot of them coming in the fourth quarter first and you add all that up it's almost 11 yards a rush in these two you about that every time he steps the ball in carrying an 11 yard the second down handoff but accelerates will be stopped again just short of the marker by Jaquan Johnson again 30 short see the communication on the road it's the best way you see it all over college football it's a young freshman himself landing dickerson tapping the center everly to let him know that we're all set everybody has to call snap the ball the very loud environment tonight the offensive coordinators green 3rd and short and again a quarterback sneak for front loss a good matchup kind of a game within a game will be the de Cannes defensive line so they had switched with Manny Diaz is their new defensive coordinator from a three for which they've had for the last five years with al golden now the traditional Miami for three he brought that back and they've got some young players up front with a lot of talent I think the matchup upfront should favor Miami he's proud the lines I bought back on and first down and takes for georgeanna Commission over there so clearly Whitfield the great things about Jimbo Fisher is his innovative innovative offensive approach he gives you here Nazir he's going to go tempo so many different looks with formations and personnel groupings a really challenges that communicate share the defense remember what gills in the backfield front wall rolls out and press out on a defensive line and hit a big shot come on up there was a spec go ceasing they've got a lot of depth up there and tremendous speed great job of being able to bring him down if the end is kept in just a bit short there's quarterman the freshman linebacker to clean it up remember a couple third and short today hasn't sleep this is a little bit longer they're going to happy to get the ball to down to Parker get him on the air I'm going to get there is the penetration by Kendrick Norton a big created by Boone sophomore remember Jean Jenkins for safety clean it up just talked about the matchup and how it could favor the Canes look at this separation he just pushes Everly right back into the backfield great anticipation there by Kendrick Norton expecting the ball to be handed deep into the backfield by cook he gets the separation and eventually gets into the backfield and blow that playoff picture is going to go for it to the loss on that play so it's serving about three and a half and either third attempt on fourth down decision to pursue last week Francois that is out of the line of scrimmage in the cane events makes the stand and will take over as Demetrius Jackson came off the end of pick it up Bennett Diaz rolls the dice on his big fourth down here early Dalvin cook wide open out the flat if he gets the ball over Jackson not only did they pick up the first down but the ball gets the cookies maybe down the sideline for a touchdown but the Canes get to stop if you watch the wildness in College Station like to say I am surviving doubleovertime over Tennessee welcome to Miami Midway first quarter this cane Seminole rivalry second possession for Miami I another loan but I'm percentage throw rocks in various made for this is at the point us you got some senior some leaders out there and ever the ones John yeah it's the coin thaw the captain's you can see tre Marshall two safeties and on the other side from Miami Jamaal Carter Brett kya trying to say hey fellas it let's keep our cool but it gives you a playbook Miami Florida State again look nearsighted Stacy Kohli we flipped down the fastest man on this Miami team could have had some room but turf months forgot him it'll be third down and that's one of those be talking the open one of the things you look to do tonight the runpass option the RPO and he felt that he had the leverage to the outside got the ball in the hands of polling Politis loss to his feet or he would have had a first down alright doesn't roll out often but does this time and it's a low throw kind of get it to Coley incomplete as his first incompletion AJ Westbrook was in coverage in Miami will punt again again Charles Kelly dialing up the pressure he has been under fire you can see the energy the emotion here's Darwin James who's been out but one of the leaders of this team you can see his energy highfiving he's trying to create some confidence there the true freshman coach has had enough he is bringing the heat and playing man tonight highrisk highreward and see how that plays out as Bogle is back with his second punt team dat 63 yards first time this one not quite that far and Wilson will make a fair catch at the 23 so we're seeing the Knowles defense off to a much better start than they have been recently Cooke and company back to work Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by Mesa premiere partner of the Heisman Trophy see the reconfigured hard rock steady and then groupings look like a soccer stadium a nice night for Klein Goodyear providing aerial coverage no matter what group your vehicle runs choose good year for superior performance with your official sponsor of the college football playoff congratulations on the new look at it Stadium and it will very cool and it is very loud they do Mecca the job any downside it would be the big screen that cost some seats in the corner but it's well worth it nice fan experience I mean players lovely increased energy in here Knowles ran ten plays before their initial Drive would stop on fourth down we feel pressure up the middle don't our delivery sparse how to get a block on the edge and of course Downton gain for Wickfield quick throw to the outside another way to try to keep the cane secondary honest and prevent them from loading up and piling up on Dalvin cook and that running game touched on it just a bit there at the end of their last series how innovative and challenging and complex Jimbo Fisher can be and that's the thing the communication will be a big key tonight for those young linebackers that's terrific game beeps 21 and fourth down long running all the way behind tucked it back you said he'd be an important part of the running game tonight he sure was against North Carolina right and he has enough athletic ability where he makes the defensive coordinator aware of what he can do with his feet designed quarterback run there you get the numbers right in that box area France squads good enough of an athlete where he can pick up 10 to 15 yards Fisher told us that he knew the front always a good athlete is a better runner more instinctive runner than he thought he was coming in you see backfield on first down Antron loses the ball collected has to make something of it and will be fat loses it again and the Noles extremely fortunate to retain possession now between my in this direction they may reconsider when they get to the bottom of the pile Bobo Wilson recovered it but not one but two fumbles on the quarterback there yeah I thought he might just give up on the play and just kind of cover it but you know this is him he's still young to try to make something happen I played he just acted almost the first caller but he left all of it he was seen very clearly the low blow Wilson jumped on top of that football but a significant loss now for a second 21 have only lost two homers this year we flirted with a thoroughbred safe handoff to cook who is knocked down after a short game that brings Aurore any crowds have always flies tough defenses that's always brought the noise down there isn't it absolutely and I think they sense there's a different energy from this statement acorn elder they really challenged him is one of the seniors and say hey a little bit to finesse with the style of defense or playing porn you are going to have to be more physical than he is active right now that runs support great play by number 29 overall those third and half the arts they see this time Miami's tremendous third down defense I'll be it against lesser competition the first four games at a hurry just get it away French water from the pocket again is the ball batted down second time tonight that was our J McIntosh the sophomore from Fort Lauderdale when they did a great job of showing pressure and then faith they had they bailed here the safety bails they only ended up rushing three they had at one point seven guys up close to the line of scrimmage put RJ McIntosh and the rest of that defensive line gets enough of a push and there's another example of the athletic ability the length and the size of Miami having an advantage against the Noles who gets that offensive line logan sylars our freshman punter with a speedy diminutive braxton barrios and let me get the low point away there it's going to have a change from the thirty darts through and it's across the 40 so better field position for kiya and Akane's scoreless late first quarter in miami miss her be yesterday think the big orange magic runs out so Tennessee and Houston among two of the unbeaten teams to fall today magic runs out but a heck of an effort to get that game into overtime by the Vols to three an ounce for Miami to start this game third possession here they haven't called a running play yet kya flips it again and Joe threw the big tight end of the tough man ship but Marc brick is calling the plays we'll check with him in a sec but quickly Samantha's on the for estate side what do you see different down there from the defense it's shockingly different on the sideline just incredibly communicative demonstrative I mean this is a team that we barely saw communicate at all on the sidelines in that game against Ole Miss and Louisville I don't know what's gotten into them I don't know if they had to come to do this moment this week but the coaches are having a hard time Charles Kelly getting to the players because they're talking to each other so much and the one guy that's kind of leading the charge even though it is somewhat of a collective effort is German James of course the guy that can't even play but it's really assuming that leadership role Sammy that's a great report and I got to believe that a lot of the criticism over the first four or five weeks of their defensive coordinator of the players individually has really rallied them also playing a rival it brings out the best in you and I made a point of saying that the adjustment from Charles Kelly was playing more mantoman and more litt singers Nate Andrews a senior and has really had to fight through some injuries his first half in his seasons not the kind of athlete that James is he's been trying to fill in at that position but the James just a sophomore one of the best players in the country one of the best leaders they've ever had at Florida State as a sophomore incredibly and to the guys that felt lost for a few games and quick samantha said to have you seen early from Kelly's defense of any indication they're finally finally growing up better late than never pains me to yard on second down it's a running play this year being who moves into FSU territory they will move to six for the first time touched on something that I don't know a lot of fans know there's a Miami fans if our Creek decided to take his god one of the first things he decided to do was roll up his sleeves and become the play caller again haven't done it since like the old thick season when he was at Georgia gets loose and Dalvin cook high school teammates things to the 35 he's never called him from the field which he says for him is a lot tougher than the press box view I just love the fact it I think he's realized by taking his job but he says he's coaching the quarterbacks he's his game planning he look at his film he's no longer that CEO type of head coach flip it out in the flat this was burned in the Taihang to get the block and is spun down aggressively on the far sideline may be proud wanted a flag on three Marshall didn't get one more quick dialing up some some tempo right now you know he had Mike beau blow there and a lot of success and he didn't you kind of trusted his play caller he kind of backed off and just kind of managed things now he he is calling this game near be rock forward and Rick's older but everybody knows that the Florida State's defense is fathered by tempo in the kingdom shoving some of it here the first time we've really got the taste and a feel for it is mixing up the run with the throw and when you have a veteran quarterback you can do that the tempo is what has caused Charles Kelly the miscommunication and the issues in the back end which is conferring here it's a fine out the Miami bring some substitutes on but a rift is confused as to the nature of this cause there there over with official timeout to replace the chain that's how fast they were going we broke the chain off the chain one way is slow in offense down the first is a goodlooking Drive moved in 40 yards very quickly just a minute 13 they in this courting position the red zone the red zone was just a terrible problem for Miami they converted easily against lesser defense this season's are put against the Noles in the past we recent losses it's been a struggle down here yeah but I think with a new head coach you kind of throw all those numbers away and it's about trying to institute against against this defense to see if they get back to an up tempo second fiveyear B tries to bounce it good penetration and he's not for a walk there that great play there by the Knowles defense moving a bunch of different guys into this lineup right now see them being able to get off the blocks of Lane coming in there and make a play guys we have not seen much of this year lane get the chance to make place and now it's third in six some command demand pressure ayah from the pocket and listed in the enzyme and over the head of injoke GU fourth down coming up and he took a hit after the pearl again Matthew Thomas got to him they actually delay the blitz there's a couple of different Blitzers right here here's Westbrook who's going to come from here you're going to see a late delayed it ends up actually getting home Brad kaya's going to wait and wait as long as he can with Thomas the linebacker with great instincts and he felt that they would have knocked him down effected that tire Michael Bagley from 37 yards they're reliable junior kicker he knocks it right through and so Miami draws first blood late first quarter three nothing so many great moments thank you the silver anniversary Oh wide right run anyone sorry to bring up that painful memory for Seminole family there's a lot of flex for dinero this is good to see rivalry back and see beautiful homes together on the field eight play 39 yard field goal drive sunday NFL insiders at 10 o'clock all the latebreaking news which you need for your fantasy team and then 11:00 the new sunday NFL countdown Boomer Trent Dilfer Charles Woodson and Hasselbaink and Randy Moss furtive to keep also on the watch ESPN app nobody's scored in the first quarter this year on the Hurricanes again there's that asterisk behind all the things we talk about with this team because the schedule do one of the weakest in the country defense again off to an impressive truck today a fourth down stop and those first driver they've been stout since then meet Dalvin cook it's scary already in the workhorse South after a short gain by the viiiage axon it gave him an option there at the line of scrimmage to run left to run right eight almost nine men up at the line of scrimmage again we talked about that in the open how challenging that's been for cook to deal with the times he tries to look at the numbers and go to the right with the games with that speed with a very very nice job of taking away the cutback lanes and pursuing the football it's three and a half work area so far for Dalvin final minute of the first quarter on the pocket Renoir takes a shot that delivers a strike for a first down to Travis Rudolph the junior you had to stand in there and deliver Kirk with a camera in his mug that was an unbelievable effort the pressure comes from the outside in to the inside Patchen actually gets to him but the matchup on the outside right now the watch his Travis Rudolph the junior going up against Cornell door one on one great focus that time by Francois puts the ball right where his man can make a play on it he the final play of the opening quarter just get off and Francois roll and wanted to take a down field shot and now just fires it into the fence Henrik Norton knocked him down and Francois lost his helmet is very slow to get up no flag but a message delivered he's proving his toughness already this season he could have to show it again tonight 3nothing ade firstquarter dominated by defense it was really close to a personal foul didn't call it back after this message it worked for your local ABC station that big hit on francois to end the first quarter hopefully has an ended his ninth but for now he is out of the game Kirk as a check out for that shoulder there he slam down by Norton Shawn Maguire is in the game for his first action is even senior from New Jersey who filled in for suspended Jameis Winston a home field win over company a couple years ago puts it short and behind bobo wilson who does make the Kachin again not been in there even in mopup duty this season but he's been preparing for this moment hoping he's ready as a senior the fact he kept his mouth shut by getting beat out by a freshman has gained the respect that much more from his teammates when he comes into the game they believe in it they put him in tough situations at the backup on Thursday and practices his teammates saluted him now he's got to go out based on him preparation as you said as a starter and go out and deliver third down the tough this is your first liveaction of the year a very loud environment collects the snap feels the pressure and will not they come right after McGwire and Gerald Willis and Joe Jackson took backups combining their he wanted to go to the right with the football but the problem he has here is to his receivers end up running into each other off to the right here he's looking to the right look out here two receivers run into each other making it very tough to be able to execute and all I can do is eat it but again Miami bringing the pressure and getting after the Knowles offensive line those guys an orange up krumper coming in waves Kristine you see 12 guys late defensive line so far and a humid night smart Martin all of them appear to be quick and final everybody right Tyler I'm answering a pump in there is a flag it was worth in court seeing so unless this is a personal foul it won't be a first down and here to be a little bit of a gentle pump that the flag did come out it's a 5yard penalty and we'll see if the those want to decline it any be ssaying I'd be very careful that it's Richards a wide receiver who is coming after hunter good acting job by today Richard says it I think a pretty good case Sam man I barely touched him if he chooses to wreak it you know look at it here five yards running into the kicker on the defense fiveyard penalty fourth down there's only a 31 yarder they will retake it it came zip blocks a couple of punts this year good special teams play a part of the for know start Ariana eleven yards in his first return sheekha maps here the Fed has set up the return what the job is Miami defense has done here so far in this game for to say limited to 51 total yard Dalvin cook only 21 yards so far running the football has it made a catch which has been a big part of their adjustment over the last two or three games and made a catch yet father never really a low kick bounces around various backs away and Kirk that tenth is getting crowded in there friends why was being looked at we're told that McGuire went into the tent as well after that series oh I mentioned the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean the damage around the southeast of America if you'd like to make a pledge of support visit redcross.org again our Fonseca Volvo is affected Red Cross now being warned and the helmets of both teams tonight Ford estates high 10 Haven Saunders his family is from Bimini in the Bahamas which was just ravaged but thankfully Saunders family came out okay I and the Kings go to work from the pocket he delivers a short ball over the middle of March welcome they used the back and the tight ends a lotta nice percent gain of nine Miami the last series went up tempo get into line of scrimmage impacted in those psyche they're going right back to that they've mixed the run with the past their best drive so far often nothing doing both Walton and Joel year B and scored a touchdown to them all four games so far with tougher sledding tonight the run oriented team it's nice to have that tandem back their last play with Derek naughty nice to see him healthy and a quick play you know 31 run it again and moves a six wire by the way is out of the tent good news he was in there great grief maybe we checked out for the medical personnel for Florida State it looks to be okay after the sack and Francois who just joining us having his shoulder looked at as he was slammed to the ground right at the end of the first quarter repeat Walton again sophomore from Miami a short game can't overstate how tough it is for him yeah he played a lot of football he's been in some big moments in big stages but not this year and now suddenly he's in the fray yeah but again I think he's approached being the backup of the senior wanting to express himself I heard even this week he laid into the team and they respect his opinion so when he gets in there I think it's a player that they believe in it trusts back on 77 takes it down field shop this is poly their fastest receiver put the ball delivered outside Samantha yeah her we see your point about Shawn Maguire once he went in after he came off after the sack he was very cold and selected not jumping around just went down the line of all his skill position guys all his oldline get mold handshake like hey I've got this no big deal and that's the type of senior leadership they want to see out of your backup quarterback also no word yet on DeAndre who stayed in athletic training sent the entire time Thank You Samantha and got his abs off as they check the shoulder out again fired new side in the traffic incomplete to get the ball to malcolm lure very well covered by robots a taylor a true freshman is a great job by Taylor and Kraus Kelly telling us this week he will play more and the reason is he plays well in mantoman they're playing a ton of mantoman watch him get underneath so you can see it and frame by frame his right hand gets in but it was actually a really good play in real time gets the left hand hand left hand in there to knock that ball away you get compared to LaMarcus Joyner as a quarter vet is high praise for a young guy versus the great Knowles allamerican so Vogel who's punted very well tonight and drives Wilson back to the 20 and the Canes perfect team flying down there to stop him right there they lose a yard on the return is for an elder there speedy starting corner made the play 49yard punt Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by Pacific Life helping generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years oldschool defensive battle soap are you surprised yeah I don't receive appointment yeah I and again I think there's still kind of feeling each other houses whether you ruin the shotgun arriving shotgun she was good here for superior performance Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff so again it's McGuire taking over Francois still being looked at at right shoulders what they're looking at inside of that tent Nate enters is getting wrapped up the better looks like he's going to be good to go they put some cramping around his right shoulder as well Alvin cook yet hard as he left through a small crease which closed down quickly I think forth happening right now you can see him right there the front the andre francois the freshman quarterback trying to loosen up that shoulder to see if he's going to be able to come back into this game but Miami I don't feel feel threatened at all by the vertical passing game today are playing mantoman on the outside and everybody else is locked in on Dalvin cook in the running game and being aggressive at the point of attack and they're all over him before me so about two three Dalvin cook in a footrace elder able to chase him down but a huge gain the kind of thing that Cook has done the last two years to the cane this is a missed tackle here in the backfield to watch him when he runs right here to left right there they had him tackled it shows you two toughness and how physical Dalvin cook can be but it looked to me that the Metreon Jackson had him wrapped up for a loss but when you try to tackle Dalvin cook there's a reason he wanted to talk back he has such tremendous leg Drive low center of gravity you better wrap him up or he's going to break through he's got 54 they're very close the entire offensive production up to that point for Florida State deaf West Africa's fouling cook and he's a physical 230 pound sophomore knocked down for a short gain ironically I just talked about how they're playing mantoman and everybody else is attacking the running game with Dalvin cook when you play that that's kind of that highrisk highreward defense you're going to get a lot of negative plays you're going to get a lot of short games and if you don't make a tackle the line of scrimmage you've got eight or nine dives up there to stop him and if he breaks free plenty left to stop in and he's able to pick up 54yard older code is paid to crack them down force analysis of the red zone here second any McGuire fire intercepted kick off our decay Jeff Juan Johnson was standing right there and McGuire deliberate in his chest he does a good job of just reading the eyes of the quarterback Sean Maguire he's sitting back here and watch him read the eyes and I believe that linebacker right there actually affected that quarterman Jack quarterman 55 got his hands on the ball talk about concentration from Johnson hit ball is tipped and then caught by Johnson a sophomore who Manny Diaz says he is one of the toughest guys on his team one of the most kind of a scrappy guy that time Shawnee athletic ability to make that play another local kid Kurt Nicoll back makes a pick Francois at his shoulder pads back home that's a good sign Messiah they can over after the games first turnover here be the back in the I information they beat a film and Joe here be hammers neck right at the line of scrimmage by I'm a while he drives him back they're rotating a lot of bodies just like what we've seen you seem in a backdrop ninetyfour like it says a good job of being able to get off the potential blocked by Casey McDermott uses that athletic ability and Chrissy talked about Miami rotating a lot of bodies seeing the same thing from Florida State I think they've still that same community that we feel and it could be the battle of the fittest here is always time we did in the fourth quarter that it is sweltering down there isn't not a breath of wind in the stadium gaya on a slant complete and that's the freshman Oman Richard kid potential de sky very quick learner and they think he's going to be a thought Sbarro's McFadden who has been picked on at times his here he can't give away the inside may make the young freshmen go to the outside that time to easy papaya delivers the colinear sign better step lowers the children human field another first down the play before McFadden gave away the quick plant that time with a soft cushion another easy throw this is where the experience and the vision of Brad kaya can come into play they're going in a brick neck speed here but he's a very very calm on how he's trying to pick apart an old secondary hear me at the back and a quick burst the airbase willing for the 11 yards and the caves with tempo over the ball again how bout the pitch in here this play looks like it's going to go off to the right here he has a quick is putting the ground right there and he's able to feel that and cut back nice job reading that and feel in the deepest overflowing what's really quick but your being dancing for a short game they get just inside field goal range for badger he's an excellent kicker they're thinking 7 here Charles Kelly and the Knowles defense has to be saying okay we've seen this from Ole Miss we've seen this from the large hacks in Louisville we saw this last week from mr. Biskit North Carolina we've got now you'll see the adjustments from the Noles to see if they're ready for this up tempo on another flat area and his hands on it broken up nicely buying markzware's white he's been a steady job at corner I can't talk wife got his hand on the ball just went off the face map thereof Barrios and just right off the hands ball is perfectly thrown out in front of the receiver he just dropped it again able and beat the Florida State defense to the inside much easier throw for the quarterback Brad pile those quick slants and folks we need eight on third down gold rush for kya retreat that the screen look flips it up to Walters got a convoy of blockers Wharton busting to the secondary cuts it back squat down near the pen you can see it coming but it was hard to stop I think made injuries you got to give him credit for trying to be out there but watch it watch 29 trying to stay up with this to try to make a play he's playing with one arm out there trying to defend the play 27 yard game the Canes ran right down and this is what's given FSU's defense bob bennett kirk it tempo inside the red zone absolutely absolutely I thought oh come on Nate Andrews father credit play Canasta custom five yards you go back to Nate Andrews here who's trying to get involved he needs to be there to be able to defend this is nowhere to be seen because he's planning Healy can't even run his shoulder is in such pain nice job with the linemen getting down field there was nobody there to block because Matthew Thomas was taken out of it he was blocked and Nate Andrew just couldn't stay up with the play of wolf and ain't the tough guy but he's not the fastest runner on any circumstances he's out of the lineup now firstly 15 3 receivers to the left for kya they throw it catches may have been it's a loss hammered immediately as Richards Varis McFadden is that is that a rough last few games been a nice play there he recognized with the three receivers there that two of them were going to block and he reacted so quickly the miami wide receivers had no chance to block him that was great reaction you're right we've been tough on the pad two times because he had some some struggles there gives an indication of his potential and athletic 36 to spent a hundred ninety eight pounds very long highly touted bigtime recruit he did feel kind of feeling his way that time he made a quick read wide your penalty for yard loss or second and nineteen they got to get to the tune for a first down gaya in traffic Walton had it knocked away it was a risky growth is they were Semenov all over the place it'll be third and long we're trying to hide Walton with a little slit screen trying to get those linebackers to think if Walton is actually blocking and try to get them involved in the pass rush but even if he was able to hold on to this if you said chrisarah a boatload of defenders they're not only hoskin the defensive linemen felt that play as well DeMarcus Christmas thought he maybe had a gift there the kids go down out of him get out a minute of an interesting run there with that got it kya got in the third is very long you can gotta get visit to the set with the end zone this is hallway drastic no signal out of bounds incomplete terrific throw Taylor the freshman covering the veteran who couldn't get his feet down well it's going to be an interesting look the left leg looked like it may have been down what's his left foot as he catches the ball is it down that's the one question the right foot right foot I was a bit interesting with the left play see when it stopped I have to that's the touchdown if guitars have to the cover Davis they're taking a look at this Jill Ryder at the replay official good comment by Herbie because it looks to me like he gets possession ball right here watch the foot there's the ball there's the foot this is going to be a touchdown in my opinion the crowds bigger they'll be King's Bench think so remember that not just Joe Ryder but the folks at the ACC headquarters in Greensburg it's collaborative replay and they're communicating in realtime so they're watching in Greensboro Joe Ryder's watching in the booth not far from us but that was a a bangbang play if you need to get caught up in the right foot but is the left foot it was still down when he possessed the ball how about the pro by kazehaya and the match up he took a shot man to man an old play straight across man to man Taylor made some great plays earlier but he trusts a piccoli a senior to be able to be at the right spot put it right to the outside where only his guy could make the play on it perfectly thrown ball by Brad time and again Dave in your view that's indisputable evidence to the turnover the call of incomplete it is because you can see possession with that foot down it doesn't take an eternity just possession how big is this swing to the touchdown ten nothing pretty lengthy field goal attempt for badly this is a really really big swing for a board estate team that it's been battle tested they've been through a lot the first month of the season and then a big rivalry game with it playing pretty well this comes if up a touchdown I'll just let you down 10 defense that came out inspired a couple of three announced to start the game it's still limited Miami to only 124 yards pickup to come on fingers draw give it to me I had that toe down it's a long review and tells you that they're close mostly a looking at it maybe even debating it and we're look tough I mean it's a really tough ball hand hands right now and the oh just touching the ground yeah I think so to me it's a touchdown it's close but it's touchdown to my eyes my eyes and since it's a consensus it'll be incomplete what's the divot say the Dybbuk in car does predict with certainty when the boots and engage gates greensboro will to never know here's that divot you can see the foot touching and maybe looking everything maybe looking at the grass we're getting some good look Dwain hate after review the receivers left foot was in down for the ball a tremendous throw by kya a 21yard acrobatic catch by Coley the senior is fit to the season and the Canes a point away from a doubledigit lead it was spectacular on both ends third down throw by Brad Kyle and Stacey Coley a guy who has been through a lot in his career at Miami wants to put it all together his senior year heck of an effort to extend and keep that foot down come up with a touchdown and Bagley makes it 72 consecutive points after touchdown a third 19 touchdown how about the effort a great throw Brad Pilon was in rhythm that's a big thing for him he gets back he feels comfortable and right now he is in command and his offense puts the ball where only Coley could make the play in the Canes are up 10 love the font narrating glory days of this rivalry Miami Hilton for a breakthrough win by 10 they've been here before though couple years ago here with a Samantha ponder for the latest on France was condition yep Chrissy's coming back in here no doubt he is nowhere near 100% dealing with that right shoulder injury I saw him in warmups you actually had a long time to warm up because of how long that drive lasted and he looked pretty good in terms of velocity but the grimace on his face is body language it is clear he is playing in a lot of pain assistant coaches went up to the offensive line right before he ran out right there and said take care of your quarterback they know what's at stake here Sammy it's interesting it's his throwing shoulder to keep an eye on and also he's athletic he says success tonight running the football does that element go away from how they attack this defense to Miami you're right that's a great point they should be pretty fast if you think the quarterback in harm's way deliver the from rear side short game they haven't taken anything approaching a downfield shot you never know they have not I don't think they can get down to this is a big hit here by Morton old and wait 305 pounds coming down on top of him and that shoulder I thought he might when you see a hit like that a lot of times just shocked to see a guy come back the same game see how he holds up here now he's back in the lineup and once again familiar position in old faces deficit a doubledigit deficit in the first half fourth time this year and so I wellprotected that the ball batted down he actually had to come backs of 20plus points in the first month of his career important walk downhill forget loss last week they brought him back and took the lead a fitness defensive line I know you and I everybody's got to be impressed with this youth and the depth here that time Demetrius Jackson who's been active tonight big number 31 a sophomore 63 255 Miami jumps up times it up perfectly remember Francois 6 I'm Jack just knock that ball away I'm sixthree sixfour sixfive big athletic dude up front for the game shave to the old days and Swami's ate on third down they do bring pressure well protected again in the first down delivery on the far side to Whitfield answer some questions that long throw but when you bring the Blitz it wasn't just the linebacker but they also brought men from the secondary it creates a nice soft cushion behind that nice job with Francois the shoulder everything he's dealing with gets the ball out into the flat where that blitz came from the Whitfield they pick up the first down great boys hit toughness there but a freshman and that offensive line is heeding the warnings of protecting the quarterback so far they've got 16 yards on 13 eight I'm showing pressure and so I get to the way batted in the air and almost intercepted it's incomplete in coverage there that was race Shawn Jenkins who got his hand on the ball watch the linebackers again they are not slowing down its freshness dead Shaq orderman you say he's kind of an alpha for a freshman and Kareem are there's no chance to slow him down or to state very fortunate that ball was not intercepted great reaction by raeshawn Jenkins to get his hands on that ball and not get up into the air if they go Gerald Willis defensive lineman it took a dive at it let's stretch play to cook when the Kings bring it out he does well back to the line of scrimmage that's how you set the edge yeah they've heard all week watch the cut back with with Alva cook his vision take away all the gaps look at this they set the edge to get penetration again by Norton great effort there by Johnson who had held but he keeps contain he force his foot back to the inside whether seven or eight orange jerseys broke into that football they rotate fresh bodies into that defensive line for the third in Panama this defense is playing with confidence right now so master Francois again gets good protection and deliberate downfield making a nice recovery to knock the ball away his elders at a big first half I love Manny Diaz approach tonight they've been blitzing and playing man all night now they give him the third down and drops his own watch for an elder he is playing in the flat but he thinks and watched the effort here he's just reading the eyes does a good job of extending and knocking that away I'm good with that playing zone reading the eyes and the athletic ability one of those underrated corners in the country this year Cornell der the pole layout get back to that ball Wow logan powers been busy Barrios watches it sale over his head and into the end zone so Brad kya that terrific touchdown throw in the last series back to Miami up 10 nothing big that on ESPN Tuesday at 10:00 Eastern the undefeated presents a conversation with the president forts raise and achievement one our forum with President Obama from the campus of North Carolina A&amp;T State Standards ten o'clock Eastern also on the watch ESPN app so Miami the 10nothing lead back on offense from the 20 running games has been really busted loose so far it's been Chaya efficient and effective trolling an app breaking loose this is the freshman richer dive tip the man still going in the FSU territory a wily player he's able to make the play for watch number seven who's moved over it's the first time he's played defense or Mon Lane he's going to the middle he looks confused so once the ball is caught here by Richards there's nobody there because her mom Lane who's kind of just feeling his way right now moving over from receiver to defensive back 38 yards for Richards in math kya is another downfield shot threw it into traffic Barrios and Coley were in the area and a flag comes in on coverage it was Marquess white guarding Barrios when you again it's another example of the defensive back never seeing the football never turning back to look for the ball and if there's any contact at that point it's going to be pass interference on the defense he never turned around you saw a shot of Charles Kelly and after a terrific start to this game as we check it out again exactly what you were saying you can see it's a very last second he tries to turn around and his point was Barrios who is engaging with me but the problem is if you don't turn your head around and there take the football then fifteen your family going to move it inside the thirtyfirst without very fast offense that 15yard penalty will also be enforced first down Wow so a dead ball personal foul on Miami I think that was Ontario City into the play i watch the end at the end after the interference there's that there's a fastener for yourself Heda throws him to the ground that's actually a really good catch by the official to see that right hand that's why there was a whole bunch of laundry on the beach I'm just the interference that was what is actually arguing mr. Wayne hey still so certain things out that they moved upon to the initial penalty to the 27 now they have to march it back to fan basketball now using the back after the interference that's the break before to safe Kirk but let's talk about the importance of the next 2:47 before halftime and not falling farther behind you've seen France warrior quarterback get knocked around he's playing in a lot of pain and this is a team it's felt a lot of pain in the first five games I mean it's not to say that they can't come back if they get down by 17 but everything that they've been through you wonder about how fragile they are emotionally and I know Mark Richt senses that this is a big opportunity for his offense to be able to try to jump up on this Noel's team as 1410 after the two penalties and khaya from the pocket again what's down field for Koli again one on one coverage in a diving attempt off his hand him a kyle myers a true freshman left out there on an island much like Levante taylor who the true freshman for Florida State they have confidence he'll leave him out there one on one actually pretty good coverage there terrific way yeah about that Miami's best and fastest receiver the progressive pylon cam showing you the play that was made by kyle myers these are playing fast there's a short gain a throw and Joker we've seen guys we haven't seen a lot this year because of the the intensity of this game the tempo the humidity perhaps coaches are trusting a lot of guys tonight yeah you have to and if this point it seems that you've worked and worked and worked and now it's a matter trying to get out there in games and see what you can do is the pivotal third down they need six borderline field goal range for Badgley and Miami will spend a timeout they had plenty of time on the play clock 30second timeout the Rick wants to check things out here he knows the importance of this third down ploy as you said Monday Night Football NFC South matchup Jameis and the Buccaneers touch' Jameis is watching this time Cam Newton of course he knocked in the head see his status so six o'clock Eastern for Monday night countdown 8:15 for the game game is tormented is Miami Hurricanes team in a couple of victories so if you're mark Rix and you're back calling plays for the first time in you know seven eight years you got a third down in six what do you expect from the defense what do you call well I think you're going to see mantoman and Florida State's been in mantoman most of the night trusting their corners to hold up and you got to come up with a man beater you either a crossing route or you get the ball downfield a coldie and your experienced receivers but Mark Richt has got to feel very very good with the entire effort the offense defense special teams every aspect to get back into this rivalry again it's been fun to watch we've been watched the emotion to this game it's Amanda me and I talked about this here's a tall wall trying to track tacklers terrific effort buddy two yards short of a first down Matthew Thomas stopped him and here comes the kicker michael Badgley will come out wonder if Ricky thought about it for a second now it surprised that Jimbo Fisher wouldn't call a timeout three remaining just to save himself in his offense a little bit of time whether they make this field goal or not they're just Miami's just going to work the clock down Mark Richt in fact is out there he might be waiting to display clocks all the way down and then wants to call his own time top I thought Jimbo may call timeout save some time I mentioned the leg badger that impressed you and warm up he has picked a 57yard I was a year ago against jewel to check this is from 51 Rick will spend a timeout in those defense that did a nice job to rise up and prevent this from becoming a sevenpoint drive it did again without calling at that time and you call that timeout it's right about at the twominute mark here in a minute minute 20 and still have all three timeouts Rick the chorus who played quarterback at Miami but there was some talent ahead of on the depth chart you believe this Kelly of course Testaverde and Kosar all coached by Earl moral the former NFL great so under old number 9 didn't see a lot actually but definitely that one was walking school 15 years of Georgia couple SEC titles seven topten finishes for that part of to Florida State national championship teams in 93 and 99 grew up in Boca ratone just up the coast so badly after the timeout from 51 to make it a 13 point lead Vives it low and knocks it through that clears the crossbar by what he sees he's got to have one of the strongest legs in the country he mentioned the 57 yarder he made earlier in his career against Roger Tech but I was watching him in warmups kicking him for 57 they were going halfway up look at this one look how high up in the yes crossbar this was way up in the net from 51 there's no wind in here they've closed this place in it's not of winning it anyway but it's far less of a factor that it used to be since they put this this group on talked about for the state's defense kind of blowing up there and getting the stop Miami gets the three so they're up thirteen but with a minute stick team to go in three timeouts see how the andre francois works to two minutes something that Jimbo Fisher takes a lot of pride in with his offense Knoll deferred so we get the ball to begin the second half and we've been here before have made character Knowles in a deficit trying to create a spark before halftime trying to create some momentum certainly happen in the comeback win and Orlando against Ole Miss actually pumped up after the field goal drives the ball out of the end zone the Allstate good hands play you got to go with the Miami defense saw this earlier tonight nice job of focusing on the football there by Johnson to make the fifth after the hit ball by quarterman and there's elder extending himself on a big third down and not letting Travis Rudolph get his hands on the ball elder also made the play chasing down cook to save a touchdown and the Canes got that big right after that a big play on special teams so number 29 is strong first half it's senior from Nashville today great high school basketball player could have played basketball I would venturous Jimbo Fisher be here they again at the end of that chain that trouble chain of the parcel and pepper he's got to be aggressive he's got three timeouts his quarterback has been put in this situation like I said he takes pride in this I think Travis Rudolph only has one catch either goes to a guy he's got to be able to make plays he's got to get separation here you gotta help your quarterback down and good protection Whitfield has been he weapon down the middle terrific catch Jenkins in there in Miami territory no reason to panic here the ball is already across midfield like I said Florida State they work really really hard on this throughout the year especially on Thursday during game week and they go good against good 28 yards the first day of Hawaii fairly good field his fifth catch tonight now Frank watch Jace gets away and even on a fast shoulder he's rumbling into the secondary slides down in size of 30 53 second a great job despite the injured shoulder recognizing the mantoman coverage underneath nobody there to account to the quarterback he has all that grass and he picks up significant yards for Florida State they've moved it 43 yards in two plays now it's my am be spending a defensive timeout here to regroup big would disappear Fisher's offense after a very lackluster first half and finally end zone watch the defense here watch how they're playing and watch out this area opens up for Francois he just kind of feels if he senses it right there you've got mantoman mantoman and nobody here to pick him up I want her to be I knew he'd recognize it but it would he be willing to go with the shoulder there's great instinct there to be able to take off pick up those guards and then slide and avoid the contact talk about how Jimbo Fisher prides himself on the twominute offense there was nothing better than when Jameis Winston was at Florida State watching them go up against the Marcus Joyner Melvin Smith on a Thursday practice we've got a couple of seats which forgets the whole time that I moved to change the lighting plate tonight they still have all three timeouts and showing some pressure points while trying to point out the Blitzers get on and he delivers almost that are set to the receiver over there fell down and fish on Jenkins almost had a pic as Travis Rudolph he was trying to get the ball to but great recognition of the Blitz offensive line does a good job of holding up despite that blitz and where he threw that football Travis Rudolph would have been cutting out thinking a cutting out of that break and would have been able to pick up another first down he's all good good one Tex tonight for 10 yards remember Dalvin cook also an option out in the backfield well what's inside and a screen pass Wilson trying to bounce three but it'll be dropped for a loss that play was stopped out early Trent Harris on the tackle and Pinckney one of those freshman linebackers is their future I cannot say enough about Shaq quarterman and Michael Pinckney to true freshman middle linebackers doing a heck of a job of using their eyes and letting those eyes take them to the football you call quarterman the Alpha Pinckney is kind of a focal little cocky guy he got the gag order this week Rick does enough buddy you and you'll pull it himself after four games today he's backed it up tonight so far they said he's got the big personality of the trio with a BMW halftime 2/4 and direct marketing and Mack Brown have you check it all the highlights there was a wild one the Aggies for the volunteers and double overtime but guys got battle from from Indiana today yeah he did ended up own 11 know this is the next week it was haunted by the way indeed situation history in the past four or five years you've had a Kelvin Benjamin a big wide receiver Rashad Greene somebody that could make a play who is that guy on this piece that can make those players nice well on her down with the crowd roaring the game's rush by francois delivers a strike 44 sound far sideline boku Wilson heck of a round we just said who's that guy Bobo Wilson is the guy right here look at him be able to take Hobart and push him well past the first Fowler because of the route he felt threatened downfield that's what created such a soft spot there where he was able to make that throw underneath and it gets out of bounds as well over the seniors kind of fight back up at the agreements a couple of games earlier this season looking seven seconds to timeout Rose nearing the red zone as Francois takes a huge shot delivers incomplete in the end zone flying in with Jenkins on the flip of a bus was slow getting up eight disguises it came very very late Jenkins is hidden right back here and it's a long way to come from for the senior and it cleaned up valving cook doesn't pick him up he was surprised by how far back Dickens cave what we have seen this young quarterback takes some vicious shots in the first five talking about a running start he ran like 20 yards to get there anyone seconds now a peacock could get creamed spend a timeout that was a good tackle by Jaquan Johnson who had to pick earlier because it looked like cook had a line to the end zone like that call when you have two timeouts it kept the defense off guard a little bit there they're anticipating they're going to throw the ball that is a great effort once again by Johnson who came up with the interception consen doesn't make that play he is walking into the end zone I get great call because there's not a huge risk there by Jimbo Fisher the reason is he has the two timeouts so we're seeing the grit once again of DeAndre Francois we've seen them in this situation before I think the difference between having to settle three are getting seven is obviously enormous and again they get the football to start the second half yeah that's a pivotal thing and I think it affects how Jimbo Fisher is looking to attack these guys at this point you've got the ball down in the 13 yard line on third down and you still have a timeout remaining 33 while from the pocket for the end zone is overthrown and Wilson was slamming into the wall no chance to make a play is for pound the ball is thrown late majoring Kolbert does a good job of forcing Bobo Wilson to the inside he wanted to try to run the route to the outside but that's what he's saying you're late you got to make that decision quicker and maybe even come off of Bobo Wilson and try to find somebody else so Ricky ayo he's 6 for 6 his young career inside of 40 but he missed 3 last week against Carolina from 45 52 and 20 of calls this week of support from it they grow to the allamerican Roberto was fun 31 and he does slide it through so a 62yard dr innate poise when a minute six Knowles on the board finally part of the Andre Francois has grown as a freshman are seeing things like this he wants to be able to try to run this route to the outside but a good job right here by Kolbert forcing him back inside and the reason I support is you have a safety over there to help him out but he runs out of real estate that decision needs to make he needs to be made quicker as you can see he's looking off to the left and then just comes back quickly and eppela really never had a chance Jimdo talking to him about that so this for the offensive line which was getting their quarterback hit a lot early since Francois has come back into the game with that right shoulder did a pretty good job keeping the Canes rush away from them for the most part yeah absolutely and they were blitzing it coming after me total yards in this first half 192 for the Seminole 191 for the Hurricanes Miami has been opportunistic the one interception by McGuire who came in and relieved and they were checking out front walk so that was huge after cook had set him up with a 54 yard run and now with 6 seconds full ramp time you figure that Brad cash is going to take a knee I am Vaughn performance whether Kane's in the first 30 minutes here at home everybody wondered Miamians beaten up on teams like Florida am and FAU I played Georgia Tech and really had not been tested the way they would be tested tonight and a lot of people were anxious to see how how they might respond in a rivalry game with such young players on both sides of the ball new head coach were they for real I was thirty minutes to go but I think they've done a nice job is sitting a pretty good message up 13 to 3 here in this half Kyah 14 of 21 the big play of course to Coley give it a touchdown on the replay reversal as we get the ball to start the second half but it's 13 3 Miami up 10 at the break Sam let's see quick info fishermen after these messages and welcome back to hard rock city an ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC and a presentation of the ACC on ESPN red guy and the Canes a 10point cushion at halftime trying to end a sixyear skid against their rivals but we've seen this before 23 7 lead here two years ago they had the lead late at Tallahassee Kirk last year couldn't finish either time so the big question among all these fans in orange tonight can they finish tonight are we going to see more Seminole resilience well I think that's what's interesting about this situation yet you have Miami saying hey guys new year new era with Mark Richt different different outcome and your Florida State and you can almost hear Jimbo Fisher saying guys do your job we're not out of this let's get back into this we're getting the ball to start this second half we're going to go down and score we're right back in this thing and it's a onepossession game so both coaches saying the right things and trying to push the right buttons a long way to go in this football game was still 30 minutes to go DeAndre francoise fighting through some severe shoulder pain that right throwing shoulder he was slammed down hard this game McGuire came in and spelled them through a crucial interception in the first half principal I got a whole bunch of treatment and is back out there hoping the Dalvin cook and spark the second half comeback he has got to be the most battletested quarterback so far in the country I don't think anybody's been hit as much as Francois Whitfield a flag comes an abuse knocked down at the 27 a couple of flags displayed a barely a month in his college career you're right he's taken enough punishment for an entire season during the return walk in the back number 85 I was receiving team 10yard penalty first down it's only the second penalty on the Seminoles are Pacific Life game summary the defensive first half is talked about getting driven down here just talk about Francois being big challenge it's a big turnover by Johnson got the ball back to Brad Kyah that's a heck of a play that they actually reviewed holy got his left foot down put it touchdown and I feeling good I was a great throw and a great catch by the veterans for the penalty on the return back Stan holds up to the 11 yard line that has been on its feet throughout this game tonight great energy with Miami defense to draw on back off it's a keeper for the quarterback well you got to grit your teeth play in pain and take a shot from big RJ McIntosh again the athletic ability along with the size is incredible it's a twist upfront you see them move right up here watch the quickness and ability to kind of catch that offensive line off guard back Norton did a good job of occupying the center Ellerbe and it made it easy for McIntosh to shoot that gap he's asked to breathe uh more noise law stands and delivers a shortfall Wilson picks up about three children read one on the tackle third down coming up Manny Diaz the new defensive coordinator the Mark Richt brought in has got to be very very proud of this defense and the effort that they're playing with he told us this week this is all about reestablishing and identity into you playing fast playing physical is about ever physicality that's exactly what we've seen from them in his horns that Alvin put back in the game into the wider front lawn for the sixth just again at the line is at four five times the canes have gotten a hand on the football they're just reading the eyes of Francois the linemen have had their success but this time it's the linebacker Pinkney watch 56 he's just kind of spying just sitting there and coverage that the great job of getting up you can see the open receiver behind him but times it up again perfectly to back up all when you think of a job Pinckney porterman of a father's reach through pressure they all came in early they came in missing on midseason to their senior high school year Houston prep but incredibly wellprepared Arthur their eyes have not disappointed amber left let them and wrong direction areas it very quickly and clamped out of the 40 Ford our flag comes in where the tackle was made Stephen Gabbard was there the first Knowles three and apt tonight by the way Kurt Gerron number sorry walk in the back number twenty one receiving team 10yard penalty first down Darren's Henley that penalty is going to oil field position Sam you guys are just talking about this Miami defense and how different they've looked out there tonight especially under Manny Diaz and that's what Mark Richt talking about raving in my halftime interview with him about how much as players are showing that they care obviously they care because it's a rivalry game but just full effort out there the kind of thing you want to see especially from a firstyear defensive coordinator here like Manny Diaz some bad news though on the other side for Florida State defense Nate Andrews out for the game officially with a right shoulder injury instead of a defense and great point on that Miami defense aims offense back to work is the first half handoff the year be one thing also stands report there you know I think one day Walter was an answer that's one thing that was most disappointing in the last five years of al golden if you talk to Miami Hurricane fans was the defense I mean that's what this program is many quarterbacks as they've had come through here in receivers the defense is the backbone of this program that's what they're trying to bring back and there's the freshman again Armand Richards on this land out near midfield you did make mistakes because they're young the Diaz is wanting to play tackle well the physical play hard absolutely his hop spin bike on the play action opens it up nicely pick up the tempo again throw outside and back to make the catch was Coley the flag Kiowa slam down and penalty Matthew Thomas got a helmet we're going to review whether he targeted the head while he's a defenseless player and the contact from Thomas was definitely up Heidi and we just have to see if it's the initial contact 6 Thomas against kaya where does he hit him first who it was right off the helmet of kya after he thrown the ball say and that's what the replay booth Jill Ryder is looking at right now in collaboration here's a greensboro dave how did you see this I see it as guitar yeah Herbie said he's defenseless that hit is up and it doesn't require the crown I think they're going to confirm this everybody I'm going to see it right there right there that's the initial hit from time this it's going to be a significant loss for Florida State Matthew Thomas when the leaders of this diss defense from Miami can imagine how fired up he is to play in this game after review the Sal for targeting is confirmed player number six yes we lose one of their better linebackers and the ball is moved 15 yards now in its side the FSU 35 don't forget he'll be out the next game for the first half and that is against North Carolina actually it's the it's the Canes they play North Carolina next yeah Thomas Wilson works for his teammates as he heads out straight ahead to the curry wanted Walton I don't love receive is when a guy picks me back on the tomahawk you see that rod attack the players get charged up emotionally and he's now I think he showed his true emotion I said Florida State playing North Carolina right yeah they play Wake Forest so he our first half of the next game and the pocket delivers : 23 and now just tackle at the 12 yard line by Lewis Tuesday the touchdown for the games threatening again this is a really well designed play here kya has time which the ball right there the tight in burned and took the linebacker to open it up again tempo to get down close they are trying to play as fast as possible which stress on that defense number three lining up in the neutral zone on the office five yards the second time they've got bad clothes in the red zone try to play with tempo and a wide receiver is committed to five European he was just lined up outside and he had plenty of time to get lined up there is a senior and a leader with his offense and then it just not only the 5yard penalty but the uptempo scheme you've got Florida State trying to get lined up right they're not even getting lined up when they're snapping the ball and then 5yard penalty and you slow down your momentum exactly look what a breather it gives it Eve has a chance to get reorganized here in 1st and 15 gaia flips that quickly in the flatness juggled and dropped by freshman richards the runpass option were there three receivers only two defenders he could run the ball or to pull it out and throw it he felt that he had to match up to the outside halftime the young freshman receiver richards just not able to hold on to it probably started getting his eyes up to look to see where he wanted to run before he secured the football Steve Charles Kelly the defensive coordinator from Florida State sits back or dialed up pressure and plays mantoman they've had more success tonight bringing pressure and playing man they don't bring pressure tires well protected takes an intro shot dangerous throw and it's intercepted McFadden came back and took it away for the freshman a huge play for that Knowles defense and a huge play individually for Tavares McFadden talked about in the first half he's been picked on at times this year he's made some mental errors a very gifted player great position gets his eyes turned around and is able to make that interception gains turnover chance to add to this lead the erase by McFadden his fourth pick of the season emptying the motivational bucket defensive coordinator Charles Kelly McFadden we made the pic want to be a coach it helps you have something he's been under the gun first four or five weeks putting everything into this game both McFadden by the way yes constable on the offense to build on that takeaway so navigating through traffic picks up five McFadden was the seminal who got flying for pass interference that set up that game winning 54 yard field goal by North Carolina so he felt awful about it at the end of that game though thank you played tonight is Eddie had a couple big plays tonight so now it's over the France why the Noles offense and if you haven't seen this game tonight the King don't feel threatened in the vertical passing games they are taking away the running game they're putting everything every effort to try to make Brant flaw in the passing game prove that they can beat this it's been palpable the Florida State offensive line all night Alvin cook and as Fisher spent the time out a 54 yard run saving tackle by Cornell during the first half the other 10 rushes he's been held in check though Saturday Night Football on ABC won't you buy chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich Jamis is quiet in a crowd here two years ago a furious rally and led by ham and Jalen Ramsay made a fictive preserve the victory over Miami I love the history shot in school never forget my first Miami Florida State game watching it it was 2000 in the Orange Bowl when Ken Dorsey hit Jeremy Shockey and the gamewinning touchdown remember that one I do house off you know long without the Hail Mary count son Goodyear tires for superior performance Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff all of the memories to go back to the old Orange Bowl yeah those battles in sideline and second is five after the timeout they flip it near side and Wilson fighting out near the 30 it'll be about a yard short of the first down good effort by Wilson Miami defense really lying to the ball keep in mind Miami has rotated from the very first first couple series a lot of bodies on that defensive line trying to stay fresh we'll see if it pays off for them if deeper into this second half into the fourth quarter on a hot humid night that could help them see more body front in and out out of this day there are maybe as they've really trusted his down includes plenty of young inexperienced players spec prints long and sneak here deliver that right shoulder loop I am gonna fall back in the game has took powers for a first down across the 30 we did see Dalvin cook get out on a big run for 54 yards where he had a break a tackle to do that but it's been other than that pretty quiet night big fella Gerald Willis the sophomore out of New Orleans is down there's to be in some pain laughter the Washington State Stanford game over on ESPN tonight Gucci and John Anderson for SportsCenter latest NFL news UFC 204 update to go with all your college football fix support center at night also on watch ESPN app and they help Willis to his feet this is an area of the team where the chains do have tremendous depth you just ten because of McFadden's interception of the end zone of the fourth row by Brad Gaia grunts Lankan engineer come back means will regret that last possession that last mistake first turnover tonight it's an area for cook who spins free and now he's brought down excellent job by Jamal Carter to Stacey to make the tackle this defense lost four starters from their secondary Adrian Kolber plays we've seen Jenkins around quite a few years Jamal Carter is kind of a hammer back there he did a nice job there you corn elder back there as well they lost all their linebackers playing three true freshmen but what they are trusting with tasty and not hesitant at all especially defending down the hook on the run going freshman off the edge on seven and seven may bring it cook picks it up and now Francois delivers on the far side we go tiptoes just enough for the first down out across the 40 and the Blitz came from Shaq orderman going to come from right here come around he's just a little bit late but Francois has a tendency to do this he waits into the last second to give his receiver a chance and that time Rudolph just settled down right where he needed to this soft spot in that zone off to the left there to pick up that first down gusty is that to wait that long knowing that your right shoulders already been hammered plan to campaign yep you fat in you fake if this cook and now front well finally we'll take a shot down feel it cook it wide open Delvin running free touchdown flag is down they may have rough Francois but Dalvin cook the hole guy strikes again against the Canes fifty nine yards Francois without his helmet is still sitting on the field da number 31 15yard penalty report from the community kickoff hostile viiiage action of ruff to the quarterback just a perfect time to call the play by Jimbo Fisher but I don't I don't know what the Miami defense was thinking here the ball is well both thrown and well after that the Beatrice Jackson is really almost a sandwich between the Miami defenders two guys hit him for what a call and there's the toughness again from Francois to hang in there makes the throw and gives Dalvin cook a chance to get down that sideline on that rail route nobody picked him up that was only got two touchdown receptions in his career both have come against the Canes and that was enormous hard to believe they forgot about number four and the shot when Francois afterword was ugly back in the 10th to be checked out again by the medical staffs as if y ou tries to cut the lead to three when you're aggressive with your linebackers it can catch up to you here they're trying to blitz the linebacker he's actually responsible for Dalvin cook in man coverage watch him right here he falls down now the cooks just going to go right down the sideline and because they're in man coverage nobody is there to pick him up the patients from France wada let the play develop giving cook time to be able to get down the sidelines but after he made that throw he got thrilled by Demetrius Jackson this is very late you right at the sandwich shot yeah Jackson from behind another defensive lineman helmets off that is way too late how many times have we seen Francois with that look look at that it's the second time that his helmets come off the other one wasn't flag but Norton knocked him down to the first half you're right though a days look in his face didn't even know they'd scored his opening night against Ole Miss he made a touchdown they had that touchdown pass before the half and God hit hard it wasn't late but he was hit hard he just he has been battle tested and hit from a lot of different angles in his first five games of his career Rafi a while is not the regular kickoff man for the Seminoles he goes to the penalty he'll kick it off from the 50 let's see if they try something a little bit tricky here usually it's Tyler moving the kickoffs deep the leg a ticking ping fly dropout is okay move it back five yards but again Aguayo not normally taking the kickoff spyler's got a huge leg booms I'm out of the end zone so you wonder a Fisher was thinking about a pooch kick or something unusual there well we put it up in the air and let your defense run underneath it or your coverage team run underneath he was checking the sidelines he was looking over there to see what they wanted to signal and now he will pooch it with pretty deep Barrios inside the five is still alive brought down at the 13 and it has been a punishing evening for DeAndre Francois the freshman again early in the entire game the offensive line has had a hard time keeping his deepest out of it they've listed the defensive line is one that looks like a cold it might be a late hit there by Kendrick Norman that was when he went out of the game he went into the test he's come back missed the last play the touchdown pass where he gets battered and again but he just keeps coming back goes in the 10th comes out one more time it's one way to impress your teammates when a quarterback gets hit and hit and hit and he just keeps coming back seven knockdown Ron's a very thoughtful conscientious guy not emotional for garius like Jamis will totally different personality time I meanwhile include a pic laughed on trying to get it to so far that tied in then it's off his hands that's why part of the Showtime program chronicling where season guy Dendi was dormant these are his gold on the ceiling of his room he wakes up every morning uses his cell phone flashlight to check out the gold for tire mom take care of his family academics very important and we've got a 3.2 GPA you saw some trophies over there on the left side well the second van of Gandalf senior be the short game it's going to be third long I thought what was cool was hint getting up so early to get ready for school in football that the room is dark and he said every morning to give him motivation while the room is dark he takes his cell phone with that light and he flashes it up to that ceiling and he looks at those goals just in case he wasn't feeling motivated he's a little bit tired he looks at those goals and it gets him out of bed and it gets him ready to go an old defend the chance to get the ball back to Francois daya facing third and eight no hands on the ground the holes they use it look against minor kinda confused the quarterback it worked last year effectively and there's an incompletion rushed three dropped eight but they still had an open receiver that was just a case in a quarterback and his receiver just not quite being on the same page look to me like Stacy Coley was actually running where he wanted to go underneath and I think Brett I was expecting him to just settle to the outside but he had he had an opportunity there for the first down but the miscommunication cost the Canes local component nie Quan Murray's a sophomore and is now back to receive this he'll make a fair catch if you feel it's an uneasy mood in this place all of a sudden yeah yeah the days were up ten in the front it was a party in here and been there done that kind of feeling yeah goes back to work down just three only so many our friend the bear Chris FeliCa migrated from the New York metropolitan area down in Coral Gables to go to school let's bring him out of hibernation for the Aflac trivia question tonight there thanks Chris obviously tonight Miami celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1991 championship game everyone remembers Jerry Thomas just that field goal in the 1716 wide right one but who scored the winning touchdown for Miami in that 1716 game they honored that Stephen has them but we're eating a sandwich we weren't we weren't paying attention to those I'm going to give it a guess Lamar Thomas if you cannot think about that thing it fit up to Whitfield and to get an effort over the defender I mr. Polly could give it to us let's answer that question a slight trivia question for you it was Larry Jones okay first Copelan the other wide receiver right a big fourth down conversion on that number 23 Larry Jon right this guy 1716 stolen play here tonight two boys a Gino Torretta over there in the far right securing as the year before he went and won the Heisman Trophy forced Copeland 88 right there for cook that's the back slides for a short game third down coming that's where the cage would score a touchdown and do a back flip that's the fit of the pistol this is the thing so happy from handle drill he'll take their helmets off now this crowd trying to get back in at speed up the slimyd pen not the same party atmosphere not input confidence the faithful here where the rolls have clawed back in this lock seems athletic the offensive linemen try to shoot the gaps the goals will have to type those foots down linebackers coming after as though in motion suicide and look from the I formation they faked a specific francois rolls out take a shot deliveries and it gets it made mavin Saunders the tight end is Prince why he was favoring that right shoulder and a gutsy call a gutsy call when you know that the defense is going to come after you he's going to drag across look at the pressure does a good job he gets hit again and a heck of the throw and a big time job big time catch there but this kind of beautiful shot there to feed Saunders go into the air to make that play ing athletic learning football but improved as a blocker he earned his playing time this year he completed not cook rice about it and not quite get the edge Jenkins did well to get out there Martel Jenkins did a good job of blowing that play up at the beginning and got into the backfield beat kareem armed force Dalvin cook bounced out to the outside hook because the so talented lucky to pick up some yards and now we see the freshman right there go down Landon dickerson bear and tear and his humid night and getting the show we'll take a break as a reminder Tuesday night on ESPN 10:00 Eastern the undefeated presents a conversation with the president works plays an achievement one hour for President Obama they campus the North Carolina a and Deimos device stanza retinol to and watch ESPN app though the Seminoles 133 get the third quarter touchdown and now on the move again died a 54 play in the third quarter second date misty backfield with protection dumped off the tight end is who stretches and fights it's sort of a first end for him and held on for dear life yeah he did and Roderick Johnson was assigned to try to make the block there in Portman who's had a big night again the true freshmen turn a good job in the middle of that defense but not a bad call there to give the Noles a chance here on now again another third down in short you got a lot tonight six for 12 Rangers quarter and bring some pressure it's picked up man and that is right distillery of ardent eight who fight throw force down here to 20 another third down completion great job against a mantoman you have great size here great length easy to throw to Tainted six five it's a matchup advantage there against red wine who's much smaller at six one where that is a great job of recognizing the match up there by Francois put the ball right over my way accident flipped over short Whitfield makes a man there and scoot into the Arizona Seminoles take the lead walk on the edge from Rudolf Kurt and we see that Florida State resilience again 60 yard drive seven plays in 334 and the Noles lead for the first time tonight the third quarter cut down consensus all the Andre Francois their own version of a run pass option this is a play that's designed to run here in fact you'll see the center getting downfield to make a block but what he sees is this a blitz from the safety Johnson because of that blitz he knows that he's got these three receivers against only two defenders he aborts the run gets it to the outside the Whitfield and there's the two blocked by his wide receivers again almost as a seasoned veteran DeAndre Francois reading the coverage recognizing the blitz from Johnson and to getting the ball out to the very fleetfooted Kermit by the permit though Whitfield has had a big night tonight that he's receiving a seven receptions 83 yards and that touchdown right there celebration of his birthday tonight with a touchdown and a 17 point run and the Canes are down for the first time this year only a couple of teams had not faced a deficit in 2016 about this guy Kirk eight straight completions and an incredible shelf toughest area still trying to keep that shoulder trying to keep it loose Derwin James coming over to show him his gratitude and appreciation kid just continues to grow up every single rep every single time he's out of that field now it's Brad guys turn to try to answer canes were rolling Dyer playing very well but the pic of the end zone by McFadden turned this thing around and now mark Rick's on the plays with his experienced quarterback he's making his 30th start tonight they got to find the rhythm back they got to get back to the uptempo attack that was working so well for them and rely on Brad Kyle's experience third year starting quarterback even though it's a new system and mixed up the formations the runs and the passes they had Florida State on their heels at times and they had success doing that that kind of that uptempo approach there's a bit more of a pass heavy attack than you expected like 28 passes to 16 running players for Miami they came in averaging 232 yards with 43 so far tonight got to give it to Walton the banging forward it's near the marker he'll be destroyed here be anvil in both in the first four games of the year kind of led the way set up their offense because of the threat of that running game now here they get back into that approach suck it in short wall first down driven out at the 40 both near the end wall and here comes apply so I had 15 more on a mental mistake by that nolde defense Herman Lane who's moved over from wide receiver very surprising to see him make a poor decision the Noles right now with all the momentum in the world he's way out of it defect but wasn't much 15 yards to push in the extension humourlessly to get that ball went on the opponent's bench living well it's the intent it's the effort even though it wasn't you could say that lunch it was he was already out of bounds and it was the fact he extended his arms and gave it a little bit of a hump when he did it that kind of catches the officials eyes every time now coffee that bruise moves the ball to the 45 just like that there cross midfield Boulton again gets around here Walton to clear quiet comes down as warrants to store the enzo stuarti tremendous effort to reach the end zone if they come back though even if it does it is a spectacular run a sophomore from here in Miami he will come back holding penalty the shame of it for Miami is it's the right tackle of Kyrie Saint Louis who really didn't have anything to do with the play he gets caught up with Derek naughty over here right there he locks up with him they do a great job of getting to the outside of Dante via stacks and a freshman linebacker the end of run is special oh it is 78 right there in the middle your screen had nothing to do with the play and your gives you an idea won't with it this is crazy he gets grabbed with the Jersey saw helmet touches the ground his hand goes down that's a shame if that counts that's one of the runs of the years you're Chris arrested pylons can give you its point of view is won't become scheming right toward you that is incredible balance to stay alive but instead of that it's burst in 20 we don't have to count that because of the penalty but we can we can mentally count that and appreciate that right you're being the spelling that was incredible you see the guy like touch his hand and the top of his head on the ground and sometimes stay alive never running was interesting approaches a murmur among the crowd here was Derek not he's checking out of the game but you know he's been dealing with an ankle they said he had a dominant camp they expected huge things from him like a Timmy Jernigan type a year but he's been nicked up tonight you can see what they're talking about he's healthier he's been very active and he is getting off a block and making his presence felt there in the interior that defense every guy's quite a decent man in this case it's the ankle feather look at him stalking here kind of walking around here on third and long they rushed three kiyah bill presser delivers a throw again but this is the second year in a row when the nose take that approach I just doesn't seem comfortable no and that's the whole point Charles Kelly said this week he's a rhythmic passer our jobs as a defense is to get him to be able to feel us we don't have to back him make him feel it's effective let's make him move off of his spot make it move a little to the left a little bit to the right they feel they can affect that rhythm and we've seen that now the last two series you just look a little bit out of sorts right now with his receivers the holding penalty on st. Louis takes the way to touchdown and now Bogle pumps it away and a fair catch is made back at the 11 this week's AP rankings brought to you by Goodyear the tide with a 19 point win at Arkansas Michigan 78 nothing somebody broadcast that game in Piscataway that's if you say I wanted to be there Chris Chris now we find out this Mark Richt era if it's going to be different it's one thing if you don't have the weapons they end up winning the game but you cannot sell this Fred selfdestruct you can't let interceptions and penalties in mistake cost you a football game that's what hurt them in the past five six years feels like they're going to have to tackle number four because they feed down them for an eightyard gain on first down they wanted to see how they'd handle adversity this is football team that hasn't trailed all year now they've got their chance they're trailing a rival 1713 with a minute to go in the third quarter how do you respond it's easy to be a frontrunner now you're being challenged we'll find out what they're made out of took over 100 yards again against contain 109 final minute of the quarter the retreat breaks grace flag down on this and honesty spins across the 30 in Alec Epperly one time we had him and we talked about he had a holding goes against Ole Miss if he's a WWE fan but he likes to get active with his hands holding maybe the wrestler in high school I don't know the different rules on the math in the field again you can't grab a guy and it's throwing to the ground he's in the middle the center went ahead and just sit on take that shoulder pad and nobody will ever see that RJ McIntosh they saw it all right that backs up the nose all of a sudden tendons are becoming a dominant theme really hurting both games five files room back at second and 12 bring those linebackers then bring in Pinckney and quarterman quite a bit tonight Wow protected delivers across the middle Katz made a huge hit deliver but holding on to the ball was Bobo Wilson I don't know what was more impressive the fact that Francois squeeze this into such a tight window or the catch by Bobo Wilson to be able to hold on to this knowing that was coming into it as a great job he knows right now that his safety is going to drill him when he makes that catch but the concentration before corn Eldar got to him heck of a job of executing there by Florida State on second long Francois and elder head to the sidelines continues his strong play 15 minutes to play the Noles Patrick seven straight win over the hurricane lead by four and welcome back to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC mr. presentation of the SEC on ESPN crossdivisional game between these two rivals is to Marcus Walker after all the turmoil and existing struggle that this team has been through the Florida State fans that's what I love to see right there the leadership from a defensive player coming out and it's time out to talk to those linemen to be a leader on this team look there's another one on the offensive in a tough run as we check in with Cassidy hover for studio update thanks Chris Taco Bell studio update a lot of pac12 after dark action Oregon State hosting Cal take a look at this run by Ryan all nipsey cut back and turns on the Jets the Beavers of 24 to 10 on the Golden Bears and so farm right there to report can play in the third Chris over you pick again we third down and short speaking of the packs Walker covers have Washington Huskies today I mean I know Oregon's struggling yeah God isn't purpler for real they really are meant when they really are last two weeks and what they did to Stanford last Friday night got everybody's attention I think people are anxious to see how they go on the road today at Autzen think it's a combination of really bad organ and very very good Washington we have a long time to keep them with us tonight again at certain store to eat too let's put up again the success on course down has been enormous the Knowles tonight to stay ahead of the count and this idea absolutely they've been in a lot of second medium third and short I think deandre France why I'm going to keep continue to go back to him because he has just been so impressive tonight in the third quarter alone Krissi's 10 of 11 now 144 yards in two touchdowns completed nine in a row that is despite going out of the game earlier with a shoulder injury that be a great night without use it here comes the flag it's Patrick to grab his facemask and will be another penalty on the Canes second boat from 95 whose mode news down this will move the ball you didn't close to midfield cloud spaceman defense number 95 15 yard penalty first down we've been talking about Francois and his toughness diet it's been tested been hitting a lot because a touchdown throw waiting to get the ball throwing the dalvik boat has a heck of a job there on third down to get the ball to tight in Saunders it's kind of in sync and rhythm and feeling very very good Jimbo Fisher together that's the glass touchdown to permit with you the bones of 42 nestor again fighting off the ropes routine zip down the nose now a chance to stretch the lead and really put some pressure on this miami offense this thing the Canes have some depth at the Benton line you notice when France wine is passing game takes all how it's all the set opened up better running length because those linebackers and safeties are concerned about that once there Kizuna Miami defense he has to dig deep as you said this is the first time they've been challenged but they've been romping rolling past people playing on the the backups have been in there by this day of the game that's the exciting part of this is to kind of see if this is going to be a different Miami team but they can't handle adversity kind of fight through it somebody step up and do the guy Francois keeps it they dumped it short Wilson gets a block cuts it back fights out of bounds near the marker at the 33 it'll be another third and very short here you have lineman downfield 6 Chris you have lineman downfield blocking but the good thing is he catches the ball behind the line of scrimmage so it doesn't matter that was the key the throw they're keeping him behind the line and not taking him down field here's a first down nice play of this ride rolling on the field is the first down the previous play is under review yeah but the spot was at an generous Oh check it out see where when Wilson got ooh back it will be third down and very short to get to the 32 tough to tell from this angle where you'd actually where the ball is and he goes out of bounds it definitely looks sure yeah there's no way that ball got towards a spot of it in his right arm just a matter if it's half a yard or a full yard short being extended there they tried to reach it back already shoved out Joe Ryder the replay official the folks in Greensboro who are collaborating with him at a busy night Miami's only touchdown really attached by Kohli correctly move a touchdown after a replay reversals Ricks you know headcoach sure but he's play caller twothirds he's got to check that chart and yeah see what he can count on see what he can go with Santiago's back out on the bill that's that's the thing is being a head coach slash offensive coordinator he has to keep his eye on what's happening with the replay but the other eye is looking at the Play chart and pick it okay we got to hold him to a field goal here we going to get a stop they get a sport touchdown and how did I get an impacted play call turns that he fends totally over ideas and let's Manny Diaz run that part of it maybe has fallen plays and being a head coach your plate is plenty full you need to trust this guy to run the defense it's such a change from where he's been for the last eight or nine years in Athens I mean he was more than he would to tell you he's more of a CEO he had a defensive coordinator an offensive coordinator and of course he was right in the middle of all of it but he was he was really just trying to help on both sides of the ball but he really trusted his staff took it a long time day if you look at this replay I mean it looked like Wilson was in the air trying to extend the ball toward the marker how do you see this one I really see it as short as you guys said in the after review the ball carrier went out of bounds at the 33 yard line short of the line the game will be third down and one to go the clock will start am I ready by the way how big will this be if they come up with a stop it could be it could be a really big third down it looked like dave like a half yard we are just depending on what they were able to look at there all right just what it is here is they couldn't find the ball so he took a little extra time makes your whole body by clearly not a first down he's cooked here you know we going to bring a couple of side ends over that pullback Stephens in the Merida block forum well salving cookies are gone I mean if the guys you like to turn to in the tough situation because of how physical he can be even if they give penetration he has an ability to run through tackles and because of the shoulder Francois he almost wonder if the sneak which they did a lot of earlier is even an option for Jimbo that you'd want to shot on that shoulder again so X is way for a first down and almost broken is holding on with red wine with an old dude with his dick watch the left guard 72 Kareem our he's going to follow him on the powerplay nice job at the right side of the offensive line collapsing down a very physical Keynes defensive line opens it up and picks up an easy first down get the toss again he's got blockers in front picks his way and now steps out of bounds but another terrific first down game is set up the series now 23 touches 21 rushes not quite the 222 that he had last year against Miami but there's still time and of course the big play of the 59yard touchdown when he was left alone remember those last two years he's had his big moment to the fourth quarter so it's still plenty of time the freshman 2 years of human flesh wagon delivered the gamewinning touchdown run my media fan holding you a fieldgoal attempt here cook have a heat hand offs and hesitation they're very short game but again third and very short the heck of a job by Gerald Willis who went out of the game with an injury it's back in the lineup now does a great job they're fighting through there with his quickness of getting penetration and because of that they held him short of the first down you need a little bit less than two yards for this one these teams are just plugging away as a physical test there's no mystery it's cooked but he doesn't get there this time they're shooting the gap with Gary and Owens the reserve linebacker its fourth down exactly right for his good eye Darion Owens does a nice job here nobody picks him up he doesn't hesitate he's going to shoot that gap for the backside to be able to negate this play and also how about the defensive line they're holding the point of attack they're not giving it an inch that is a big theories for the Miami defense it's hired as they say a bit on that 12 play drive his forces field goal that's a great point that was a folk play of the drive a digging and force of lions 32 yard field goal both take that though because it's still a one score game boy nice to see these two rivals forcing each other forcing each other to dig real deep Mike Cassidy thank you you'll go by Aguayo makes it a 20 to nothing run for Florida State became still within seven nine oh two to play here and this muggy night in Miami kaya and that offense can have to rediscover the rhythm the Mojo they had early in this game most defenses recovered nicely take a look at 18 see inside access when Thomas drilled kya and drew the targeting pen little led to his ejection keep a close eye on the quarterback took a shot in the face right there underneath him that is his tooth folks Sunday a dog with a right tackle recovers the fumble giving it back to the quarterback they just take it off it's a molar back there Kurt are you kidding I've never seen anything like that I appreciate the offensive lineman with his blogs his dirty gloves on reaching down there and picking that to stop might leave that one in the back till next week and it's Dennis content to uh we've had at least two dirty shots on the quarterback one for each side tonight I is going to have to get this going it's been a tough second half for the Canes often and especially kya throwing a football because when we say the teeth has gone out of the attack yeah good this is a goodness right there I didn't really have really have not had much bite she's going to keep going you know Mark Richt came into this game thinking hey we're going to be balanced and we're going to run the football which they've not been able to do 65 yards tonight running the ball so it's put a lot more on kiya and his group of receivers and second a guy delivers again excellent covered them they're all over the tie ends tonight that was firm and well covered by ha Skinner you know we talked all week about the Florida State defense their fans have been talking about what the heck's going on here think about nine point four yards per attempt as 127th in the country tonight only six point four three yard improvement they have done a great job tonight of mixing up the look getting pressure on kiya and playing more importantly with much more discipline in the back end and that's secondary Furman has one catch and jokes with the other tight end has three but no big plays at all from those guys those those are big weapons that is offense guy on third down delivery to Coley has been the key guy flux catch at the 45 in DB the freshman Taylor because he could have seen mantoman across the board here he'll proceed will come in from the outside look at the top all the mantoman coverage at the Cutty throw from a guy who's been three of nine in the second half at 17 yards in that third and eight goes down Walton forums for about two just got done dragging on Florida State defense there's a miscommunication Derrick Noddy jogging in they basically stopped that play with ten defenders on the field they only had three defensive linemen and they still held up for a short game for Miami Flint Barrios can't make detection now a couple of flights come in wife was in coverage but they may have flagged I hit on Barrios after the incompletion the batter could have been early on Marquess white there's a lot of contact defect number 27 call the foul it wasn't necessarily into it where you saw the ball try to get to Barrios it was a lot earlier when the ball was in the air he just kept jamming him 5 7 8 yards down field a lot of contact there and wasn't necessarily at the end of the play was earlier right when the ball initially got into the air long move to the null 47 is Walton we continue to tense the middle without much success Dante Venus Jackson the freshman linebacker on the top and an open Olsen Charles Kelly I said we're going to leave our corners on an island we're not intimidated we're not afraid of that vertical passing game even though you've hit a couple they put everybody at the line of scrimmage based on the formation and the downand distance they read the tendencies they assumed run and they guessed right for the loss and retire had that big fourth quarter last year throwing the ball second and 11 in the pocket he throught that was Derek naughty new Gotham it will be third in very long not he gets him but an assist go through the Marco Walker who forces him to step up in the pocket washing the top40 force forces him to step up not he just dominates the inside we just got done talking about what a force he's been now that he's healthy and Linder just did not have a chance against a quickness and power you see in the right there on dogwood the tackle got rolled up on his knee that did not look good let's take a break Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by AT&amp;T mobilizing your world and for we go further so you can I was trying to make it seven in a row over Miami would equal their longest streak in the series aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear no matter what route your vehicle runs choose Goodyear for superior performance Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff after the fact its third and 17 for Miami the new member here maybe just one more chance to get back into this think I have stepped up stack on backtoback plays that was just sweat the linebacker finger John sweat when he was questionable for the Louisville game you take him out of this pass rush it's a significant loss choke healthy get fired up and I don't blame him here he is right here just using his speed does a good job of getting around and you can see it's not quite 100% but still quick enough to get around Trevor darling there only two sacks allowed by Miami and those four means the win but three tonight those guys in orange out front getting whipped lately and Vogel's punters fair spot at the 15 yard line by Wilson so 548 to play and a toll sitting on the sevenpoint lead quarterback comparison is the Pacific Life game summary disaster are pretty similar but that one interception in kaya's column there that take by McFadden in the end zone really turned things around I agree but I think that's the case where the stats don't really tell the story right DeAndre Francois has played a great football game tonight beyond the stats getting hit the entire night and just he hasn't flinch he gets continues to come back but I wouldn't see here is Jimbo Fisher that sevenpoint lead how does he attack this Miami defense because the cave keep it needs to make a play to get their offense a short field after tackle hook and they do behind the lawn quick penetration by Michael Pinkney the linebacker I can't spam it we've seen a lot of great young players tonight we've talked so much about Francois but Michael pink thee and chat quarterman Joe Jackson on the defensive line there's some true freshmen out there that were playing high school football last year and tonight during the Miami Florida State game and they're making plays and playing with boys we bring filed against Francois who throws incomplete off the hands of Saunders it'll be third and 13 I think as much as Jimbo Fisher trusts his young quarterback because of what he'd seen from him in the first six games this year still has to be smart 5:08 defense has been playing very well against Kyle we've got to be smart here and not put him in a position where he could potentially make a mistake in cost you in Miami desperately needs a break they desperately needed to give taya great field position first comment alongside Griffin lawyers is back for France whopping Ibaka delivers in the traffic incomplete and a flag comes in very late Carter and Jenkins converged on Whitfield it wasn't interference was it a personal foul you got to think it's going to be targeting potentially defenseless player I just want to see where the contact was if they've to tie up here to help us personal foul targeting yeah for everybody at holohan course you can review this it can be looked at Dave once you hop in and help us with that rule this year every targeting penalty is reviewed regardless of what so you have it here he hits them in a chest to me with it is we need to pay another look and look at the primary thought that goes into the chest area let's see live I thought he hit him in the chest take a look at it right here Carter they fly coming in but Fields helmet does snapback isn't I think it's a reaction because you hit in the chest on the shoulder pad just the edge of the helm yeah that was a much better look that's what it was called that's really close and I'm not sure they can change this call let's see that contact well that is a that's right at the gray area exactly right depending on who's in the booth looking at if we're the gray area it's going to stand yeah it's really close yeah I agree that it hit on the left shoulder his head did snap back the flag came from very deep they don't call that it's 4 and 13 from the 12 this is an enormous you could argue by Joe Rider you could almost feel Carter trying to intentionally go low keep in my current width field is 5/8 and he was kind of scrunched down getting ready to engage in contact it just felt the Carter was trying to get his low as he could but when you look at those different angles and to the first end anyway whether whether whether the targeting is taken away until a personal foul it's a personal foul if they call it for a lady of the receiver but if it's only targeting and they take the targeting way the foul goes away as well did he cook did he call personal foul with targeting that's not what he said so we'll have to see he said personal foul targeting retard any think that's all it was yeah please talk about a huge call after Revere ruling on the field stands JOHN CARTER is out but more importantly for the flow of this game the Knowles after a fourth or a third and 13 but first down a fresh set of downs with 501 to play and not to mention Mark Richt now loses is debris coming down now Mark Richt now loses one of his leaders in that secondary they're going to have to hold up the game you're right sir Rhea Pillai he went to the end zone and out of the upper decks this is the stage of the old Orange Bowl crowds which we'd get frequently out of hand this is going to be a lengthy delay now and in Miami players are really frustrated with their fans I mean there is debris everywhere Jimbo Fisher just said why is that was that not 15 yards he's going to talk to the head and head official and ask him if that should be a 15yard penalty there is debris in the entire field at that end is littered with debris Rick who's out there was this will fissile take some time and again because Carter walked off this crowd may not like to call but the judgment he made to go after the receiver the ball was not he's not going to be caught really in my feeling as I said it was in that gray area and it's in the gray area you're going to have to go with the call in the field you know I at the end of the day you can get here in Miami fans you're going to say he hit him low and in the the contact sent him up into the face mask but if here for a fan you can say look at his head he's obviously hit him in the helmet or in the facemask there so it is it's a gray area call and you have to stay with the call in the field all has been moved to the 27 yard line they want to find a look at it are you going to see it here he's clearly defenses right now he's defensive but it goes down all right and they're the shot you can't really see that here's another angle coming in here now let's see if we can see any contact clearly below right there you can you can't see a definition it's a gray area you got to stick with a call yeah there's really not enough there to definitively say he definitely hit him in the shoulder or hit him beneath the headgear I bet had that not been called targeting on the field you don't believe the booth would have intervened to call targeting as they can not on this one I don't think no Miami did everything they needed to to get to stop now they're going to crank it back up again after that penalty they breathe delay and sois is grabbed high and wrestled down for a loss by that time first time we call chat Thomas's name tonight does a great job of getting around because of his quickness keep in mind 265 pounds the left guard Kareem our who came around he was surprised he came around and boy number nine went right around him with that quickness reading that place as well as he did another good readers good stop on first and ten but again they're heavy traffic battles hard to get back to the initial line of scrimmage quarterman and Thomas combining that's on that play call from Jimbo Fisher keep in mind the confidence that he has to have maybe for the first time this year in his defense in a way they play here this second half I think it's impacting on how he's balling this right now especially deep in his own territory it's going to be that you throw the ball here yeah I think you get Francoise chance you gotta trust in but if it's not there you throw away check it down to cook record those up the back foot and aspires it into the pan Schiff is Thomas again making his presence felt and its fourth down Miami's defense makes the stand despite the targeting penalty and now an OLE is on the field there and that's kareem are they less guard again we've seen that the big boys on both sides in the trenches feeling the wear and tear but yeah on a shame by the way Chad Thomas I was wondering if he got outside of the tackle box after consulting you're right they could they call with an intentional grounding which I move it back and still four down again court for the fans when you throw it away you've got to get outside of the tackle box and he's looked if he does he get outside it's kind of the area that he's in inside that pocket he's inside the pocket and now he throws it up here there's nobody up there the receivers cutting to the inside there's nobody out there but if he doesn't get outside of that tackle box where you can throw it away welcome to goes beyond the line of scrimmage it looks like brass China Kirk is going to get the ball back three 32 to play Miami has all three timeouts desperate to snap this losing streak against the Noles and a potentially career defining moment for kaya if you can lead to come back Monday night Buccaneers and the Panthers and obscene south pole Asian coverage begins at 6:00 with Monday night countdown and then the ball game at 8:15 also streaming live on watch ESPN app still down on the field the stream our guard for the Seminoles is to see a whole lot that is of concern during the plate Kirk but he went down to the field and just now finally people to walk off a long game those offensive lineman what I love is are surrounded by the other four starting line they all walk off within as a group very cool there's Logan Tyler mindful of the fact that the Canes again have blocks to punt this year and Braxton Barrios the speedy returner hands to give kaya excellent field positions which could be a gametying drive they come after it here go to put the return up great field position of the return gets away at higdon Barrios no fair catch cuts it back braxton burial FSU territory and cut down inside the 20 finally a special teams play as Barrios decreased and accelerated the touchdown is saved at the end great job here watched the freshman Richards he does not block in the back he kind of pulled back they set up a wall to the left in which he just set those blocks up perfectly I was affected Logan Tyler the punter got a hand out there and saved the cut center that was the only thing 43 yard return in a very low punt was that helped set up that return and now here comes Brad Piatt with a chance to possibly tie the game for Miami remember it's been a we're off second half for Pyle look at the numbers in the first half first what he's done here in the second half but great field position on the 16 is Walton but sit back not down hard after about a five yard game is it Doren leading the way there talks sometimes to get wide against the speed and athletic ability from this Florida State defense you can see sweat coming in as well to clean that play up but a good gain of four no rushing touchdowns for Miami tonight Boulton again barrows forward will be knocked down soon yards short of the first down by pew they're down where you got to love this mark rich first year head coach school that he played back from being so successful at Georgia and the SCT punch time in his first Miami Florida State game to the head coach of the game but it's coming down to there what nothing stop right there by the Marcus Walker came around the edge interesting call your son's going to take over when the games on a line and that's what just happened with the Marco Walker and Derrick Nani completely not fearing the quarterback run at all they were completely locked in on the running back kind that time Mark Walton the other time he wasn't winning Popples a shotgun snap fourth and five here comes last gas perhaps for the team hyah pour the enzyme parlay a fourth down first down and Michael Bagley was made seventy two consecutive P 80s must deliver one more to tie the game with a minute 38 to play with a stroke by kya on fourth down his block it's so good no block to PhD and badly streak ends at seventy two in a row is that to Marcus Walker young mate the block is a couple of flags down let's check the markers but the Canes are walking off after the plague we had did for sports Malloy conduct as on both teams 98 of Florida State and 63 of Miami that is both of their first personal icons gonna game we will have a kick from the 35 yard line nobody has been more automatic making PhDs in college football than Michael back want to hold a little bit maybe affects the rhythm there but no question dr. Marcus Walker gets his hand on it and knocks that ball away talking about one of the best kickers in the country how about the leader Walker making plays down the stretch penetrates right there puts the hand up and knocks that away unbelievable and just when it looked like Miami with the throw there on fourth down was going to tie this football game he's talking about Wesley larvicides less per hunch great coverage by the way by McFadden I mean he had stride for stride the only thing he doesn't do is locate the ball there at the end perfect throw by kaya always he and Koli did seem to always be in sync that is a gutsy play to potentially time to King human they missed the extra point and DeMarcus Walker Mambo mode he calls it when he's playing well what an enormous play I guess if you're an old fan you figure you're overdue but to make a play in the kicking game in this series with all those field goals that have flown wide right now if you're if you're Rick dude you try an onside kick you kick it deep and use your three timeouts here taking a look at this this under review we're told they have any idea with what they might be looking at on this I don't know unless you're looking for numbers of players on the field I'm not sure what they're looking at the play was clearly blocked it's certainly too late to review the touchdown but that was clearly a touchdown possibly numbers of players on the field and I'm not certain depth awake see if Daniel is the door there number 63 from Miami it takes the helmet off and slams it down oh gosh you're 15 so they had they're already offsetting penalty as they said and the normal kickoff from the 35 maybe that's when they didn't spot initially right I mean if the only something quite on the mound the offsetting penalties didn't affect where they'll be kicking the ball off no still have all three timeouts a minute 38 got to believe it's the onside kick coming up depending on what's going on here with the officials suck about a turn of events here barriers is dramatic punt return setting F Caillou needed a fourth down completion Nicoli and then the inconceivable from the Miami point of view actually automatic automatic and PA sees yes I'm being told there they're reviewing whether or not people came off the sidelines but they certainly did off the floor to stateside separated about that half the teams out there and a bunch of coaches like everybody's been shocked but we had offsetting unsportsmanlike calls yeah Revere sports electronical Florida State is on number 89 89 we have to review this I guess because if you get to you're kicked out of the game days exactly then we knew there was a foul on each team they've given it to the Noles 89 that's why it's so important what Keith gave and back up wide receiver would you kick a deep I'm right I'd kicked the onside kick it and trust that the defense can get a stop on three straight plays and take a chance on the onside kick your ass kind of a funky formation join D with Knowles expected on side games states back to his two yard line and the Canes get down there cover it very well so the Knowles have to operate from inside their 15 a minute 33 Miami with all three timeouts the logic here from Mark Richt and his staff is let's kick it deep more than likely Kimbo Fisher is going to run the ball three times we have three timeouts you get three stops and three timeouts you forced a punt on fourth down and you're out of timeouts but you get the ball back with maybe about a minute to go but you got it obviously you can't give four to state a first down cook takes the sauce you get nothing met immediately right there by Michael Pinkney's and they do spend the time out before wrapup show follows the game with Cassidy Hubbert we'll be talking about a Miami comeback or a 7th straight win the Seminoles in this series I mean these seems a battle suit the nail over the years has been so many big plays in so much emotion so many hard hits you've got all that tonight and so often it's come down to a kicker more often than not missing all those names of the Florida State close calls the heart breaks the wide right what's the name for this one with the block party DeMarcus Walker oh here he and Derek naughty both when the game's on the line those guys started to make plays late in the game it was just it was a full rush block wasn't he was got up the handle got a hand up yes all right same thing for the state's taking the skid to one first down and it came to thinking we got to stop them again and you got second timeout interesting play action all kinds of room for Francois who doesn't really want to get out of bounds falls down at the first down that is all Jimbo Fisher great call everybody expecting run everybody thinking let's stop three straight runs use the timeouts get the ball back but instead they boot run into the outside keep it in bounds pick up the first down and now you work the clock Rick not calling the timeout here so they don't have to snap it till about 40 seconds they're going to elect to hold on to these timeouts so half to this first down was a gutsy call and a great call by Jimbo Fisher while snap at about five seconds before he had to cook around the edge may not matter Delvin cook another first down at the 35 yard line and now Miami is going to have to spend the time out here you know Sunday morning tomorrow ten o'clock Eastern over on ESPN NFL insider Sunday edition as all the news fantasy update that 11 o'clock the news on the NFL countdown takes to rate up to kickoff post shows also streaming live on watch ESPN app what a crazy final chapter of this from of the Seminoles runs down 13 nothing it was a 22 nothing Ron Kyah and the chains off and fists on nothing but Ferriero sets him up with a 43yard punt returned on fourth down completion to Coley for a touchdown blocked PAP to Marcus Walker it says a lot about the Florida State resiliency everything that they have been through this year some tough losses most recently last week on a lastsecond field goal at home against North Carolina and get down early in this game and they just keep plugging away keep plugging away and that young quarterback just kept making plays if he could get making plays final timeout for Miami right at 40 seconds that they lose on the kick of the life by by Nick Walker ochio on a 54 yarder and you win on a block BAC something that has been absolutely automatic for Badgley tonight street cred brush you by Allstate dad something we've been doing all we all year with Allstate hashtag street cred on Twitter kinda looking for the team of the week and some great choices to quitting this game tonight but we're going to go with Navy with the big upset over number six Houston if you know forty six to forty and week or so actually picked that so congratulations to the sunshine scooter for the the pic and also for his nose maybe finding a way to win here and shut up Anjali there and the final kneel down by France was could it be a third lock by a total of ten points in the last three years and they had had leads in the second half of all of them and this Florida State team is going to improve the for into they get their first conference win Keith Flynn hopes to live for the division title they got a beat comes in a couple of weeks at home hope the Tigers lose another game hope Louisville loses the game but for now forget all that it's Francois and a testament to toughness pitcher still perfect against Miami the Marcus Walker expects him to rush the passer to tackle the ball carrier but comes up that make high reach in a block PHP to preserve the victory no questions for a 150 yards and back to Sam good jibba pitcher you just said wow how would you describe what you just experienced Florida State Miami that's what it is always been that way always a little better like they got a great ballclub our kids spot scratched and clawed and played a great ballgame we had mistake for that support estate Miami game a great competition and heck of a game speaking of competitors the guys standing right next to you right now your quarterback as a freshman to get banged up the way he did take the shots he did what can you say about his performance tonight especially in the second I'm very proud of him I'm a devastated when your quarterback knocked off your team's nuts up and your quarterback stuff we got a tough tape leads them the right way he's doing the right thing and he's growing I'm very proud of him tonight last thing for you before I talked to DeAndre coach there was so much conversation about your defense and what was going wrong and should you make a change and all that kind of discussion what can you say about what your defense did tonight girls Kelly in a defensive one heck of a job our kids battle scratched and clawed even when they tied it up didn't quit we got what you got a block p80 I'm asked two weeks in a row they've done that in that situation so there's a lot of we got things to fix there's no doubt but our kids love us they believe in what's going on and we're going to get better thanks coach we'll talk to QB now DeAndre get a little love from his coach not a lot of love from Miami tonight they were all over the place defensively obviously you're dealing with a shoulder injury how would you describe first of all the pan that you were in especially after you went down that first time yeah I was hurting a little bit but I think needed me oh the trainer's got me right in I came back on the field played a good game how do you do that just mentally I mean I saw you trying to keep your shoulder moving at all times just from the perspective of a guy who's new to this at this level how do you do that yeah I got titled me a couple of times but I think I telling myself mentally y'all you know keep going keep playing don't worry about the injury if I was taking about my injury I want to be able to play so I just blocked the injury our focus on my game and my mind you know take over my body what stands out to you most about the way the guys around you helped you out tonight just kept fighting and kept on stopping that make it big play the big moments you know we stuck together in a family and we've been through this before you know we came in the game down early and we fall back like we did tonight but not as a starting quarterback against Miami so what's it feel like it's gotta be I know you're hurting but I've got to be a little bit fun right yes why I'm not really happy go get a Levine thanks DeAndre Sam thank you great job eleven of 1352 yards and two touchdowns in the second half he also ran for five first downs as they'll take a piece of the side here put it back in the SOB Cemetery in Tallahassee Fisher Kirk mentioned the defense the hell became to 276 total yards tonight just an incredible game and I thought he what he said to Sam was perfect this is course day Miami and it's kind of what you hope for is a competitive game as Dalvin cook it's his third win over the Miami Hurricanes in the town that he grew up in decided to go play college ball up in Tallahassee he's fired up and it was but it was great it was back and forth Miami came out kind of showed that this is a new era with Mark Richt and then gives DeAndre Francois this Noel's team a much battered Florida State team a lot of credit for the way they persevered and fought back a couple things really turned this game Miami was rolling tiya through a pick in the end zone this bad throw McFadden who's been an embattled player in that secondary for the Noles he made the pick to turn things around and then there was the targeting call on Jamaal Carter the safety for the Hurricanes on a third and long play if he doesn't target if that call isn't made and upheld by the booth Gaines gets the ball back who knows how would have gone from there but that is another play that loom large in the final yeah I think there are a few plays it kind of went back and forth if we went back and and looked at this and watched it you could say boy how about that one and how about that one yeah they would it was definitely one of those kind of games but of course the extra point at the end Miami did everything in their power offensively to finally get good field position after the big punt return Coley on fourth down the touchdown and we're just you just kind of assume it's going to be a tied game and headed to overtime and then Walker comes up with a big block p80 and that's what you have to do rivalry games Miami loses for the first time down to the 11 undefeated teams is here's your top for the Huskies have moved up into the four position after a big win in Autzen Stadium yeah Alabama at Ohio State it wanted to Jenna this is something that can change weekly Clemson a solid three and if four I mean you've got teams like Louisville you despite their one loss so you've got Michigan out there I decided to move Washington up there to four because of what they've done now in the last two weeks and they just continue to play dominating football and I think they deserve to be up in the top four right now what's cool is Ohio State's at Wisconsin next week we'll have that game for you Alabama's got that date with undefeated am coming up at home and Clemson's had to go to Tallahassee on the 29th of October so big test for those top three and absolutely in Washington has a few sneaky games on the road they've got a good Estill to Salt Lake and go
