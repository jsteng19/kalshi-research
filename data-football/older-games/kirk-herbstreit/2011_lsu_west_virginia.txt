============================================================

sound the musket Smith the Mountaineers are fired up LSU's the number two team of the land is invading West Virginia touch that block of coal for good luck we're gonna need it Russell Shepard returns for LSU and other Tigers concerned about a night game in West Virginia have you ever been to Baton Rouge on a Saturday night game on welcome to Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines you are looking live at a soldout Mountaineer field Morgantown West Virginia and Baton Rouge Louisiana or arguably the two toughest night game environments in the country and tonight LSU travels from the bayou country into the teeth of the gold rush this is a perfect Saturday night in September for a college football game 62 degrees not a lot of humidity around calm not a lot of wind Les Miles is ready with LSU so let's go down to Erin Andrews with a coach Erin Brent thanks so much coach you said this week your team really enjoyed playing on the road this season why do you have so much confidence in hospital environment like we bond we've identified how we play on the road already you're just young season so you have an environment like this everybody just jacked up our guys before the flames you had success against forehead and Mississippi and what's the key to by cooking it was a different challenge with different defense really explosive offense oh but those were to be the same boss because the same attention in his website Tigers will be by frequency Thank You Aaron and its first year Dana Holgorsen man being able to move the football as an offensive coordinator at Texas Tech Houston Oklahoma State now he's in charge of the whole show and this is the biggest burrito that he has stepped into since becoming head coach in June under way and Austin will take it from the tree to the my fears alley and a fine return out to the 29 where it will be first and ten and this will give us an opportunity to take a look at the junior from Miramar high school down Miami way Gino Smith amazing to think to three games into learning this new offense over a thousand yards passing already and you know he's got a strong arm quick feet as I said earlier tonight Brett I think it's really about being able to read this defense and getting the football out of his hands as quickly as possible against the athletic ability of the LSU defense freshman Bernard Roberts will start as a running back Andrew boy is injured and we're not sure that we're going to see him at all here tonight the coaches were not confident so young Roberts out of the Washington DC area is just behind the quarterback on first down there is a quick lowly commit one of his teammates Stedman Bailey from also from Miramar high school LLC on the very first play testing the mindset of West Virginia brought a corner blitz the mokele a worn they recognized it a quick sided just good quick release by Geno Smith receiver protects the football and it's the first down for the Mountaineers to the four wide receivers lined up here though Smith keeping it in the air and complete now one of the things Coach miles told us is that in three games West Virginia has thrown 30 screen passers that's if that's a lot that's obviously an average of 10 a game but basically that's their running play when they go to the screen game absolutely branded it's also very effective in trying to slow down a big athletic defensive line and that's something that Dana believes and in that in the running game and what should we talk about these guys throwing the football they do run the football and throw screens to try to keep the pieces behind and linebackers on it here is her every one of those running plays right into the teeth of that outstanding defensive front now you can see a little pushing and shoving and they're confident early flying a couple of become flying and we'll stay with it because this this proved from the SEC wants to clamp down early not let anything get out of control motions are going to be very high for this game it was going back and forth but Joan had said the senator from West Virginia losing his pool there and I don't that's when he made a pretty heavy push there that's when the flag came out but we'll see if it ends up going to both teams could be offsetting 10 waiters is the referee here tonight Rick colloseum dead ball personal foul 74 on the offense penalty 15 yards just when you saw her he lost his cool the center yeah he's upset with his center not the official hit the official but this is going back and forth but right there and that's when the officials were already trying to separate it and right in front of two or three different officials and to think they were fitting it you know third and 839 now they go way back and now you just don't want to make a silly mistake on third and law probably a screen here to one of the receivers Benny Logan was the defensive lineman who was tied up with Matson on that third and twentytwo purse with an amount beers under pressure stepped it off underneath to Austin and out of bounds at the 45 yard line is Tavon Austin the junior from Baltimore's Dunbar High School and after a miscue like that you get the ball back to about your 44 and you put the ball in the hands of Cory Smith in the punter to try to give you a piece of field position as a defense as they get ready to take the field here for the first time West Virginia has got to be able to maintain their cool with the emotions and plan this kind of game LSU's used to this environment West Virginia's got to show some poise your guy Matthew is back deep now and Cory Smith is the punter and he's trying to keep it away from him sort of shanks it out of bounds that has been a problem for them all year dead last 120 is in net funny that 26 yards in that pun and this one's a good helpers every where you come back LSU's ball for the first time after a 14 yard punt well nothing flashy Harvey about LSU quarter by Jeremy three touchdowns but only one interception that's critical with him and he kept coming off the game where he's 21 X 27 against Mississippi State from where Oh Spencer where and Michael Ford will alternate and let's talk about number 10 Russell Shepherd who's making his season debut he was under an NCAA suspension and coach miles teller is they are going to move him all around the field they don't want to put him in a wildcat here deny everything they want to get him a lot of different looks I'm not going to go easy with that could eat him back in as you said they'll move him around and right now he is at this plot right at the top of your screen right up here second date they look at his collection to go to the outside the end battle to the bull and it falls incomplete LSU is lucky that candy did not intercept that ball he was juggling it when Danny had a shot at it watch Darwyn Cooke astley after that ball and juggle I care I thought what might be able to hold on to the football but nonetheless the ball is dropping brings up a big third down here early in this game we talked all week about how important it is when you're at home you're not your dog because of number two you got to come out early I try to get yourself to believe right now let's keep it to try to do that need 8 yards on this third down has time wideopen Randall Reuben Randle moves the chains and LSU moves into West Virginia territory and a big mistake rent by Pat mill in the corner watch him on the left he doesn't even reroute the receiver Reuben Randle doesn't get a hand on him it makes it so easy watch Rueben Randle we just kind of sit back sits in the hole makes it it easy froufrou for the quarterback Jaron Lane has a mistake there by Pat Miller the corner there on the third down and on that third down they pick up 16 for Garrett Lee come back with the power either going to throw off the play action going to go deep far side double coverage Oliver and it is incomplete throwing it out of bounds Shepard the intended target and again they're going to trying to move around he gives you the vertical threat and that's something that's different with this year's LSU offense the more comfortable jared lee gets the more you're seeing them willing to take some chances it's a big traffic tonight West Virginia's going to crowd the line last week against Mississippi State on first insanelooking a terribly 10 for 10 on first and 10 passing last week against Mississippi State the defense's crowd the line to stop this physical running game Lee's got to be able to make them pay for it one on one homeless come back with the money it was bent to where does great one of the Mountaineer linebackers making this down this is sort of an unorthodox defense or aviod you know I've talked about it three three five but as you said a lot of those safeties kind of move up into the gaps it is it three three five essentially really an eightman front they walk a lot of people up to the line of scrimmage and if you're playing LF you watch apparently isn't free your Department has stopped their running game and make them show you that Karen Lee and his receivers can execute the passing game for four quarters without making the same a dozen yards they converted 1/3 down that's the last did he take it past the play clock then lay in the crowded game take effect on the other side of the 45 yard line the one of the advantage here the Jets conceal the defense coordinator from West Virginia has been playing this different look but at 3:35 his disguising look trying to be creative with where's the pressure coming from there last year they had 45 sacks this year they only have one Bruce eleven is the guy to watch when they try to apply questions Jeff Jeff steel the defensive coordinator all the defensive signal for the sidelines and he's got a man wide open it goes deep another huge throw on third and that is Odell Beckham jr. he is the talented speech there in a coming out of his Oregon and exactly the same guy look at the quarterback Pat Miller wheezing to the inside allowing Beckham again to just get off with a three relief there isn't a safety behind him to help to cover up Pat Miller twice now on third down they go right after him right behind him in zone coverage and Jarrett Lee finding it both time for first down 29 more yard to leave with two completions both huge on this Drive those converted sir I mean backward we're we're in the hole to about the 11 yard line as you look down at the Mountaineer defense and taught me to Jeff conceal he he told us that he lost a lot of fellows who wound up at training camp in the NFL he was a halfdozen off this defense and a lot of right in the middle of that defensive line Jeff has told us that one of the things when you lose six or seven guys to NFL camp it's going to take a while to get back to where they were a year ago where they're very athletic very physical they're getting there but they're going to have to splat and move and growl the line to try to get offset that power running in prince aware that also Leigha firing for the inzone and he's got it for a touchdown Rueben Randle who converted one of the two third downs he grabs the touchdown pass pay something pure Utley it's settling in really become a strength in this LSU offense we had in the opening week he was all to talk about Jordan Jefferson what were they going to do and Jordan Jefferson's that great Blair does all right the Jarrett and the additions becoming his football team and they are becoming a balanced often huge opening drive to the Tigers through a LeMat tacks on the extra point the Tigers strike first that will quiet the crowd as curently fires the Rueben Randle nobody liked it any better than less mild now Ford is in as the running back short drop empirically Herbie's impressive he snapped that one off again to Randall he's kind of getting into a rhythm here of his own like I said if you think that LSU is just about running the ball and running the ball and then on third down and three just throw the football and try to get just enough power first down this offenses involving coach Scott the offensive coordinator calling plays this year for the tiger is the first one to tell you listen we're going to be physical we're going to run downhill right at you but if you're over commit to the line of scrimmage we've got confidence in Garrett Lee and our grouper receivers that we're going to go behind him and secondly three Ford stays in the game didn't hook up that job would be a wide receiver back on the freshman long from there I could check there at the scrimmage by terribly and mini five coats God will give him a run has checked at the line of scrimmage we wanted to go too fast and I think back on that time after hearing the Ralph would point out he should have brought his his alignment closer towards the ball to give the quarterback a better chance to making that bro that one story ride Jarrett Lee hits too big third that he's two or three for the night will they come again they're going to run for it this time so after passing for two they come back with we're behind the left side of the offensive line Miller comes up to make the stop for West Virginia and this is still Brent their identity it's you and I know me neither when they need to tough yard we're still going to rely on their offensive line they've got a great full basket came sampling the angelo peter that had become a heck of a blocker upfront sampling let that play and I'll tell you where it makes the most of it we check in with Robert floors in the studio Robert what do you got for us here we had the swing pass over dispenser where so the running vacuum slips into that right flat and as a result the chains move again for LS you start to think about this offense with Russell Shepard coming back and Spencer where who's a physical backboard content who's got great speed and acceleration Rueben Randle really developing ok this is an offense that I think I pretty feel like it's rolling right before our on cosplayed afford he blacks his way across the 25 yard on the first down power on one of the Tigers saw Jarrett Lee look over to the line of scrimmage and every time a play is called generally you look over and times he'll get confirmation whether or not it's going to be a run for a pass you can see the safeties are back there confident when they have numbers in that box area they're going to hand the ball off and if you're going to give them numbers they feel like they're going to get four or five yards and put themselves in very good position here now in second five Shepherd slips over to the left side randal to the hoist and poured rungs to the left daylight in zone touchdown LSU Michael cord sophomore from Leesville Louisiana and that is his fifth rushing touchdown of the season 22 yards great job and a left side that line receivers downfield picking up some block the true freshman goes elf Beckham downfield good block and there's the compliment to the more powerful Spencer where I just said Michael Ford comes in such a great compliment because of the speed and quickness not snap ball is down it will stay at 13 and more importantly Alama might have been shaken up the most important part of this story is the possibility of an injury to their kicker hugely loyal fan base and there is the kicker there to injure a knee and now as the result and here's often bringing it back with a 27 yard line it's a great job of blocking on the left side but to your right the true freshman Beckham back is actually able to line up against Pat Miller who's been given him that cushion but he just has a nice stock block and with the speed afford he gets into the end zone but as we sit here and look in the first quarter nine nine run to nine passes tremendous balance what happened rates right there who had a hurt knee already throughout the camp and it kind of lingering for the first few weeks of the season he was coming down hard on it there what does the defensive player wasn't sure who had the ball so we tackled the kicker if he thought we took both the holder and a ganger got a big hit or going to take the kicker out right writers found Roberts all right they continue to go back just West Virginia's not going to get back menace game and compete and they know that Dana Holgorsen knows that the running game is a part of just keeping a defense on if it's the defense it's an offense rather he wants to spread you out try to find matchups oneonone matchups in States the problem is the athletic ability that they're trying to get the oneonone matchup against his secondary very very tough Bushman Dustin garrison Carolina Texas Jepsen the pony got four what's the pinion look like it was move it in the middle to see if Benny Logan was drawn off or he broke into that neutral zone come over he might have been playing a guessing game there with a snap count outside 93 on the deep end we've seen these kind of offenses where receivers try to get to a spot and a quarterback is instructed in coach to throw the ball to a spot it's 2.5 seconds for example this receiver needs to be it's this spot and if the defensive backs disrupt that rhythm and make the quarterback hold on to the ball that's where you have a problem with this offense and eventually the rush gets going Alston checks back into the West Virginia lineup and as a penalty flag on the snap false start 57 on the opposite side yards sucking down Chevron the left guard and guilty they continue Dayna continues to experiment with his running backs Ryan Clark the fullback had checked in not wanting to put it up as you pointed out against this defense on every play trying to find something that will work for type trouble again up at the time bobble Gino goes back to pick it up but his teammate bailed him out on the play saved the moment Alston number 20 pounces on the loose football look at Gino's eyes he's not even ready for this snap and right now West Virginia is really imploding showing their youth showing their inexperience showing that maybe the scene and this team is maybe a little bit too much formed through first quarter fill three quarters of football right now they don't look like Edina holders can often so LSU leads 13 nothing that is presentation of Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations well here it is LSU 13 West Virginia nothing but here's a bulletin UCLA 27 Oregon State 19 mister Herbstreit what do you got to say for yourself you know there are my preseason pick oh I know the pac12 south and I abandoned him I left them and there's a completion by Geno Smith to start the second quarter snapping it off to his former Miramar teammate nats mccartney came up they gave it to him a favorable spot but you know it's great about college football you think about what happens in the preseason and you start to watch games and things change it's a big serve down good effort did he hold on to the football did he get his arm underneath see if they can snap the ball before they take another look attack who just stopped in time I would say that they're going to take another look at well you know I've got to give you a really high marks because a year ago you picked Auburn okay you know where our review they go and win a national championship I'll sit there on my couch in Montana wow UCLA just find out more about those gotta finish you in three weeks then I said I'm never going to fit you feel age now there I'm fine now they look great now they're going to make that run yeah it's it's crazy it's emotional Oklahoma state by the way an amazing effort what they were able to do is Texas A&amp;M so some great games all day that's a tremendous opportunity here for West Virginia on third down and it looked like he holds on to it afterwards it looked like he may have gotten that arm underneath I don't know if there's going to be enough evidence to overturn it let's take a way it looked like his hand and arm got underneath there to be able to hold on to that for a first down it's a Big East replay crew and an SEC crew on the field that's how they broke down officiating here tonight so they will take a couple looks at it and then send the decision down to the field and and we will play on interesting look at his offense and McCartney Bailey Smith all from the same high school and you know Dana Holgorsen telling us this week to new offense but they've really adapted to it well because of that relationship that they've had all the way back to high school I'll make you a big favorite on that block tonight come on boy come on in duck here we go it's what former West Virginia lion governor ah is the alltime leading tackler for the Buffalo Bill I'm making a Hello favor did you feel bad for the first three weeks you going back to Odyssey I mean I know it yeah at this time I give my man an easy one and only about UCLA it's only fair that I give you a team recognize here this weekend seems on appeal that's why we brought this up don't give it away okay there's some people out there wondering right they don't live in Buffalo the way he likes I do I live in San Diego all right here is your answer go ahead every tell us who it is Darryl Talley an alltimer here and went on to play in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills all those great teams with Bruce Mitchell Thurman Thomas and they were both here by the way because he's been inducted into the Hall of Fame the College Hall of Fame well is alleys being honored now the ruling on the field stands this is a completed pass you could tell by the roar in the background so it'll be a first down there is Dahle receiving his plaque to preach yeah he was a great player here too played for Don Nehlen really turned things around here in West Virginia good jesper wonderful crowd had the grandson who's a receiver on this we haven't seen yet in this game tonight who's the son of the equipment manager Dan Nealon maybe we'll see him going over Gino snaps it off that Austin and there is some more trashtalking between Austin and Matthew and that's what they need they're going to hurry up here the table in Austin against Matthews a great matchup but that time press coverage and West Virginia hit it got the first down Austin again this is the guy that they have to get the football to now they're really fun to hurry up they're trying to create some tempo here for the Sultan Pacino pit trying to get LSU defense on it field in out of attack mode you know back again side in Toulouse I love that Dana Holgorsen is getting his offense to just get up to the line of scrimmage alinka get into attack mode let's hurry up because a lot for not just wearing down the LSU defense and they're rotating defensive linemen as we speak on and off the field but it more important it gets your own offense into a rhythm it makes them where they don't have to think as much the way they did in that first quarter Roberts's Ramon Valley played faithbuilding Gino rolls right throws back and had to receive our cutting across the field that was Bailey unable to hook up with him there was a little bit of daylight down there it appeared for Bailey Gino could have had a big gain on that pass and now he faces a stiff third down here one of the things that this defense because of their speed and because an athletic ability will test the me of a young quarterback is his willingness to get the ball out of his hands entrust his initial read if you don't trust your initial read and get the ball out of your hands you're going to be too late against the speed of this defense the pressure trying to get there so he snapped it off completely short of the first down marker Austin again the crowd wants him to go down 13 points they're going hurry unfair again moving on at the 36 need to get to the 32 snap it off got the first down beautiful trolling of pressure to Austin that's that's showing confidence in an offense even though you're down 13 to nothing and table and Austin again is the goto player reminds me a lot of the Kirsty Harvin as far as to his ability to make plays in space I'm not comparing in the harvest I'm just saying that he's that kind of playmaker had that kind of sudden is in quickness and he's the one athlete picking matchup favorably against the LSU secondary Clark and Garrison now into that backfield playaction in trouble steps away from it fires penetrate into the red zone as McCartney and that's a beautiful play McCarthy and the quarterback as the quarterback was in trouble he was able to pull away and we have another injured tiger down on the field rendered dead on what was impressive here about the pressure is the way Gino Smith stepped up away from the pressure stepped up into the pocket and then even after being touched he's able to reset his feet and then rotate off to the right and find his man downfield McCourt steps up away from Kiki Mingo who's got great quickness that eventually finds his man downfield you know this is an interesting tempo tempo tempo tempo West Virginia has some success I think he's frustrated because in towns is there any hurt but I think frustrated to see now just when they get a little rhythm a little bit of rhythm going they say you know there's an injury now it's closed them down a little bit 18 possessions and only ten touchdowns they would like to pick that up snaps it farside incomplete overthrew the receiver on rooks and that was Ryan Neela there is the grandson of Don Nehlen the legendary coach here his father Dan this young man Nealon he's a premed student and coach said he's got everything going he's got athletic ability a 40 inch vertical he's got one of the bestlooking girlfriends on the case something up right there total package slacker down and there's complete let's down West Virginia rode that much big frog there obviously by West Virginia the way that first quarter went it couldn't have gone any worse but in to bounce back here in the opening drive the second quarter will play 73 yards get the crowd back into the game get this team getting a little bit more but but attitude thinking they can compete with the Tigers Tyler Bittencourt adds the extra point after the touchdown by Bailey to Miramar high school teammates we'll be right back well the Becca Lee exhibition coalmines main attraction is that tour it takes visitors 1500 feet beneath the hillsides of New River Park not too far from Morgantown back through the years the coal miners and one of them had an interesting comment for a cameraman he said I'm glad to see on a day like this normally when we see cameramen around of mine it's not good news but this was good news all those hardworking fellows that go down to that mines working on our behalf we salute them here tonight Alston checks in now is the running back Gino's with that field position one punt down at the three this one at the four and from their own end zone Maina Hogenson will throw it and he does complete the Bailey Bailey spoils to the first down second effort little bit of desire here early on the Mountaineers it's nice to see Bailey get this but Brent real quick watching little hesitation by Tavon Austin who's the goto guy a little bit of a break down here by LSU gambling and thinking that everything's going to be thrown underneath something it unsure Dana Holgorsen will try to come back through little hesitation double move and right by the safety collapsing down on those short throws got the ball out to the 15yard line with the first down you know rolls throws deep out of bounds LSU defense determined to try to take away those underneath throws and I thought West Virginia you know we're talking here that last Drive so hurry up I think created tempo and I was the first time we saw all night LSU lose a bit of their aggression hands on their hips look a little fatigued that's what West Virginia's going right back to here this Drive now second and ten snap it off complete and Brad Starks makes the play 13 straight pass plays we talked about how they have to sprinkle in the run game just to keep those defensive linemen honest they've only run tonight for 12 yards so it's not like they're going to have a big night running the football but you do have to try to get it going just a little bit just to make them appreciate it and understand that you have didn't get it and there's a penalty flag thrown into the middle of that pile Alston was the ballcarrier short of the first down obviously decline this is Senator Joe Madsen trying to fight for position against Anthony Johnson the freshman just tackled him pretty easy call for this thing opening number 74 on the offense penalty declined fourth down so now they'll punt it away Cory Smith the junior from Inwood West Virginia will trot out he's a young man by the way who transferred from Alabama during his high school days here in West Virginia this young man was picked a 59yard field goal a little back deep Matthew so here is the West Virginia putter ready to go boom after you've driven back for the 27 yard line starts up field short of the 40yard line and they come back with Michael Corden we entered the game for the running play and West Virginia signal that they had stolen the football but I believe he was yeah yeah absolutely down Ford comes in to give where and they continue to rotate back and forth again great compliment to one another with the speed and quickness of forward with the power of where and think about coach stud is a play caller for LSU they will stick to what they believe in which is continually run the football and when they find opportunity to throw they'll look for you know a guy we have not heard from tonight at the Angelo Peterson the big tight end who's quite a receiver in his own right he's off to the left here apparently we're running backs into that is short of that first down marker so this will be third down and short but they've shown us that power I and their ability to pick up the first down let's see if they bring Stampley in as the lead blocker or they bring JC Copeland in JC Copeland will get the call this time he's from LaGrange Georgia 6 1 to 80 big time size advantage to the LSU offensive line you know it's coming can you stop it number 44 will lead you to it oh no they throw off it the man hatter is at it again touchdown LSU Beckham scores at 52 yards mr. miles I don't believe unbelievable fall coach miles the coach done the play call earlier he is often on Chavis and coach got up there as well one ski about it third and short I formation they bring in the big fullback just make it okay pound away get the three yards for a first down great time they waited and they waited they get everybody up to the line of scrimmage and to show the courage to call to play an outstanding job and LSU coaching staff a great execution by the players Salamah back on the field with that slightly ding knee was able to add the extra point and he looked fine it is the beautiful play Pegg and there comes the speedster in the freshman Odell Beckham from New Orleans he is going to be a good one folks Alston checks in is the running back pistol formation of the Mountaineers snaps it off there is often in the middle getting daylight often tried to catch a seam first down and ten 127 with Virginia three timeouts clock stops every time they pick up that first down does a good job of Austin cutting back underneath the pursuit for the defense and picking up more yards for that first in Austin McCartney and Bailey have been the big receivers for West Virginia tonight they could be here shuffle running backs in and out half the football sit back complete again another first down stop the clock and Bailey when you see mostly born say they did baling pushing off if he ended his route that's what allowed him to get open what great receiver doesn't do that occasionally but a forsake the get separation especially his play board and a Syrian company until I see secondary that was back underneath to Austin Austin trying to get outside and he is bumped out of bounds by Simon a good job to get out of bounds again they still have the three timeouts we love a chance to least get into field goal range it's all offense knows how to execute they have about a minute to go in a few timeouts submit so plenty of time Brent I'm sorry to get into field goal range a fitness room will be for 203 yards here is 21 to 35 does have a clutch mount as it does have an interception after the Claire the runningback will step out of bounds to stop the clock that's garrison the freshman from Texas his first catch of the game and now they're down to 49 seconds with it one thing you've seen right now Ellis you do a good job of taking away all the deep throws they're back there right now with two deep safety see one here another one back here to it a great job of taking away make them throw short sideline Gentiles like hounds partly out of bounds on the far side but there is a penalty flag thrown back in the back field right there when they typically get a hold you have plenty of time there throw and a lot of it had to do with West Virginia grabbing some jerseys up front overall as you look at bran the left guard he's got a couple ton we should night but Barkley Melton number 55 on the offense penalty 10 yards third down Raider and ager offensive line actually has held up pretty well and then we did this rush no we must think about it for West Virginia as far as it's going pretty good job they have the one area that you'd love to see and be able to do a little bit better is just defaming a few blocks when they decide to run the football every protections been good he's not in fact you got to open up this a few teams for the running back danger zone here you intro a costly pick you're late the first half after you deflect that picked off Matthews down to about the oneyard line that was the zone where you had to really be careful about throwing the football it was third in a function here comes the playmakers Tyrann Mathieu from New Orleans Matthew he comes on the Blitz recognize the place Maxis puts it open to the air and if you're an LSU fan you've been seeing this now since he was a freshman last year he used to do I Got News for you college football needs to pay attention to number seven and LSU he's one of the most dynamic playmakers in all of college football I keep using the comparison ed Reed because he has that sixth sense to make plays I don't know how he does he's always there to make pleasure the luck could be one consideration the impact place and no one they give it you're more of an impact for LSU that this young man right here Nikki knows too that big I think in the where Dana Dana Holgorsen said that he thought he was the best defensive player he had looked at all year on tape he said because he's all over the field I thought you don't know where he's coming he's not just on the field he make plays what are they wearing I was expecting a convoy yeah look like they've grabbed a top ten right now let's see what they do Spencer where we'll be in find the fullback Stampley at the lead back I'll be doing and it will be second down and goal I'm LSU trying to get their timeout to make sure everybody's on the same page here it's a big drive put in just have to be able to execute here try to punch it in big swing in this game again number seven right in the middle of it the Oregon game to do and I had the opener in Dallas pivotal play of the punt return for the doxy was right there that caused the fumble pick it up put it into the endzone and again big game you need a play turn number seven and he produces first time he's been the boss of the entire I've been a coordinator and bill June when a whole bunch of circumstances unfolded here in West Virginia Bill Stewart out Holgersson in charge rolling and throwing and diving for a touchdown in the endzone is chase Clemente from Thibodaux Louisiana the junior and there they are thrown again when you expect them to run good call aggressive play call by coach stud balls thrown down home it gets his hands under they may take another peek at that just to make sure it did not touch the turf see if maybe this angles show you a little bit better I don't know I don't think there's anything that we've seen there that could over overturn this that is the young man's first catch of the year no one is hoping more than it holds up then he is right down chase Clemente for his career he caught two previous passes for LSU he's never scored a touchdown so he still hasn't officially scored one until we hear from instant replay at the for the review the ruling on the Philippi Farm touchdown his first catch his first touchdown Fred how about the formation look at Tyler Edwards I tied in I mean there are they selling we're going to run the football absolutely there here we come we're going to run the football look out whoops second time they've tried to pull the defense in second time it's been a result has been a touchdown very creative offense here by the Tigers who had come up from Baton Rouge and they're going to take a nice comfortable lead into the locker room here at the intermission case you just joined us and you're wondering about the 27 they had a bad snap and missed an extra point situation on their second touchdown so it's 2077 mixed emotions for Jordan Jefferson as he watches and happy that LSU is doing well but he so much wishes that he were part of this and insiders on the LSU team at Kobe they think he's going to be back this year they think Jordan Jefferson will be reinstated we'll see how that will unfold down in Baton Rouge Les Miles has a real good football team and you can make an argument now that this team should be number one in the country because of who they've gone to war against if it even or again instead of the Mississippi State and now tonight West Virginia on the road one on a neutral site to when they're on the road they have got a tremendous argument they're the only team in the country who have played three top 25 teams when you take a look at the coaches and the writers polls you'll see that they differ on one thing and that one thing is LSU the writers this week as you see what they've accomplished in their first three games Oregon 40 twentyseven a little bit of a scrimmage against Northwestern State in nineteen six and now here tonight so the writers moved them up to number two on the left the coaches left them just under Alabama on the right so that's a Donnybrook ball kids wake up are you kidding me me watch the watch a few of these games and how do you have LSU at three if they go on to win tonight that's by far the best resume in college football it's not even close LSU for now should be ranked number one nobody's done what they've done and I don't even matter what Oklahoma does tonight that was a great way to tour the stage but nobody's gone on the road and played three teams ranked it highly is LSU sympathetic so handing off to the youngster and that is garrison exploding brings it out to the 44 yard line the final 16 seconds on the clock LSU back in that prevent defense and so West Virginia just content to go on inside the locker room so Holgersson faces his first uphill task as a head coach there you are at home huge crowd on hand and it's a disappointment here in the first half you're down 27 7 I guess one of the best teams in the country these West Virginia fans any players figured hey this team went down to Baton Rouge last year battled him 22 14 and had some chances late why not have a chance to compete with them this year in Morgantown and have a chance to beat him first taps do a whole second half to play with the first half these are two different teams ilet's used a better football team than they were a year ago more complete than they were a year ago and West Virginia with a new head coach and a new system going through some growing pains here early in the year Knoll Devine was a running back for West Virginia last year down in Baton Rouge and I gave that Herbie was speaking about he was injured in that game really has not been the same turn loose of the NFL well the final play and Smith is going to throw for it and guess who knocked it away focus guess who was that number seven why not has he done everything else how he should lead the team on into the locker room and Herbie it began with this third and one call by LSU great call here by Les Miles and all that the coordinator drinks third and short they decided to go over the top to backup their freshman makes the big play defenses out of position and you said Tyrann Mathieu what a play to knock the ball up into the air makes the play gets down inside the two yard line and you love to see this second down aggressive play call again on playaction did time to the back of the end zone of clementa tight in and LSU all of a sudden builds a commanding 20point lead and now they get the ball first there to start the second half this is so important for West Virginia to shut him down right away get it back to the true score game and they can't give up I mean they've got to be aggressive obviously they still got a lot of work to do here in the second half they get an overloaded line of scrimmage continue to do what you did early they have some success but they've got to get aggressive so they've given the ball over over three times they've got to create some turnovers in their home so LSU will bring it out on a kick off and out close the 14yard line as Morris Claiborne with a good return and we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary should not surprise any of you of course that the the turnovers have been so critical in this game three turning coach even sit at the Aaron walking off the field and you have three turnovers in a game like this against the team like this it's going to be a long night look at the starting field position at the bottom LSU right around midfield let's get West Virginia because of the punting by the Tigers inside their own 20 starting field position at their own 16 on average that Brad wing the Palmer is an unsung heroes Brooks is down for the Tigers they've had a few players shaken up here tonight and some big collisions on the kickoff coverage Tanner was checking down below with Aaron Brenda had a chance to catch up with LSU had coached left Myles coming out of the half he said look we just have to keep up the intensity you know the way West Virginia he knows is going to try to get back in this thing they want to keep the clock running the way they throw the ball but he was very very happy with his defense and he said from West Virginia's defense tried to take away our running game we decided to pass the ball and did it very well also an update for you guys safety Craig Lawson he did pass with compressions tests but they're keeping him out of the game one of the numbers about LSU that we haven't given tonight they've won 35 consecutive nonconference games that's the long one of the longest preaching in the country nonconference on the 35 straight Michael Ford will open the second half as the LSU running back gets the carry and he bumped out of bound 49 by Miller going back to what Aaron said there with Coach miles and I think that's very important early in the season you want to be able to show kind of a killer instinct when you have a lead on the road and LSU that's one of the things they really find themselves in sure you're up 20 but don't let off the accelerator keep attacking keep being aggressive just when you let up a little bit that's what a team like West Virginia can get back in the game so the coach preached it now we'll see if the players with them West Virginia's defense is good lay hands on terribly he stands in there again and hits Randall for a first and then at midfield so that you know every we haven't given PJ Lonergan the center and the rest of these pellets enough credit tonight Chris Fogg P Bob a bear will Blackwell Alex hers to the triggerman of course in the center PJ Lonergan they've done a wonderful job up front here tonight I see that Greg Shaw is in that offensive line right now big number 75 senior from Hialeah Florida the white back oh right bored another first down you get down by 20 and you lose a little bit of your aggression with your tackling you start to just use some arm tackling and they're blitzing they're crowding the line of scrimmage the problem is if they get through that initial surge they're very lucky before that time didn't flip the safety and take that all the way to the house but West Virginia can't afford to kind of sit back and just and lose that aggression you've got to continue to be intense with your intention to be able to come up with some big tackle cancer farm tackle he's running back to run right through them straight to that blast ran it into three touchdowns in the second half on this West Virginia defense good makes the stop that time glad you talked about the offensive line and see the night that Ford's enjoyed with the touchdown he's been able to get out a little bit more tonight didn't where but that all bent to line if they're lose they don't have their leader up there Josh neurotic who's out for the season with the knee they lost Alex first from time to time you see Greg Shaw you've shown a lot of death a lot of maturity here early in this year and on display again tonight Copeland and where are now two running back there's that playaction beautifully executed by Lee and Shepherd goes high to pull it down right now they are in rhythm running the football playaction on early downs giving gerrant Lee plenty of time the ball is up in the air it gives you an idea of the athletic ability that they have missed from Russell Russell Sheppard the freshman Beckham is kind of taken that role on but now to have them both in a lineup together it's a pretty lethal combination when you throw a Rueben Randle and back them as a freshman and now Russell Shepherd all three are on the field right now Broadway and close to another first down is where I think they're looking to kill the will here in West Virginia absolutely outstanding job up front we just talked about in Brent how they're standing those blocks of getting a push balanced attack here LSU just kind of doing whatever they want to the West Virginia defense very very impressive and the quarterback seems to just get more and more comfortable with every snap that he say we're on the cost not going to get the first down of that time buying taco by Ian Smith another of the youngsters from Miramar Florida that's the way they've got to stop this office when they run their so overmatched physically up front and it's three three five they don't have the size and in the second half not only mentally but physically with this big offensive line leaning on you all game really start to see LSU have a decisive advantage in the trenches but the big play because they got penetration there's out and three Buller kinsman tight formation and rebel dropped a touchdown pass the back of the endzone off the play action Jarret Lee had another six points and Rueben Randle couldn't hang on I said you know Jared Lee hit a little bit of a smirk on his face he can't throw the football any better I love to see and he just kind of smiled and say hey Ruben shake that one off look at the technique little playaction falling off of it a little bit that's something he's really worked on this year is stepping into his throws but that ball is right on the Bucky Rueben Randle alibi on the field for the field goal it's a 30 yard hold it left missed it left Gino Smith the junior quarterback from Miami brings West Virginia out the freshman from Texas Dustin garrison number 29 you're from behind him Ryan Clark's number 32 to fullback and they run the end around with Austin Austin cuts off what's right at it in a footrace brought down from behind at the 41 yard line and flying after him was Kendrick Adams it's a 38 yard run folks Kendrick Adams is the defensive lineman chased him down field it's the first time they got the ball to the perimeter and it's safety from LSU over pursuit it often cut back against the safeties and then all he had was nothing but turf in front of him that shows you something about athletic ability of LSU when a defensive end is moving out on one of the faster players on this West Virginia team and 94 tracked him down from behind and he had a full head of steam oh boy you talk about athletic ability on this Tiger team to be able to have defensive linemen do that second down and eight now have a problem when the defensive lineman who taxes is safety infected there it's called SEC my friends enterprise Alabama how that get away from the Clemson tie Holgersson want is a little upbeat tempo here now that's that you know not only to speed from Ella its use defense but a big play by Tavon Austin to get the ball into Tiger territory here second down and eight back in the pistol formation complete first down we're at the 30yard line Austin able to pull it down and they're picking on the corner to that side they had a receiver short and a receiver deeper downfield he had time to be able to make a decision to corner kind of sat up tight on the receiver it was up tight pile Tyler Urban who makes a nice strong throw behind him that's an important Drive here early in the second half of West Virginia garrison the Texas question that was for a couple of yards and Matthew there to making the Saabs all over the field you talked about we started the second half if you're West Virginia you got it you got to somehow get it stop get the ball back to your offense and try to put the ball in position to be able to put some points up on the board I'm sure that's what Dana Holgorsen told his team this is what we're going to do and they're off to a defense guard here with his first drive the second half garrison motions up at the blind is in time and he fires for another first down down to the 10 yard line Tyler urban second catches and I watched the head of Tina Smith look off the defense we got Michael Broncos down again he was down earlier in the game watch Brett watched Chino 12 watch him look to the left with his head just enough to be able to clear the safety Erica Reed and give his receiver urban that much more room to be able to catch the ball and get upfield does a good job of using his eyes gets the safety back throws an accurate ball to urban and gives the urban a little bit more room to cut upfield just by using his eyes off to the left there now that's stir from the crowd is that they think some of these fellows are just going down to stop the uptempo play that has appeared West Virginia was going to go to and you may have been reading the stories about the National Football League that they are going to find teams and players if this happens but the problem with it is is you really got to be certain that a player is not injured or shaken up and number 90 goes off to the sidelines you can see Holgersson reaction he's saying exactly what the fans are saying that this is well whatever you see the Giants game how bet that was white that that's what least there's a little effort here if in fact the LSU players can clear that of the pencil he's in Austin emotion pumping to his direction top middle touchdown West Virginia Tyler Urban so they find the tightend the tide in in this system of course flexes off the line a little bit they hit one of the big colors so you talk about a couple of drives that have put the crowd back in this game first once for Virginia survives and then they come back and they score great job backtoback plays by the quarterback of using his eyes that last play will come back and look at it a little pump fake showing the screen got to safety out of position and urban goes right into the hole for the touchdown perfectly executed six plays eighty yards Tyler Bittencourt had the extra point and you take a look at that beautiful pump fake come back middle and it's six and a mountain news where is Robert Kraft the New England Patriots and he was downstairs with our Urban Meyer on the sidelines and you had a chance to chat with Rob it's the first time I've had a chance to meet in and said he'd been trying to get around to a lot of college football games here this year really like fifty obviously every year how can you not like he's not here it's not good for the scouter who get into Robert comes back as I like this left back oh what are you to say yeah you're right so here comes do you know maybe back doors over the crap got separate here comes Austin all of ours if you haven't seen Gino Smith playing this shows you right here our inference and accuracy backed by his own goal line he puts the ball right so he could have placed temple and he's better to save on Austin we talked about at the beginning of the broadcast the one guide it has got to make some big plays some playmakers Bebo and Austin head time he got right behind Hatcher 72yard to Smith is closing in on a 400yard night here in the red zone that's it incomplete off to the side McCartney early Brent about the red zone was at West Virginia has had coming into this game we talked to Dana Holgorsen about that he said you know with this kind of offense it's a lot about field by the quarterback and the feel means he's got to trust that read and be able to put the ball out early and and accurately they love to try to throw the ball downfield down to the back of the endzone to these taller receivers but you know up to this point not been able to settle in to this aspect of this offense you know good speed and to me if I would go off the board here Brett throws it underneath comes back to McCarty all that we far side we've got a third down here coming up for West Virginia 204 here to go in the third quarter vein of the coaches that need to think about what happens here on an incompletion get it back to a tenpoint game or do you gamble on a fourth down let's see what happens here now first things first I was got the defensive line jump has his complete to the nine but there was a flag and it was stopped false start number five on the eye that's a wide receiver McCartney he should never as in ever be guilty of a false start second time the last two drives we've seen a receiver with a pole so we also had Neely and have one kind of affected in out the last ride with the previous drive or down five yards tougher set the screen set it to the left side garrison out of bounds inside the 5yard line that is a bigtime tall of that situation the timing brant of this and you could see Dana Holgorsen panic given assignment he knows Chris he wanted this fall the previous player where they had this ball start the timing of this when the call it is great in the execution is impressions Dustin garrison gets it fall down to the two yard line garrison the pressure for the puck the coming out of a running back through the years of West Virginia they've had some great money back here they're searching Dustin garrison maybe ending that searcher tonight he's a young man from Carolyn Texas and he let perryland into 5a state championship in Texas now bit moszer here Harvey and suddenly there's going to be a little league with the Mad Hatter this is amazing atmosphere him here in Morgantown these fans that have sucked around everybody there they believe that they've got a chance to be able to win this game the freshman garrison with talk again Brant about the offensive line they're facing one of the most talented defensive lines in the country most athletic or the deepest deepest the lines that you'll see in college football in fact Les Miles have been on record this week thing this is the fastest defense that I've been around and I've had a chance to coach these guys will down 2077 and they have fought back here in the second half to get within six points and breath don't forget 27 to 7 and LSU had a chance to potentially put this game away and Rueben Randle dropped that touchdown pass if you remember they would have been able to split them up potentially 34 is 7 the bowl is perfectly thrown and he drops it that opened the door for West Virginia they've come back taking advantage of it then they've missed the field goal after that Brooks's play quarterback from the one is quite on first is a 35 40 45 midfield long tattoo folks a 99 yard kickoff return for a touchdown by sophomore Morris Claiborne from Shreveport Louisiana and that followed West Virginia climbing right back into the thick of things so you lose Patrick Peterson and you think it's going to affect the old return game right but mostly for their stepping up and drink as you said kilts would it look like the stadium West Virginia had regained the momentum do you want to be ranked up at a1 top 1 2 or 3 things in the country that's what you've got to be able to do it was a huge return and the timing of that return could not have been any bigger for LSU Alama things that really stood out to me there and it looked like he had a nice return and you'll see this I mean it sped up perfectly he's dangerous he's got tremendous speed picked up a few blocks how about this shake right there I thought he might just kind of be pushed out of bounds right there but he doesn't give up on the play and neither does the convoy of blockers looks like he might get pushed out he keeps fighting to be able to try to find a crease and eventually he found it and it begins the blockers didn't give up on him either that's pride and a lot of athletic ability to be able to make this play right there doesn't go out of bounds now he's got a chance to take it to the house the fullback is in Michael Ford is the running back let's see if this is going to be muscle football where we come first down behind the fullback well and you can see a scrum down there in the middle of this but now for tonight's big picture brought to you by Sony let's talk about LSU and where they are nationally in their opening game on a neutral site in Dallas they beat up on Oregon they then on a Thursday night went on the road to Starkville a conference game they passed that test by beating Mississippi State which was in a top 25 now tonight they lead them out nears and a whole lot of folks including per country think they should be the number one team in the land because of playing a schedule like that one hopper to the outside and it'll be third down hence if they survive can hide here Morgantown we were talking at the break if folkway board doesn't return that kickoff obviously not bumbled not only to talk about a different game you're talking about LSU all threads right now being able to finding a rhythm and a chance to move the ball effectively against what Virginia and on the other side West Virginia kind of moving the ball and feels pretty good about themselves so this is still a long way to go here in the fourth quarter Jeff this field defense has done a much better job here in the second half third down and six now to the outside and where the running back and this will depend on the spot this the linesman is going to give him the first down this is a first down for the Tigers and this is a big moment in this football game pretty good effort there by Spencer we're just to fight to get into position to have a chance at a first down what do you think of every first dollar no fitting the first down and I think I think he got a pretty favorable spot I think II think he haunted about a length of a football good eye so let's take a look at the spot but he got on this it's fighting about everything he has to get avoid it that's interesting I mean he looked like he was right around the 42 or the 47 rather hope you got inside it 888 a met spot inside the 47 but I left first down here Center where the I back and picks his way across the 45 yard line we saw some aggressive play calling by LSU in the first half and it worked for everybody is kind of assuming that LSU right now is pulling their horns in and running the football and working the clock and just not forget Les Miles known as the hat had so many willing to take chances chances coach Dunn to play call it offensive coordinator to get all to sleep and think nothing but run he'll go playaction I mean try to hit a big eight in the Box where Prince outside puts away footrace to the 30 and down to about the 26 handy force to bring him down looks like they had him jammed at the line of scrimmage and he's run away to the right this gives you an idea how strong he is the balance that he has tremendous speed if it looked like almost every West Virginia defender had a chance to be able to knock him down 230 pounds Spencer we're not giving up on the play and second time effort right there for wear picks up another first down fifteen yards now for drew places where after that run in the rod nothing doing terrific defense by West Virginia's Bruce Irvin here come the chance Bruce Bruce Bruce he finally make the play Bruce Irvin got a lot of attention last year as a junior college player because he had 14 sacks last year he only has one this year but this is a big play in a pivotal time in this game big tackle for a loss nobody picks him up the quarterback gives it a try by Jarrett lead with the power and quickness and the instincts that time of roomservice prevail where is the running back second and 18 the only solace unless you are going to burn their first time out here to second have 3421 LSU leads it second and 18 for the Tigers in the West Virginia 35 right splat and a fine run by Spencer where who was outside the long throw for charity to make and we saw it earlier pick up a first down I just love the effort here by wearing almost white boy it looked like he stepped out of bounds but the officials right there and if you're a West Virginia defender his play the game she's got to get low and she got to make that play good effort once again third time on this drive alone by big number 11 Spencer we're third and seven draw play with where first down they brought two linebackers this time and guy that we love the fullback James Stanley watch 35 pick them both up he hits one of them and shields the other and when you take that it's a bit of a risky blitz both your middle linebackers you better get a tackle for a loss because if you don't and the fullback picked them up there's nobody left other than safeties to stop it from sort of touchdown for touchback touchdown LSU may not have been the dagger but it's out of the sheath folks this is a huge six points going on seven for LSU big offensive line the little fullback against Stanford you know he doesn't have a reception or a carry on the year but it continues to give these tailbacks room to run you love pull backs it will get a lot of recognition but that's a great job to open that play up for Mike before now they're going to go for two but this on a 42 throwing for it no good it will stay at 4040 21 Michael Ford from Leesville Louisiana fifth touchdown of the season at this point this games how to reach for West Virginia but it will be interesting to follow them the rest of this year and the Big East and see if they're able to maybe capture a big if championship it still despite with all that's going on in the realignment everything so yes that has began oh yeah we could spend actually the last six six minutes talking about that but despite all that they still have a chance I like South Florida personally to win the Big East get to a BCS bowl game but now after see any guys tonight they're going to continue to grow up and continue to become a team that you're going to have to look out for an app maybe have an outside shot to get into a BCS bowl game second down and eight coming out for the Tigers and now the question is what will the voters do with LSU after this September run fourandoh as where bangs away toward another first down here on second down if you check out the Associated Press top ten Oklahoma of course sitting number one leading 3821 they struggle a little bit early you would think they would stage number one for me ended but LSU you would think would be a solid number two but you can make an argument out at LSU should be number one because of the schedule not that's the thing I mean they they had a chance to have style points tonight but I think you have to add up playing Oregon in Dallas playing with 50 state which is always tough on a Thursday night and then having a chance to play this game since a we're taking a direct snaps on your centers stuff that first I'm not playing this game on the road that's playing teams that they played away from Death Valley and then they deserve recognition and credit for them so we'll take a look at this call and then we will we will take a look at LSU's remaining schedule and most of it now is going to be in the SEC first down so I think that one of the big surprises in the SEC is the fact that Florida would be an urban mentioned it or it could be little bit stronger than the than you think Auburn rebuilding of course without Camden this year but there is at that big game on November 5th in Tuscaloosa Alabama and don't forget November 25th at game LSU in Arkansas always a great game so still a long way to go for the Tigers but just looking forward and kind of picking up with what urban said I agree they have really shown people that the speed is back and healthy they're fitting in well and to Charlie white for skiing they really were able to get dense Jeff dimps on track to today to go along with Chris Rainey so I got a lot of play makers and they host Alabama next Saturday in Gainesville which will be one of the games of the week for sure in college football so here's a first down and then we're inside of five minutes Morgantown West Virginia disappointing night for the Mountaineer fans where it used to be the workhorse and Alfred blue is now in as the running back and the young man takes it in for the touchdown Alfred blue sophomore from Louisiana 6 to 215 pounds that's the second touchdown of the season for Alfred so in the end LSU pulled away and it's Laurel look for the turning point in the second half he's going to vote with Purvi it was play ball and kickoff return for a touchdown no that's the point is good you see blue step into the end zone or reminded that you're watching Saturday Night Football on ABC there's those fans that travel here from Baton Rouge you know a chant there's their thing has 1860s the the head and here is young Austin coming out now you're not going to get back to the ten and there's a penalty flag push in the back that's how Geno Smith 454 yards passing that broke Marc Bulger single game record for West Virginia against Missouri in 1998 429 yo but of course he's not going to win the football game so that will not get the attention that Whedon's record did with Oklahoma State today as well right a lot of speed here is Gino Smith tonight both school records you can see the 37 of 62 you got the feeling with Dana Holgorsen gone offense that broadcast crews might be pulling that up about every other week I'm going to think Pitino crits going to throw the football quite a bit with Dana Holgorsen here is the play caller in head coach absolutely incomplete out of bounds was Devon Brown the transfer from Wake Forest you know I thought I had remembered this but I checked it we had Claiborne going 99 yards of kickoff return last year from Baton Rouge Patrick Peterson went sick in the yards for a touchdown with a punt return and then he did the post do you remember mother successfully I might add as Desmond oh no I'm sure he took a page from dead there but the thing that it I guess it surprised me the most is as good as LSU secondary is if I'm going to play LSU I'm going to figure out ways to give my quarterback time to throw and you guys are just need to be separated it's been going on all night with the LSU secondary but I'm going to try to attack LSU through the air I'm going to spread them out and even though they're very athletic and very good if I've got guys who can play in space hey Ron Austin I think gave you a book to study on how to try to get separation and try to attack what appears to be a strength of LSU which is the second word so there's a challenge on the previous slide great concentration really it's a matter if you have a toe here at Olin Alliance burglars I believe it's a left hook take a look at this early did he have complete possession there and two cameras looks like it had that catch Kevin Brown after the night the Gino I found I could give you attached by the way that ball was tipped and brown still was able to focus on the focus point hold on to it transfer here from Wake Forest this could be an interesting time for this coaching staff in my opinion Bill Stewart was forced out in June Dana Holgorsen was elevated the ball will be placed at the 18 yard line first and 10 no time out challenge until later the point I want to make about this is when Dana took over he inherited the rest of the staff he did not have time nor inclination to change any of the positions and a lot of them a lot of these fellows are loyal to Bill Stewart ooh went 28 and 12 here before they decided to make a change all of the turmoil during the offseason involving Ohio State Miami all these other schools I thought the most bizarre was right here in West Virginia I honestly thought that I had never ever encountered stories like we're coming out of Morgantown and there's the timeline and you can see reports surfaced that Coach Stewart it asked the writer to dig up dirt on Holgersson and at that time all of her luck the athletic director said he had enough and so Stewart was forced out and Holgersson became the replacement and now he's working basically with Stewart set after a game like this at the time when a coaching staff can have some disagreements and it'll be interesting to see how this staff does or does not rally around Dana Holgorsen something to keep an eye on here second down and 12 with a minute to go there is Oliver luck in the light shirt standing up on the left he played quarterback here was a second round draft choice his son is Andrew Luck by the way there was the favored to win the Heisman Trophy and be the first player drafted by the NFL he passed up that opportunity of this year and went back to Stanford in the existing outstanding young man incomplete and you're telling me right now looks like a battle between Seattle and Kansas City maybe yeah earlier get pointed take a look at the Scouts grades we've got three quarterbacks and here's how they rate them right now Andrew Luck at 99 attire and a me quarterback came out last year Landry Jones is right there with some of the other fellows you see cam this is 93 but do not go to sleep on Matt Barkley of USC pretty highly rated and you know in 1999 his Scouts Inc dropped on a player I can't believe they've been too many 99 no it's why if you're if he's not 100 it must be impossible to be a hundred OLS you will get it back and he'll run a clock out now Matthew says we're not running nothing out I'm going to keep on going to the 45yard line that there's the victory formation ah how about Marcus Lattimore of South Carolina is he in the chase for some postseason award yeah he had Trent Richardson both in Alabama great backs but we shall see you know game that it could have gone either way but after the big return by MO Claiborne LSU most impressive resume in my opinion through the month of September very well deserving of being ranked if and very easily good back come back on Sunday maybe be ranked up at number one if you go by what they've accomplished and you compare that to what everybody else accomplished a reason at all they should be up at number one or be 36 stripe nonconference regular season victories for LSU Les Miles is with Erin Andrews let's go to Erin friend thanks coach at the half you said you're happy with your defensive intensity but you wanted to see that same intensity in the second half how they do I thought we did that you know there was a piece of time where we misfire on offense put the game out of reach and so he's even said to go back on and play and they did did well I am very very satisfied with it because performance tonight you come away with a win but Geno Smith did throw for over 450 yards against your defense what do you learn from that well one we got a pack a little better you know there's certainly some missed assignments we're going to get a lot better when we see it and they're pretty good then number one he can play and speaking of number one there's a conversation going on right now in our booth with Brent and Kirk and with a lot of people that because of the three convincing wins that you guys have had on the road you should be number one when the poll comes out where do you think you should be I think it's a compliment to our football team certainly it's not in any way what we want to be we we understand it we've got a lot of work to do as a long season in front of us we play a lot of very quality football teams you go forward I think we'd rather sneak up on number one maybe a little later in the year I don't know if you're speaking up with anyone with that defense good thing for George appreciate it Darren see it alright guys thanks and he's become one of our favorites now if you've got a little character Les Miles the LSU Tigers over there saluting their fans who traveled up here a regime that we'll be one or two this week that is for sure we want to thank everybody for watching ESPN on ABC and we want to thank this great crew that came in here and this set up we haven't been
