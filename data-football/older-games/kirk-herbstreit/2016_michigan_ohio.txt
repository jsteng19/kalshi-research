============================================================

welcome to the game and the entrance to be rounded by guy afternoon that my turnip greens we tour the year preparation builds towards the game Ohio State in Michigan one hundred thirteenth edition when a beautiful day here in Columbus Ohio welcome to ESPN college football on ABC presented by Jared the Galleria of jewelry part of ESPN's rivalry series presented by Jimmy Lou this is very special folks Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit will join me in a short time here whatever happened to the next few hours is going to echo down to the decades the history of this rivalry and of this sport it's the 11 top five meeting more than any rivalry with the backdrop here in the playoff here is differ they come in rank two and three beyond that it's more complicated Michigan needs no help to win the division to play Wisconsin next week in Indy Ohio State must win and hope that Penn State stumbles against Michigan State later on this afternoon but a victory may be enough to get Ohio State's into that playoff that's the backdrop but what happened today who will step forward and make the play that decides this game that is watched around the globe by Wolverine and Buckeyes everywhere we cannot wait to bring it to you senior day all the emotions bubbling forward and then kickoff is coming up back with that from Columbus after these messages in a word from our ABC statements welcome to the titty Lube rivalry series and what about you're watching a presentation of the Big Ten on ABC the ultimate game in the Big Ten Ohio State and Michigan ranked number two and number three in the playoff rankings the old horseshoe of the banks of the Olentangy send today and it has rarely been a game of this high stakes high emotions Senior Day at elf line from Pickerington the allamerican candidate at center the centerpiece of a very small senior class most of these Buckeyes as you'll see today we back next year 13 to 2 in the last 15 meetings that looms large it's a bankrupt that might surprise you if you don't live this rivalry Michigan winning in 2011 five years ago today but have not won in Columbus since the year 2000 the Buckeyes have been very very hard to beat here period Harvick trying to avoid starting oh and two against the Buckeyes and Meyer trying to extend it to five and OH Michigan has not yet arrived the tunnel now they just appear seeing that Jim Harbaugh says we'll find that sweet spot between being two feet up but not focused enough he believes this bunch has the belief necessary to pull this upset today Arwa hasn't been back here since he was a player and guaranteed a Michigan victory delivering on that 96 Michigan team that stumbled a couple of weeks ago in their biggest road test until this one at Iowa got through in the snow we could go against Indiana these Wolverines ready for this the veteran team loaded with seniors who have one final crack at the Buckeyes you can hear you could feel the hunger in this group there's Jabril Peppers star of this team that will try to make plays in three different phases to help his team win the national anthem played by The Ohio State fan and welcome Kirk Kirk Creek joins me here but you have lived the intensity this rivalry as the son of a captain as the captain here yourself you covered some great ones interesting backdrop high stakes what will decide this for Ohio state your opinion with it I think first of all maintaining your emotion and allowing those emotions to work for you instead of getting so amped up they can work against you I've been on that side of it when moms at Ohio State commit so much as a senior to try to knock off Michigan because it's been a while and so Michigan has to guard against that I think for Ohio State honestly it comes down to their ability to make plays and being aggressive I think Urban Meyer this year they've been times when they've opened it up and there been times when they've kind of just managed to game and and I think this is the game where he's going to have to be willing to take chances and open some things up and and gave JT Baird a chance to be aggressive throwing the football and for Michigan there is intrigue at the quarterback position right down to the final moments watching in the field there you got Wilton to pay you got there he is number three they're injured a couple of weeks ago that shoulder that left shoulder he's available says Harbaugh Jonna Cornett they're throwing the ball as well this would be is a tstar for just his second at Michigan samantha ponder joins us on the field well coach we talked earlier about the distraction and the hype of all of it but you know your guys better than anybody so what's the biggest indicator to you that they can handle it today they've been a good team all year they're fun to coach their guys when it's time to lock in they listen and they go because you know when it comes to Mitch oh he's answering the question jakey's trying to get some info he tells them that way alright one more for to coach Phil Cochin you know this Michigan team can run the ball effectively so what's the key to slowing down their running game tonight that's always can you negate the line of scrimmage and our defense line older or they've been getting better and better all year but it's anytime you wanna stop the run you try to get extra hat the box but you got to control the line of scrimmage for same time thanks coach great Sam thank you very much talk to coach Jim Harbaugh prekick asking the status of world and space Brizzy he said when you indicated he's available for the big table maybe more anything more indicative he worked out with the number ones in the starters for the majority of the warmup growing 30 yard out how he can redeem contact through that injured shoulder an open question answer the message to his team from our mom he was simple was couple fours the regular season it is a playoff game that was invented referencing back to his time of the NFL certainly the state's back that off Chris there is your bell peppers will kind of make an impact as they kick returner here can be very intriguing to see Kirk now this Michigan offense operates as fate comes back in there less than honor force on 43 seniors on this team I think Jonah Thorne has to be put in a position to maybe take some early shots on first consent last week 7 and 16 they can't be onedimensional and expect to come into Columbus and win this rivalry game guys one cause they deferred pepper is back deep we need to kick off the cleaner German just honor here this will be fine folks you took the game is up to the height the short kick keep it away from peppers it bounces got coverage Lila brings you dive on it at the 22 yard line and now they insert the question that's been asked for a couple of weeks as tempers already begin to play over that sideline and for the last time Pepper's right out there near his fate so Spade you went down hard slam to the turn and that loss to Iowa reports he had a broken collarbone that was never confirmed by Michigan here he is Kirk not a hundred percent been growing pretty well in the warmup and he gets hurt with Tom Rinaldi saying that biforn had taken a lot of the reps with the first unit this might be how does Wilkins fate especially if you get hit how does he react but you gain all that experience that they lost last week when a corn went out and played against Indiana formation Davion shrimp warren ohio promises to run hard and one angry today against the guys from his home state the battle in the trenches any time Ohio State and Michigan get together from the dust settles and this game is over you'll look back on both sides of the ball and say how did things go there and of course now state interesting that he found checked out and that's where you get your grilled peppers now we knew the Wildcat was coming more tonight than any time all year we're doing ice meant that his right one second in five guards up the middle moon shows the acceleration looking to making plays at Bryant introduces prep as many as ten today they get their first first down and space comes now back into the game and again Jim Harbaugh is it innovative and outside the box type of thinker when it comes to the offensive side of the football he knows that this battle is being on the road with the wait his offensive look the last two weeks at Iowa in my Deanna get it did have to have some wrinkles and do some things that they have not done in recent we lifted short Jake but the old American Finance candidate is running phrase near midfield for another first down before March Owen Lattimore drove home at Ohio State actually ends up bringing a blitz here on the left you'll see the linebacker he gets picked up actually gets by the freshman presence on it and hidden space for the first time but because the linebacker came on the Blitz the nice big hole there and then zone nobody is there to pick up Jake plot who's one of the top targets on the biscuit offense big gunship concerns a table at Ohio State I've across the 50yard line is Davion Smith 715 rushing yards 10 touchdowns this year the impact players yeah you can always look at Damien Smith but I think Chris dancing is for seven kids a big play ability shake but he's already seen one of the leaders on the Steve who's from Columbus area member Ohio State Raekwon McMillan his kind of game against the run he'll have to have an impact and when Michigan throws specially on third down number 59 Taekwon Lewis can really get after the quarterback seven and a half stack you want to test that shoulder of Bank with the false start before the snap put Michigan behind the teams here on second down anything from offensive line in this environment Michigan taking this football his first drive just doing a nod to make the Ohio State defense which is in this stadium in a rivalry game with all the time they're playing very very emotional but Michigan slowed them down with a variety of different formation personnel groupings making Ohio State have to reassess and have to take and put Michigan normal aggressive mindset in second and 11 bait rolls out fires far side cook completely near Kamara Garbo is top target from the edge Lattimore made attackers be third down pull him out moving the launch point Wilton State he is a big man but you can see he's comfortable on the move as an accurate throw welldesigned play another nd Pro easy read here early great group of wide receivers on Michigan ball go is one of the receivers but eventually they'll try to get the ball down field the senior who has great athletic ability great speed they've been tremendous third bill deepen will redeem for because something drive alive protection delivers a lone throw incomplete but tried to go down and get it let her hit the carpet mid 4th down but he settled right between the two linebackers Raekwon McMillan and Jerome Baker he does a nice job settling there the ball has just thrown a little bit low so high o state brought pressure there and that may have affected that accuracy Oh to throw there looks like the young freshman Nick Bosa got the pressure but one of the last guys he'd expect to drop a pass in a big situation so any Allen veteran punter is out there and Samuel who's now taken over as the punt returner for Ohio State makes the fair catch at the 7 yard line and again the figures to feature field position back and forth will house they will take over in for field position for their first offensive series we'll see if that dictates the conservative approach from urban Urban Meyer always talks about that field position impact ultimately his play calling and you're right he has a tendency to be very conservative in these kind of situations CGT Barrett coming up the junior Pro highest a JT Barrett Arne has a couple games against Michigan back in 2014 big day running the ball but remember that's the game late in the game he ended up breaking his right ankle got taken out see Devin Gardner over top of the actually Santa Q encouraging words and then last year another fit date on his feed ran for three touchdowns so the last two years he runs for five touchdowns his legs have been more of a factor than his arm I've got a great block from Noah Brown on a crack block which opened up the edge it got Curtis Samuel who was a teacher died today Ohio State wants to get him as many as 25 touches and time he got the edge and got some big yards but a great block by Noah Brown I'm everything there awaits a long time that's why ending it creeping in and Samuel that time swallowed up after just a short game we've talked all year about Don Brown the defensive coordinator from Michigan and the aggressive scheme that he has brought and they are trying to push the line of scrimmage back they lead the nation tackles for a loss but they've not seen a mobile quarterback in a long time Barrett's throwing for the first time in the tech window there Noah pile next to catching muscles out near the 40 to the first down nice job here Ohio State and tempo here they want to get the aggressive Michigan defense on their heels good sign for Ohio State here early an accurate throw and rhythmic throw from JT Barrett we've not seen a lot of that to start games in recent weeks we're scary for Mike Weber the Michigan native comes out of ed powerhouse pass Technical High School in Detroit which features seven players in today's game credible though he is amped up to go against some of his former teammates have been getting an Ohio native making the tackle there to makes it rivalry so you need these guys know each other from back in their high school days Barrett this is his first keeper of Anthony not the last that he knows the six again near midfield a guy who has gained 831 rushing yards this year before you factor in the fact what an aggressive defense they're flying downhill but how about this second effort there by JT Barrett that efforts what picked up the first down Barrett now for midfield a first down throw incomplete Buckeye crowd now gets the late flag Noah Brennan was covered by a chin and Stribling both guys at the death valley Noah Brown was trying to work to the outside and Stribling would not let him he wrapped him up and once the ball was in the air the official is right there now they're going to talk about it to see maybe if the ball was in fact in the air and capron hitting this big tin crew so physical this is Noah Brown going to try to get the outside hold it yeah offense 10yard penalty anyway I'm scribbling one of the fine corners on this team Jordan Lewis on the opposite side they've been able to lock down receivers Iowa State's about matchups and right now Jordan Lewis to cop corner where the top of the country is in this slide they're going to try to keep him with Curtis Samuel the biggest threat from Ohio State Ohio State may be looking other areas to try to attack some potential matchup that they think of favorable as I've already moved of all 52 yards in five plays whoever motions back in there it keeps it okay Katie Barrett in their secondary lowers the head moves down to the 20 Chris walks with the action here look at the linebacker blow a great read and feel of the defense by JT Barrett as soon as they saw action the zone read they went with Webber the linebackers took off Barrett recognized that pulled it out with a man coverage in a lot of room to run I'll say respectful Michigan's defense would ultimately unimpressed by all those even fast that they've been piling up the bad faced us yet but guys test the middle whoever finds rid little number one in scoring defense ask the offense third down defense they created more negative plays than anyone but this was a defense that got chewed up my own house in a year ago you're right and Ohio State feels very confident their scheme again hurt early in this game and you want to see oneonone matchups and I think Ohio State's moving a lot of players around a lot of free snap movement to try to create the oneonone matchup that they want samuel on the pop pass tries to get the corner truck sit back that was well defended strung out in taco charles in the defensive end messed it up to be third long his penetration comes right through here watch the flow and the speed of the Michigan defense watch how fast they get out there so Charles that does a good job but the rest of those white jerseys are out there we passed on third down Barrett from the pocket buys time rolling and now all get knocked out amount at the line of scrimmage by Stribling the man who committed the penalty and Ohio State's Drive will distort comes a field goal they flushed him from the pocket of Brian Glasgow who got him out of the pocket and once he had to move to his right instead of having four receivers to try to find an open man he goes off to his right and everybody was covered he only had one receiver try to look for great coverage and good pressure that time by the Michigan defense one miss for Durbin this year that faithful block by Penn State returned for a touchdown it was the decisive play in Happy Valley he's not missed inside 40 but the pressure of the game can mess with the mind and reliable team your kicker pulls it wide left I'll state an impressive 72 yard march they come up empty so both defenses end up coming up in his opening tries which stops after both offenses had stopped to check no point yeah he just hooked it from the start Durbin says dadgum it college football presented by jeredy Galleria of jewelry in part by Bank of America and mercedesbenz the best or nothing we entering Kirk a new 10year war era year two for Harbaugh of course times and this throughout of Michigan victories Meyer for no against allah brain second possession for michigan from the twenty in its Wilton State at quarterback Davion Smith picks his way for a short gain Raekwon McMillan and Damon Webb Sock'em Jim Harbaugh head Woody Hayes glasses on and shindig with he came out among other people the other you drag to Malcolm X yeah we like characters rooms for know down get to over here Aaron picton is the back now information behind the boba and you put the short this is but wellguarded Weiss there knock down quickly by Jerome Baker the linebacker it will be third and five and when Jim Harbaugh is going to that three title look pigs physical offensive line with three tight ends when the fickle has done in his adjustment as he's getting a corner a smaller body off the field and bringing a fourth linebacker so essentially a four down linemen core linebacker look at Joe Berger into the football game Michigan has not been a terribly efficient often from this distance on third down so far this season fake they block the pressure complete and often running is grant Perry out near midfield so they came after him extinct and out in a hurry you think Jake but would be an option but he goes here which opens up a nice throwing Lane for spate for grant Perry who gets away from Ohio State top cover man and Goering calmly in the eyes of spate locked in to intial third down here early this game and there's the accuracy that Michigan needs it yards there were two third and five now peppers in the game at quarterback means it off he was a high school quarterback in New Jersey couldn't throw the ball as well as run it hasn't had that yet this year but it's definitely but it's definitely in the playbook that zone read is a different look a lot of times you'd see just an athletic guy and a wildcat come back to predetermine what to do if the natural quarterback run or just hands it off he's actually reading that which goes back to his high school days I'm killing at some point today he's going to throw the football for the Wildcat package victim on the left side this is the kind of game we've seen it over the years when a normally conservative coach will pull out all the stops especially if our boss thinks he needs to today and I think that Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer the kind of coaches that had such respect for this game and what it takes the winning that you save a few things for this game in a crucial moment in this game we're going to see that from both sides for defensive ends in the game for a while estate they call themselves the rush men from 37 they get protection incomplete delivered in traffic falling down with Garbo and it will be fourth down Harbaugh looking for the flag 71 he was frustrated because Garbo who was coming across he got caught up with a couple Ohio State defenders are on the outside with Lattimore you can see the physical push oh my good wraps Damon throws him down that was the reaction right in front of the bench yeah right exactly right yeah one thing to be at the line of scrimmage but continuing down field falls in the air surprise it was not a call big missed foam on the third down and now and one to punt it away and he'll again calling fair catch it'll bounce and again roll dead inside the 10 yard line so two possessions both the very for field position for Ohio State still scoreless in Columbus Mercy Hospital in Toledo which is a border town dividing these two states the birthplace of both of these head coaches they're born about seven months apart Harbaugh December of 63 Myer in July of 64 Harbaugh his father was enough high school assistant coach in that area at the time and that credible Kirk pista what are the odds of that he couldn't script it right as to this mistake in anticipation of this battle in his era hardball and Urban Meyer mana state takes over at the eleventy keeper by affair at the ball hit Brandon Watson he was down covering the fun so the Wolverines punt team didn't get the down at the five on state taking over but still backed up again they sure are and running the football war with with JT Bev it's still going tempo Eric for the response on Marcus blog at tight end trying to escape it's only to the 15 to be third and six vitiate has done it all year and they're not going to get away from who they are the DNA of their defense they ask their defensive lineman to get penetration be able to slip the gap linebackers are fighting downhill and look at these corners they're walked up to the line of scrimmage they're as good protection for a time and now is Draft Michigan with the 37th sack of the season that's Ryan Glasgow Levin was able to do it blitz you bring pressure linebackers safety and then they locked you up on the outside their feeling is we're going to get to you with our pressure before your receivers can get away from our coverage and that's exactly what they did especially on third down you're looking at the best serve down defense in the country and it's because of their pressure package that they bring you pepper is trying to do what Desmond did girls what you did the only tool is green ticket went back for a touchdown against allowance a but it's so to return the punts of the senior from Australia a.m. Johnston only 11 of his months have been returned all season long why he's one of the best in the country at that position tomorrow 10 o'clock on ESPN NFL insiders all the fantasy updates all those breaking stories right to sunday NFL countdown at 11:00 up to kickoff then a buddy net football the Packers and the Eagles in Philadelphia not down begins at 6 o'clock kickoff at 8:15 also on the watch ESPN app the ability of Johnson to help nullify four field positions so huge it has that feeling it's going to be a field position game turnovers in special teams to go a long way the determine who exactly v to go over 137 Volvo and most and staples back to the near side and delivers a strike he catches me by AJ Cheston senior threw that ball right on the break the relationship they missed last week meaning state and his receivers just like the deep in the early going state by they get all the intrigue that wouldn't be able to exist the mindset he looks so wellprepared he knows where to go with the ball before the ball actually gets into his mouth hold on for a short walk temple on third down Iowa State had 12 men on the field little confusion with the tempo from Michigan and Jim Harbaugh Robert Landers the freshman was trying to run off the field and they caught it after wrinkle Kirk's strategic tempo don't often see that for Michigan's right you could do it in third until fall on the play the play results in the first down they picked the flag up but Smith did gain sufficient yardage there's a there's a mr. Buchan they played with 10 but Landers is running off the field they're thinking that they had too many on the field delivers a Explo you a tight window again to grant Perry except 9 I love to see the game when you think about the two teams running to football who didn't have better success growing I love the Jim Harbaugh putting face in first in 10 passes that's the times you want to try to attack at events and so far that's when we get inhibit you can see the rhythm in the confidence this state has in the open windows that we have to throw it and also over the short yardage specialist an lsit gets the source down the lid he'll nine touchdowns when his quickie two carries coming into the game really get you guarded carry but you can go on the hammering stander that time he doesn't move the stick or the folks here he goes down and everybody always running backs to all the work they do inside the 5yard line the hailer to the big boss here matchup problem for Ohio State and not only a matchup concern it's the ball first intent on state second Tennessee shall run watch David where we would have him be play action when he sings action he's completely out of position his eyes are in the backfield instead of on demand that we should be covering which is which is looking very 79 that's the third time before the ball first alone a little wrinkle there left to play this fertilization procedure there has we called a game in Madison we confident at first half Wisconsin had a lot of success being able to get to the edge with that jet sweep local call from RJ Shelton last week for Michigan State how to do if you can my yard plan succeed with the Ohio State defense that that is a threat and it opens up other opportunities in the fight hard leaner first down yardage Ron Baker stopped him the higher stayed inside linebackers chrome Baker and Raekwon McMillan they are going to be kept in another first down position there to be tested the physicality of this football game via the final play the hardfought first quarter histories had the better of the field position allowed state missed a field goal we are scoreless at the end of one in Columbus back after this message and a word dear local ABC station ready for the second quarter on ESPN how's the fall on ABC presented by Jared Galleria jewelry Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit Samantha ponder and Tom Rinaldi his annual collision of Midwest behemoths Michigan on the move as we begin the second quarter and inside the 10yard line they've moved it 54 yards in eight plays most of the game has been played in the Ohio State and so far empty backfield on first and goal state quickly back woopsy for the end zone a oneonone battle but against demon wept at safety no chance to make a play that is a favorable matchup from Michigan with budded sick sick 250 pounds in daemon web athletic / corner now playing safety this year 510 and 195 pounds right away they try to throw the football first at 10 and go right after that matchup but some of the Millennial islands on this roster for the powerhouse of Pickerington chris evans the true press when you mention cookies now the tailback in the eye on second and down and he's got the ball and he's going to have to escape and fight hard to get to the 5yard line there was very quick penetration there by Sam Hubbard but Evans did well to get away humma does a good job of getting off of the block but I three that I brought Evans up is because Smith Damian Smith is more physical but the play making ability the true freshman evidence is really what they need today Pepper's comes into the game on this third and goal redzone opportunities so they decide this game if they have so many others in this series a perfect quarterback if it tries to get the air gibraltars knocked down for a loss again it was hovered blowing to play up and it's fourth down Chris you're right hooker ends up getting a tackle but keep in mind Sam Hubbard in 65 255 pounds out in space against the most one of the most electric players in the country doesn't go for the fake to the inside keeps his up outside shoulder up field and gets enough of peppers while hooker eventually come in and clean it up nice play by Hubbard so it's Kenny Allen we struggled a bit early in the season that has made 10 in a row chip shot from 28 he knocks it straight through right off of the flagpole which can get Center in the goal post there you don't get extra points for that Michigan will take the three and they draw for his blood in Columbus Kirk eager to hear what the bear krispies leak has come up with the ramp but trivia question today I think this one might be mr. Herbstreit wheelhouse black the last time Michigan defeated Ohio State and Columbus was back in 2000 what jobs did Kim horrible and Urban Meyer hold during that 2000 football action know that yeah the too easy for us in a big game yeah you do one I'll do the others it's one of those weeks for you he was playing with the San Diego Chargers in urban was a wide receiver coach at Notre Dame Jim Harbaugh was last year in the NFL when he met we swapped a bet we're out it's a bear today finally Allen drives the pickup deep there will be no return lands five yards out of the end zone our mr. Polly could give us validation confirmation to officially answer that athletics really a question we asked you what two jobs an urban buyer in Jim Harbaugh Holton mm football season two for two Jim Harbaugh quarterback of the San Diego Chargers when 2015 that year Urban Meyer wide receiver coach at Notre Dame who wound up in the Fiesta Bowl that year lost to Oregon State Hall oh my god he mentioned the one in 15 he slipped that in there that was a rough season they call it quits on ya no doubt about it 15 years in the NFL quick turnaround on us wherever he has been in coaching from San Diego to Stanford at the 49ers and now of course here at Michigan never Ohio State in their first possession had better field position a lot of tempo and really an aggressive mindset last time they had the ball they kind of shut it down being pinned back deep inside their own territory freeing out last time they went to 72 yards before missing the field goal under opening possession and this is the best starting field position that had Sara option look Samuel in a backfield and dropped for a loss that was Jordan Lewis the allamerican corner making a black first look at the depth of this Michigan defense they are attacking the line of scrimmage and until Ohio State has an ability to stretch this defense look at this there's nowhere even when option football there's nowhere to go because there's so many white jersey don't close to the line second and 15 is the Weber muscling but he has shoved out about aggressively by Ben Gideon for no gain and now I'll say this is 30 degree long see right now Don Brown doesn't fear the vertical pass so he tightens up the line of scrimmage and he says we got to take away quarterback run and we got to take away the horizontal threat of the most dynamic player they have heard of Samuel you take that away Ohio State has to come up with an answer throwing the ball more downfield guys over to one third down he 14 here Barrett from the pocket to spin free David's alive fires him sidelines into heavy traffic Brown was double covered by peppers there and it's four down Marie's first junior was chasing the quarterback with Kris warmly and as a Wolverine down this is the this is the luxury from Michigan and Don Brown instead always happened to blitz you see you can get pressure with four this time it's Hurst who ends up eventually getting to JT Barrett and there's the wide receivers nobody open downfield even when JT Barrett tries to create and pull out to extend the play Ryan Glasgow Kirk got hit on a blindside block there and veteran up front there making his 32nd start today is being attended to chance to check in with Cassidy huh birth in the studio hi Cassidy has to be thanks hi Bob to check on Glasgow is able to walk off very important part of that interior defensive line for the Wolverines Kirk with Michigan again very effective on third down Ohio State they've had third and six third and eight and third and 15 that's exactly what Michigan wants and IO state with their offense and with their struggles at times and passing the football they need to stay on schedule with an athletic quarterback though third and twos and third and fours last couple drives playing right into the hands what Michigan needs to do defensively again cam Johnston the Ray Guy Award finalist called on the flip field position the last point was his 14th of 50plus yards this year gets it away it's a low boot Peppers will have a chance field it at the 30 peppers trying to escape and got it moved back into traffic and is knocked down after a short gain at the 34 yard line Michigan takes over a 53 early second quarter college football presented by Jared the Galleria of jewelry brought you by chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich and Pacific Life healthy generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years so great to relive the memories of this robbery there's Desmond our witness his sons they're known to one but then don't return for a touchdown against the Buckeyes with a beautiful call by Keith Jackson hello Heisman a quarter century ago this year you believe that 25 years ago cannot believe Canelo Michigan's had nine first downs they've thrown on five of them talked it all week about Jim Harbaugh meeting the great tendencies and he sure has done that here his first half in spate had been very sharp if another first down attempt from the pocket he delivers a high strike there kokoa Crawford the true freshman goes up and makes just his fourth catch of the season football obviously became about adjustments Ohio State staff more than likely thinking John o corn would be out here playing they've seen a team that's been very conservative the last couple weeks even in Iowa on the road when they had space to now they look like a different team they look like the team they look like before the Iowa game where they're much more aggressive and confident with their protocol roll out on second and six faith delivers an accurate throw Jensen knocked out of bounds they'll be short of a marker how about other couple weeks ago that he's really only the third play caller that Tim dread know makes most of the calls Jen fish makes the bunch in Harbaugh is third you get the feeling today the third player to come look at it al is being taken ball four these two other coaches he seems pretty hands on it it ball seems very very interesting to play calling today they did for mr. down missiny caprices they're all over pot that time he was extremely well covered by Chris Worley the linebacker for down so chick but going motion I say confident Worley as an athlete can stay with him he's out here will work with him he actually takes away the angle takes away the throwing opportunity because the tight coverage there's no where will Spade control it except try to throw it away where I'd have a chance but it's a good job of anticipating there by Chris Worley the junior at equipment first 3 and alpha hila state's defense has been able to force and any ala no handle all the kicking duty delivers a very high punt bounces beautifully for that coverage team and once again Jade Seah Barrett at Ohio State will be pinned back at the 4 huge parts of this game we talked about of the open it's going to be field position special team that turnovers another great job by Michigan here let's take a look at we've got you covered and fronted by Jiffy Lube it's really about the Michigan defense and what they've been able to do Mike Lecrae by the way his dad was a captain at Ohio State all over the Ohio State run game Ohio State feels like the quarterback run can be a threat Don Brown the defensive coordinator for Michigan feels like he has to have one extra hat in the box so far early in this game Michigan doing a good job of containing the Buckeyes running game and now for the third time out of their four drives that they've had to start this game they start inside their own 11 line to make John by Kenny Allen the front over the 55 yard punt that time at hitting yardage would be huge today now will they break out of their plate calling shell back to heaven so far predictable but often very effective quarterback keeper they're able to muscle for just a couple yards and peppers who's in on the tackle and pepper said this week we're going to hit it and we're going to hit him hard we're going to see how he responds because he hasn't been hit the way he'll be hit by a Michigan defense he's a great way of avoiding direct hits doesn't even show this Derby guy but nobody really seems to lower the boom on him now I think it's his running style and he just has that innate ability to avoid that big collision from the pocket plan man Samuel that was airmail by JD Eagle too much adrenaline and it's third and long again I think there's a tendency with the way this game is starting you get a big chance at a big opportunity he hurried his throw and effected inaccuracy he's got him wide open to our left to his right I mean wide open he talked about getting separation finally on Ohio State receiver that's the matchup they want her to Samuel against Thomas he was open but I think he could be standing on his own goal line he buried the throw and it affects his action accuracy empty backfield the Greens not showing pressure on this third down a rush for Barrett gets it out and the catch is made that done by dontre Wilson has been trying to fight through an injury he's short and we're going to spot him where he caught the ball so it is a first down at the 15 surprise that Michigan gave the cushion to Ohio State dontre Wilson they've had such success getting up into the face the ohio state receivers making them work to get open this time dontre Wilson nobody takes them at the line of scrimmage he's able to settle right at the first down marker try to lean across to get it Jess was able to twist three and break the plane there so Ohio State converts for the first time on third down today Samuels in the backfield goes in motion Barrett looking the other direction is chase but gets around over the middle to Brown who is knock down another push down across the 25 great job is sticking with his throw by JT Barrett watch out he wants to initially make this throw to the right right there he's already hoping but instead of giving up on it he continues to lessen receiver or a dangerous throw late over the middle but there was such room there he makes the right call to give Noah Brown a chance for the throw around a big physical target of about 220 pounds Berek case back for a second time taco Charlton the senior came off the edge in seventh of the season the center Pat L Klein has to work all the way out here to try to stop Charlton who's one of the better pass rushers in the Big Ten these guys are both from Pickering pen and suburb here in the Columbus area I give you an idea taco Charlton and 675 pounds and a big athlete they're now batted down betadine at the line by Maurice first jr. a Michigan front which has been so impulsive long after its way so far for the last two plays they sure have saw the rush by Charlton and this time her so I think might be the best athlete up front especially in the interior he's had to battle through some injuries throughout his career at 62 282 pounds they've been using him on Twitter now with another twist and good recognition a time off when to get his hand up and knock that ball down McCann Barrett produced here on third and 16 good protection looks it off short trying to get it Samuel he was well covered they're not an easy match you for a linebacker Mike McCready good job that time for down obviously it's going to be going to be topped for Ohio State to try to get those chances but Paris Campbell this is going to be something they're going to want to look back on Ohio State needing to get the ball thrown downfield this time I don't know if it broke in coverage if he would have been able to recognize him and just put that ball up in the air Parris Campbell who might be their fastest receiver had a chance to get behind the coverage Johnson's been busy Tommy Ozzie picked up at backspin effort makes the fair catch at the 40 yard line but a tale of field position in this first half the field very much tilted in favor of the maize and blue don't take over at the 40 watching two versus three here number for Clemson live from Death Valley against South Carolina on ESPN this evening Tigers have secured their spot in the SEC championship game next week but need that win to stay in the playoff on Bennett's the Seminoles and the Gators 8 o'clock Eastern on ABC so Michigan back to work from the 40yard line Harbaugh this play calling triumvirate had the comfort of being in good field position for most of these drives unlike Ohio State State has been sharp whereas Evans the freshmen the dogs traffic in the backfield gets away from it milling but me put a blue to play up Raekwon McMillan is is the leader kind of the glue of that defense has been facing so many threat attack this is a game where he welcomes the challenge of how Michigan runs the football right at him and he's going to have to come up with a bunch of tackles today Ohio State could have continued to play well on defense peppers back in the game Curt lined up the Wildcat quarterback on second and nine get make an impact play on offense when it's right up into traffic Ohio State's been preparing for what they've seen what they haven't seen from Michigan involving number five it's almost as if Jim Harbaugh is setting something up for later down the road with two real Peppers it's almost as if he's baiting them into thinking run run with five run with five and at some point Jim Harbaugh was going to put that same look in and he's going to go back to peppers and ask him to throw the football that had to feel kind of a throwaway way and it sets a 137 for space there's the train formation bata Run State High School in Colorado they try to keep the defense guessing in terms of the personnel big hit down for the first time Jerome Baker on the set and number three nursing that sore left shoulder goes to the ground the first time we keep talking about Michigan lifting on third down Ohio State moves to nose guard shoots Baker up the middle and the right guard Kahless does not do a good job of recognizing that and coming down it's a bust in the middle and that offensive line and it's a good call by Luke Bickle to time that up on third down faith didn't have a chance you can see through quarterback credit protect himself turning his back to the back to keep that left shoulder protected and I want to take too many shots like that he's a tough guy but that children did not be 100% right so why the Saints defense forcing the second consecutive tree and half the question remains what it was coming in what about this ohio state often sat at times in penn state asking against Michigan State in the snow has struggled I think everything has as much to do with the field position early in this game is anything Urban Meyer has had a tendency all year with his offense that when he gets backed up inside his own territory its ultra ly conservative and I think their average starting field positions known 12 yard line had a lot to do with how they have called the game and give Michigan and Jim Harbaugh a lot of credit they have decided to be much more aggressive better field position but with Wilton spate but I told you it's a game of adjustments Luke's pick for the Ohio State defense after the first couple drives they seem to settle down and now they're getting after spate in this Michigan offense is close for him people keep talking about him is before head any Allen has been terrific he just gets this punt off in the jet stream look at that thing this time it bounces into the end zone so Ohio State will be very happy not to be pinned back inside their 10yard line to Tom Rinaldi Chris local Spade came off he shoot away anyone trying to pay any attention to him for the first big hit he's really taken in this game picked up the phone to talk to the coaches upstairs and let's lose the stream of exploded to give you an idea of just how invested he is frustrated at the lack of protection there but certainly invested and seems to be solid after taking that first big hit you've got an update on injury on the Ohio State offensive side yeah JP Barrett obviously looking for guys to get separation one of the reasons he may not be getting that is Marcus bog playing her couple drives ago he injured that right angle on that busted option play he's definitely nowhere near 100% on keep an eye on you sure is because he could be a very effective athletic receiver and a matchup problem where is / Samuel Ben remember to break free at the nice first time use your right the playmaker the top receiver and on the seam by far yes the only three carries so far and only one reception for one yard you know Ohio State's at some point they're going to go they're going to dial him up right now they've got to be the slide need Webber again going to be stopped a yard short of the first down Bryan Monet offensive tackle midfoot that ball injuries and Sandy just reported on it's not only big and hip trying to get separation to be a factor in the pass game but also he is a very important part of being able to try to control that defensive line of Michigan's and be able to run the poker finally votes whatever morrow for a Grand Forks whoever the hit behind the line in rock Mon a backtoback big play so that Wolverine front its fourth era where they go just attacked Isiah French the right tackle from Ohio State what a good job by Monet watch him just push French right back into the backfield right there 59 right in the middle of the screen he makes that play single handily by just getting off the ball getting low and having that led tries the boss the offense comes up big again on 30 short Johnson gets the punning and here comes the flag net will produce the first down even if it's not a personnal panel of five yard to be enough to put Ohio State's offense back on the field Mike McCrae the line back to ran into him pretty good running into the kicker got the other number nine yeah grandparents always find resist well get frame to the proper guy Harry trying to kind of slow himself down he's on the edge there he did literally can't stop himself runs right into the punter and he knew right away keeps this drive alive for Ohio State after the big stop by Bryan Monet they're on third down and short Buckeyes up on 25 plays 882 yards for barely three yard to play looking for Samuel there he is in the slot to the right there is what using his left and misfires her Marcus BA JT what to you would you diagnose is the issue for him so far throwing the ball I think it's a variety of things I think it's a group effort it's fast protection it's the receivers being able to get into their matchups one on one to be able to win and the other thing is it's just him settling down I think he's a bit just uncomfortable right now with with the plan and with his accuracy he looks like he's rushing he doesn't look like he didn't rhythm it all in the pasture at this point they're at five for ten just 40 yards he's trying to get Samuel on the edge but Ben Gideon's sniffed it out another third and long think Gideon sniffed it out but Mike McRae contained the plain horse get back to the inside okay Don Brown has these guys out in he basically told us this week listen they've got number twenty five and number four and number 16 if we do a job on those three we're going to win this game make somebody else besides Curtis a mule Mike Webber and JT Barrett beat you it's important to claw is ailing if the tight end is a guy that could make a play on third and nine now Barrett from the pocket delivers again looking for Samuel incomplete that time it was Delano a hilled of safety who drew that assignment and here's a good one another miscommunication this passing game of Ohio State so Samuel eventually works the cross here but JT Barrett I think is except one receiver in the quarterback have to be on the same page he's expecting Samuel to continue to work across Samuels working back to the quarterback a bit of a miscommunication pretty tight coverage there by Hill as well peppers involved in coverage now back to receive this punt from Johnson Wolverine's don't get near him this time this is an excellent pitch pepper his punches to go over his head lay the hit on one of the coverage guys but Ohio State their turn to pit michigan deep as johnston does what he has all season long for 10 before halftime on the Wolverines will go back to work up 53 as we take a look at tonight's 18 chief inside access and this is one of the features of this rivalry the countdown clock starts it 365 it'll be will tonight this was in the final day yesterday yes it's always been important to both these programs and seen Urban Meyer even Jim Tressel started that with the countdown clock yearround countdown clock Michigan the same emphasis with Jim Harbaugh with Erwin would he love this we've seen some excellent hunting both sides so far this is a Zippo and 49 degrees right now Davion Smith lined up in his end zone they fake it to him state gets to throw away intercepted and it intersects it's the Ohio State defense the lead just walks in for a gutsy call by Jim Harbaugh playaction pass which is worth mostest game at this time back deep into his own territory Ohio State brought pressure they brought their linebackers so hooker comes up with a pick for the guys on the ball but the two linebackers Baker and Raekwon McMillan constant six picks for hooker leave the team and their seven six six of the season threw for him miss villain provided the pressure and just like that Ohio safe after a pretty dismal first half offensively takes the lead with the defensive touchdown and bring the two linebackers Baker has already walked off McMillan's who ends up getting to the quarterback but watch the running back and Smith how unclear he is and what to do here ends up getting the pressure hookers right here with his eyes on the quarterback the ball gets goes up in the air and there's hooker who's been doing it all year is his third interception for a touchdown seventh throw hiyo states this year and again we talked at the beginning special teams turnover margin that's what ultimately going to decide this game and the Buckeyes capture a huge break here so a risky call by Harbaugh and Michigan backfires McMillan got there LeBron and his Cavalier teammates dancing down there the end zone this is his first experience in Columbus for this rivalry it's a bucketlist day for LeBron the Cavs are always clowning around whether it's their celebration or here in Columbus now watching the buck out they watch the guys score touch centers a tremendous basketball player for his first sport he thought he could have been a halogen player at a very very high level before shifting over to football he has now the career Ohio state record for pick sixes and he's been all this year with three of them and the horse she is alive again now the goalline estates the floor and Jibreel peppers has a line down the sideline has to spin free that allows a pursuit to catch him that was the kicker Tyler Durban who saved the touchdown by getting in peppers way but we always talk about bigtime players making big plays and big games and that's exactly what he does watch his jump cut to his right right there all these Ohio State defenders gives him a chance for that jump cut to get me outside almost catches a break pretty good effort there by the kicker to come over and cause him to go back to the inside but peppers give Michigan huge starting field position after the interception for a touchdown 45 yards impact way man sauce evidence cuts it back and the true question is about 200 pounds stop by Hubbard that's his face and that kind of bounce back from that that decision of that throw now I think the equity thing he has in this season I think it allows him to mentally put that behind him and move forward I think this were early in the year the first time starter you can start to doubt yourself and what's happening but their plan has been pretty effective he's got to put that behind him and now just try to execute move the football was openly promoted this year by the Michigan offense the fifth interception if not beaten themselves that's a tight grow Darbo makes a diving catch out near midfield short gain it'll be third down a lot like Ohio State Michigan even though they they've been affected as far as the accuracy it's a heck of an effort there by Garbo to make the catch and he had a 15 but for only 95 yards too much like Michigan's defense doesn't fear Ohio State throwing downfield the same thing that Ohio State's to us they've really tightened up their coverage today don't fear the fewer 7/3 down so far for the Wolverines they need six my guys rush for the faders flushed and now delivers a strike and coming back to the football was Darb only moved the six to the 40 that is a great job of keeping the play alive I will Wilton state see the pressure again Baker almost it's to him he flushes him Hubbard ends up coming up with a hit after the throw but give Garbo elan and credit as well recognizes his quarterbacks in trouble work back to the football to give him an open receiver to throw to first and handoff the spin we've been impressed by how nimble spake convey is 660 is a big 240 pounder but he evades the pressure so well almost in the same vein that a Ben Roethlisberger would do or a Jameis Winston here at Florida State big guys aren't really going to do it with their sudden quickness but they do have a natural field and ability to pull away and anticipate that pressure by action on second down fate retreats it's a screen and Smith makes the first man miss will be knocked down by three Mike Jones short a couple of yards away for the marker on third down now maybe there was a boot screen last week early in the game from Michigan State to wit the LJ Scott it was a huge game it has not been a huge screen team this year but they have seen something last week that they wanted to try to exploit Ohio State does a good job of keeping them from getting becoming a first down arranging borderline field goal range for Alan meeting a couple of yards here roll out and a pro far side and wide open making the catch there is grant Perry who has been involved in this first half this is like a twopoint when you know you use this play where you take the man in motion and you use the two receivers that are lined already on that side and they just kind of run a slow route in man coverage and they create a pick for a rub so the man is coming in motion he just times up the snap and easily is able to get to the outside see that a lot teams that are trying to go for two and Perry only had nine catches all season come again feature to this first half three catches 14 a final minute laughing in space over the middle in the traffic catch made by Darbo and the Wolverines knocking on the door there's the first intent playaction pass from space what that does prison to get some linebackers up and it gives him a better throwing lane to be able to get over top of the linebackers this time he didn't even have to do that how about the concentration hair by Garbo to come up with that catch 19 yards and an excellent job by the quarterback bouncing back from a horrendous play to give Ohio State the lead here it moved the Wolverines 48 yards into scoring position nobody take a timeout the combination of the kickoff return by peppers and Jim Harbaugh having confidence in his quarterback and saying don't worry about that pick six put the ball right back in his hands let him execute the offense and come up with some big throws there's the throw again the garb all higdon drought took Raekwon McMillan out these receivers they played a lot of football Garbo and Cheston they have been around in Ann Arbor heard all week about 43 seniors on this team they've never beaten Ohio State sarva one of the most improved players on this team was really chested it was the featured guy last year was the team MVP for Michigan in 2015 but Darbo working so hard in the offseason has become a real force for this offense stand read mark van Mack Brown the half one half timer for 58 seconds away get down into this area you always have to think about Jake but if Wilkins fate is the quarterback and they end up going to peppers there's always that Wildcat package as well a lot of moving pieces for the Wolverine offense with the best defense in the country in goal to go situations for Ohio State of course and throw Garba making the catch a fly it comes out after the pass was delivered they've been Hansen to face me Jim Harbaugh is Ryan I think is both of the Ohio State player ended the Michigan player have folks had their hands up in the face personal foul hands to the face defense the Marine e6 automatic first down you got dream on Jones about guys first penalty of the afternoon bredesen the left guard 74 against 86 Jones both these guys are freshmen to right away they're both both kind of have their hands up at Jones definitely the call pretty almost took that helmet off that's worth to the to finally moves in a yard closer horsten go men Gaffney Ohio native fun down for no games barbell not necessarily feeling the urgency yet as we get down to 30 seconds still two timeouts not clock organ see but urgency to find the 45 I thought he's got his eyes on his clock he wants him to snap the ball here he's all the way down to 15yard line enough inside pull back fighting he'll doesn't get in and now the clock's ticking down at 10 seconds Michigan will have to spend that second time out it'll be bird and very shortly he was working his way down to the 15 down to the 10 just in case hill did not get into the end zone well this play has been great all year fate pushes him then watch you'll see him get involved remembers you can push your ball carrier into the end zone but they don't scarlet jerseys not letting he'll get to the goal line you can push but you can't pull but there was no push happening there Ohana they set up a Scarlet wall across that goal line and this play feels enormous it's Michigan going to shake off the pick6 reclaim the lead going into halftime can Ohio State force the short field goal attempt wraps and what do you call here you know the testosterone the history of this rivalry pure power football so often on display I'll take another crack at the center of the line well what's ironic and sees both these teams pride themselves on goal line situations in spring football they work on goal line a lot of teams work on twominute offense spread attack these teams pride themselves on goal line their offenses in their defense isn't outfitting at a pivotal moment in this game with ten seconds left in the first half we've got a third and goal inside the one yard all the sweat and the hammer away in the practice field building for this moment whistles before the snap Ohio State will spend a time out Luke fickle walking all the way down there spotting something for the staff any dewpoint we get too much time out by Ohio State their second hioh state wanted to get the look whether it was the turbot Cabrillo peppers kind of Wildcat package with the potential of like a chuck pass or if it was in fact that more powerful look for the iformation now you wonder if Jim Harbaugh says okay now they know that look let's go to a different book or they stick with that power set it's a Michigan offense it's rushed for 39 touchdowns this year that's the most in the power five the Buckeyes have only allowed four rushing touchdowns and the running game so far today really hasn't been their permission group it's been the passing game so what do you think the hole is here only 30 yards so far running the football but still you think you're being a senior DNA to win with that look inside the 1 yard line if you get cute and try to go into playaction pass and fake the bulk up the middle are balls all the way down to the two yard line now at the top of the screen Faulk in the official probably telling him about hey listen I got one timeout and some eyes on me if they don't store I guess did you get the ball on a hill and ran in front it right up the middle the bill number 80 smooth this to his left it goes about 265 pounds no one is lined up farther than about five yards from the football Gilligan your power football muscles input amazing blue and Michigan reclaims the lead six seconds before half time and it gets feisty down there look out all those big bodies colliding and separate flaring go get mean Michigan Jim Harbaugh was out there he's involved trying to get guys off the field his reaction said it all I mean it's not just a touchdown to get Michigan the lead it's an attitude the michigan prides itself on now with Jim Harbaugh a head coach Matt a suit and a big body as Hill runs for his eighth oneyard line gets his tenth rushing touchdown touchdown the vulture the hammering Panda we're going to play the tiger point whatever you want to call it means found a way to have a 54 yard drive set up by a 45 yard kickoff return by peppers Kenny Allen has made a big impact in his first half as a punter out of the hold of Garrett Moore's is a finalist for the feat more tell award for the holder of the year one of the three finalists as you'd expect from a more tell finalist to get the gun perfectly as States trying to get the lowest man wins and it's tough to slow down Hill who has success all year with this play 263 pounds lowers his shoulder I say tried to shoot their linebackers right into this hole here nice block by the big fullback Poggi also to open that up touchdown run that Bo Schembechler would appreciate looking down at this one and Speight answers some things about that the drive following the big mistakes the interception for a touchdown all the Sun the momentum of the crowd back in the game favored and Ohio State the big kickoff return by Jabril peppers to give them very very good starting field position at their own 46 and Wilton spades led a great Drive at great if you said a great reaction and answer to that pick six space 15 of 20 in this first half you look at the yardage totals Michigan has more than doubled up Ohio State the Buckeyes with just 83 total yards on their 28th plays and yes your position has been a big factor but so has the inability of the passing game to be effective at all it's been it kind of been a bit of a reoccurring thing for Ohio State when they've gotten in trouble in some games teams have kind of challenged him saying that hey until you prove that you can get separation get the ball thrown downfield we're going to try to just walk everybody up to the line of scrimmage take away your short passes and take away your run again take a look at the PlayStation rankings here these teams at 2 &amp; 3 Ohio State trying to win and then wait and watch what happens in Happy Valley when the Lions take on Spartans Michigan can clinch the division by and winning and state sitting there at number 7 Wisconsin's already secured a spot in that Big Ten championship game before the battle for the axe with Minnesota they figure to just take a knee here in the final play of what's been a frustrating first half with this one guy offense so Michigan's defense space efficiency hunting the Wolverines March down and take a 107 lead at the break Samantha coach obviously they get it in on the ground there but they've been doing a lot of their work through the air so where do you see most opportunity to make an adjustment defensively well we just got to get every time we get pressure on we play well so go get more pressure on the quarterback offensively how in your mind can JP and this offense get into a rhythm that you're looking for we've been backed up for for the five series we started our own inside our 10 yard line we just get the hell out of there and then start playing a little bit so I get a little field position time great bear with just 57 yards of total offense in the first half Michigan's been a great first half team the best in college football Tom Rinaldi will get Harbaugh's take and have that report right after these messages 10:7 Wolverines at the Horseshoe halftime report from Michigan their 40th rushing touchdown of the season for the Wolverines they have the lead on Ohio State at the half we heard from Urban Meyer Tom Rinaldi spoke with Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh just a minute ago Stan had the fan had the chance to walk with him as he and his team made their way up the ramp asked him when did he know that will the state would be the starter and he said he watched him get better and better throughout the week of practice after the final week after the final practice rather he told spate and the team state would be the man to start the game pleased with him obviously aside from that interception as for his defense most pleased with their ability to squeeze the field and contain the perimeter really taking away the other threat but most importantly he said a long way to go in this game hoping we can maintain the defensive intensity we've shown so far great feeling he said when we punched it in at the end of the half stand alright Tom thanks a game dominated by defense so far the Wolverines with the lead welcome in Capital One halftime report stands Arendt along with Mack Brown and mark make guys which jumped out at you in the first half beau and witty would be proud let's block get each other out they've got the personalities of their coaches right it's a defensive game it's a special teams game but quarterbacks are going to make the difference in this game first you look at spate early they haven't been able to run the ball he steps up under pressure he hits Jake button for a big first down on the crossing route then you've got a couple of slants but pulls the safety out of the way and then he throws to the receiver behind him very accurate because we didn't even think that Wilton Speight was going to play and then playaction safety bites very accurate looks like he still got a little bit of motion issues with his arm mark but he's throwing the ball down than a mistake protection mistake he had to throw the ball he's in the backfield but interception for the touchdown I think that's what seven or eight for Ohio State's a pick six is this year so they've been playing great defense but I think mark we've got a great football game that's even going to get better the second half we're going to talk to two more defense very physical on both sides of the ball but particularly the Michigan defense what they're able to do to the Ohio state office on third down here is third and a watch this Michigan defense go after quarterback JT Barrett they swarm to the football look at the defenders get to him where he's got to run it out of bounds he can't throw it down the field vertically they get third and 14 quarterback JT Barrett again nice pushed by the front four of the Michigan defensive line putting pressure on JT Burt where he's got to scramble out again throws the ball away then again third and 16 this is not what you want your office to be in third along situation again great coverage downfield by the Michigan defense this is what you want defensively before the Ohio State offense seven times third down six yards or more six of those times they couldn't convert but there's two key the one time they had it third and short mmhmm they lost a yard it was third and one they got knocked back a little fourth and two jebel peppers a big part of the defensive effort for Michigan he does so many things for the Wolverines here's what he's done in the first half of course had that big kick return right that definitely helped we talked about to reel this entire week and the way that you needed those hidden yards not only hidden yards he would be a key factor in this game whether it be on offense defense for special teams and on that return put it in great position in special teams coach neither one of these teams can run the ball right now Michigan tried it 20 times for 43 yards think Ohio State 17 performing for 30 yards Ohio State's at 43 so it's going to be quarterback play and who takes care of the ball the best the second half points are a premium in this game you take them you can get them if it's fourth and four don't go for it if you're inside the 20 go ahead and kick it well and Ohio State's already missed fill go Michigan made one so that may be a huge factor at the end of the scan so big stakes in this game Michigan goes to the Big Ten title game with a win Ohio State needs a win and a Penn State loss to get there so big day on the field this halftime report is brought to you by the Quicksilver card from Capital One earn unlimited 1.5% cash back every purchase everywhere all right coach secondhalf adjustments well what you've got to do is try to get the quarterback on the on the corner if you're JT baguette even make some plays downfield hop it's got to get the surgeon down situations where six or less with five and less or four or less not third mate clause all right second half coming up you're watching the pulpy lewd rivalry series we are set for the second half at Ohio Stadium welcome back to ESPN college football at ABC presented by Jared the gallery of jewelry and this presentation of the Big Ten on ABC the visitors from up north protecting a 107 lead here a first half of a shaped by field position and dominated by Michigan Chris Fowler back with Kirk Herbstreit Wolverines don't have a run longer than nine yards a couple past play is about 20 yards but our first half stats brought to you by Garmin you see on this side Ohio State Kirk they ran 20 plays after that opening drive of the missed a field goal gained a total of 19 yards in this place and you heard Urban Meyer walking off with Sam under mentioning the field position had a lot to do with his approach was a play caller they were averaging 3rd and 9 in that first half I think it's because of a very conservative approach even the passing game it was more short intermediate throws they didn't attempt one pass over 15 yards Kurtis Samuel had had one reception for one yard Michigan doing a great job at defending Ohio State of JP Barrett's most explosive weapon you know at halftime both sides are making adjustments for Ohio State they're trying to figure out how can they get their playmaker more involved Speight right there you saw him number three a somewhat surprising starter in his condition with the left shoulder a wellkept secret has been very evicted he made the biggest mistake of the first half the pick6 finally cooker but he cooked that off and the very effective in the wolverine touchdown drive i said get the pole to begin this second half allen has been driving his kickoffs deep and preventing any chance to return and he does so again how does our Pacific what game summary kind of been a type of game that a lot of us thought we would see lowscoring field position great defense from really from both sides Michigan and sac JP Barrett three times Curtis angle it's been bottled up big thing for Ohio State they've got pressure here Raekwon McMillan led to an interception and the only touchdown for the Buckeyes is hooker took it in and if Michigan has paid credit they responded by driving the length of the field getting the ball into the end zone for a touchdown to give them this 107 lead cannot overstate the contrast between last year's matchup and the first half so far with this battle between the Michigan front and the Ohio State offense start this game with Samuel now in the backfield they move Mike Weber move him out of the backfield down here got a hurry and that play keeper by their they were very lucky just got it off before the play clock expired Ben's Gideon makes the tackle and John Brown is saying that we're going to always have one more in the box for quarterback run they have eight guys up at the line of scrimmage to take away either Samuel or the threat of JT Barrett makes it very very tough on JT Barrett to be a threat in the quarterback run game first true here for Brown did a terrific job coordinating the defense at Boston College of finals for the Broyles Award as the top assistant in the country there is a completion over the middle it's been hard to get the ball to Marcus ball is playing through some ankle pain peppers on the coverage foot down 65 255 going up against peppers who is a great player but undersized trying to match up with a big tight end and you can see the ball despite the ankle that Sam reported on still doing a good job of getting separation when the first time the JT Baris had a receiver that's pulling away from a Michigan defender makes it a lot easier to throw the ball it's a weber Barrett from the pocket faces first downfield shot Noah proud is down there broken up by scribbling at the last minute he's slow to get up but it's a rhythmic play about the senior let's hope he's able to get up that's where his length comes into play say he'll get up looks like that left shoulder it's kind of stretching that arm out that's actually the left hand he extended himself to keep the ball away from Noah Brown we 6 2 they've listed at 175 watch how he goes up into the air ball thrown on on the money but a great lastsecond effort there by Stribling there's that link he needed every ounce of that length to be able to knock the ball away from Brown but Ohio State here early better field position more aggressive with their approach offensive Lee finally a down field shot Brandon Watson replacing scribbling at the corner position stand here in the nearside matched up against Campbell Barrett looks the other direction off the hands of Samuel intercepted by peppers lookout peppers with a ball in his hand electric fun down as a 43 but a high fro produces Barrett's first interception in the last six games he actually had Curtis Samuel here the ball is thrown high which forces the ball to go up into the air little ball fake little playaction fake keep the linebackers in he got hit right as he threw the ball may have affected the accuracy the ball that's why it may be sail on him a little bit high good pressure there by Chris normally the senior out of Toledo the dangerous play there I don't think he intentionally went low but definitely impacted the throw ball goes off the hands of Sam Ewing there's the playmaker peppers with a big interception just the fifth bit grown by Barrett at the first since the Wisconsin game Wolverines find the build elite take over at the 42 bay from an empty backfield flips it short and the catch is made by tight end but then a favorite target this afternoon defeat Macmillan they move to six but almost his den pits like an option round like a basketball move here watch him feel peppers won't watch him work to the middle he's kind of looking over his shoulder this way no we're going to go back that way there's the relationship coming into play again between faith and the veteran Jake plot by the official sucking down the kids on the passing lane open there's Evans in the game of the iformation hands it off and Evans does that shake and that acceleration on the first down gain of about seven Tom Chris you want to know the emotion in this game the reaction are Jabril peppers after making an interception came over the bench jumped up turned his back to the field faced the crowd maybe Oh H and oh oh it's a no gesture never appreciated but even for play like that in a game like this and peppers know is but if you remember forever be part of the victory over Ohio State been set for a long time easy to games he planned these this driver is what people remember he watched the game Charles Woodson made so many big plays in 97 that's when he fell in love with Michigan living his green today the kicker permit set up the touchdown on the interception on third and short miss get free get this baby not Smith rumbling down inside the 10 yard line that's his best one of the afternoon Iowa State pinched it pinched inside good block by Wheatley and then but leaves around to the outside Ohio State loses contain anticipating an inside run and that's where the play was designed to go with the vision of Smith bouncing that to the outside for a few jars got 16 ago miss again X is way up the middle lowers the head knock down at the one yard line by hooker Michigan threatening to stretch this lead now off the interception was great patience by Smith allowed the blocks kind of a little counter play let the pullback in the polling guard get around instead of hurrying it and running into potential penetration from the defensive line because patient they allowed him to come around to the left to the right finally reporting on the briefs getting to feel it over there the group that was blown out at home last year by Ohio State one building space and now it's scrum at the two yardline Buckeyes are pointing their way and they have it a turnover that could turn around this game as spate fumble the exchange and Hamilton makes the recovery Jim Harbaugh has got to be so frustrated one thing as a quarterback when the right cards rolling around there's a tendency to want to pull out a little son looks like he actually had his hands on the football it wasn't as if he was pulling out too early ball just never quite who's never quite able to secure it you can see a great effort there by Devon Hamilton the freshman the winds up coming up with a football second turnover for spate they only had eight all season coming in you have that let's go to injury it can be tricky taking it snap sometimes get example who knows that that's a factor it hasn't been a factor all game I just think you get down inside a 5yard line linemen are polling and you're trying to get the ball out and that's why you're seeing here in center right now Cole talked about guys been back in Auto field positions Varrick spins for a few yards he did take the down field shot unsuccessful later they begin to open things up there's going to have to have to if you throw the ball it's quick plant it's a quick game you get the ball out quickly rolling in the end zone just have to avoid the sack and the safety as rashon Gary the true freshman was in his face one of those highly touted recruits in the country and came down to Clemson at Michigan and last day watch his effort here to work through two guys Webber and Prince I think because he got by them I don't even know if JT Barrett could see him instantly he did his face and he gets rid of the football that's the call here now and third and long that inside the five empty backfield Bryn's rush board Barrett steps up delivers catch made by KJ Hill for a first down a clutch kitchen Castro hi Oh state I'm very very surprised they have oh hi Oh state pen back deep in their own territory the press coverage has given Ohio State a problem look at the cushion look at that cushion on third down that they decided to give up to KJ Hill and JT Barrett says thanks you very much the win against some tendencies didn't bring pressure didn't play man now Weber who's had a tough go of it the guy at a Detroit comes in highly motivated Hitchens been able to get free at all Michigan their strength has been not just a pressure package it's been getting up into the faith in the Ohio State wide receivers and really challenging them to try to get down field and it's affected the timing between the receivers and JT Baird they're on a big third down they decide to give them soft coverage and they were able to execute it bring the pressure on second nine Barrett immediately has flux out and fires incomplete to brown Mike McCrae from his linebacker position was there in a hurry they continue to get after him but continues to be a challenge for these receivers to separate from the coverage the tight coverage it talked about the one pass down feel this one pass off to the left where they challenged them downfield beyond 15 yards everything else is short rows and it makes it a lot easier on a defense but you don't have to worry about that vertical passing game like there's an empty backfield is looking across it Michael McCrea spy on this third and 10 from the pocket delivers high Weber Mexica she's immediately driven back by Delano Hill and Michigan forces another pun Delano Hill max matched up man to man on the running back Mike Weber who inflect out and that if the fact that you talked about Iowa State trying to use a rubber out hoping that he'll would get caught up in it but he came clean easily able to make the tackle for the first down whoever hadn't even landed when the prey arrives to make the hit Pepper's 135 and constant takes off on a bank and doesn't get there Urban Meyer said it efficient showed that formation they might think it what a gamble it backfires as jordan glasgow tackles the punter he told me hey you and i that there's a look that they came that no matter what happens at any point in the game if they give him that look he's going to call it i said what if you're in your own 20yard line you're still going to call it consider if they give us the look I'm going to call it the 5x2 luck only two guys so one side of the center Michigan was painted in that look and this guy can run this Aussie but boy Wolverine from ready for that yes Sam Hubbard is able to sustain his block and I think it's a totally different story I think they're able to pick up that first down but Urban Meyer rolls the dice they pay the price man so forth then carry fun let's go fight muscles ahead for about five this really eventually grabbed him well those Gamble's make you look like a genius when they work dirt but my role perhaps question himself this back thank you he will look at that and see when he goes back it diplay is actually there if Sam hundred is able to make that block a defensive player has to make a big block in that situation peppers in the game and Wildcat quarterback he's all the way again knocked down has it been a productive formation of them at all Raymond Jones was there go back through the effort here by hover against Glasgow class goes to the good job of getting off to that block but you can see the other blocks are there if all the credit to Jordan last to the salt for who had to block punts last week for coming up with another big play this comes on yes to the Glasgow brothers all three walked on a Michigan Graham was in the NFL why and of course we've seen him on the offensive important like an acute play what will bring deep five on third down it's rid of it and a first down completion the borrowed Garbo inside the pen that is great anticipation in a great feel by jordan Spade he knows the pressures coming he knows he's got to get rid of the ball Nick Bose is right in his face he throws that ball well before Garbo even turns around that's when the hours of practice in June and July the summit on seventh thrilled that you do with your receivers you'll develop a rhythm and timing they're perfectly on display in the world reason a goal to go situation State Dumbo's as he reaches back to hand it off to Smith who gets just a yard it's been difficult to execute down here they were able to muscle it in just before halftime Kurt with him we saw on the fumbled exchange and he almost tripped there and we'll see lucky to get the ball off before his knee touched good effort there to get the ball into the hands of Smith you can see just gets her the ball most cost it into the hands of Smith it you're out down here has been tough sledding like it's been for most teams against Ohio State inside the 10yard line they've been very good preventing him from getting into the end zone Ilyn Smith in the backfield with spate drops back looks in the flat and delivers it hit it cooks down Collett Hill has been a power runner all season long makes his second touchdown reception and Michigan capitalizes on the failed big pond slide the big fella out of the backfield the linebacker Chris Worley is late and getting out there maybe not anticipating and thinking that the ball would be thrown out into the flat and he'll Chris 265 pounds has soft hands it is very athletic and has been doing that all year Allen has the conversion this is what set it up so that they practiced and planned for but did not execute well enough Johnston tackle by Glasgow couple of yards short the marker very short field for Michigan and kiloton Hill says I'm not just a power runner I get to my soft hand I can make some catches 217 seven rivalries in primetime as well Death Valley the emotions senior night for any chance

Twitter and highlighting the performance of the week and after a holiday weekend Thanksgiving how about Washington yesterday in the Apple Cup 45 to 17 emphatic win over the Cougars in that rivalry game and eleven win of his 11th win of the season to me it sets the table up and if they win the vac Bowl title I think they're going to get into playoffs Santa Clara Friday is the championship game in the pac12 against either Colorado tonight arrestee Buckeyes now facing that 10point deficit midway third quarter in need of a big play a spark and Samuel provided gets the edge climbed down after a nine yard gain before Hill stopped him he may be the guy he's going to have to be the guy and he's not had as many touches as we thought we would see I think you're going to start to see them hit him the football he has one reception at this point a game and only five carries six touches overall thank you and I and maybe a lot of people watching this game feeling this is a pivotal point this game Iowa State down ten with the way their offense has played for a young football team this is where they need to step up and try to really have a big drive there is each that they had Webber and Samuel in the backfield with JP bulldozes for a first out of the 40 pretty good movement up front the few times we have seen a good push Jamarcus Jones the left Akal is opened that up and gave JT Barrett plenty of room for that first down when you start to run the ball it starts to set up potential play action shots or you can throw the ball behind the safety timeout by Ohio State is at this point in last year's game when the Buckeye has just began to impose themselves it was long touchdown drive after long touchdown drive against this Wolverine front a lot of the same veteran players are out there today rest in white uniforms charge timeout Ohio State and Dave khatai may want to come in here Cory Smith the receiver didn't have his mouthpiece in it was up on his face mask and the official right here in the Ohio State sideline saw it and caught I think he said that's we're going to charge Ohio State with the timeout well exactly the rule is a mouthpiece is piece of required equipment and if you don't wear it properly it's going to be a violation which is a charge timeout very seldom called well can be big will step aside or since them as you come back cap covers fear Taco Bell studio update number 11 Louisville in a tight battle with Kentucky but Heisman candidate and large accent doing everything he can taking off for a 60 yard run here part of 117 yards rushing children 36 for their three total TV so far Louisville up 31 20 in the third on the SDM Chris Harvey back to you yes you thank you after the fourth time out on Ohio State and go back to work first down Barrett back almost collided with so ever was coming out in motion there and McRae batted the pass down not only he batted out he almost intercepted it Mike McRae the senior out of Dayton Ohio Trotwood high school jumps up and times it up perfectly we've seen it a few times today Hurst had one now McRae goes up and like I said he's almost close to being able to hold on to that football the borough Iowan for Michigan our feet a little bit faster for those guys in this rivalry game Barrett as a blocker and has the productive run eating the Michigan territory and by the Buckeyes are back on the plus side of the 50 for the first time since the opening drive right here is the read he comes down but he also has a lead block coming around the edge but is tied in lapses down on Webber there's nobody to the outside when the first times in Michigan has lost contained mr. just the fourth snap Michigan territory for a while stay tuned now a down field chef Sam Bulow was open there were two receivers converging Samuel and Brown overshot them both they had the oneonone matchup that they wanted and looks like he's trying to get into Sam you on the inside what a matchup there when Jordan Lewis when the top cover guys vault with no matter who he throwing the ball to where there's no one brown or the curtain Samuel another inaccurate throw downfield from JP Barrett those receivers did get separation there second down Barrett's got it again you've got the edge again spinning back for another first down what guy is threatening again for the first time since the opening mint that's not like a Chip Kelly move in those days in Oregon you run an option play that's own replay it's effective it works why not why you want to wait to the next series go right back to it similar opportunity to vent game big yardage for Jacob Parrott getting the edge Wolverines have not seen a running quarterback of his quality this season did a good job containing him in the first half whoever drops the pass in the flat not bleeding you dropped the pass into plaque to affect the tempo and the rhythm that Ohio State has been able to establish here in these last three or four plays you know not just early Meyer trying to call plays that can work his offense it's about tempo moving people around trying to get to Michigan defense on their heels the pocket on second thing Barry has brought the time deliver is to Weber in the flat but he kind of threw it behind him and at the loss on the Texas Canon scribbling craft in five yards behind the line surprised at JT Parrish ends up throwing this ball out into the flat it's a long throw well behind the line of scrimmage against they were very athletic defense that has great awareness scribbling their first and in two or three other Michigan defenders softly today pursue the wrong rely the boring you need 16 this third down you got to go all the way inside the Michigan 25yard line Breen's Rockport get out there and fires over the head of Samuel again he was well covered by scribbling no chance to make a play he's uneasy in that pocket right now it's very simple to see even though they don't actually sack him watch JC parents body language he feels he's feeling that pressure he's not confident in that in that offensive line keeping the pressure off of him and it's hurrying up his thought process which is affecting his accuracy and way he throw on the ball he's hoping that they keep that pressure off of it they've got him rattled right down hard to do isn't such a choice guys his third start against Michigan when it started or two victories over amazing blue but not playing up too far today Johnston with the short punt peppers makes the fair catch at about the 12 yard line and Wolverines will go back to work protecting a tenpoint lead let's take a look at who's been putting in work luck to you by Carhartt Wilton spade has been putting in work with his timing with his wide receivers see how quickly when he deals that pressure under two seconds because of the Blitz he gets the ball out and then catching Ohio State by surprise getting the pull back out into the flat Hill for that cut loud touchdown they put him up 17 to 7 Speight nine consecutive conclusion don't think he's misfired since that big six are they done last time he was deep in his own territory like this Jim Harbaugh got aggressive with his playaction pass on first and damn which led to the interception yes from camp represented by dr. Bethel with the awarded in Tampa these teams came into the game with strong contenders for the playoffs they won is going to survive they seldom used Henry Posey to pull back with his short game this time he says forget the full action Pat's on first and did back here let's run the big fullback a lot of anxiety in this place these fans came in filled with confidence as their team do they are stunned with what they've seen so far in the last eight seasons make another big play face the livers behind Sabo he couldn't collect it he was streaking open space felt some pressure and that froze when to see when accurate ones do that Marshawn Lattimore retreated in coverage and it to made our lows wide open he just didn't secure the football ball is thrown between the corner the safety there's a knife hole in that bone coverage great read another another program it behind them with equipment rific but fill it up all the Garbo you typically expect him to make that get stable higher states listed here or sit back tries to just get their pressure with four in Spain field pressure at the screen again Smith weaving and dodging people forced down and much more flag comes out as Smith gets out near midfield Damon web forced him out the flag run to the 32 yard line so again not a big stream team but they use it effective death he signed it up when he's needed it a leak hooker who had the interception for a touchdown just a missed tackle here came in out of control and Smith made him miss first of all fall fake that down Mason cold the fine Center flying for faith mass crabs a hold up the top variety grabs a hold in the corner Lattimore's grabs a hold his facemask he's part of a convoy of blockers didn't affect to play at all but a very costly friendly having the ball out here the midfield daddy 10 bucks 20 Jim Harbaugh thought it would be a first down and then spotted the foul to bring it back that's why he is frustrated he said it first half he thought he thought it being first down and maybe a person 15 her birthday 25 they did throw the flag into 32 so a spot file 15 yards back from their sets up as a third down he's saying because of where it was we go back to this screen the Ohio State has it defended look at the safety hooker right here just comes in out of control it's a great cut by Smith but an open field tackle for hooker he didn't even get a hand on him to slow him down 16 yard penalty starting nullified it only breaded at the 28 yard line they've Gemara wanted clarification and that rule pretty clearcut though very clearcut because it is a spot foul on the offense and that that penalty took to hide the line to gain so we got to repeat it down rather than the first down okay reigns had converted the last five third down would it be six for six before that penalty let's see where they've got dialed up here it could be a penalty to a member wilds they bring us around inside of three minutes in the third quarter no state may want to consider tightening up coverage on the outside member Wilton Speights been doing a good job getting the ball out anticipating pros against loss coverage going pressure that's all they have signs on the pocket delivers a strike a first down let's grant Perry again beating Darien Conley that is just a quarterback that is feeling it gets mantoman great job of separating by grant Perry when you win oneonone and you have a quarterback that has time to throw and is thrown with confidence you win as an offense even on third down incredible decision from Spade the guy who again sat out last week's game with a shoulder injury was a big question mark coming in he is delivered big time first down handoff in mast down behind the line by Fremont Jones Smith that time been a rare tackle for loss Trayvon Jones has had a great freshman year this year for Ohio State shoots a gap he's undersized for being in the inside but he uses quickness to win that is an example that right there Iowa State defensive line considering all the great players that they lost that are now playing in the NFL coming into this year it's really becoming sprint and they've relied on some young players like Jones to be very effective for their looks people kept saying the guys inside that got beaten today have got to play physical today they stepped up the letter intercepted picked off by Jerome Baker and bankers got blocker tackle inside the 15 the third it makes you can turn over the second pick by spate and Ohio State gets the spark they needed press the first interception with great call Macmillan making a play this one is all welcome Spain Baker is right here just kind of thinks and quilt insane and doesn't account for it comes off the play action look he's waiting for that crossing route right here what does it feel for C Baker puts it right into his hands maybe thought he could get it over top of him the Baker's a heck of an athlete those Upper Merion the big play early in a year against Oklahoma he's got great speed of a natural athlete in the open field picks up big yards at the Ohio State defense again sets up Ohio State's office first one wasn't touchdown this time inside the 15 third turnover for the quarterback is played on the terrific game but that mistake they're being very costly flinch upfront the greens are pointing take you're one of those guys who go up to a terrific start as you said kind of hit the wall kind of a midseason slump but a big moment to deliver Oh what's Grayson building for Harbaugh Jim Harper Jim Harbaugh just through with entire play sheet they threw a flag on it call it a sideline warning maybe it is a sideline warning but a heck of a reaction from Jim Harbaugh after they made the call it was the play car ended up right in the middle of the field he threw it so far morning man it's a penalty and it will move the ball inside the five folks lost his cool the Ohio Stadium is alive again which get great in this area defensively all year a low hiyo state attack Paris barrel forward stop short 20:59 here creek excuse me in the field feels tilted for Ohio State down held evidence we hit the goal line situation to help fitting in Ohio State Michigan game to happen while state cuts down the redshirt freshman from Detroit yes the Buckeyes closer to plays after the interception by Baker a couple of penalties on the Wolverines and the Buckeyes p80 away from drawn within a field goal now this can change so quickly again fit sure can earlier is an interception by Malik Hooker for a touchdown this time Jerome Baker goes up and makes a pivotal interception to give the Buckeyes great field position after the nice return Jim Harbaugh helps him out with the reaction to an offsides call with an unsportsmanlike moves the ball deep in the Michigan territory two plays later chris said Mike Webber who's from Detroit knows a lot of his Wolverines goes up into the air and scores that touchdown he talked about that face mask call on the center often do you see that on the screen pass to Smith which nullified a big game nullify the first percenter set up the interception and the short touchdown drive on say it which has done very very little on offense today if just 153 Coley ARDS a pick six and a short touchdown drive huh composure that's been a key message on both sides but you saw Jim Harbaugh and really when he grew the play cards up in the air and got that penalty for it that was a fuse that had been lit because he was so upset about where the ball was born believing that he had the first down and had to call the timeout it was a whole succession of plays which ultimately manifested in that frustration the penalty which obviously helped the Buckeyes come back in this game that immense it's always correct though I'm often see the penalty called but that is the chain of events that's got no on state flows Jordan Lewis back deep instead of peppers where they kick it to the right which is a rarity for Ohio that breaks it strong tendency Wolverines able to get it out across the 25 yard line with Bobby Henderson the fullback so now how does Wilton spate respond to this mistake he did well the first time he didn't have any problem with it earlier but again that wasn't one thing on him that that was pressure Raekwon McMillan hitting his hands he threw it this one was a poor decision I still I still think you're going to see him disguise in a good place until that throw he's been making good decisions he's 22 27 he's been throwing the ball accurately I think it's more about Jim Harbaugh and where does he go from the flake caller standpoint then will fate I think space can respond peppers is it tailback first time he's lined up there today haebang cocoons fate rolls out D'Argo's in the flat running free a welldesigned play with the attention for how son number five and he gets ten yards sometimes for real peppers is so involved in your wear of them defense looks for him tonight's call to come right back where Michigan's done a lot of misdirection bootlegs moving Wilton Spade around he's not just playing from the pocket today they've had a plan to kind of move this offense around and use a lot of misdirection eightyard gain picked him in the game on second down he's got and he's got a first down final 30 seconds approaching of his third quarter been dominant in front of the largest crowd ever to watch the game at Ohio Stadium 110,000 45 we're going to reduce the capacity or take some seats out next year so this may stand forever as the alltime record here in Columbus who knows well the faithful go home happy Ohio State back within three at the end of three the dramatic final quarter coming up from the horseshoe give back after this message and a word for your local ABC station you're not going anywhere are you Corian faker 35yard touchdown catch Chucky with a 38 31 lead in the 4th over on ESPN Chris Harvey back you guys as we welcome back to the final quarter here in Columbus Mexican with the football first down perfecting a 1714 lead empty backfield fate has time delivered hi and incomplete try to get the ball back to Jake but little dr. McMillan and coverage Pacific Life game summary takes a look at the quarterback comparison that so much surprising starters fate had his moments but those three turnovers Barrett has struggled big time at the passer today but the 58 yards rushing talking there at the break the last series we saw him probably have something his best run but definitely not feeling it today throwing the ball at this point again on second down making it off inside and Chris Evans Michigan's been pretty onedimensional today not much of a running game to speak of running four yards on this third down and you're talking about a fishing an offense that could have been large part of his season they've been able to control things at the line of scrimmage quarter 35 yards game on the ground although the last two weeks when they won Iowa City you and I did that game last week is second calf against Indiana they were able to run the football whose fish got out a couple times base defense get the football back they got pressure in the ball got deflected at the line he hits the deck and is a little slow to get a pike Juan Luis off the edge made the play both of the defensive ends Hubbard who got to him on the outside coming here but here comes Mike Watt Luis who's had a monster year this year for Ohio State he gets his hand up and knocked that down one of the first times we've really seen spate taken down to the ground hard throughout this entire game so impressive to see the power of Luis also the flexibility that a nimble miss as a pass rusher doesn't really get talked about as often as he should he had a great year Andy Allen is at a great game the looming kickoffs knocking effective punts this one bounces and you'll thought about it but lets it go and it rolls dead at the 16 Ohio State back to work within three now the football team's efficient in Ohio have been engaging in a rivalry that is truly second to none winning is the community no mate is more important to team 15 of team cheer force of their leadership s they had this rivalry to another level and Tom Rinaldi asked Urban Meyer if you could ask Woody Hayes one question over to be how did you ever let Bo Schembechler get away to go folks that other side no doubt about it used to their forceful personalities defining a new era in this rivalry car bomb and it frustrated second half through his play card got flagged broke his headset hoping his defense can restore order here and Barrett looking to throw after dodge pressure can't get away for long finally sacked on the inside by Chris Worley taco Charlton he Ken was there in a hurry though well they do a good job of being it would get pressure on JT Barrett but you'll see in the background is Curtis Samuel who we keep talking about where is he where is he they had a linebacker Ben Gideon trying to run with him downfield got to be frustrating Urban Meyer and in order that they've not been able to get the football to him the right tackle Prince continuing to struggle and pass bro Barrett escapes and is brought down Mike McCray was spying the quarterback Samuel Cerf is 61 catches the lead of the game 34 more than the secondbusiest receiver and he is the Michigan Scotty's Lee made him the most high priority of the Ohio State attack three point six yards per touch entering today 10 yards and they've moved him around but Michigan is kept usually Jordan Lewis or they kept referral peppers on him and man coverage third and six areas to the left watched by Lewis I can't pressure off the edge Mike McCrae part of that thirddown package and Barrett goes down hard again but they bring both the linebackers Ohio State's offense aligned with struggles to be able to hold up here you see an odd front three down linemen they bring both the linebackers and Mike McCray whose dad was a captain at Ohio State is playing very inspired football as a senior the top run soccer Kirk he's an excellent pass rusher as well when they callin him to do that it's a big stand by Michigan's defense in Johnston from his one yard line it's a low boot away Peppers is back as the punt returner retreats to his 37 1203 to play Wilton Speight to shake off his latest mistake college football presented by Jarrett the Galleria of jewelry in part by GMC we are professional brain and Jimmie Lou we do more than just oil changes all in a jiffy Allstate good hands play featuring the interception by Jerome Baker that set up Ohio State's very short touchdown drive to draw within three in that third quarter the offense is struggling bigtime defense for Ohio State it had to step up and make plays just to stay close in this game frankly 152 yards of total offense for Ohio State both their touchdowns all for those Michigan turnovers trying to make it tough for the green offense Smith tailback position they think it to him straight wanted to take a downfield shot it is he throws pressure there by Lewis again what's at stake here in the final 13 minutes or so Michigan can win the Big Ten East with a victory and ended in D to take on Wisconsin while safe with the victory they would lose the headtohead Tyburn against Penn State they would need the Lions to lose at home to Michigan State coming up that game follows directly on ESPN right after this one's done vixen is the back on a second event just could not break the tackle of recon Macmillan the top tackler on this defense he was he was really sensing and watch his eyes watch his focus anticipating potential run and draw he beats the center basic goal trying to come out to get him because of that quick reaction four great linebackers do they anticipate and get to the football before the linemen have a chance to come out and make a blood rush been packaging the game on third and tenth row I'll say rush for faith immediately pressured in fact closer than jalen homes divine Luke Bickle mixes it up his looks he's showing crusher they get a blitz right they're going to bliss no they're going to drop and Bosa ends up getting home show pressure drop it and that's just Nick closer with quick hands and quick feet getting right by the veteran Pyle Kahless big brother Joey made a big play against Michigan a year ago and now Nick is the true freshman with his fifth sack of the season Allen drives the punt Samuel who comes up no fair catch Ian spins for a short gain from the 37 yard line that's where Barrett will set up shop the 11 top 5 meeting it's Robert more than any other but it's the first and the playoff arrow both teams are really employed PlayStation were getting you the house ball playoff rankings you see this is a 2 versus 3 game Clemson before playing tonight Colorado playing at home in his Utah and State Michigan State team watched closely over on ESPN at 3:30 Eastern Time Ohio State with the football after the worst pun of the afternoon by Allen his first poor punt they have it at the 37 I stayed 72 yards and an opening drive 79 yards since that opening drive favorable field position see what they do with it samuel was slot right now he motions in Barrett looking to the right engine right off the chest Paris Campbell has not made an impact boy in the last few weeks that had a chance there I could not have been thrown any better Katie Barrett throws it right on the money in Paris Campbell just unable to secure it soft coverage from Stribling is it a quite a few weeks yes I had a chance to make a play that occurred before you got to be ready in the fourth quarter calling your number absolutely got to put that one behind it Barrett looks to run escape JP Barrett gets away from pepper too frantic chasing down inside the 25 we're ready for that but fusion before the snap from Michigan pepper has gone back to Thomas you can see they're not quite on the same page and I think Katie parent recognize that right away there's nobody in the middle the defense the center outline is going out to the safety pepper is the block it I think JC Barrett aborted to play Saul that opening and just took off and read improvisation creating a 41yard gain by far the Buckeyes biggest play now Barrett fires barzakh Samuel makes the catch out at the 15 in front of peppers so matchup we thought we would be seeing all afternoon is Curtis Samuel going up against reveal pepper is ironically Samuel from Brooklyn peppers from New Jersey never played each other in high school but the rare opportunity there for Sam you want to make the play they knew about each other no didn't take care of it cannot escape peppers I knew all about the guy from Brooklyn you know they tried to set up a scrimmage it didn't work out between those two high schools they finally get a chance to hook up here this afternoon fact and it's not very common for Iowa State to go to the East Coast especially in the city and in the Brooklyn to be able to bring in a bigtime player like that but they've been able to do it and at last play it was just all about Michigan's defensive line getting around blocks after a nice gain on first and ten Knicks you know it's third down and short here for hiyo States number third down defense in the country needing to get a stop here for the field goal attempt on state needs for whoever and Samuel in there but Barrett keeps it all the way lower distilleries near the marker I think they'll spot it just a little bit short wrist warmly held him right there along with peppers decision time but we saw Urban Meyer fake upon we'll say he picks it's going to be trying to get everybody lined up to go tempo here on fourth down noticed engine at all just go we're down and our whistle before the snout or behind they will spend a timeout resume irons upon a time of the staff starts timeout Iowa State the Buckeyes down to just one timeout because they had to spend that timeout earlier and a half and Cory Smith didn't have his mouthpiece in of all things spending the second timeout fourth one really about a half yard they need Kirk and Meyer not thinking about a time field goal here no and he has been aggressive today as you'd expect both these coaches to be in the Ohio State Michigan game fake punt deep in his own territory that didn't work out now down three quick go for the time with it what a kicker that's been really consistent this year but it looks like you know Ford's in left in the yard he's going to go for it interesting because he wanted to run self or perhaps next wish you can see if it's not lined out then you seem to think better okay wait a sec maybe we don't rush this play let's take a timeout think about it make sure we have our play call and get the execution so usually you think this is going to be 16 on the cable oh yeah yeah the thing is you go back against the defenses they pride themselves on penetration they shoot gaps that's what they do they've done it all year with with Tom Brown scheme you told me earlier this year the three things we pride ourselves on is nobody runs the football on us especially in the red zone be dominant the red zone in third down defense those are the areas and when you have that it means you're penetrating the offensive line then Capron has come over look at this spot will change the Baron who's the replay official they're going to check out and see whether or not spot was correct it looked like he bounced he came down and then he bounced when he bounced looks like he went across the line but he'll they marked him short spots pretty good did seem to land short of that yellow line and then bounced across it looks like he's about that 12 and a half that where the ball is spotted right now yep but it played this significant we've seen every inch matters in this game people so you better get the spot correct it's worth a little prudence in the part of the replay booth here I don't think it's going to change what the ball is playoff I haven't seen anything that would affect the spot the entire stadium seemed to expect the quarterback keeper by Barrett the situation he can pick his lane no didn't know where he's been what I was going to say is he you go by review the previous play stands as called you go back in that shotgun what I'm saying against the defense it leaves the nation tackles for loss he's challenging his offensive lineman right now I mean he's yelling at them because they can't allow any penetration and on the Michigan side you're thinking guys they're going for it or a three huge opportunity to shoot a gap and do what we've been doing all year you're right two very different approaches the third and fourth and short there is in the guidance whoever to his left peak opening over the right guard McCrae walks up in it and handed also ever who muscle for a first and goal the Thai team Marcus ball is lined up on the left the backup pine and Alexander the push is right there so good job on the left side of the offensive line the two tight ends AJ Alexander and Marcus ball got to push Michigan still moving around trying to get lined up for this person goal fly and Michigan's confused again and Jim Harbaugh is going to have to use another timeout timeout this week their second time part of the game plan for Ohio State to create confusion by Michigan which was trying to identify the tight end and formation before the snap a guess we haven't seen it for three and a half fours they've not been confused until it's Drive the big run by JP Farris a couple other short yardage situations step away 41 yard run by Barrett abyss Drive equaling their first half rushing output the third hundred yard rushing game for JP what you think might have been it improvised by a decision that he made when he spotted confusion on the other side it was recognition is what he saw Michigan settling itself down it hopes on defense after the timeout whoever trying to get the edge took one tackle cuts it back hit hard at the six yard line there by taco Charlton Chris there was a serious block by Noah Brown on a crack block right here he's down there Monta Thomas watch this block oh no around that's how he really what he's known for is being a physical wide receiver just crack block is a block that dangerous play for those safeties and linebackers usually that corner yells to try to alert to safety few things make a remark cited than a physical block by a wide receiver that's his background as a coach taco Charlton down as well he made the tackle there so two key guys on Michigan defense being attended to let's listen to that block again and also Michigan defenders are up charlton looks okay he's walking slowly the trainer are with Thomas that's a obviously heavy will hit there Charlton looks like he's going to have to go out that this should looks like you think be able to come back to see both guys up whoever I really may be out of the game now here yes whoever actually because of that block was able to get to the edge and cut back and get all the way down to the five yard line second and goal there was rolling pitches he froze a dangerous pitch into the end zone tried to find Brown nearly intercepted has been Gideon came on the Blitz this is a dangerous decision by JT Barrett he's got a lot of receivers go in here and then Noah Brown working there this is this is a defense it almost comes up look how close I mean Gideon get for him obviously affect the accuracy the throw but kennel goes up almost comes down with the interception the safety filling in for Thomas third and goal Barrett keeping all the way into heavy traffic knocked down a soon yard short you'd have to figure Meyer is going to choose for a tying field goal here he's thinking about it but I'm with you you would think that chance to tie the game he's frustrated I think since there was an opportunity after converting narrow on fourth down and the way this game has gone and the fact his offense has not been able to drive the field and put seven points on the board they keep it feels like his offense missed out on an opportunity now they hope to decide again horrified extra point for Durbin and 20 yards he missed earlier from 30 70 seconds into the season and it's left missed it again Meyer incredulous as an ultra reliable kicker is Oh for two in the game about 105,000 other incredulous folks here think about the weight of a game this yet this guy has been so consistent all year and you just said it's basically it's on the Left hatch but it's basically I get extras just close to the left an extra point the bulb didn't even I didn't even get it clean again the pressure of the moment manifested in many ways my clock is our spotter said that it was for technique again and Mike former kicker Barbara knows that was just a little piece of luck urban cannot believe that he's Oprah he can field goals today really get another chance initially with seven minutes to go back on offense been tough to run for the Wolverines today again coming into this game Durbin only missed was the block by Penn State returned for a touchdown the decisive points in their only loss he's been perfect except for that coming into this game senior this hoping for another opportunity later in this game if you can move around a whole bunch of big bodies presnap here on second na with running behind all them knocked down after a gain across the 25 third down again Jim Harbaugh football Kareem snap lumen try to affect the communication adjustment of a defense hit the good blocking angle to the offensive line one o'clock big play for us considering we're six minutes to go on this game more power football in spate a chance to move the sticks for the path for incomplete it was throwing a little bit behind Darbo off his hands Denzel warden coverage its fourth pound vehicle hi O state thought dick but Mike hit the football watch the linebackers especially Baker Baker looks but up to the left so I just looks him up it opens it up for this right here for the quick slant now it's just about getting separation and Chris you're right the ball is thrown behind Garbo but but takes the defense away Michigan unable to execute the second time Garbo's drop the pass today booming punt from Elvis been a force in this football game punting and kicking off Kenny Allen if they emerge with a victory is going to be remembered for a long time for this effort it sounds silly in this era of football that we live in and spread and people scoring it will on offense but in this kind of game 1714 when we knew field position would be big Kenny Allen's got to be right up there and considered Michigan wins the game is maybe the MVP of the game say them with a smile but I'm with them 56 yards on that punt and Ohio State now backed up inside its own 20yard line after getting to the doorstep and then being denied missing the chip shot down only three does it just flip the field ultimately affect how high Oh state attacked deep inside their own territory you wonder circle how state just one timeout how many more chances will they get to drive this football down particularly it changed our table and remind you what's at stake here this is the game of their lives all the Michigan players told me that these seniors who have suffered at the hands of Ohio State well aware was five years ago today that they last won in the rivalry but losers of 11 to 12 this program mm mm when they're toddlers that's the last time Michigan came here one so that's what they're trying to protect in the final minute John Cook was the head coach that's how long ago it was who's last year as a head coach and these guys have put everything into this year they knew what opportunity they had they played their hearts out and Ohio State hung up a football team you're talking about the youngest team coming into this year in the power five they also have laid it on the line Barrett looking for a first down throw pressured again and will be sacked one more time taco Charlton has had a ball game and the Wolverines pass rush has been a major force Isaiah Prince the right tackle for Ohio State has had a struggle all year in pass protection we've called the Wisconsin game he struggled a Penn State game he struggled today he is struggled against Paco Charlton Michigan taking advantage of a wing flake up front on the offensive line on second and 17 Barrett tries to escape some of it back as a runner is knocked down across the 20 it'll set up third down Sam yeah Herbie was talking about Isaiah Prince and that's what JT's been noticing obviously too on the sidelines when they come off almost every drive he'll go up and talk to him he asked about this last time are you ok the response was yes and he gave him some encouragement for right now obviously so struggling the loss of Penn State they were eaten alive up front 5 second half sacks by the Lions third and seven bear has a lot of time now delivered down feel incomplete and here comes a flag it was Samuel cover by Delano Hill I don't know if he needed to bend the ball was very high but the flag came in quickly I'm with you Chris Center and then playing the center field in the middle is Hill the ball was going to be thrown over top of her insanity defense number 44 and Hill doesn't even make a play on the ball it's an incompletion ball is thrown high he definitely got his right arm on top of him and it's it's it's the right call but he did need to do it the ball was thrown in accurately Curtis family would have had a hard time trying to even get a hand on the ball ball move to the 36 7 penalty on Michigan just one on the Buckeyes this afternoon Barrett from the pocket paddock down just rejected right there by big number 90 Brian 1a what depth this group has rotate a lot of different bodies Monet codeine Hurst Glasgow taco Charlton rashon Gary Kris warmly when a bitch has a pass rush specialist number 15 I mean they have eight guys that rotate in and out and they don't miss a beat the matter who's out there as you were embarrassed last year but what happened against Ohio State trampled more than 350 rushing yards in this game and showing their improvement but more work to do for any of time and delivers bill retreated after making the catch he was ahead of the marker but is tackled as the 44 by peppers he was across the firstdown marker it released very close to it but trying to make a big play by cutting back under peppers seems right at the marker he just goes down he tries to avoid peppers and comes up short of any and third down playing quickly and a percent gain by Weber up near midfield now inside of four minutes one thing they have been able to do better in the second half is their run game the inside Ron in the zone read when JP Barrett has been able to pull it they didn't get much of a push in the first half but it's been much better in a second Barrett protected well again delivers across the middle Samuel down to the 35 finally the playmaker making an impact what happens is we talked about that zone regain that three pins the linebackers Mike McRae and Ben Gideon they start to look back in that back field and they lose those receivers coming in behind them Michigan team there's a man down Brad always suspects that it's a ploy to disrupt the tempo but taco Charlton has been battling cramps in the second half he was taken up earlier yet I think they're they're reacting he's trying to get somebody to check in for him he's that he just kind of went down fans reacting to that the second time he'll go on so they lose their most dangerous edge pass rusher but Samuel Kirk you you can guard him well you can protect him even plenum Oh afternoon but he has this kind of raw ability to just make a decisive play at any moment it's also credit to the offensive line we've been talking about how they've been giving up pressure that time Curtis Samuel had all day to wait for Samuel to clear to throw the ball Barrett again has a ton of time he's also got face pump fake and disputes that abound after a game that will bring it down to the 32 yard line and without taco Charlton in there the pass rush off to the right where Isaiah Prince has been getting beaten this time it's maurice Hearst and Prince does a much better job of not allowing the pressure to get to JP Barrett at least gave him an option and a chance to pull it down and pick up some positive yards Michigan defense has spent a lot of time on the field of the second half their offense has been able to generate much like that in six again on of time Barrett look downfield now the scramble for a first down inside the 25 the offensive line now stepping I was going to say Chris it's a different feel now watch the right side it's been a problem now look at that nice job by Isaiah friends everybody covered down field so the veteran JT Barrett picks up the first down with his legs whoever is wide left empty backfield they throw it to brown who makes the catch down inside the 10 Ohio State had three receivers to the field only two defenders I think Michigan got a little bit confused there Noah Brown had nobody on it Katie Burke has flipped it out there simple designed to confuse and exhaust Urban Meyer says as a whistle and pokken also caused some execution issue that's a rare miscue false start on the Buckeyes folks are often number 59 five yard penalty first down the right tackle prints their second penalty that's me that's the downside of a tempo Kirk trying to go a little quickly and guy wasn't set yeah now hi Oh state I think it's the last couple drives they've been able to get tempo more involved as their friends looks a little fatigued itself usually it's the defense you try to wear down as Michigan defensive line they're a few of them with their hands on their heads been a home game two minutes to go in this game first and go back at the 13th play clock is winding down the barracks it just gets the samp off there's confusion a near collision and Gideon drops him for a loss the play clock going down JT Barron's trying to get Mike Samuels intent or Mike Webber's attention to come over come over come over let's go he finally had to snap the ball he's right here see a play clock he's standing on it down in three JT Bears trying to get his attention but because he wanted to back Hill to pick up a block there's nobody there to get to tied the linebackers Urban Meyer just hunched over out on the field nice to be corralled to the sideline boy it was his first and goal at the eighth a false start tackle for loss they inside of six just get it off Barrett takes off again will be stopped and now it's Ohio State that looks a little confused after putting Michigan's defense on the road skirting absolutely taco charlton by the way back in the lineup and we've talked a lot about how they've been stunning and twisting up front and that's with that time from Charlton from the outside back to the inside he's the guy who got a hand on JP Barrett but the one to lino room to run for at 30 seconds they have one timeout they got to reach the end zone 18 yards away or I'll turn it over to Tyler Durban again Barrett across the middle catch made thaw in traffic to the five fourth down and 20 seconds to go I'm Jim Harbaugh saying let's go get to get the field goal unit ready there's very close to the same spot they were last time when he missed the field goal to fire clock ticking got a timeout if you finally will spend it to make this in effect a walkoff attempt to force overtime the last thing you thought Kurt coming into this game was the Tyler Durban would be a liability for Ohio State Ultra ultra consistent missed one early left and basically an extra point push left again and now this senior from Fairfax Virginia as a chance for a measure of redemption a 23 yarder the fourth overtime and it's been his technique from these first two attempts and this is like you get in the heat of the moment here at the Masters here at the US Open you've got a three foot putt you're standing over top of to win the Masters seems like an easy putt right when you're out the practice rate the Masters Championships on the line and you got to make that 3foot but that's what he's facing right here he began his career James Madison is a soccer player but a couple of seasons there eventually walked on to Ohio State in the spring of 2015 become a component that Urban Meyer can count on now he's just got to do something he's practiced a thousand times knock it through from 23 to get the Buckeyes even and let's keep an eye on Jim Harbaugh and see if he tries to freeze him walking down to the official right now instead it's coming off our bucks dragging on the ground doesn't stall time and Durban his time knocks it through third time's a charm he makes offering support and with one second to play last day has finally gotten even 17 days and 8113 meeting between these two great rivals who will play the first overtime and history of the game how fitting considering what's at stake here number two against number three and this latest playoff rankings for these teams is not about a playoff ranking it's about a victim championship Michigan if they win they're headed Indianapolis Ohio State if they win they need a Penn State clogs to go to Indianapolis but there are many to believe that Ohio State win but they're going to secure a bid in the playoff so much it stayed only fitting for it to be 17 17 and potentially headed into an overtime but a frenetic line if you managed Michigan's defense was confused Barrett had ripped off the big run of his first single all of a sudden Ohio State trying to run temple they got discombobulated it's ready attack yeah we're confused in the backfield and Marcus bought five yards short of the goal line and that third down urban back out there is a ball blows off the sea and over time something that in a big game always creates a really uneasy feeling in a stadium doesn't it oh yeah but what are the odds it gives a real peppers a chance to return this kickoff 0.0 gets it along the ground is the wolverines that little magic here Gordon Lewis to dance free Jordan Lewis Epson face puts back get into Ohio State Territory harp in mouth time with a Buckeye faithful as the allamerican corner actually gave it a go Kirk are you kidding me at the heck of an effort by Lewis all to talk about peppers but maybe the top cover man in the country said hey I got some skill to overtime coming up you can stand the tension uh sure Meyer kid shut up now you can exhale back this work your local ABC station all the history all the drama over the years memorable collisions always room for a new wrinkle over time between the Wolverines and the Buckeyes both programs and history of overtime play have been very successful Michigan ten and two ohio state nine and two including a road victory and madison earlier this year and overtime got as a captain kirk after battling each other for three and a half hours shake hands again for another coin toss you're still visitors okay ha there we go it is a pair and split the two coin tosses today what into the future Michigan will start on the offense obviously Buckeyes will go on offense the top of the first as they did in Madison I did back then I'll debate as elected to play the overtime period the south end of the stadium first Allen I'll stay first they play in the south end of the stadium against the team up north right Wow Kirk I mean you got to hit the reset button don't you all that happened and now it really comes down to a game this could be decided on any flight from here on out and this hasn't been a finesse game for 60 minutes this has been an emotional training physically draining football game that now you find out two programs that pride themselves on the fourth quarter trail and getting that mental and Jean who's in the best shape that second into play here too is it a factor that nobody in the Michigan side playing and reading for role today has played it in overtime game you have to go bud late in the 2013 season so maybe if you guys were pressure on that game they've not been in a situation much less in a monster wild original Mountain State has already won an overtime game as we said last month I think familiarity and the experience of it just knowing what to expect but this because Michigan hasn't been in games you know that Jim Harbaugh is prepped and done everything he needs to to have his team ready to understand what how this how this unfolds and how the urgency has to be at a very alltime high during this period here we go Buckeyes from the 25 Barrett pitches at Samuel head face blessed he cut back inside to tear in the first and goal bucket they finally get Kurdistan one to the outside plus a linebacker McRae the defensive end Charlton collapse down how's the foot race look at the block by Noah Brown on Jordan Lewis babes yards there for hioh State on their first play in overtime and if you Samuel admits 18 yard Barrett running all the way going standing up that was easy the first thing that's been easy all afternoon but it's off when the chips are down don't bet against their 100 career in the sucks out the extra point now from Durban I think it's been automatically drive that through so perfect family on the first play picks up big yards you think that caught the attention of the Michigan defense watch how he goes here watch the Michigan defense react opening up a lane for JT Barrett he gives it a little shoulder to the outside there goes the Michigan defense and look at the job by that offensive line but the linebackers with safety 5 we're on number 4 Curtis Samuel Urban Meyer they calling Group came up with a couple of the really excellent plays before overtime and the joint is jumping now 17 unanswered points pressure on faith in the wolverine offense has played with composure most of this football game he'll need to be the leader here not let his crowd and adversity effective by active in the flat take plot knocked out at the 16 yard short of the first day out when in doubt go back to reliable tight and burst in 10 ply action it's work the entire night the safety Damon web is glowing getting over it caught up in traffic crossing around a nice state call but when late getting over an easy read therefore the quarterback local state with not down the spot will be just short of the first down go burger a backups in on the tackle to be third down gotta keep an island for hioh state in the middle of that defense crema Jones we've got great quickness along with Robert Landers number 67 you take a chance here we got two plays to get a half yard ahead in this path down inside the 10 first in gold Michigan a quick hitter Davion Smith who had a career game last week against Indiana I thought last week he showed great patience and his running style for those two big long runs and right there again different slight hesitation to let that hole open up and they accelerated through for players to get 7yard yeah that's it that inside the five it has been a big struggle and we are in tight for the Wolverines today hard work in the final few yards my master's in safety that time is Malik Booker coming up and run support Michigan thinking about either running the football all sets of line or good time for a playaction to try to find a mattress that they like the compass defense accounts up all season long as its situation and made their corners out there on Islands at the bottom in a flat and you delivered incomplete he fired it low for he'll never had a chance under that was a touchdown pass earlier to Hill the exact same throw when they kind of snuck him out of the backfield linebacker Worley lost him on the touchdown this time has better coverage but the troll never really had a chance to plays to get five yards to stay alive on Michigan I'm anticipating pressure you're taking about the Blitz there it will come down to one final play from the 5/4 and gold surprised by the run for Michigan on third down in Taiwan Louis had a stalemate on the edge to force him back inside this is it across the middle touchdown Darko went down low there was hesitation on the call what a catch but a senior who's dropped a couple spade wants to go for two in the win right here all a strong low Chris but he gets his hands underneath it to secure that for a touchdown he got away from Lattimore the ball was thrown low and Darbo gets underneath to make the catch he said he's had a couple of drops within difficult catches but no mistake here just caressing that football before hit the ground and there was some lobbying being done by the quarterback he was holding up two fingers saying let's go for two in the wind which remember is what Mark Dantonio Pratt chose to do in regulation last week against Ohio State came up short yeah they're going to go to the extra point it appears anyway but we're talking a lot about garv oh did he get his hands under it but Wilkins fake on fourth down game's on the line stands in that topic with can hover closing in on him and makes the throw here's Kenny Alamo extremely crucial conversion it was a low snap put down by Moors and we are headed to doubleovertime Michigan offense headed right back out on the field after this Moore is the holder did an excellent job getting that snap down to Ellen could knock it through touchdown was great it was clutch it was a great throw it means nothing if this p80 his minato agency secured a loan snap if he gets the laces out they tilted the ball well done that clinched the holder of the Year award he's one of the three finalists trail not kidding he just one Evan Michael Memphis Connor McQueen Texas A&amp;M the other finalists along with more matching the tension and Happy Valley if y ou state wins this game Penn State can clinch the East with the winning against Michigan State the games is about to begin in Happy Valley as it is already underway Michigan victory they control destiny beverage throughout they had to head they would go to any to take on Wisconsin next Saturday even fans in Madison Wisconsin are watching this game closely because with a potential Michigan wind that would be good for Wisconsin they're watching closed against Toledo the border town birthplace of both coaxes they're watching around the world because these university's alumni bases have global reach you hear from people who are watching this in an Abu Dhabi Lagos Nigeria and Australia where the wee hours of the morning sounds like your summer travel Tura Michigan's offense right back to work a change into the field they started that last overtime period with a nice play action to the big tide in Jake puck through thick throw again on first and ten endaround Shepard not able to break the tackle cleanly Baker grabbed him at Silla 5yard gain a good effort there by Jerome Baker to get outside because it was very very close to Cheston being able to turn the corner maybe there's nobody left other than Baker he would've been able to take that to the end zone he is the fastest Wolverine so he comes around takes the handoff already at full speed and hard to manufacture running yards today for the Wolverines second and five man your log middle picks up only a couple Macmillan again tackling third down I don't know how many tackles great comic villain has but we put him out on it one of our impact players had everything to do with the kind of offense Michigan runs and how many opportunities here we did these offensive linemen can not climb to the second level now has 16 tackles needs to be give credit to not only his style but also the defensive line of keeping him free from the linemen getting up this leg 11 days of Crisfield interest against Michigan one says 26 top of 1850 1986 third and four bathtime delivers incomplete and well defended by Conley its fourth BAM wow that is a good throw in a bigtime play by Gary on Conley turning his body around Perry to get the left hand there and knock it away there's the right arm holding on to that right arm of Perry the officials do not see that but the left hand ends up getting away if you only knocked the ball away grab and turn it's an automatic flag you can get away with a momentary grab and now Allen has been so flushed as a putter and a kickoff man from 36 for the lead respond to the pressure and Michigan goes on top round steak can win it with a touchdown time to snap a little high more event to bring it down he knew it wasn't going to be low after the last one mores all over it man another perfect hole they're in great harmony their practice that the what 10,000 hours hoping to execute at a moment like that and only Kenny Allen appreciate that number Ohio safe was scored in two plays in the top of the first of this overtime Samuel on the edge and then barrages waltzing into the end zone and win it six here running all the way making his way any five predictable that's so difficult to defend he now all the way up to 27 carries on this game I thought he might get between 20 and 25 he's been their best running game as he's been most of this year up to 123 yards whoever motions out Barrett again taco Charles going along with Ben Gideon it's again the right tackle Isaiah Prince is a combination of great taco Charlton and watch Isaiah French does not get his arms extended his hands out Charlton is able to just get right around in with quick hands and just quick lateral movement around him but you think Isaiah Princeton would use a a backwards hide in somebody to help him because he is continuing to get feet to the outside there because eight sacks efficient almost equals 1/2 of the total Ohio City given up all season long and he'd nine on third down Barrett to Samuel can he make a bunch of guys miss cuts back Rick treating ten o'clock Samuel still alive and stopped just short of the marker that was adventurous I retreated out of Nouveau real go ray Myers saying hurry get to the line get them aligned get to the line or if he's going to call another time out last time he did it he call the time out this horse out it's the ball game if they can't get half a yard and now again a whistle from the Michigan side they spend a defensive timeout almost came down to a few breathless seconds and a half yard needed yes Urban Meyer was not hesitating he this time he was going for it and I think they were going to go back to that zone replay but I was with you Karthik cook Chris Curtis Samuel well it's a great effort you're thinking as he continues here he's going deeper and deeper making a kicker have to work that much harder potentially to go to a third overtime he's bumping into a blocker and finally after all that that that fast switched towel and he gets down within a half yard of the marker incredible because the fans are all thinking no no no yes yes yes one of those clips now you value with the decision to go for it forget the field goal forget triple overtime keep the drive alive and win it right now it's fourth and a half a yard there's probably two defenses in the country if in Michigan and Alabama it's tough to get a half a yard in this kind of scenario will Marines be to stop then all the misery headtohead close the back Samuel and Webber both in the backfield keeper what is the marker the spot will decide it the Ledo Hill got there it looks like it's a first down it is so high Oh safe stays alive barely they put both the facts in the backfield to try to give them the option to go left or right but they put it into the hand to JT Barrett after the fake there to Samuel T you get hit low there by Hill going to review the spot they're going to review the spot he was hit low then then ran into a couple of bodies high and knocked down this is going to be scrutinized by William Simon's the replay official Chris you know he'll hit him low and then the senior Chris warmly hit him high it's clear in harvies mind yeah I think when the four progress would be when he's in the air not where he lands I think it's went in the air right there and the ball in his right arm from that angle it appeared to just break the plane before he hit the ground I don't think again if you go by where he landed he looks like he's a half a yard short if you go by where the poor progress is wise in the air I think he's right at the mark what do you think did bring into Kataya your app you're absolutely right Kirk it's where the fullest extension of the ball with defensive contact so they're going to go with that forward spot and now they've got to be able to tell whether it's short or not this very well could be a stands but they've got to get a really really good look at it it's the call after review the play stands has called on the field which I agree with very very difficult to overturn a spot especially in a spot like this so first on Ohio State the 15 yards away from the goal line Barrett barely Samuel the chickens misery in this building continues Ohio State first serve ears and prevails 32:27 in double overtime we thought we'd seen everything in this rivalry we had never seen him overtime before and the playmaker certain the man who was absent for so long in this game Curtis Samuel in overtime made two monstrous plays let's go to Bob Rinaldi Chris thank you very much jinke a lot of these games just gave that detail how would you describe different there's one as what we talked about for years because we just led a team over there we get away after this trouble offensive over first at Genki what the de turning point good night you guys amazing keep on fighting let's take a half we came together away any we are no we gotta go make the place as they are line to win fans but God next is what we talk about right here congratulation seeking Thank You Sam with urban Sam I know you're still taking it in but describe for me what your stress levels were like towards the end there for down a little stressful run some good help but he's a he's a man's man what a great day for Ohio State football very blessed to be here and coaching guys time Edgar so how would you describe what it was and enable just seem to be successful down the stretch when there were issues throughout the game okay well you're facing a great team now these are people in caves in America lost several people expect is going to be a and creditor rivals that was a great game a little stressful those were his words a little stressful for the head coach every times when you wonder the Ohio State offense would ever arrive in this game they were carried by their defense the pick6 the interception set up another touchdown Michigan fumbled at the oneyard line here's the winning play Kurt Curtis Samuel we talked about in the first half where is he been yeah the flow of the defense to try and contain it because of his speed but he shows his natural ability of the runner sensing that he saw it on that crazy play on third down this time he felt it there's that acceleration that's what makes him so dangerous in the open field but he had a quiet first half finally found his way especially in overtime Urban Meyer moves to five and all against the maze in blue but he'd never had a rollercoaster ride like this to his belly danger being trampled over there pick him up right Wow Buckeyes and the Wolverines do not disappoint let's see if Scarlett here I go back to the play just before the winning play and it's an old fish eh this is a game of inches but in that case it really was think about how different this scene is how different this strip is this afternoon if Barrett is stopped a couple of inches short of that first down it's a fourth down keeper they say forget the field goal very confident it's got to get the yardage he's hit low as you pointed out has the strength that just gets the football across that line replay confirmed it that the disappointment of Harbaugh that was their chance to win it right there and end the misery and Samuel bolts into the end zone from here after for me it's just fitting to see Ohio State in Michigan with Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer beef settled and over double overtime it is kind of setting number two against number three the other thing I'm going to take away and remember about this game is Wilton Speight a guy that we didn't even know if he would play the game he didn't just play the game he left his heart out literally out on that field I thought he was dynamic in his decisionmaking played with a real chip on his shoulder a heart of a champion and then JT Barrett he's now three no against Michigan did not have a great football game throwing the ball but in the second half took control started to be able to run the football and started to finally find some confidence I think that was missing in the first half exhale net we exhale and talk about the bigger picture moving forward because Ohio State still hasn't clinched this division in the big 10 the game that's going on right now in State College in Michigan safety early three nothing lead over Penn State it's the Lions by virtue of that game we saw earlier that would control the headtohead tie break against Ohio State but if Michigan State knocks off the Lions Ohio State's got to go right back next week and rematch with constant in indeed the are they already in the file I should they want gasifier in my opinion based on what the committee has already shown you by their rank example Hiva stated to solid tooth today now you add a Michigan win who's at number three on top of that a higher state might want Penn State to win so they don't even have to go to play in the Big Ten championship game he's still going to make the playoffs conventional wisdom says oh no we want a chance to win our operations it could be for a conference championship always this the big ten is the goal Ohio the alma mater is pled and tens of thousands on the field celebrating along with this Buckeye football team but ESPN will have that Michigan State Ohio State game is 3 nothing Spartans as we said Urban Meyer for the moment couldn't care less Ohio State is Sunday they persevere they prevail a gutwrenching loss for the maize and blue and their losing streak continues in Columbus we hope you enjoyed this classic wherever you were watching 32:27 Ohio State in double overtime is
