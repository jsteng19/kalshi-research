============================================================

this is not a good fuel bike is a guy that has to go Texan still searching for answers everybody saying you're done everybody saying you're not gonna make the playoffs it's a lost year the truth of matter is there was zero nada to feel good about last night the Colts are gonna be like shoulda coulda woulda this is about now this is about this time this is about this opponent trusting the process and believe in each other the tops are go to the playoffs we're playing like a bunch of madmen we were able to come back from on three because everybody believed the Texans have won the AFC South no one can stop us we were best team when I feel you have yet to see let's go do we lose only place you're going is home the playoffs begin with an AFC wild card matchup from here in Houston the Colts in the Texans they were able to come back after miserable starts the season with luck at Watson star quarterbacks who had a comeback from serious injuries and now we all come back to football's ultimate pressure cooker the NFL postseason has arrived as we welcome you to the GMC wildcard kickoff the number three seed the AFC South division champs the Houston Texans taking on the number six seed the 10 win Indianapolis Colts as we say good afternoon everybody I'm Joe testator thrilled you're with us for the first the four very intriguing NFL wildcard games and to think the Texans were sitting there at OU and three and the Colts at one in five and now they're two of the hottest teams in the NFL and as much as the theme is come back this is about the immediate future because you talk to coaches you talk to players and there's a common refrain it moves a little faster it's a little more intense and you're defined by the results right here right now let's bring in my partners here who know all about the ups and downs of the NFL postseason the future halloffamer Jason Wittman the twotime Super Bowl champion Porter McFarlane something you're familiar with the third goround of a division rival these guys split here each winning on the road what's the message being doing you know you don't matter how it doesn't matter how you got into the tournament all it matters is that you're in and so the focus is take that emotion out of it all right it gets back to your messages situational football do your job red zone taking care of the ball not having the penalties come up that's what the focus is and playing this game let's size up each team here we'll start with Coach O'Brien's Texans what's the winning formula well it starts with the quarterback deshaun Watson he needs to get the cape out and put the S on his chest cuz he's gonna have to be a star and carry this football team they believe in him he plays his best football on the big stage and expect him to do it not only inside the pocket as a passer but as a runner and be a difference maker and on the other side of the ball his running mate the stars they have to show up JJ Watt is gonna have to rush the passer he's going against a rookie and Braden Smith the right tackle for the Annapolis Colts he's confident that he can play big and his running mate on the outside Jadeveon Clowney he's gonna have to play well bringing pressure inside when he gets a stout offensive line in an in hapless coach those guys have got to put pressure on him and I expect him to play big yeah the Colts this season wasn't supposed to be there the rookie head coach and Frank Wright they bought into what he was selling Chris ballard the GM who went out and had one of the best wraps in lever city but then there's number 12 yeah there's number 12 in the trust between number 12 and Frank Reich is what led Andrew Luck to have a career year a career high and completion percentage a career high and quarterback ready the ball is going to come out quick he doesn't hold the football only 18 sacks he's the catalyst but he can't do it by himself you mentioned Chris Ballard what a draft that he have one out and first he got Quinn Nelson oh God that brought physicality and toughness of the offense and everybody net offensive line they picked up on it on the other side of the ball you heard of Jack ham you're heard of Derrick Brooks introduce yourself to Darius Leonard he's a guy of the same ilk they hope he can produce the same way he'll make tackle sideline to sideline now at the line of scrimmage but also uncovered it's a young team but it's a team that's ready for this moment we're just moments away from kickoff here wildcard action set to go when we come back the comeback kids Lisa Salters on Andrew Luck and JJ Watt soon we're today's wild card matchup will feature a couple of comeback kids going after each other again Colts quarterback Andrew Luck and Texans defensive end JJ Watt had both rehabbed their way back from significant injuries and now find themselves back at the top of their games but I have a lot of respect for Andrew and what he's been through and I can't speak for him but I feel like the feeling is mutual I mean after every game we have that respect for each other and to be able to go out there on that field in battle after everything that's gone on in the last two years they were both very happy to be back out there the fierce competition the genuine respect it is mutual between JJ Watt and Andrew Luck and they both can appreciate what it has taken for the other to be here today luck missed fall of the 2017 season after shoulder surgery on his throwing arm a threetime probowler he admits he was scared he might never be able to play again a back injury and a broken leg forced watt to miss most of the 2016 and 2017 seasons like with luck there were those who doubted he would ever come close to resembling the threetime Defensive Player of the Year he once was and yet here they both are Luck finished the regular season with the highest passer rating of his career and watch 16 sacks led the AFC you see everybody you see everybody question will you ever play again period will you be good if you do play again even if you are good will you be that good I think Andrews kind of sounds to all those people if somebody last year when I was sitting on my couch with my leg in a brace came to me then and said at the end of the season they're gonna be a division champion they're gonna be in the playoffs and they have 16 sacks would you take it I was shaking their hand said let's do it well I got all that and more he was voted to the Pro Bowl and earlier this week was named firstteam allpro both for the fifth times and career death thanks Lisa and the scary thing for opposing offenses is that even with 16 sacks he size things up this way saying my job is to take over the game to destroy it until I completely do that then I'll feel like I'm all the way back you've been watching the GMC wildcard kickoff engineered by GMC and their lineup of denali vehicles ESPN welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League Basco when they pay initial we're ready a game fueled by momentum the Colts have won nine of the last ten the Texans 82 down that same stretch it's been a decade since we've had a wild card game with teams winning at least eight of the last ten if you're watching on ABC the Spanish version this game is presented by ESPN Deportes and you can access it by using the s AP function on your remote control the roar of the postseason it has arrived the Texans won the toss they defer the Pope's will receive Zach pasto from Old Dominion set to return the Fairbairn kick and it'll be his 59th touch back of the year per ke me so andrew luck his seventh playoff game he says most of this season has been pressure football it just like it's been the post season for us for a while now and I don't think anybody's approach will change just because we're in the dance we're certainly excited and for us if that means focusing on the process you're sure we're getting better today and excited for that opportunity he's excited for this opportunity he's going to need to play big look for them to get the ball out quick to start this game and eliminate that pass rush of the Houston Texans he does get it out quickly was deflected at first but then into the hands of Marlon Mac right at the line of scrimmage the Andrew Luck finished second in the NFL with 39 touchdown passes second behind Patrick McCombs and a superb 50 that he put up for Kansas City see the careerhigh numbers the top Comeback Player of the Year candidate 28 year old you didn't take the Colts long they got their jumbo package out there that's really what they like to run the ball with that is Joe Haeg the extra lineman on the left side is tackled for a loss who else but JJ Watt well JJ knew that he was going to line up there he said that's where they want to run behind is this jumbo tight in he shoots the cap but he'll penetrate inside he'll play the backdoor like we just saw right there he is so aggressive getting in the backfield it's tough to defend him not only is it just a pass rusher but in the run game and here's it down a few of the Houston Texans that you want to make sure you come off the ball pass rush if I'm the Indianapolis Colts I locate number 99 and number 90 the other playmakers in the pass rush for the Texas third and 12 the Texans the worst defense this year in giving up third and 10 and more boats were number two offense converting now look drives the ball right to the stick to make to t:y Hilton and just as we said that unique matchup of third and ten bus that was a third and 12 and you see the difference between these two teams well interest has got so much confidence in going to ty Hill he runs a little fight rally sells that corner he comes back and the houston texans good job putting them in the third down but you have got to capitalize you cannot leave dy Hilton oneonone on third down notice how much time Andrew Luck had we talked a lot about the pass protection only 18 sacks all year he looked very comfortable just now as Matt goes ahead behind that muchimproved offensive line for Indianapolis yeah it starts with Quinton Nelson the allpro left guard he brings the mentality upfront they need to stop this deep into line they have to run the football oh that's tough going against the Texas because they're one of the top teams only but everything the Colt offense was to do play action get it the T Y hilt and stretch the field comes off that running game so if they can be efficient with it look for Andrew Luck then to play fake it and take his shots downfield the to Y Hilton play action on second and seven luck pressure and throws it away and that was Bernard Rick McKinney coming in on love and that's exactly it they want to run it then come back with the playaction just like we talked about with the problem with that is if they cannot protect he doesn't have the time to be able to take those shots those areas in that back end they want to attack the secondary of Houston but they have to be able to do that up front with the way they block firstyear head coach Frank Reich won the Super Bowl is Philly's offensive coordinator a year ago we talked to Andrew Luck yesterday he said he's so calm he's so patient great communicator 1st 3rd down Andrew Luck had all day to throw let's see how much time he has here this wife does Claudia's merciless as somebody get after this quarterback in speed his talk low third and seven as Matt stripped up a flag is down it was Matthew who cut him down outside he fit $4.99 5yard penalty deep down and that's the thing about JJ Watt he's a great player allpro but he's the second most penalized in the entire National Football League as far as offsides and neutral zone he can't jump the snap count he's a good enough player he doesn't have to do that but he talked about Witt he said you know what I'm gonna do it in critical downs during this game chronic ant happen there though because now you take him from a third and seven and give him 32 yep he saw Andrew clapping those hands he said I'm gonna time it up costly penalty third and two what extends and then goes right near the sideline at Hilton and that's gonna be a challenge for them the Texans defense because they're playing mantoman and third and short and what happens T Y Hill comes across on a drag route they get a pick you see Matthew running with him but andrew has the threat of running and to get the first down and right when he feels the defensive guys that collapse he then throws it good awareness in that moment and T Y to just keep running away from the man coverage and getting the first down something to pay attention to there Clowney was spying luck on that way just because of that reason you spoke ball look nearly intercept at that time by Jonathan Joseph very interesting matchup with Hilton and Joseph you know T white Hilton already with a couple receptions today do you think about what he's done here at NRG Stadium these Bulls by the way aren't chasing something they're running from T white Hilton he's dominated here at this stadium 133 point free receiving yards per game that's the most by a visiting player at any one venue in NFL history second and ten empty set walk down field and that is Hylton again something about this place brings out the best in him 38yard reception and the Houston Texans are on a cover to defense and the middle linebacker number 55 Bernard McKinney and covered too he's got to get down the middle that's a matchup Tiwa Hilton against a 64 260 pound middle linebacker and Bernard McKinney there's no way he can run with him and how about that throw by ng luck just drop it right in there 41 credible first and goal Ebron what a year for him Eric Ebron touchdown Colts they just run a little quick flat route but he brought is able to get there because the Texas are in a man of man the guy deserves credit is T Y Hilton because he sets a pic route and makes Matthew run the hump in that situation good call by Frank Wright knowing that when you get inside the 5yard line they want to play mantoman and you get the pick for the touchdown also understand and honey badgers going to match up on Ebron just the way he did against urge a couple of weeks ago nice scouting there by the Colts great opening drive for Indy and for Eric Ebron his wife Gabriella gave birth to her second son the other day first touchdown of the postseason here country Hopkins both greatly inspired by their mothers Shawn's mom Tianna cancer survivors often told us about his high school days watching her bravely take on that fight we asked him about any inspiring message she shared he said yeah protect the football and then there's DeAndre's mother Sabrina a domestic abuse survivor or the result of that abuse leaving her blind Hopkins says he loves having her sitting right next to the field he can go over he can talk to her visit with her pregame and Sabrina tells her son she wants to hear his name a lot from that PA that is his plan today and that is often the case settin nothin Colts here AFC wild card playoff Colts had seven opening drive touchdowns this year that was tied for second most in the league Sanchez kicks away and Carter let it go for a touchback so here comes Shawn Watson just 23 years old his first full season after the injury shortened year last year always likable of modest but confident with what this team is three words that describe this team Brotherhood heart Swagger no one can stop was the best team when I feel it means a lot to me to be able to you know have this team made the playoffs never lost faith and Cal you know pushing for get the day started with playaction plenty of time to wind up and go downfield and Hopkins couldn't come up with it as coverage came from anymore or Deshawn said we're gonna do a little playaction pass and we're gonna take a shot to back these guys up we've heard all week about they held in knowing 36 yards but really good coverage Kenny Moore running stride for stride with him down the field against one of the guys he's got the best catch radius in the National Football League DeAndre Hopkins and I thought that was a good nocall good by the refs allowing him to play but also good by the techs and said hey we're gonna get our man involved today they go with jet motion and as cutie who is back from injury he practiced this week he missed the last five games with a hamstring now we were taking a look at DeAndre Hopkins pregame you know so many players this time of the year dealing with injuries is really trying to stretch out his lower leg looks like he was working that Achilles there with the trainer and his ankle playoff football oh yeah get out there third and five now Watson will go out of the backfield simillar and he's trying to stretch for it but instead was brought down by Mike Mitchell you talk about momentum that's a big stop by the coast defense the folks offense comes out drives the ball down the field gets a touchdown now the defense comes out three and out and how the crowd is silenced the coats have come on the road and they're ready to play today you know there's a lot of talk about deshaun Watson hasn't been down on more than seven points since high school with the wave doctor Luck surgically went down that field he's got his work cut out for him Trevor Daniel punting away Chester Rodgers calls for the fair catch Jenny hauls it in and around the 25 Andrew Luck had a big two games against the Texans this year was six touchdowns in the regular season and already one this afternoon he's back out there when we come back to Houston 63 receiving yards on that opening drive knows the most for him on our opening drive in his career tap ie bronze touchdown catch from Andrew Luck and I thought the first drive was telling guys seven passes only two rods took the run against this Houston defense I think that's the formula tonight Andrew left on the ball here's Mac again and look at the Running Room for Marlin Mac as he's finally pushed down by Justin Reed well the best thing that Marlon Mac does is he gets out in space in his Lyman or phenomenal pulling around see Ryan Kelly's leave blockers sinner they cut on these guys and Mac has the speed to get on the edge and that's gonna be a big part of this running game for the Colts today you see the numbers on Mac you know he missed four games this season with a hamstring but since week six on work the fourth most rushing yards in the league able to wiggle his way free again before he's driven down by the honey badger at the 40 yeah when you take a look at this Texas defense everyone knows that it starts up front with JJ Watt all throw a guy that can create a habit not only in the run but in the past also and the second level is running mate Jadeveon Clowney the best athlete of the front seven a god is going to play in space he'll shadow Andrew Luck as far as the spot if you're gonna get this Texas defense you're gonna get it on the back end they've been susceptible to deep balls just like they were in the first series well men often fiveyard penalty as build n Yvette's shoe is the crew treat his 11th postseason assignment today he's worth three conference championships officiated Super Bowl xlix the Patriots win over Seattle now they're going big again you got mole of and Ryan Hewitt Haig in the game here on second and six as they will feed Mac and he has taken down right at the line of scrimmage with Jay Jay want coming around where you couldn't stay patient with your running game and get that established with these big tight end sets as long as you're ahead of the chains the penalties talk that in the beginning you know you have situational football is huge because now you're in these third down yeah Houston Texans haven't got that stop on third down they're looking for expect him to play a little zone and pass it all because if ant who has time he can pick it apart you know a so far white and cloudy haven't got there in oneonone matchup does Romeo Crennel get impatient and bring a little glitz here and remember Hilton already has two third down receptions as he motions to the top of your screen third and five and you saw the movement with merciless neutral zone infraction beep that's number 59 5 yard penalty both they're down there is Romeo Crennel 71 yearold defensive coordinator for the Texans the oldest coordinator or head coach in the league is 36th season in the NFL he's not happy with those guys jumping on side that's a second one on third down they've had encroachment because all sides and now given this offense third and short and with it out of the I formation easily converting is math behind Hewitt remember the message that Frank Wright delivered about priority number one running the ball in this game well and it's not so much about the number of yards I think it's the number of attempts and the yards our opponents right now they're controlling the line of scrimmage they're being more physical on foot and who would have thought about that years ago with this coach offensive line now being physical here's a reverse and it's Pascal and with a good block in front it'll be another first down for the Colts 14 yard run from Zach Pascal well it's just a really good call by Frank Reich getting these guys on the perimeter it shows it and then gets speed by Pascal with lead blockers those linemen getting out in space they do a phenomenal job picking up blocks worn against these secondary getting those guys in space and Frank just mixing up the running game stay in control and now they're in the field as they approach the red zone taking a shot Matt this time wrestle down immediately from clowny and we talked about clowny as far as his ability in the pass game now tapper goes down he defeats the buck with quickness you don't always have to do with power sometimes you can do it with quickness County did it that time that's six straight runs for the Indianapolis coach you think they're trying to make a statement right now you know it's amazing about clown is what police say when the guard pulls you got to take it on and squeeze it out unless you're really athletic you're just running around the block and still make the tackle for loss yeah and he's really athletic these be out really and play second and ten here's luck now is this able to get out of the pocket and stride able to get it completes as Chester Rodgers you know he's doing a really good job Andrew Luck is of getting outside the pocket but then pulling up to make those throws so it's a little run pass option he sees cloudy come inside so he invites that rush inside and then it creates a lane for him to be able to throw and pull up it he's so good on the perimeter as a passer and also what you've seen him back in the Texas cannot stay with these receivers in mantoman coverage they're getting loss the misdirection of playaction guys who have two or three step cushion on the defenders 16 yard catch makes it a first and goal Matt trying to get to the pylon and he's pushed out short that time as it was Jackson coming over defensively but six yards on the reception come back well Mack just gets another job where they're getting their lot their guys in space he's gonna set a pick route so that Matt can come out here on the flat and once they get that bump turn it around you see Paschal right there forcing him to have to run the hump the linebacker McKinney he can't get through there it's all about matchups and doing your job and playoff football great job by the young player Paschal setting that pick you know the Philadelphia Eagles took advantage of the Texas linebackers and the coats are doing the same thing too right now second and goal he brought ships over with blockers in front and another touchdown for the Colts that's two for two on these nearly flawless drives / Indianapolis well that all fits a line it's been talked about how these guys do it but watch this left side they just full zoning mulling them off the line saying we've heard all about JJ Watt and clowny and this deep it's a line we're gonna run the football get to stout defense and Mack with great patience while those guys go to work it's embarrassing Jadeveon Clowney was two yards in the end zone that's embarrassing for a player of his stature in this league and now this Colts offense game number three against the Texans they have scored a touchdown on all nine red shelled appearances against Houston I'm deck if you're like me you were Jason Witten Berger McFarland Lisa Salters furthest AFC wild card game at defensive line for Houston all the talent up front what and company but being dominated early on here by the Colts and that offensive line that has been paving the way protecting luck leading from max rushing totals 145 total yards for Indianapolis in a tune well it's been the mentality for this Indianapolis Colts you're gonna see these guys quit and Nelson they're going to just zone it on up and they get four on three they're gonna push these guys full zone it manonman and not the defensive linemen all the way into the end zone creating a mentality yeah and if you chew Debbie on clowny you first of all you can't swim on the goal line it's low man wins down on the goal line he didn't do it he gets knocked two yards back in the end zone the Houston Texans have to change their mindset because right now they're getting manhandled maybe this helps with Griffin connecting from Watson the NFL playoff debut for deshaun Watson and visit with the honey badger so what's this guy like when he crosses the white line said listen you know him to be humble right says he's a killer on the field humble off of it so competitive extending plays tougher than you think too ran the ball great last week and he is still with injuries and pain this year and a punctured lung to injure the ribs in Week five as Lamar Miller goes ahead offensive line has been a concern yeah big concern sixty two sacks this year they're gonna have to protect on the perimeter it's a oneman show ste andre hopkins gonna try to give him the ball a lot of different ways but right now they're down fourteen they haven't had any juice the system Texan team the guy that's gonna create it is the Shawn Watts and look for him to extend these plays and run the football give this team a little spark Alfred blue comes in at run back on third and one and he will move the chains that year player out of LSU just a simple ozone read there he's reading the defensive and offensive via kind of stay put he handed it off that was easily taking candy from a baby look for Watson to bold that later on in this game yeah and the Colts defense it ends they got a close yeah I got to come down hard you can't worry about him keeping it it's not your responsibility that falls on the linebackers so Bill O'Brien Texans head coach his third NFL postseason three different quarterbacks in these trips to the playoffs he's got the one he wants for a long time though doesn't he Watson again and training around every which way was Vincent Smith trying to find that ball you saw him look to the right back to the left he was covered by gathers well Vincent's just got to make that catch you know I mean you don't get passed on that many opportunities down the field and what I used to try to say is just move my body not my head it's hard to turn your head to three different times around like that you've got to use your body and leverage to turn it he lost track of it missed opportunity big time the Texans offense missing a couple key parts here earlier this season will for Torres ACL good downfield threat at receiver then they picked up Demaryius Thomas he's out for the year suffered a torn Achilles trying to fight for anything was Lamar Miller yeah when you take a look at this coast defense it's a 43 defense up for it you may not recognize the names but they're gonna play tough physical and they're gonna play hard and run to the ball the guy on the second level that everybody around the NFL needs to know about it's Darius Leonard he's first team All Pro to fit in the Pro Bowl and he wasn't it's a cover to scheme but not gonna give up the big play and they're gonna fly around a football field they win with effort third down and eight with Watson facing that defense that wins with upper and the leaves in that Tampa 2 system and right at the sticks is Hopkins 9 yard reception there what happens a lot of times when you go against good receivers you try to press him but he's physical too he knows where the first down is he does a good job dragging his feet they like the matchup with Jazeera because he's physical and long but if I'm the Colts defense I'm putting two guys on him I'm rolling coverage in behind him and allowing them to press he's too good of a player to leave him single you know I think the coach feel good they play about 75% zone so I don't think they feel like they have to match up mantoman against Hopkins in that situation Colts are gonna challenge this call that being a reception by Hopkins you're watching for that toe tap and that drag they're like they're really gonna feel like a plea to pass at the sideline I know we're going to take a quick break while they take a peek Hopkins catch did stand that it was a catch by DeAndre Hopkins who's just named firstteam allpro was the leading votegetter among all the offensive players watch that right foot mitts down right there he started dragging it prior to catch yeah see so he has such a good feel for where that abounds is but I don't mind the challenge my friend right you're looking at it and saying hey if we can stop him here and go up 21 but great play by Hopkins Watson escaping the pocket and then just throws it away mentioned Bill O'Brien what he's done this year just masterful and leading the Texans from oh and three to the playoffs the first team to dig out of that hole after week three in 20 years and this is an important drive for Bill O'Brien because he wants to this offense to be able to be complimentary yeah and for that to work he obviously you've got to stay in the game and this is one they have to capitalize get points and get this football team these fans a little juice second 10 as it's incomplete as he was looking for QT one of the ways they're trying to do that is get Deshawn on the perimeter allowing do it but the problem is the Colts did a good job they try to slide Griffin the tight end back across the defensive end blows him up and then if you cover Hopkins guess what bunch of rookies out there haven't played in these type of games where the energy and the game just goes up to another notch it's faster when you play and playoff football and that's the second time we've seen the bootleg action that's one of the ways you attack a fastflowing defense who legs and misdirections empty look here on third and 10 O'Brien talked about how much Watson prefers this as he goes under short of the sticks and is taken down as they were able to corral he kikuchisan Darius Leonard who led the NFL in tackles with gathers and this is area I wouldn't be surprised that go for it on fourth down right here early in the game I like to call the pillow Brian you got to play aggressive it's playoff football it's win or go home fourth down in four over the course of the last five years is 44.7% Reed wide here's fourth down they only send three truck ain't enemies intercepted that is Kenny Miller with the pickoff well that's just a phenomenal play bike anymore it's cover two and he knows that it's playing quick game he's the slot player and when he's in this moment he's gonna play on the edge out here and and then he's gonna play on the perimeter he's gonna guard him and then come back off on the tight end he sees it there he's playing the slot and he's got that area he comes off knowing that he's gonna throw that to the tight in good eyes good feel that's how you want to play cover two with your eyes up reading the quarterback they did a great job playing cover two with the spot number 26 Clayton gathers was fined as Shaun Watson just in case he took off nice call by Madiba's loose and now after the turnover it's complete to enman who gets three before Matthew finally puts him down that after two Shawn Watson's first interception in his last 215 pass attempts got to go back to week 11 against the skins the last time he threw up him well he just hadn't turned the football over he's been very protective of the ball the Texans have got to wake up the Indianapolis Colts came out swinging on a Texas go fight back nothing Indianapolis in our first four very intriguing wild card games here and if though playoffs have arrived and boy have the Colts arrived with momentum the atomic possession of ten sixteen in that first quarter to Houston's four minutes and 44 seconds look over the middle and goes to Rogers well the interception was what opening it up keep an eye on Kenny Moore he's gonna be in cover two instead of carrying it what he does is he comes off on it DeSean thinks it's gonna be quick game he's gonna have this coverage and Kenny Moore comes off of it and takes away that throat does Shawn never cease it understanding it fourth and four that ball is going to come out the Shawn's cannot believe that he missed that one yeah play back anymore though really good job smart football knowing that down in distance anymore who sealed last week's playoff clinching win at Tennessee with an interception as well there's Mack trying to get to the outside of Cunningham and Mack just has incredible vision right he can change directions that's a run to the right and he can fill us the blockers coming down on the inside there goes clowning underneath he sees it and goes back out to the outside so his change of direction his vision it fits this offense nicely because he knows clown he's a wild card it's gonna do a lot of different things and if you can feel that in real time you can have runs like that and stay ahead of the chains Matt stable to get beyond the line of scrimmage for a yard finally we got some penetration from this Texas defense talking about Mac about the return of the Mac late Mark Morrison's ninety six hit book I know you love the return of the Mac and Mac has been running the show from week six have returned from injury fourth in the NFL in rushing since then tied for third and rushing touchdowns past eleven weeks that was his comeback song and book I know back in the day you were clubbing to return of the members as well so for years you already know this Texas front set but has got to make a play JJ Watt clowny where are your merciless the back end needs your help you have to show up now in this critical time third and four they pick up the extra man and the track route goes for a first down to Iran for five yards where we've mentioned pick routes and that's exactly what they're doing in all these third down possessions that they have of getting their guys on pig routes and Ebron gets another one here he's on the slot receiver on the outside he gets it by Pascal forcing him to have to run the hump he gets he Braun wide open across if they have to run around they're not gonna make those plays let's take a look at JJ Watt you got to give pressure he's trying to bull rush Smith does a good job of Washington by right now the front seven of the Texans it's being dominated by Frank rice with his play calling and the Colts offensive time Brayton Smith's the other rookie know all about Quentin Nelson this is the guy from Auburn who's also been solved for the it is tinted it is intercepted that is big Brandon done JJ Watt got a piece of it as he has one to do and done came up with it is that the spark that Houston needs watt de flex it done Corral's it it's again on Monday night aren't they on ESPN's gonna be Bama and Clemson in the college football playoff national championship from Levi's Stadium and who do you think has familiarity with spots like this deshaun Watson of course he made national headlines with his epic comeback against Bama the 2017 national championship so he's down 14 here 14 nothing here in this wildcard game he has one successful 14 point comeback as a pro or polish starter it was that flag is down as he goes to Miller so as a starter in the NFL or college one successful 14 point comeback and it was that game against Bama formation offense number 16 covered number 83 fiveyard penalty and when you get in playoff football you can't have mistakes like that you can't cover them up young players like that you know qt covering up the tight end forces you back now first and 15 from your 10yard line it kills all your momentum jjy gets a tip you get the interception now the crowd is starting to get into the game a bit just kills the momentum it gets your play caller behind the chains go backs him up person 15 at the 10 as Miller we'll motion back to the backfield with Lhasa not much there at all as he was wrapped up by shared first hunt getting involved and they just get after at that front let's take a look at this these this is what the coats are doing they have two guys in the a gaps it's the old Pittsburgh Steeler defense a double cog knows what that does it doesn't allow the guards to come off now the linebackers can stay clean easy for Darius Leonard and Walker to get tackles when nobody's blocking them second and 15 Watson she gets it out towards the 15yard line that time to Qt Maddie brief loose is the defensive coordinator who's a top head coaching candidate who will tell you all about that front you just describe what without a doubt he was watching a football life and he told his wife hey stop and Wynette because I see something and he's what he saw was the Pittsburgh Steelers Joe green Ernie Holmes employing the double edged out blitz he calls then Rod Marinelli said hey coach let's put that in and he's brought that to Indy and he's using that he doesn't have the right personnel in a 43 and so he's using what he has and just designing defenses to get those guys loose and sitting there on his couch watching a documentary of Joe green next thing you know he's designing a defense off of it third and ten Watson trying to split him and get free but he is dragged down by big Marcus hunt at six foot eight well they're just moving a lot of line movement and Marcus hunt just sees it he comes back off underneath they know that if does Sean that clock goes off in his head he's gonna take off running so they're moving east and west and then collapsing that pocket when you don't have a spy on them and you said it both a lot of their personnel is three four guys so they're big and when you want to do that movement well guess what those big guys don't move as fast you want so change it up line them up in the a gap yeah we're Canelo a welcome by Daniel as he drives Rogers all the way back yardline and Rogers with a decentenough return but two three and outs for that Houston offense with our playoff clinching win over the Titans last week he reminded them just how far they've come remember this remember this from our early training camp meetings anybody remember that slide that was put up and then we did it we did something only two teams have done in NFL history and that's make the playoff if we won or five you graduate he put up that number 32 because there was an article at the Power Rankings and they were 32 and look at them now team that was one in five to ten and six and now up 14 zip here in the second quarter of this AFC wild card game it's amazing two things guys use the butcherblock material there's Jordan Wilkins getting his first work as he's able to get some extra yardage Aaron Dylan Cole you know Frank's done a really good job coming in here how he got the job from the Super Bowl I mean you know josh mcdaniels turns down that job he comes in he says he doesn't blink just I'm gonna take advantage this opportunity one in five after that start you know he starts growing the beard he looks like he you know he's working my god at the at the hunting range you know the Rams who got down there and just he he buys in with his players they they feel his authentic communication the way he goes about it he's a really good play caller sure is Patsey Eagles fans last year's offensive coordinator for that Super Bowl run look at how they've turned things around guys even think of what this Colts offense was a year ago when they were 30th in points allowed they were last in sacks allowed they made them massive improvement commitment to the offensive line drafting Quintin Nelson and then you turn that horseshoe the right way you get some luck you get Andrew back and all of a sudden you're 15 points allowed and you've only given up 18 cents and right now a major concern for Houston Jadeveon Clowney is down medical staff is out there we'll take a short break check in on what's going on with him sway to the medical tent at nine sacks this year for this Texans defense looks like maybe add a little friendly fire there helmettohelmet potentially with his own teammate hope he's okay get back out there this is the big third down for this Texas defense you don't want the post one on an extended drought especially when you're down 14 nothing they are four for four in converting third downs Indianapolis third and two empty will kiss Heinz came to the near side one as he goes right to that side to the reliable T white Hilton let's check in with Lisa hey Tess well Trudeau being cloudy went into the medical check with the unaffiliated neuro consultant so that tells us that he is being evaluated for a head injury thank you Lisa continue to check on his progress you know guys speaking of Frank right we discussed him here's the thing I like about Frank right he took this job not knowing whether Andrew Luck was going to be healthy or not he wanted the job he was the only guy to interview for the job that didn't ask him fists batted about Andrew Luck and not only did he get Andrew Luck you got the best version of Andrew Luck this year sure has and here he is on first down and here is completing the ball to a wideopen Inman as luck continues his hot hands well Nick Purcell and they go to a playaction this is a really good route by EM and on the outside they're gonna run the playaction and then when they fake it he pulls up he takes a shot outside that's what's going to slow down this pass rush and enmund his ability to be able to get separation to give Andrew Luck a nice easy throwing catch and then once again to match up with the corners from the Texans Kareem Jackson got turned around and fell down if the front seven doesn't get to look he's feasting on the secondary of the Texas 21 yard reception there the Dontrelle and men first down passes he drives it complete inside the 22 Eric Ebron 15 yard catch their clean pocket to work with huh yeah just another playaction they've being able to run that zone read where he comes over here max gonna fake it and it draws these guys all inside him there's a big hole for him to hit Ebron that's space by the linebacker that's created by that read of Matt really putting that thing sideline to sideline turning his shoulders to force those linebackers to have to run he's got Ebron and it's broken up at the last second by Justin Reed he did have him but Reed came in and threw his whole body at him to break it up and he is still down on the ground after that hit the rookie out of stanford who gives up 50 pounds to big Eric Ebron but take a look at Reid though good job turning his shoulder making sure he didn't get helmettohelmet contact you might have hurt himself a good job there so clowny walked off moments ago and now starting a wild card is brought to you by GMC live like a pro teams have never played each other in the postseason but boy are they familiar with each other after the regular season shows they put on and the overtime earn week and then the threepoint game again down here in week 14 bull scenes winning on the others home turf Wow touchdown and men eighteen yard strike from Andrew Luck well that's just a really good route by him and he's gonna sell it it's a corner route he gets right up on him in that little stick and then hits the corner good separation Charisse Wright was trying to play the post and Andrew was able to hang on it because he had time but what a route in the red zone for the touchdown and with Venna Terry out there who now is the second oldest player to ever play in a playoff game George Blanda was 48 when he kicked for Oakland in the mid 70s all the sudden it's 21 to nothing Dontrelle Inman who's had a circuitous path to success he was undrafted went to the CFL what a great cup there then he was with Nick saryati in the offensive coordinator Frank Reich with the Chargers traded to the Bears signed with the Colts and he's been pretty hot down the stretch from week 7 onward now four touchdowns without a doubt he got a great quarterback that's hot right now and with to meet a game as simple as this right now the Cotes feels supremely confident in the matchup of their receivers and tight ends against anybody the Texas are putting out there and if the front seven doesn't get there watt county or merciless they are killing the Texas secondary you're right bug it's 100% and the other part of that is they're 5 for 5 on third down so they're excelling these drives and they're getting more opportunities and when you do and you can run it efficiently then the playaction comes and these guys are just tearing apart on the back end boy and momentum matters doesn't it you better believe it does I mean everyone 9 out of 10 you know they've been playing for the playoffs since about week six they are well forged at this kind of setting here's Carter on the return as he gets it out to the 27 I know we had a stat about Watson down 14 nothing do we have one bottom down 21 but listen if there is a guy in this league that can come back with his legs and has the mindset to be able to do so it's deshaun Watson he just needs a he's gonna have to flip it right so you can't panic here still early in the second quarter look for him to extend it with his legs being able to get himself to get down the perimeter to get a couple first downs and then take his shot to Hopkins but he's got to be patient though this defense is designed not to give up big plays he's gonna have to hit the check down underneath and take him methodically as he will pull it and pick up a block from Griffin and then is what he offers we saw plenty of that out of Watson last week as he goes for nine yards on the ground and that's what it's going to take that's what they have to do one of the things Bill O'Brien does when he runs these zone reads is he has a lead blocker you see Griffin coming around is tight in so he's not hitting the perimeter without protection with his line and is tight in pulling out in space that's what you need you got to keep playing that way out of the shotgun get in some empty and allow him to attack and look for the coast to keep two safeties hard not giving up the big play here there was some movement both start up at the pretend 5yard penalty miss on Hopkins guy who never comes off the field he played 99.1 percent of their offensive snaps hope you know we talked about when you get in these games it goes back to the simple things you have to take the emotion out of it yeah right and number one is penalties taking care of the football put penalties they've had defensive false starts all sides now they've had often someone's just you can't happen thanks for a second and six little cat blitz off the side that they pick up and Hopkins able to get free for a first down just beyond the zr4 eight yards in for DeSean this is how he's got to play here get a little bit of uptempo play he's got Hopkins who's physical with his hands get a little up tempo what happens is this they play cover two they play soft it's much like being in a twominute and you just take it one possession in time that's all you have to do but but the pressure then becomes back on the defense when you're playing that soft pimp adult break you just got to take what you're getting because you still have a lot of football ALPA blue she was first hit there by Ridgeway the Falls ahead for four you know and so far on first down the Texans haven't been gaining a lot of yardage before that play six play is only 15 yards on first down they're getting behind the chains deshaun Watson then has to look into the cover to in his own coverage and you got to ask Bill O'Brien hey Bill we can't always look for the big play we have to be methodical I take the check down six Watson he gets it complete and that goes to Qt who is very happy to have back a 20yard catch for QZ Watson's gets good protection he sees it he's got a good arm inside the pocket that's the play that they need I would go up tempo now you're getting a little bit's the best drive you've had just take advantage of it now you see him calling at the line of scrimmage good protection for Watson this time and plenty of room to run as it gets to the outside and then dives ahead and that'll be a first down let's take a look at the coach as far as their defensive line you're going to see the guys come in the gaps in this Lane and here it's going to open up wide and that's where Watson is gonna hit it once it opens up the shower Watson as the defense we cannot open the middle of our defense up especially against a mobile quarterback like Watson he really likes to enter inside the AP cap he's not a guy that wants to extend on the outside desperate to get on the scoreboard this Drive has the look of it as he had a bit of pressure and through it short to Griffin it was Anthony Walker Shan more coming in for what happens then after you give up a big play a deeper flu says I'm gonna run a blitz they're gonna bring this pressure here and then slide him over the top and blues gotta pick that up he doesn't he comes across he misses that protection and now it's right in Watsons face even though he has it on the perimeter the backs have got a scam because after you give up a big player what's the deep it's a coordinator dude that's always with the Blitz yeah auntie look here on second and ten quickly gets it to Hopkins who somehow is able to slither his way and get ahead right to that line to make for 10 yards Watson's just understands that after you take a shot knowing that they're gonna potentially blitz just dump it out quick yeah and right after catch is a big part of that that's what he did on the last play well and he understands then a too high safety look that you're giving you that three or four yard pass and allow your guy to run out to get you make the play Watson we'll check down to blue and he is immediately met as we are under two and a half minutes here in this first half as Bill O'Brien Squad is hoping just to chip away a bit before halftime what an impressive first half for the Colts it has been and if I'm Bill O'Brien I'm thinking right now hey regardless of what happens this is four down territory field goals are not going to beat Andrew Luck the way he's slicing my defense up today and we're gonna hit the twominute warning he bran back Inman touchdowns for the Colts 21 to noon up weariness the tacks live halftime show Suzy Kolber Steve Young Lewis Riddick the fast start here what if Steve and Lou think is the answer for the Texans Plus rece Davis and Kirk Herbstreit they will get a set for the college football playoff national championship preview Bama and Clemson a fourth straight season and the college football playoff third in the title game Texas needs something here they took over on their own 27 the 9th play coming on this Drive second five Watson taken down that was Mohammed darting straight in and Tory on it as well where he comes back around on the inside he's over here he's gonna come back inside they're gonna try to pull this guard and get on the perimeter and Mohammed comes underneath gets right inside there a man short when you pull that guard just a good scheme by Mady brief loose to pull those ends back in there and get him maybe grab that face master but you know Maddie perfuse does a good job of allowing his guys to look to move he doesn't have that dominant oneonone rushes and so he moves guys around running twists and starts and allow guys to get pressure and another red zone sack as the most in the last 30 seasons now 15 times 13:14 coach you're gonna play this cover two and down you to throw it underneath by here they've been doing this for a long time in Tampa too and he does throw it at me and he gets it to Qt who's going to be about a yard short there 13 yards on the catch and I think you have to go for it as I said is 21 nothing there's no question Andrew Luck is torching your second deer you're gonna have to score touchdowns to win today that was a good response by Deshawn no more came off and got the interception earlier now he told QT hey widen out a little bit yeah there you go fourth down and one and a timeout is going to be called by the Colts what are you looking for here guys well I think you got to run the zone read if they give you the dive inside 420 hard to take it if not you have options so you can get DeSean out on the perimeter using his speed to get the first down you know I think the coach is gonna be a mantoman defense so if I'm the Texans maybe there's something with a little rub get Watson outside the pocket a little picker out now it either it's wide open or he takes off running he knows something about thick routes in the championship type atmosphere postseason play we're talking about Bama Clemson a little earlier so here it is fourth and one trailing by 21 piecing together this 10play Drive and it could be a QB draw good be there it's all coverage right now looks like it watson fourth and one goes to the end zone and incomplete looking for hopkins and it's a turnover on downs with a minute 20 before the half you know I really don't like the call there I mean you go to an empty set forth in one you don't have to score right there I mean yeah they got a chance and this is the throw with them dropping hunt back in there so it's really an eightman drop right because you just want you go empty they're gonna drop to eight guys instead just hammering in there get the first down and then you get a set of downs instead they got an eightman drop he can't get it over the six seven hunt well and the shot Watson has to be more accurate with that he didn't he didn't throw an accurate football Eber flukes went to deep zone and he dropped an extra guy so to Europe when he had eight guys in coverage and you have to be so accurate and precise on that throw but one of the reasons he drops him because they're an empty set you know and so that's the point I didn't like the formation and the call to allow Eber flues to drop fourth and one he didn't want to drop the guy until he saw the empty set now back to business with as a continued push there from Belinsky and that is not a good sign as Hopkins been take an early exit for half time here and trying to work on that leg pregame and he'll get a start before the rest of the team shows up and a timeout is called by Houston you know the Shawn Watson we know has to do a lot by himself here's the first half look at him now let me see the rush coming gets a sack Danny comes back and said you know what I think I have the hook rod no more comes in interception the interception and for me on fourth down he's got to be able to throw this ball accurately where DeAndre Hopkins can go make a catch and get you on the board he didn't do it he's out of trouble first half and now hop he's just going to the locker room somebody's gonna have to step up and help watch it in the second half there's math again and this team I'm back will go ahead for a first down is coming up on a minute to play here in this first half and he goes for nine yards you know and the thing that's gonna have to adjust and go into halftime for for Houston is look the Colts haven't punted yet I mean they have the tip ball they get the interception but other than that they haven't stopped them so does Shawn has to understand every possession is now critical yeah you need seven points and if they could have got points there knowing that they're getting the ball coming out the second half that would have been huge for them they get that swing opportunity instead sitting there with that Boucher and then there's this as Andrew Luck goes downfield looking for in men and Jackson had a pull on the Jersey and that's what I love about Frank right though right a lot of people say okay just run the clock out we're up 21 nothing on the road as the six seed no he's trying to go make it you know 28 I don't think it's a 24 he thought there were 25 but he stays in attack mode if there's ever been such a thing as a great penalty by Jackson this is a great penalty because this is a touchdown so listen I don't mind this penalty in this situation I'd rather give up 40 yards to give up another touchdown so I'm telling Jackson hey don't do that but good job on that one there you go play off though and allow him to throw it underneath and we can win with both of those but I don't think that's a good alternative situation will it appear that the Colts were going to be running the ball getting this thing to halftime to now put themselves in striking distance and that work sums it up doesn't it 23 yard penalty first down at the 45 the line again by JJ one remember he had the one earlier that ended up being intercepted by done here's a newsflash test III get it JJ Watt bettin balls but guess what they don't pay you as a defensive lineman the bad balls he's got to get to the quarterback great job getting your hands up but as a defensive lineman he's been threetime Defensive Player of the Year and I promise you he hasn't done that because he's batted balls in the second half he's gonna have to get to Andrew Luck to create a sense of urgency in the pocket because right now luck is way to comfort yeah and he's got his guy clowning on this side and here's one so the camp double team both of them ten we'll duck out of bounds before Cunningham could get to him he goes for three yards there 27 seconds remain in the one timeout for Indianapolis as they will be facing a third down you know one of the things about this Indianapolis line they've done a great job only 18 sacks but Andrew Luck deserves some of that credit because he's stepping up in the pocket he's not getting to the back there 10 11 yards deep he's allowed his linemen to run around the edge well guess what the Texans know that so clown he's coming back underneath with the inside rush and what Andrews doing a good job today is getting outside the pot so he's keeping these rushers guessing throughout the first half third down in seven number twhite Hilton's had success on third down he has three third down receptions all converted the first down what pumps pressures stand strong and then will be wrapped up by merciless as a flag is down just beyond midfield well Edmonds just dominated him on the outside and creamed Jackson's holding that's the second third time on this Drive we've seen him cream Jackson's having a hard time in the fifth row 25 penalty miss Jackson again Edmonds doing a really good job for veteran presence of getting up on their toes what that means is you've got to eliminate space as a route runner and when you do that then you have a twoway go he's running these out breakers and Jackson just continues to grab him and it was a big difference between veteran corners and old corners yeah we came into this game saying that Texas had veteran corners the coats are making them the goal good point take your time now now they are saying that's a catch at the 40th Pascal was close to the ground there as you got his hands down low take a look at the end of this I got his hands underneath that yeah that's a great catch and a timeout used by the Colts Colts with a 21 nothing lead and you size up the FCM and this is the six seed but it's the hottest team in the NFL with what they've done down the stretch of the season so if the Colts win the six moves to the worst remaining seed slot that would be at the Chiefs when I don't know that if that's the way it plays out I don't know that the Chiefs are dying to play those Colts team who would be late you know and so you look at tomorrow's game the Ravens and the Chargers them you can't say enough about that Ravens damn pants they've rally behind Lamar Jackson but you know what Phillip Rivers something about him it's all season long you just feel that buzz coming out with the Chargers I've said for the last couple of weeks I think the most complete team on the AFC side of the bracket is the Los Angeles chargers I think they start proving it tomorrow by the way there's seven and one on the road this season are the Chargers they're the Ravens so if you throw this ball in bounds you got to get up and clock it immediately second and four timeouts remaining pressure goes for downfield as he's looking for Ebron and he is out of bounds like to see him just drag that back foot that's a tough catch though reef does a good job challenge him that's the power of a tight end using his size and the pillar to go up there and get it just we can get that second foot down spoken like somebody who knows hit on great and look on pylon cam there's 10 seconds remain so now you don't have enough time probably Florida inbounds and get up and clock it and kick the field goal so right now everything is going to try to get out of bounds as you see Houston's defense is playing the sidelines then they get venit area chance they do go underneath can he get out as lessers was trying to work his way to the sidelines and they will hit double zeros and failed fourth and one at the 9 yard line when the Texans were trying to get on the board 21 zip Texans to get the ball to start the second half will join Suzy Kolber for the TurboTax Live halftime show starting right now literally we don't have any nonbelievers it's a young team but it's a team that's ready for this moment this is about now this is about every play every snap every moment all of a sudden it's 21 to nothing we have the heart they continue to fight the only place you're going is home right now the Texans may be staying right at home and not advancing if they can't get a spark here 21 is if and they're 1 in 50 for all time when trailing by 21 plus points luck against Watson well Andrew the top candidate for the NFL Comeback Player of the Year 191 passing two touchdowns wasn't sacked Watson threw a pick by the way the Colts were 6 for 6 on third downs all that success of dominating first half why did the Colts offense have so much success well they were able to be efficient with the running game and then what they did was they got their playaction game going down the field blowing with the max protection clean that pocket back stepping up and then after having a big target there he can go on the outside knowing that it's oneonone he has the space it's protected and he's taking full advantage of it and then you talk about the oneonone matchup here you see Inman turns Jackson around Jackson falls down on the ground then by the goal line it doesn't matter if it's Jackson Joseph here they have to reach right on him doesn't matter Inman has done an outstanding job in the oneonone situations and if Romeo Crennel and this defense don't figure out how to match up it's gonna be long second half no question you know there's that opportunity they have they went for it on 4th and 1 through to the end zone incompletion looking for Hopkins and there is Hopkins Murray trotted out early to get a jump start and get into the locker room Texans were / on fourth downs both were an indeed territory first of four wild car games Colts and Texans from here in Houston three touchdown advantage glad you're with us this afternoon Joe tessitura Jason Witten Berger McFarland and Lisa Salters from NRG Stadium in Houston Lisa what do you have for us they test well you mentioned DeAndre Hopkins went back to the locker room before the first half ended they were looking at his right shoulder Bill O'Brien just told me Hopkins is fine going back out there for the second half more importantly about his team though he said we've got to stop them on defense how many times did they have the ball Lee so he asked me and he said how many times did we stop him he's right the Colts had five possessions scored three touchdowns and they just ran out of time on that last one before the end of the first half 276 total yards as well ways as Watson is gonna have a good run to open up this second half and they've done well against the Colts in the two previous meetings to Texans offense scoring a touchdown on their first possession the second half in both of the meetings with the closest season was just gonna run the zone read and again he's got his tight end gripping and when he keeps it he's got a lead blocker coming around that's one of the best things that they've done with the running game he's got to take advantage of it that's the second time we've seen it today both of them been four big gains for him and then he can take his shots look he's been down there now he's just gotta take it one possession get it out of his hands first down they go to Miller and Miller will get out aside from this year he's got to feel pretty confident in what he did there right at the end of the half yeah all right and so obviously there was mistakes galore for the Houston Texans offensively in that first half but they were able to move it that's the formula get a little uptempo get the ball out of his hands and then allow him to do it as a runner and then take your chance on trying to find Hopkins down the field but this point you made earlier could have come away with some points there then gotten this opportunity here let's see what they offer up that is incomplete beyond to the outside of conference you know here's the thing coach O'Brien told us hey we're not built for 16 play drives okay we're gonna have to figure out a way to get some explosive plays now comes the chess match because the defense you're going against they're built not to give up explosive plays so now can you get your quarterback in the OC and the play call it to be patient against this defense you can't get 21 points at one time you can only get ones for they're down in three and that was batted away by Jazeera the air dizzier incredible back story of how he's arrived to this point in his career he had an interception against Watson back in wait for as well give him credit though I mean that's two plays he's right there he went for the break up instead probably could've got the interception but backtoback plays going against one of the top receivers in football and he answered it how about this defense they are dominating Bill O'Brien and deshaun Watson here this afternoon Daniel punting again and Rogers will fall for the scatter and it'll be down around the 11 yard line Andrew Luck will be back out there his first playoff start since 24 teams working out pretty well isn't it astok parody Twitter account that portrays Andrew Luck as a civil war officer this week captain Andrew hook put out dearest mother our celebration festivities were mighty but briefly begin our march to Houston to Thrace battle the Texans each unit has a victory over the other we shall drill among bowls to better understand their tactics I am equal parts confident and anxious boy should he be confident that thing has four hundred four thousand followers it is hysterical the portrayal of Captain Andrew Luck on Twitter with that neckbeard he could be one event going to those captains back in the day yeah that thing needs its own Twitter account so he starts this second half their first possession on the ground with Marvin Matt gets ahead to the 15 so as a nod to that fantastic parity under fire his first five seasons he was set to point two times per game pressure the third most of any player but the reinforcements arrive did they ever with the rookies on that offensive line and only 18 sacks given up this year the captain Andrew la well we just had a formula the formulas get the ball out quick you know don't allow those linemen to come after him leave it to linemen and then run the football and then the playaction and so it's working that formulas working for them today there's maca Gannon he is driven back that time big DJ reader and 347 pounds maybe yeah maybe I mean he looks about 350 but welcome to the playoffs DJ reader where you been all afternoon their ability to get penetration now once you do that beat the doubleteam linebacker comes up takes the doubleteam off as a defensive chop you split the crack and now you can make the tackle but this is the down right here with third down early in the second half you have got to get off the field at field text readers uh he's batting about 350 up they thought the night came to him my goodness left by the way on third down five of five with five first downs here he's facing a third and six can he stay that redhot gonna let me do it on the grounds yes as he ducks out and we'll move the chains and so finally Romeo Crennel says you know what I'm gonna bring pressure I'm not gonna get there with just watch counting and so he brings to that Cunningham merciless comes off the edge there's nobody there to get Andrew Luck and Andrew Luck scrambles for a first down so the adjustment has been made by Cornell we're going to bring pression now now Andrew Luck's legs come in to factor can you get somebody to bring him down and don't underrate that aspects of Andrew yes not trying to get back to work here on first down almost able to get free was wrapped up by house Frank right first year head coach spent two years his Phillies offensive coordinator of course won the Super Bowl help groom Wentz and then was able to oversee Nick Foles and that run and then gets the job after Josh McDaniels tax out and framed against the veteran Romeo Crennel on the great defensive minds generationally in the NFL second and seven orbit motion from Rogers on second and seventh look plenty of time to look downfield and it is thrown high and incomplete for Zack Pascal he still had a chance there Pascal he threw it up and the playaction has just really taken advantage of them Andre how comes back as his safety he returns back he can't get it but the playaction he has time he's able to step up as clowny comes in behind going oneonone out there and you know he's fighting he's going to get a good rush but Constanza to be able to put him around and allowing him to step up and this is the game there's 7 / 7 on 3rd down you talk about situational football that's what the Colts have done well today they're down in seven and that's the first time they will trot off in that situation incomplete looking for Rogers but once again you see the adjustment no longer are they going to sit back and allow the coach receivers to torch the DPS and Andrew look have a clean pocket they're gonna pressure they're bringing five and six guys they're gonna make luck throw under duress that time him and the receiver live off they get off the field on third down and Matthew closed he closed on that one too good job of seeing it knowing it's man coverage and taking away that space so we Roberto sánchez to punt to Carter as he skies this one a flag is going to reign in at midfield should be holding here here in the kid holy he's into words 39 10yard penalty name of the kick Houston ball first down come on what is the answer for the Texans and that guy offer it when we return I need for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award that recognizes NFL players who have made significant impact both on the game and in their communities Colts nominee is jabal Shearer winners going to be announced that NFL honors the night before Super Bowl 53 can learn all about the nominees nfl.com slash man of the air folks incredible stories when you go there to see the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award nominees Watson escapes for the moment and then throws incomplete I'm just amazed guys everyone talks about this this Tampa to defense and this defense is old its antiquated this defense has six Super Bowls on its resume for with the Steelers one with the Bucs and one with the coats it's a system that's not complicated it's built on effort zone defense and mattie brief loose and the coats they play 75% zone and they are shutting the Texas out today one of the reasons why he broke loose is one of the hot names among the head coaching candidates and here's another guy who has been held in check the great new popkins that's a loss of three as Toure comes up with the tackle and that's the other thing but they run and this is kazeer on Hopkins does is only catchy make him work for it they're early to 0 but deserves challenging him making him it not having being on the same page with Watson which they been all year and he's just playing this little catch technique though he's got long arms he's not allowing Hopkins to use his link in his leverage to get separation it's covered him 22 times Hopkins has two catches on four targets only 16 yards against 20 12s got a check down underneath to Miller who couldn't get to the line there as he was trying to split defender sheared and Leonard come up with attack 11 yards there but that's the thing it's third and 12 they're gonna drop back play Tampa to will give you 11 yards as long as you don't get 12 that's the beauty of this defense you can have the check down all day if you want to you have to punt we get the ball great design great job great coverage by this coast defense we'll pressure on Dennis Rogers they'll feel this at the 16 gesture Rogers on the return he's brought down at the 22 and another three and out for the Texans their third of the afternoon the O'Briens offense being shut out Baker Mayfield say Quan Barclay the splash rookies in the league you want to talk about the guy who may be the most dominant young player in the NFL quit Nelson starting guard he's been incredible you know and I had a rookie come in set in Zack Martin and this is what he reminds me of he's physical and he it's a mindset he wants to finish to the echo of the whistle that's clouding he's going against as a rookie make those type of plays he brings it in the whole offensive line has right behind him I think he heard us talking about him cuz it looked like you flinch there off its gonna fix it I've got penalty you think about these two rookies what an incredible job they did in hitting this jackpot Quinton Nelson and Darius Leonard yesterday they got the news that they are allpro you have to go all the way back to 65 to Gale Sayers and Dick Butkus two alltime legends that rookies on the same team being named think about those two names I just said you know and for Darius Leonard to make first team all role and not make the Pro Bowl shame on everybody that voted on the Pro Bowl if this young man didn't get it to fix the system then ya fix this this yeah yeah between the fan vote coaches the players obviously the allpro is something that you look at you say close to the best friend we judged on the way you want to see a judge done what amazes me about Leonard though is not only is he a sideline sidelines player 165 tackles but it's seven sacks yes it's more for an inside bananas the play like that and make those sacks not only 44 times coming after the quarterback he came up with that number led the NFL tackle second and 15 that's a get after luck and he escapes tucks runs and gets out at the 27 credit incredible ability to escape the pocket by Andrew Luck we've seen it over and over not only setting up and throwing it down the bill but doing it as a runner you know and seize it come in once again chronic comes with the inside swim move and allows him to get on the perimeter and let me say something look if you're Bill O'Brien you had fourth and less than a 1 down 20 more nothing you don't go for that you decide to punt you're telling me that you think your defense can get a stop for you because this is the drive right here but they're gonna get a stop and then you believe your office can get something going if not then you got a question the decision to go forward on the fourth and one so here's the opportunity for that stop and wait clock running down third down and five incomplete as he was being pursued that time by Ejiofor and that's a nice job by roaming your canal in this defense your head coach had faith in you planning on fourth to one now defense get to stop but where's the office it's gonna where is the off it's coming from down 21nothing your offense has to get a drive forward somehow someway they're gonna have to figure out somebody to make some plays besides Hopkins and Watson all of a sudden you look up at luck in the second half over for since halftime directional hunt this time from Sanchez his Carter feels it near the sideline 45yard punt USAA and the NFL pay tribute to our armed forces through the salute to service there's Bhavana Terry the brother of full sticker Adam served as a major in the Army three tours of duty for bow to an Afghanistan one employee and you want some family history when it comes to salute to service that's Felix Benna Terry Adams greatgreatgrandfather who was the band master for Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer that's my kicker that test Superbowl baby you got that ring on proud they're 46 year old Adam Bennett Aires we told you now the second oldest player to ever play in a playoff game see on tape Foreman gets a carry here second year out of Texas enacted last week didn't lay against Philadelphia a couple of weeks ago and I would go uptempo offense right now and DeAndre Hopkins gonna move him around we've seen him be the single receiver put him inside in the slot get some pick game going allow him to do that but it's got to change momentum got to go up tempo see Hopkins number two receiver to the near side pointing in the slot there on second and seventh as they go underneath on the drag to Qt who's got a little bit of speed as you see the acceleration to midfield that's exactly what I do now you got the first down go up tempo right away change it up and what cutie brings to you is no one that Hopkins getting all that attention he gets through there it's the mantoman rub route we saw it on the other side change it up Hopkins seems like something bothering him a little bit he's having a tough battle yeah well guess what the other guys have to step up in and take advantage of it just like they did puck it's only 24 yards receiving here today they'll head out of the backfield couldn't hold on to it at midfield you know QT missed those games now he's back it's given the guys an extra weapon will fuller got hurt they traded for Demaryius Thomas they need more weapons on this offense and an offence with only one weapon at receiver in a quarterback this coasts defense is doing a good job of containing that they're gonna have to become more multiple on the Texas side we just can't capitalize right now now get a big play then potently right read by watching the throw it underneath to form it it's gonna be a 17yard run ya gain incomplete drop second and ten got it cutie here he is again and he's gonna be close to that line to make as Darius Leonard put him down hard when she Wilson was following in coverage and that is a first down for the Texans and now go let's go get up tempo get going a little bit here does Sean take advantage of it this deep in Brandon apples they play with such unbelievable effort yeah now make them feel like they're on their heels a little bit but notice what we talked about they're gonna give you that underneath stuff they're giving it to them now Watson is hitting it you got to move the ball methodically down the field against his duty got one on one with Hopkins and steady checks down to Miller and Miller unable to get TAS gathers five yards they're trying to get Hopkins he's inside he's gonna run a little skinny post but look at the zero how he's just playing so tight with him good job by Watson reading it out checking it down underneath we talked about this year the guy's been waived by three teams he was a fourth round pick of the Browns he's ball in today's second and five Watson stays alive Griffin Griffin did a really good job working that route you know and when he has opportunity he's gonna take it down the field he sees he's got Walker here's Griffin has the tight end he's going to go up and then come back underneath it and gets Walker turn completely at the top of that route and watch him do a good job avoiding now just lay it in there baby and you look at you thinking they haven't had a ton of those opportunities but you know he had Vincent earlier and now he had Griffin missing those not being able to take advantage of it puts him into third down yeah Houston dismissed on her last five third downs here's third and five Watson try to run for it and he will get it as a flag is down we will check on that back at the 40yard line for now it's an eight yard run from deshaun Watson we're gonna be holding holding office number 66 then your penalty and at the end of that play the veteran safety Mike Mitchell the stain down I mean the coach that bring a little pressure off the edge yeah anytime you do that well what happens with and they disconnect you got to get out yeah you got to take an injury timeout as they look at Mike Mitchell me me and Witten 240 let's go as right now it's that defense that just keeps going with Kenny Moore coming in and taken down to Shaun Watson they have seen too much of that this year of Watson taking hits and going down well it's just a blitz with Kenny Moore coming off the edge and into Shawn never really see it he thought is picked up turned his back on it you know that was a costly sack there because really that was four down territory sure so you're trying to get half of it back potentially to give yourself a chance on fourth down instead take the sack forced upon fifth time in Texans face third and tenth or longer and they're old for five I saw Mike Mitchell go down earlier Lisa what can you tell us yeah test right now 10year veteran Mike Mitchell strong saftey headed back to the coach locker room looks like a left foot injury of some kind they dropped the card over to help him get back to the locker room he declined said he wanted to walk there helping them back there now I'll have an update boy I wanted it and you know Lisa we discussed this week that Mitchell's a guy who's really been a mentor to this young Colts secondary all year Quincy Wilson has been very open and discussing the credit he gives up and Chris mallard the GM signed them with that intention of serving as a veteran leader and coaching up this defense that right now is got that shutout against Houston 21 to nothing here in this AFC wild card game is they're trying to get themselves with the number one seed the cheese as he works it Chester Rogers I tell you what book that hit the pro ball yeah I'll do the dline drills with you yeah and then you do the receiver drills Quechan drills with me right and then they will let the Twitter then call that Twitter noise out there about your Monday night crew you know will let them be the judge on how we turn out I tell you what I like your chances though can you imagine hey I do have a touchdown reception in my career by the way just so you know there may be a little bit of a gap in differential and sizing that standup between two of you second and four that's a good cut that time by Mac look at Mac we this way past midfield missed tackles by the honey badger and Andre how 29 yard run by Marlin Mac watch Nelson no he comes down on the down block he secures it all you're looking for is space and if their guard can knock the deep its alignment into the other gap guess what you open up a huge Lane for your running back and then he gets to the second level Nelson just the ability to be able to move defense alignment in the first two seconds of the play it's incredible to watch and if I'm the coach right now let's just run the ball this is an attitude drive right now let's put the Texans out of that measurement your physical football what play action on purse down as it's short of tea why Hilton who is cutting to the outside this offensive line her Indianapolis has made such a difference in every way oh it's just the it's the formula that was a priority for them in the offseason you know they used first two rounds they went and got Britain Smith as the right tackle initially they drafted me a guard he's doing a really good job filling in there and play him well the course Quinn Nelson what he's done and then the playaction and the quick throws and just another one Andrew missed that throw but you can see what he was doing Andrew Luck today twentyeight drop backs no sacks as Wilkins goes ahead for a three you know you have to give kudos to Chris Fowler because he came in here and he remade this team a physical football team we're gonna build this team up the middle the previous coach Chuck Pagano and GM Ron Grigson they didn't do that this team was a soft football team Chris Balan has done a phenomenal job of addressing the middle up the offensive line and they're not done you know depots they still have work to do but this defense is playing pretty well today third down and seven Texas upbringing pressure luck sees it he's going to hit he brought on the track again incomplete you probably should have now Chris Ballard you mentioned him remember he was with Andy Reid in Kansas City he's the guy that was helping out with that draft of Travis Kelce and Tyriq Hill and putting together what Kansas City has right now so they may be visiting each other yeah and you know the thing about Chris Ballard two is not just what he did with the draft but when that happened with Josh McDaniels yeah I'm out in the press conference said hey we're not fazed by and then when the team started one in five he sent a text out to the entire organization don't panic it's gonna work out boys I think it's panned out pretty well for him directional is trying to get a pin inside the 10 here put it down there so if this score holds then you will see this redhot cold Steam travel to take on the number one seed and there are the Chiefs of course Patrick mahomes expected to be the NFL MVP 50 passing touchdowns the combination of Kelsey and Tyree kill but I'll offer up this on the chief so you take a peek at that defense when they need the big stop when you're playing pressure football do you trust that defense you know I want to but I just don't trust him enough you know and look though I'll say this about the cheese they don't they're not afraid to win 52 49 if they have to do it I'll give you that there's the option with Watson as he's able to get past the initial charge there of course there is the history with Andrew Luck the 2013 comeback in the wild card against the Chiefs they trailed by 28 points in the third quarter and then here came all to match if importing the fumble and five yards out then late in the fourth quarter hitting T white Hilton for the 64 yard touchdown the miraculous comeback as the Colts won that 45 to 44 after the play I'll give you another little bit of history yeah please I'm gonna test you after the flood no no no no jeopardy here in the middle of a broadcast but Lamar Miller there on our Super Bowl run yes hard weekend wouldn't we be that's B what do we be well you got the ring on the Kansas City chief that's you like history Larry Johnson that physical running get up for at 4:00 know I believe franchise history yes the Chiefs I saw you're rockin the jewelry's playoff football just what we play for right now test speaking of magic test Houston Texans offense he's a little that tests magic let's see if they could get some here Oh bobbled around in the hands up this year but he couldn't hold on for the interception but you just can't say enough about de xira challenging hopkins playing physical catching it him again and then he just knows where he wants to go there I mean staying on top of him and he then he's catching him he's not allowing Hopkins to get his body on him matched up pretty well you know something that's coming into play that's a couple of time Watson has looked at Hopkins saying I thought she was gonna do this no you did that Hopkins hadn't practiced a lot so maybe the miscommunication is happening because of that not pretty is it not in third and ten and I think the answer is now get back to their crossing route somebody forced these guys they're gonna spot drop get deep and then they're gonna try to rally inside and use your speed Hopkins is off right now he's had an incredible season what he was able to do with 115 catches but today is not his day so these other guys got to step up and fill in looks like he's banged up a little bit on the outside well the problem is where are the other guys will Fuller's hurt the Mary's Thomas is hurt who are the other guys that are going to step up you gotta say your routine Anson Smith a wookie this is third and ten as he goes to Aikens rookie tightend out of UCF and you have to go for it here on fourth down you know you can't it's too late in the ballgame to think that you would pun it well here's the thing I say if you go for it now and you don't get it the game's over all right your biscuits in the game is over with an entire quarter to play that's why I would be a little hesitant I like being aggressive but I will still be a little hesitant in the third quarter I love that spot I thought it a little bit closer than that it's gonna leave him a fourth and three so here they are from their own 33 yard line this is when he needs Hopkins up top just hasn't looked like is all fro self today fourth and three and he gets it complete for the musthave first cutie now tempo let's go get the tempo rolling you need three possessions and three scores you have to get your tip for one right now don't like the humbling up about Watson and O'Brien they have to have a little bit more sense of urgency here as we near the end of Ward 3 I like the call dough by Bill O'Brien in that you know moment to be able to go for it on fourth down knowing where his football team debt likely the final play of this third quarter Watson just dives ahead to the 44 there have only been four instances of a 21point playoff comeback Colts are looking to hold on to this big lead and advance end of three Houston Texas home to this AFC wild card game now whether you have the cowboy hat we're the Longhorns on there it hasn't been a pretty day starting this fourth quarter down three touchdowns move up the road a few hours to Dallas to see the next wildcard game only second time the two NFL postseason games played in Texas on the same day Miller hoping for something as he crosses midfield and that will give them the first down the 8 yard run I mean you down three scores and we're still hovered enough something's not right with that fish and now you got the ball plus territory yeah you think this is a possession they got a score on this Drive right here to have a chance stay in this game Watson looking over his options comes Crossfield and gets it complete to hopkins who falls down there with a 13yard reception and this is the formula she said the last two plays run the zone read and then come back with the play action off of it he escapes gathers himself and gets hopkins on a deep ovary and hopkins has a good feel for Watson they seem going on the concert and then finding he looks around find the sauce behind the zone find the open area come back with the other way now looks left and has to come back to it as he's able to get it into QT and we remind you of what we showed earlier in terms of franchise history that the Texans have a 1 in 54 record when trailing by 21 or more points that includes the playoffs got to go back to that one win being 2013 against the Chargers there have only been four times in NFL playoff history that there's been a comeback from 21 points where's Frank Reich has the most famous of all we showed you Andrew Luck against the Chiefs Pat's Malkin Super Bowl and then the Niners and Giants and the O three wildcard as well as Miller's will go ahead for five what was second and three I'm putting together a nice little drive here you just wonder what took three quarters to get this going but it doesn't matter at this point now you have to score a touchdown on this drive to give yourself any opportunity win this game heck we felt that way just before half down exactly and they went for it on fourth and one and through and complete in the end zone 12th play here of this Drive for the first down at the 22 Watson checked a Miller who makes the first man miss reverses course and surges ahead for nine you don't see Darius Leonard this happened to him very often he's gonna dump it down to Miller Leonard does such a good job usually closing 165 tackles on the air led NFL yeah and give Miller credit just taking it dumping it down and then allow him to do it with the run after catch second in 1 Watson reaches over to try to get that complete it's a big Jordan Aikens and that mark will give them a first down with all his time I mean if the clocks are ticking you're down three scores bring it up and if you're Matty Bruce you're okay we've given up I know we don't want to go up touchdown but if it takes them this long the score touchdown hey that's the best is maybe not the best of both world but that is good for you that they took a lot of time off the clock pressure off the edge they pick it up he gets it to fool on the outside who quickly tries to turn the mortar against Darius letter that's six yards there for Alfred blue Andrew Luck whoops on open that clock counts down and he can get a date with Patrick mahomes in a divisional round are you taking if that matchup happens book well we got all week to talk about that I do pose that question about the Kansas City defense to you know word they posed that question to themselves Watson is hit on his last seven once is the offer on second and four as he tried to go underneath to the two yard line to Qt he's covered by Anthony Walker and the coats are not just gonna give the touchdown up he's and that's two plays in a role they've brought the nickel back off of the wide side of the field they're bringing five right now trying to make the Jean Watson feel like he has pressure and then still zoning up behind us and he's got to decipher a read man who zone and get the ball and deliver it to the right receiver you talk about utilizing the clock this is the 16th play coming up of a sixminute drive when you need urgent see they need a scorer desperately beauty reaching for that pylon touchdown that extra effort Toodee fumble it watch the balls starting to come loose it's a touchdown on the field there may be something and touch back that balls loose does he have control that ball is coming loose right there all scoring plays are reviewed so no one needs to challenge all scoring plays a review this was going to be countless all it has to do is break the first even speck of light on that plane but he's got to have control though he does ruling on the field as a touchdown we'll take a short break and come up with it on the field does stand as a touchdown watch the ball just break the first instance of the plane and nothing after that matters great effort by QT though and sometimes all you need is a little break like that and rally your team and give yourself a chance with a to score game with eleven minutes to go now here's a question do you onside kick right now it's less than 11 minutes to down to four do we want side kick here I would kick it deep look you still gotta believe in your feet fence of getting the stop they're gonna have to you can't just play that game the rest of the way I would get kick it deep believe your defense can get a stop it but just needed a drive like that deshaun Watson look this is what he does he has a short memory forget about what happened the first lap first three quarters put together a good Drive and you know what give himself a chance dumping it down to qt not forcing it and the young player having some urgency reaching that ball out and get it in and you know it was close but all it matters they gave it to him the rookie from Texas Tech who had missed the last five games dealing with the hamstring he was great against Indian week four had 11 catches for a hundred nine yards there in that overtime win and comes up big right here desperate times here in the fourth quarter 21 seven now and we've been waiting on someone besides DeAndre hop step up cutie has done that playing really really well then been targeted 12 times 10 catches for 96 yards keke 30 let's look at the Genesis total replay well the Colts have been able to get this running game going because of the lineman up front gate maxed almost got a hundred yards rushing through the first time the Houston Texans giving that up pull the tackle bringing Smith come across Nelson on the down block creating space for him to run in get it on the perimeter making the secondary guys miss what max done that's allowed all the big play actions on the back end look this Houston team defense they're going to come after him here luck needs to be smart with the football right now look goes short that time Zinman that's a four yard catch remember indan had the touchdown that made it 21 than nothing that was with six twenty four before the half you know Frank Reich told us going into this game he says we got an out brush to Houston Texas it doesn't matter what it is we just need out rush woman right now they're doing a pretty good job of it 143 rushing yards compared to Houston 72 he felt like that was the formula showing up Marlon Mac sitting at 98 yards Texans and the Colts I probably haven't given up closer to the our lecture this year and look if you think can get a stop right here we got ourselves a ball game goes up telling you Matty brief loose if there's one guy you don't want to go against in these type of games that can play big in the big moments it's deshaun Watson you hear the fans right now they're coming alive you might have ourselves a football game and if you're Romeo Crennel right now you're DPS have been a liability I'm bringing pressure up the middle make it Andrew Luck move his feet to throw the football I'm not gonna allow this guy to sit back there in the pocket here to come third down in five look with time and he goes to T Y Hilton Hilton had been shut out in the second half until that absolutely clutch for 20 yards what a catch snow by dy dragging his feet at the end of it getting separation on Jackson on Jackson's right arm nearly in the path of that ball but look just able to get it in and that is the 4th 3rd down catch 40y Hilton that's kind of the story today toe coach receivers dominating their individual matchups against the Texas defense when that taken down by McKinney Lisa hey test check out how to I open arrived here at the city of this afternoon in a clown mask it goes back to earlier in the week he was asked about his success here at NRG Stadium he said it's like a second home to me both Texans corner Jonathan Joseph didn't like that remark said that's for clowns I asked you why what was the message he wanted to send by wearing the clown mask and he said that the clown is in the building I'm here he's hoping to get the last last year what a scene that was when the team arrival second and eight now under 8 and a half to play here first the four intriguing wild card matchup this weekend it is batted by Cunningham and it falls on oculus Lee at the 35 you saw Cherise right saying ball ball balls it floated high they're getting their hands up knowing that ball is going to come out quick Cunningham just comes right inside with that blitz finally couldn't find it in the air bringing that pressure we haven't seen that much today where guys have come free create another third down and you know dy Hilton you know it's clever and cute I guess but you know you're gonna put that cat and mouse game you better show up and deliver and he has today the war of a third down these home fans have been so patient all day looking for a stop here what getting after it luck escaping mckinney pursuing flag is down most likely holding as luck goes out for three yards there on what was third and eight holding offense of a 50 cent family declined to play yeah and when this defense needed to play let's take a look at JJ Watt coming off the end they're gonna bring pressure he puts one arm longer than two he's trying to turn the corner just the effort McKinney what they needed a stop they had to get Andrew Luck off the spot they did a nice job now they give the man with the S on his chest a balk and Watson drop him down and get a score where he goes Sanchez on the punt he was third and net punting this season in the NFL will Carter get a chance for consensus get a pin as it bounces inside the 10 and then floats out so now the stage is set for the Shawn Watson trailing by just under 8 minutes to play reminder that SportsCenter with the incredibly wellprepared and entertaining Zubin Mahanta comes away at 10:00 Eastern on ESPN everything from this game plus reaction with Clemson Duke and Mavs Sixers a Sports Center following college basketball on ESPN also available always on the ESPN app second straight drive starting at their own 11 Shawn and the Texans trailing by 14 steps up stays alive gives a pump and goes ahead for a first down how about Watson here he comes man he forgot about all that other stuff he just said all right new possession down 14 you know huts coming free around the edge steps up if you forget about the speedy ad get the first down right after he takes off running and this on the comeback of an ACL and then the punctured lung and now he gets a complete 2qt and all the sudden you can sense the momentum but listen gasps it's okay I've listened having played in this system it's proper to notice what the clock is doing the clock is still moving they need to scores baddie proof loose is more than willing to give up these underneath throws as long as they don't give up anything big over the top I think even flu stir like they're fine that's the defensive coordinator who reportedly will be meeting with the Cleveland Browns to discuss their head coaching vacancy pressure off the edge watch him through to the inside looking to check down to Lamar Miller so so we've been talking about the cover two all day here's what it is it's two safeties deep they're gonna drop you can't give up the big play and you have five zone droppers underneath now you want the ball is supposed to be blown underneath and now you have everybody rallied to the tackle that's what the cover to does it takes the big play away deep has seven sets of eyes looking at the ball carrier they're gonna force the bar underneath and when it's thrown they rally and make the tackle and then they mix it up with a little bit of pressure off the edge and that's that's the formula for Matty broke loose Griffin was open but slipped down and is incomplete as the ball was thrown low into the inside jabal sheared was coming after watson at the end of it this is the end of the plate in their midfield as you see Griffin just couldn't get his hands fully underneath the balls he was reaching back further you know it's the one thing that we talk about with these quarterbacks I'm like you guys I am amazed at what Watson can do outside the pocket but isn't it amazing playoff football throwing the football and delivered it from the pocket we've seen him miss a couple of bows where he's bounced that he's overthrown it you still have to play quarterback from the pocket in this lead and right now watching this struggling today doing that is this a spot where he can overcome it third down and ten for the Texans Watson pressure underneath Miller tried to reverse course but is taken down by Leonard after six yards there so that'll be fourth down now for Bill O'Brien and the Texans well and so when they are playing that cover from the offensive standpoint there's areas to attack you know where the holes are and what you're doing and that's why it's so critical right now on this fourth down to attack it Hopkins to the nearside stacked in front of QT on 4th and for Watson has to have it can it get it with his legs yes and more still on the go and finally dragged down at the 36 yard line the 21 yard rod on fourth down for the Shawn Watson well here crossing routes going across and he just finds that we said he likes to step up in the feet gap and then he has that little fake and Leonard wants to come off he sees him running but he has that little fake with it does it and it just buys him an extra step and he has the speed to take a 12 yard game and turn it into 20 25 yard games in a hurry clock coming up on five and a half minutes to play next down again Miller goes to the inside and Miller will have another first down so one of the things that happens in that book if you are going to force from the throw it underneath they're gonna rally attack yes and it's an example and you're seeing Miller who's traditionally used as a first and second running back doing a good job with his run after catch after he catches the football 76 yards rushing for deshaun Watson today that's twice two coats of missed tackles in the zone defense here comes pressure they pick it up but they can't escape Hassad Ridgeway Stewart and Ridgeway collapsing on Watson third sack of the afternoon for the Colts they're gonna bring Morel at the edge up top and then that is not gonna get him across late and collapsing and then he has to step up and what he's doing when he's bringing pressure is he's bringing that backside deep it's tackle looping him back around knowing that Watson's gonna run pressure off the edge wants it on second and 10 drives the fall short over the middle again to your point book that's the point we're talking about you have to stand up and deliver the football into pocky with accuracy and timing there holes in the zone deshaun Watson has got to make this throw that'll be the next step in the maturation of him we know he's a phenomenal athlete but in crunch time and playoff football when it's win or go home you got to make that throw well there's a soft spot right in there but behind the linebackers in before the safeties 15 yards right on the hash and you know he can those quarterbacks can throw that with our eyes closed yeah today he's having a difficult time with it leaves them with a third and ten again corner pressure again he steps up and that was nearly picked off by Leonard as he stepped in front with those long arms he's a sixfoot to rookie linebacker but he has the wind span of somebody who's 610 somewhere the great Derrick Brooks is saying son picked that it's a touchdown and game over I've seen him do it many at times when you're a weak side linebacker he's dropping back he's reading Watson's eyes and there he is he's just got to get a little bit more to catch that football distillers head jag jag ham the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hair Derrick Brooks hey how dare is Leonard a god I think can be in the same ilk as those guys so here is 4th down and 10 they need the Indy 14 yard line to keep it going fourth and 10 Watson incomplete wasn't even close ask anymore what's coming in hard and it's another turnover on downs about Kenny Moore though coming over inside on the slot blitz Fortson deshaun Watson it throw it and that might be the ballgame boys ESPN's NFL wildcard is brought to you by Burger King try the six dollar King bucks including one classic entreprise to drink to cookies only at pk here in Houston Joe tessitura Jason Witten voter McFarland Lisa Salters with you coverage of the AFC wild card first game of these NFL playoffs as the Colts take over after the turnover on downs and luck will run to the left side and he will stay in bounds Texas will have four clock stoppages the three timeouts of course a twominute warning well they brought Kenny Moore inside he faked outside came underneath and he walks Miller back into him and Watson just didn't have the time he needed the throw he's got guys open at the end of it his balance kits knocked off you see his finger there deshaun Watson this is bleeding and quickly went over to the bench they were taking care of that trying to stop that bleeding applying some pressure there it's been the comeback stories right for so many stars in this game you don't lose track of what deshaun Watson went through this year Bill O'Brien is so much respect for him not just the fact of coming back from the ACL but suffered a punctured lung and injured ribs week five against Dallas went on to play the next week that had to have a road trip to Jacksonville they were concerned of whether or not even get on a plane so he goes and makes a twelvehour 800 mile bus trip he is tough he wouldn't just any bus now I think this is a luxury bus baby test here's Matt trying to go straight ahead we'll leave them with a third about two we've got a hundred yard rusher against the Texans in Mack both these teams been outstanding and not giving up the big plays on the ground this year one timeout remains first time are you yep both teams had not allowed 100 yard rusher this year well Houston's defense looked big the coach didn't even punt in the first half yeah right it had four possessions where they forced puns they've rallied up got stops and certainly none are bigger than this one right now there's third down as Mac is gonna try to push ahead we'll see where they mark him here as merciless and reader combined for the stop there yeah I think he's got it boys it's pretty close a little bit of a push back yeah and Houston's gonna utilize their final timeout what a year for Frank Reich huh what a great visit we had with him yesterday I'm talking about the pie in and way he wanted to really explain to this team that even at 1 in 5 you don't give up hope you can make incremental gains little by little and that's what they did and then came the win streak and the surge to the playoffs you know it's amazing I was visiting with some KOAT staffers before the game and they talked about sito's measurement here get off the credit card that's the first down you know test they talked about maybe we didn't get the initial guy we wanted but we got the right guy yeah no doubt about this the right guy for this organization is Frank Reich and he's come in and everybody's bought in and everybody's drinking the koolaid Chris Ballard on down and it's gonna be fun to watch I don't know what they're gonna do if they're gonna win this game next week against Kansas City but it's gonna be fun to watch them build this team from the ground up the way they started to do this year barring a miracle finish here with 347 we would see Indianapolis at Kansas City next Saturday at 4:35 Eastern that would leave Baltimore or the Chargers to decide who plays at New England next Sunday at 1:05 Eastern should be a lot of a lot of Marlin back here nobody seen plenty of him today 21 carries for a hundred and four yards he has been sensational down the stretch of the season as Matt will continue to work it and then we're gonna wrap things up here and get ourselves a nice dinner on both width and watch her former team the Seahawks and the Cowboys to see who advances there I think Eagles and Bears is a fascinating matchup but coming up later tonight few hours north of us Seahawks and Cowboys it'll be their second playoff meeting alltime dare I bring up 2006 wildcard playoff in Romo don't throw out snap in the holes I'm just doing my job with it's not Whittle shy of the goal line but this Cowboys team and what they've been able to do with that defense those speedy linebackers and Zeke Elliott you talk about two teams committed to running today we'll see how it plays out tonight's second and seven for now and max2 its total and more spinning past midfield what a day for Marlin Mack 15 more yards and you know with that run right there I've been waiting all year to do it but former Dallas Cowboy dandy Don would say turnout the party's over oh it's over and the six seed is advancing yeah ten out of the last 11 incredible JJ Watt was reaching for his wrist there in outstanding year in a comeback effort for last year's Walter Payton Man of the Year 16 sacks course threetime NFL Defensive Player of the Year banged up his elbow last week last couple years been tough with injuries only played eight total games had the neck surgery in 2016 and then the broken leg last year and here's the thing I start to wonder about this Texas defense you got veteran corners or old the way the coats have made them look today you got watch been banged up merciless is a veteran player is the window closing for this Houston Texas defense we thought they were a win now team let's see where they go in the offseason I mean think about the future of this team look at Matt Marlin Matt just shredding through this defensive front twenty six more yards for Mack memory missed four games came back and he has been phenomenal today back here in Houston reminds you that you can catch the GMC postgame for analysis and breakdown of this AFC wild cards part of SportsCenter airing on ESPN Frank Reich starting to
