============================================================

welcome to college football ah yes presented by Hampton by Hilton here watching the SEC on ESPN the number two team in the country on the road in primetime as number two Alabama night and all makes the 90 mile drive to Starkville the base number 16 Mississippi State the crowd is loud and hostile and Alabama likely will be number one next week if they can win this game because Georgia the current number one getting blown out at Auburn 4210 with just a few minutes left in that game Wisconsin a winner big over Iowa so four unbeaten teams left an FBS entering this level and hi everybody alongside Greg McElroy I'm Dave Pasch look at Tom luginbill in a minute well Greg Alabama has won 30 consecutive regular season games going back to the Ole Miss game in 2015 but this is a tough place to play especially at night you played here with Alabama the current quarterback for Alabama jaylen hurts he's been so poised great he's only turned over once all year he's done a tremendous job and so many people look at jaylen hurts they say where can he improve well he's 23 and 1 as a starter so top to a pretty dang good start but if you look at the way he works in the pocket there is a little bit of an issue with sometimes trying to escape a little too early he did a great job last the pressure in the pocket moving while still remaining a passer and keeping his eyes downfield right here on third down stepping up hitting Ridley over the middle but of course jaylen hurts he's got to be an athlete he's one of the best runners at the quarterback position in college football and if you don't contain him with your pass rush he can get out on the edge and make big plays happen the numbers will pedestrian but he took a big step forward maybe even a bigger challenge tonight though Tom luginbill going against the South Mississippi State defense well there's no question dragged in the guy to keep an eye on up front is number 94 Jeffrey Simmons he's the Lord daddy he's a disruptive guy that gets gonna be tasked to stopping those inside runs it is imperative for Mississippi State on defense to put Alabama and obvious passing situations which means winning on first and second down versus that stable of running backs now this is a defense has been opportunistic they create turnovers this is a team that turns turn in two points and if you're gonna beat Alabama it's tough to do it without them helping you they points they need to have a breakdown in the kicking game you to take those turnovers seven turnovers have been forced by this Mississippi State defense three of them returned for touchdowns something like that happened tonight for Mississippi State to have an opportunity during this fourgame win streak for Mississippi State it's not just about causing turnovers it's about great plays by the quarterback Nick Fitzgerald who has rushed for over 100 yards in four straight games the first SEC quarterback to do that in 20 years and talk to the Nick Saban last night he's concerned yeah I mean lake Fitzgerald just from an athletic standpoint is as good as any in college football he hasn't yet hit that ceiling but he's on his way there and to win tonight he has to put together a superhuman effort he's gonna do it by trying to get to the perimeter in the run game he's also gonna have to throw in two very tight windows Alabama's secondary is a lead who's gonna be accurate and on time when he does deliver the football he's also gonna have to rely on Dan Mullen one of the best offensive minds in college football he's got to get some guys open for Nick Fitzgerald and when those open guys are there he's got to deliver the ball accurately Alabama defensively a little bit beat up at the linebacker spot though Tom there's no question that the Alabama Crimson Tide they're banged up they're playing without four start tonight went down in the last two weeks this is a concept based defense it relied the Punk communication this is a defense where the linebackers of the quarterbacks and so look for Mississippi State tonight to try and get some of these younger players Keith Holcomb number 42 the true freshman number 18 Dylan Moses get those guys to commit some eye violations move the formations around shift motion inside and get Alabama out of their element I would expect the young guys to play fast and not have to think too much Sonic's is first sec start and Moses is a true freshman meanwhile for Mississippi State the Bulldogs have some injury issues on offense their top three receivers are out bullet gear up to the season with an injury that happened earlier miles neither flyer available tonight ESPN college football brought to you by USAA showing your appreciation this Veterans Day using hashtag honor through action Xfinity experienced TV like never before with Xfinity x1 and Zales tis the season to save and sparkle more than ever injuries are injuries but when you get a rash of injuries at one particular position that is a little more difficult to deal with the other guys plan mr. newer faces but no nothing change this is the people that need a step up I think they know who they are we're gonna have to have some younger guys who have not played much be able to get themselves ready and get to the point where they can play winning football for us I don't know anybody that plays Alabama it's not the underdog outside this facility or no okay so we're gonna win give us a shot it hasn't happened any ASL and it'd be huge to be able to go out and play against a team that you've always been against your whole life is just go on the field jeffrey simmons with the chain is it to say usual so like that the Bulldogs sideline shows everybody else with cowbell in hand here at Mississippi State Nick Saban's last loss against Mississippi State was his first year as the head coach at Alabama the tide won the toss deferred selection so Mississippi State take a scout putting it away and Mississippi State will start on the 25yard line junior quarterback Nick Fitzgerald big guy six five 230 pounds from Richmond Hill Georgia but originally from Germany his dad Derek was in the US Air Force for 20 years Nick played receiver for three years until moving to quarterback as a senior playing for his father Derek in high school and along with Lamar Jackson Nick Fitzgerald they are the only quarterbacks with a thousand passing yards at 800 yards this season it's Janet deep on first down he's got a receiver throws a wide open teeth mix and that might have been a touchdown it certainly would have been a huge play to start the game trying to make a statement early talked about the perimeter rushing attack of Mississippi State faking that perimeter run trying to hit a deep post over the top and the deep balls that Nick Fitzgerald has missed over the two years as the starting quarterback here in Starkville have plagued this team from time to time few bigger than the one he missed right there because to beat Bama you got a hit on those with you get those opportunities play fake Fitzgerald in the pocket throwing again it's high over the head of the intended receiver Jordan Thomas the Nick Fitzgerald's got to settle down here a little bit here on the first drive coming out of high school was a triple option guy attempted just 76 passes coming out of high school really limited his recruiting two offers including Mississippi State and the key for Dan Mullen was getting this young man on campus getting him into camp so that he could evaluate him and that the young man could show what he was worth in person and if you can give Dan Mullen credit in any area he knows how to develop quarterbacks you talk about debt Prescott who was the predecessor for Nick Fitzgerald of what he did for Dan Mullins team the what he's doing now in the NFL big shoes to fill Fitzgerald has got a pretty good job so far coming into tonight 1310 another pass balanced a Fitzgerald is best player defensively you can see standing up on the right trying to create options up front just to delay blitz you have one on one on the outside evans pretends relaxes and then recognizes drop back and goes full speed to bring down Fitzgerald great start to the Alabama defense during that time the sixth set allowed by Mississippi State good Papa Bear caught by Marx at the 34 yard line here comes Jalen hurts I'm a proud Texan Ben from Texas is a little different I feel like we'd do it different you know you hit a motto don't miss it Texas there's just a fire thing there's a lot going down now that I say but the least I can do is pray for them on Saturday there was a penalty marker down without to wait for Janet Hertz to take the field here but hurts out of Houston a true sophomore he's responsible for 53 touchdowns 33 passing 20 rushing but for over six hundred yards this season over nine hundred last season there is a leaping penalty on the pot so it is a first down for Mississippi State the deserts at the ball on the 30 yard line leaping penalty on the pond called against the top so here's a hook on the punt and the defender for Alabama going over the top and that was the foul good call by the officials giving Mississippi State new light that to the three it out seconded to I gotta run Williams again and he stood up by Evans and Lake Borgne Davis Davis 6 7 305 so hard to run between the tackles against Alabama so sound defensively they almost always have guys in the correct spot in the correct gap and seldom do they miss a tackle Alabama's defensive group over the last decade have been among the elites in college football few better target inches just shot a 40yard line Williams again and good push by that offensive line which you say is the best offensive line to ban display this season they are especially the left side of the offensive line which was the point of entry there for Mississippi State's offense Martinez Rankin Dara Williams on the lefthand side they're big they're physical and this Bulldog front really plays with the chip on their shoulder they love to set the tone upfront they've done a good job of it over the last three plays Rankin back and left after missing time due to injury Fitzgerald getting to the perimeter before he slumps out of play after a gain of about three or four so important to have Rankin back and left tackle he had an ankle injury that costing four games played a little bit last week and a win over UMass they need him obviously tonight if they're gonna win this game against second ranked Alabama it's so hard to contain Alabama up front especially when you're not in the hundredpercent fortunately for the Bulldogs Martinez Rankin very well regarded throughout the SEC and by NFL scouts so they spread it out here on second down and seven fits jail one of his passes have been highdollar down on the roads it's a 44yard line trying to get Nick Fitzgerald into a rhythm throwing it first two passes were off the mark now you try to bring it underneath with a slant very advancable tax roll on the facemask and a nice pickup for the Bulldog offense Greg he's gonna have to be accurate tonight because so far Alabama is lined up and press across the board they feel confident they can match up with Mississippi State's personnel is going to be some tight windows here tonight last year they couldn't score when they got into bandit territory will tonight be different Fitzgerald on the roll bitch hands getting work tonight because of all the in breeze they have at the receiver position a jerk the dump this might be an opportunity on second and short not only is it likely fourdown territory but if I'm Mississippi State I might try to hit a playaction shot down the field no one I can come back and get it potentially on third down and remember it was open on the very first play at Fitzgerald just overshot the receiver little option here on 2nd and 2 and the pitch to Williams and he's going to get shut down Anthony Everett coming up the norm support it'll be third and 2 for Mississippi State on the 36 yard line tell you Gregg getting 32 for this offense so that's a dream they've got to be in third and short all night long to have a chance in this Drive they've had third and less than one third and two here that's that's the recipe for Mississippi State and Tom Dan Mullins not pulling any punches you got to think it's four down territory when you get to this part of the field they might have two downs to get it even if they're stopped short here now they got a walkon freshman kicker who hasn't missed this year but he also hasn't kicked on from this length they hand it off to Williams he is stopped the nose man with the head so it's 4th and 2 would be about a 54yard try again the kicker Jayce Crispin his long in the season is 45 the offensive staying on the field this is not even a thought to Dan Mullen as you said he's gone the crowd approves of the decision to potentially go for it and now they gotta calm down took the commo stick though guys it's too early why not Connick try to pin him deep this is Dan Mullins philosophy aggressive aggressive aggressive now Fitzgerald gets up under center maybe just talking to John Alabama outside and they're gonna take the penalty in Kannada I think this is the right call by dan mullen here in Alabama deep play defense and Williamson the referee you've already flipped the field now you're just hoping that your punter Logan cook can do his job senior kickers got a lot of experience but look on the season zero punts inside the 20 saving marks is the deep man Alabama had a leaping penalty trying to block a punt earlier on this Drive and you seen her they wanted to try beautifully done Mississippi State all over that great punt and Chris Rayford is down there for the Bulldog ESPN college football is presented by hem tin by Hilton welcome back to college football on ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA it's a final at Auburn 42:17 Georgia get the roll so there will be a new the college football playoff line we feel thanks from the 5yard line it hurts the quarterback Damien Harris in the backfield and it's going to be Harris good game on first down out to the ten for five yards hurts a true sophomore had maybe his best day as a quarterback against Mississippi State a year ago or touchdown passes and a rushing score there is again and this time he stepped up with the harvester that's got a yard it'll be third down for Bama the atmosphere into the field it's not quite as well as the other with the communication so difficult for Alabama for Mississippi State everybody standing up to the line of scrimmage sack fight GT gray forcing a fight John Grantham the defensive coordinator for the Bulldog ops to bring pressure off the lefthand side and you see gray to slip right around the left guard Pierce Bakker wrapping up Jalen hurts in the backfield huge play in this Bulldog defense JK Scott at the back of the end zone the punt this is his 54th game at Alabama he's been a situation before gets off an excellent kick in a deck Thomas fair catching it falling down he's their fifth string punt returner they've been so many injuries at that position Mississippi State's defense gets a stop and forces a pun ESPN college football is presented by Hampton by Hilton book a room today and follow your team all the way and in part by Kia hurry enduring Kia's light up the holiday sales event offers an su Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald from a military family his father Darren boy spoke to this week said he served as an air traffic controller basically in the Air Force for 20 years it was born in Germany moved to Florida at the age of 1 after retiring his father became Nick's football coaches Fitzgerald Jordans ominous dan wants to take advantage of six foot five a prett a corner Jeromy Pruitt the defensive coordinator for Alabama was concerned about the ability that Thomas had and he felt as though if he got in oneonone situations against these corners that would not be good for the Crimson Tide so a second time already Mississippi State has been in Alabama territory fits Cherokee thing it here turning it up inside to the 28 yard line by the yard line for Fitzgerald is a big dude sixfive 230 thread you talk about that matchup on the outside and Dan Mullen talked about having those opportunities it's at a weakened formation um I can get the oneonone that I want but now we've got it executed and in that particular instance they executed it perfectly which sets up the next one down with your best runner in the ball in his hands who's well covered just almost impossible to stop a well thrown back shoulder tom on second and five it's a oneplay Williams pushing the pile near the Raekwon Davis office top third down and one we saw this on the last Drive where they get third and short now they're in field goal range see if that offensive line can lean on Alabama's defensive line which is awfully hard to do but Binney group can it's this one last time on third down and short they didn't run Fitzgerald they tried to get it to one of their running backs in short yardage he got a guy that sixfootfive 230 pounds run the big fella and see if you can get some surge between the tackles or perimeter perimeter instead it's held straight ahead bouncing off the temple inside the 15yard line challenge the teeth of the Alabama defense deep wholesome number 42 filling in for the injured Zhang Jian Hamilton he's there he just doesn't make the tackle great job by Fitzgerald spinning off the wouldbe tackler and falling forward for a big first down Greg dúnedain take a look at how long Mississippi State is taking in the huddle just simple to say low in this game down yeah just gonna say that leaves you've got ten and a half minutes gone by bamas had the ball for three plays they handled all Peter Williams make it thrilled at the 11yard line by Davis again and of two and three four eras Williams you're gonna hear that name a lot Raekwon Davis number 99 only a sophomore he might be the bestlooking defensive lineman in the country he's six foot seven and I think that's a little short frankly he's every bit a six seven the hook maybe six eight three ten and so versatile and athletic very long there in the trenches been very active early in this guy second and seven Williams again it all started with the penalty on Alabama for leaping that kept the first drive alive for Mississippi State which gave them good position rales Mississippi State for the first time in a game since 2008 Williams with a rushing score at a dog strike first welcome back to college football on ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA eres Williams with his third rushing touchdown it's the first first quarter rushing touchdown given up by Alabama in the last 21 games remarkable Diggs and rugs are deep for Alabama but this will go through the end zone the touch back as we check in with Edmund Burke in the studio all right Dave Pasch thank you very much rocket Moore who's playing with confidence update opportu and George the deep south oldest rivalry and what a performance Auburn put on Jared see them to carry on Johnson here before today the number one team in the playoff era had lost four times by a toll at 21 points georgia loses by 23 to over one a game and then check this on Alabama coming into tonight trailing for only two minutes and 26 seconds and they're down late first quarter the Mississippi State not much there for star bro on furnish down on only a yard want to go back to the touchdown Alabama was so good up front that you have to create opportunities with leverage by looping pullers around look at 51 Stewart Reese a great job getting to Holcomb and allowing the touchdown fill one here a second down the 30yard line picks up four luis on the stop it'll be third down and again look at that D line for Mississippi State everybody staying I can push it expands pulled in for a first down Ridley wideopen he mix in a fender missin still going wiggling past the 40yard line weirdly to the 10 Alvin Ridley the best player on offense for Alabama left why toka all because of the protection up club Mississippi State opting for blitz which leaves their secondary and isolation someone you he's going to make for the person I'm 64 the sixyard the leftside stiffarming lunging and they mark him down at the oneyard line great effort by Hertz looks like that left knee was down so I think it about correct but tremendous effort by the sophomore at 240 pounds that experience joined it and purged out of bounds but he got in touch down on Alabama eight rushing touchdown this season for Jalen Hurd's who just beat the defender to the corner so much green grass to the field her Jalen hurts and it's a footrace him and Brandon Bryant to the pylon Jalen Hertz wins it what an answer by Alabama's offense then we showed that graphic about trailing for two minutes and 26 seconds all season they trailed for a minute 54 before scoring a touchdown and then tying it with a point after take off your week 10 NFL Sunday with a countdown crew at 10 a.m. Eastern on ESPN also streaming live on the ESPN app and our Monday night football matchup this week the 4 and 4 Dolphins against Cam Newton and the 6 and 3 Panthers Monday night countdown kicks off our coverage at 6:00 Eastern on ESPN 16:39 bass player Ridley setting up to jail and Hurst touchdown run for unbeatens left in college football with George and losing tonight Alabama Wisconsin Miami spending noted and shortly an ABC and you see a short kickball field it at the ten yard line by time out to the twenty seven want to go back to the last drive and looked at that long pass play by Alabama Mississippi State opting to bring pressure off the righthand side this is called a trap to you see those two safeties deep and the corners underneath nothing but wide open space over the middle of the field and that's exactly where Calvin Ridley got to tremendous job up front by Alabama's offensive line picking up that pressure and giving Jalen Hertz a couple seconds to find Ridley streaking then of course Ridley making it happen after the catch that was Mark Maclaurin that missed the tackle which led to the big one after the catch from the Mississippi State 27 yard line put a mixup Fitzgerald colliding with Highland Hills and Fitzgerald keeping it for three yards Mississippi State beat LSU big at home earlier this season but the games where they played top 10 teams this year they have not fared well they lost 49 10 at Auburn 31 3 at Georgia much better start tonight against Alabama quick throw by Fitzgerald to the true freshman he'll slam down at the 32 yard line by Levi Wallace gain of a couple third down coming up your jaw by Levi Wallace they're shedding the blocker and making what could have been a decent gain a very short one and setting up a third and a little bit more difficult than the third and twos they've seen to this point Greg that's where I think Alabama's so good on defense they're difficult to block and then they tackle in space tackling in today's offensive game the football is so difficult that you got to limit those leaked yards after the balls been caught Fitzgerald on third and four with time broken up incomplete Minka Fitzpatrick Oh Gladys thrown Fitzpatrick look like he made a good play on the football maybe he got the receiver with the left hand as he was knocking the ball away with his right following his nails on the receiver that was sick Budi Jones that's the second big penalty by Alabama that's led to a Mississippi State first down you can see them right here Hootie Jones on the righthand side he grabs that caller that's a great call by the official easy call are you surprised great and how much Mississippi State is huddling trying to shorten the game I'm not surprised at all the more plays you play against Alabama the more difficult it becomes I'd take your chances when you can from the 42 yard line big hit in the backfield the helmet comes off as Fitzpatrick makes the tackle he's gonna have to come out for a play tackles Kyle and Hill but because he lost his lid he's got to sit out for a play see if Mississippi State tries to snap it here doesn't look like it will only go to the second quarter with a game tied at 7 touchdown run by eres Williams and a touchdown run by Jalen Hertz for Alabama number 16 Mississippi State setting secondranked Allen you're watching the SEC on ESPN and when you are born in Starkville you are born with a cowbell in hand everybody's got him here at Davis Wade stadium the things loving it's awesome so Minka Fitzpatrick out to this play because he lost his helmet Mississippi State on second and ten kilowatt hours magnums are the touchdown earlier and he gets a first down here the third time already Mississippi State has been in Alabama territory the good job of misdirection look at how he starts to his right then comes back around to his left and follows big 61 Deon Calhoun through the left hand side nice counter action Alabama is so aggressive and so good and versatile up front you need to get their big guys running in one direction and then come back the other way misdirection is imperative for Mississippi State to try to create opportunities on the ground eris williams gained 10 pounds from last year got a lot stronger it's on a run between the tackles picking all here moving the pile a little bit but Isaiah plunks pushes him back gained a free boil and then he'll take that rung on the football between the tackles against Alabama positive yardage against this defenses of Plus now can't gain three on every down obviously and get the first naturally mathematics Alabama so far you've seen them have a couple issues at the second level with their linebackers Holcomb in particular missed a couple tackles now Holcomb not on the field and his number 18 Dylan Moses the freshman in the middle of the field Williams again and this time brought down after a gain of about 1 by Anfernee Jennings you mentioned the linebackers talked about it in the open with Matt Wilson and Sean D on Hamilton out for the season Paul cone comes back in this is his first SEC start four linebackers out for Alabama and Alabama is about the only team in college football that could handle this type of devastation at the linebacker level they've recruited so well at every position but it's no denying that the most important part of their defense is the second level and they're missing some key players tonight third and seven for Mississippi State from the 43 yard line Fitzpatrick tours to the sidelines it's packed and fighting for the first down as Justin Johnson as he's able to break a tackle they move the sticks 6:3 247 pounds tougher defensive back to bring down Johnson just drag that's all effort I mean a Brits trying to get there I'm Tony Browns in a good spot he's just giving up 50 pounds almost to Johnson it's tough to drag him down when he has forward momentum tremendous job by Justin Johnson from Birmingham you got to think he's got a little left in the tank knowing that he's playing against his home state school oh yeah these two schools separated by only about 90 miles they're gonna run Williams again in trouble in the backfield dragged down loss of one big Quintin Williams and talked about the athletic ability some of these guys was watching him return punts and warmish how does it feel Quintin Williams at 290 and Tom you you recruit you know recruiting as well as anybody try to put into perspective just how good this front seven is from a recruiting standpoint at a depth standpoint well let's see I'm counting right now how many stars the stars one hold on I'm counting them one two three eight eight Under Armor all Americans are on the field right now for Alabama on defense some of those guys are backups including the Brian Roy a true freshman who's in Williams off the left side inside the 30 in short for the Bulldog a great run right there and a good job up front on this big offensive line they found something that they like on this left side they've used some pullers they've used some rappers dan mullen knows that the left side of his offensive line is outstanding and they've leaned on those big guys up front for a majority of this first half expect him to lean on that left side again right here on third and short Fitzgerald fakes now just releasing vertical off the playaction Harrison is looking in the backfield he's a half second late to turn upfield and the results in a big completion first and goal how about Eris Williams 14 carries already 460 yards we mentioned her to blowout losses this year he struggled in those games so he got more yards in this one than he had in those two losses mr. Fong is good at 147 but they had to establish the line of scrimmage he challenged his offensive line if they've responded just another day in the park mr. mowett the ESPN F is a fans best friend that arch knew frankly every espn/abc college football game is streaming live access to scores download the ESPN f to start streaming now so watching games upset already tonight Georgia going down Alabama trailing by seven look at the rushing yards of the Mississippi state Alabama only gives up since 76 rushing yards per game he picked off by foot little Kumasi the 25 we're talking with Dan Mullen yesterday and remember they had a losing season last year so his name wasn't out there a whole lot but it is now and he said look I've been here for nine years people just assume that I want another job that I love it here now I'm sure there are jobs out there he would look at if offered but he said this is a place he loves and obviously he's built this thing up he has and he's built it in his image it's a tough bluecollar football team that really responds to the challenges that he provides what a job he's done in Starkville it's obvious why everyone thinks is one of the best coaches around for Hertz and it dumped it off two inches the tight end out near the 34 and a thing with Mullen is who you work for admire with him at Utah with him at Florida his development of quarterbacks something that probably doesn't get talked about enough and identifying talent too he knows what to look for from the fans of the standpoint at second and short they run Josh Jacobsen he's able to get the first out of the 38yard long you know guys this is the first series that Alabama has been backed up in the closed end of this steel and it is getting loud and they've done a nice job of moving away from the south the line of scrimmage was there first and then Cory Thomas who's been out with a foot injury cleaned of all this the last three games put us back tonight second and ten for Alabama time to throw for her climb in the pocket but everybody covered so he takes off there's it pushed out of bounds at the one that's twice Mississippi State has forgotten about the best player on the field for Alabama I love that this part of Jalen hurts his game is really starting to come al last year here to take it off in the run now eyes are downfield he identifies an open receiver that limits it very accurately on the run but first in gold Jacobs into the endzone touchdown Alabama 61 yard pass play to Ridley sets up the oneyard score by Jacobs so much poise for this Alabama offense as soon as they get hit they counterpunch hit counter punch and they did so with a big play in the passing game by their quarterback and their outstanding threeyear starter at wide receiver Calvin Ridley this remarkable owe that twice Mississippi State has lost Ridley leading two touchdowns for Alabama as we are tied at 14 ESPN college football brought to you by Allstate official protector of college football fans and nisa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy so Alabama's trailed twice tonight but for a total of only three minutes and 410 snaps 16 snaps all season long both touchdown setup by huge pass plays to Ridley on the go line is Reggie Todd hits when he goes but a flag if that's on Mississippi State I'll have to start from there 5yard line Brian Robinson huge hit block in the back turn to number 29 half the village we go first down huge penalty we'll start at the 5 huge penalty here you can see right in the middle right there and that's just in front of the referee and they're gonna call that every single time CJ Morgan's gotta understand that when that kickoff players cross his face he can't hit him in the back and put your here on their own five the first time first time grad we've seen the skilled positions flipped in Alabama's favor it's to keeping it able to get outside get the first down shooting out of five twelve yard run for Fitzgerald they had numbers on that right side Fitzgerald coming in to try with over 800 rushing yards the 13 career games where he's rushed for a hundred yards that is a record for an SEC quarterback he is a very Airy in the passing game every week they go into here on first after the 17 Gerald Thomas had it but just couldn't hang on it would have been a gain of about 30 at least man huge play potentially Thomas just can't reel it in he knew the hit was coming it just slips right out of his grasp just a terrific throw Greg from fish jail this is the most accurate I've seen him all year long no doubt Tom and you see big Jordan Thomas going to the sideline the Bulldogs need him on the field that's been a very good matchup to them so far second and ten fitzgerald running in trouble and slammed down with Sean Evans two tackles for a loss tonight for Evans we talked about the guys they don't have it linebacker but as long as Evans is on the field they're okay they got him that's a big deal for Sean Evans just another in a long line of outstanding linebackers for Alabama Thomas still shaken up on the sideline very difficult third down here for Mississippi State Alabama so good in coverage and terrific rushing the passer averaging almost five sacks a game the last four games this is a V state doesn't give up sex though only six on the year but one tonight play clock winding down it's a 2/3 and 13 and Fitzgerald just a quarterback draw and he's out to the 20 so that's just to get some yardage and give their punter some more room hopefully help themselves a field position and a few missed opportunities for Mississippi State so far the first play of the game they try to go deep Nick Fitzgerald overthrows it he's made some great plays between then and now and made a great one too when he threw it to Thomas Thomas drops it he can't make mistakes like that against Alabama because they're going to get it back now with tremendous field position 10 punts this season for Cooke have gone more than 50 yards Mississippi State could use one of those right here and it is an excellent they flip the field with a 62yard punt and a near giveaway bump punt by marks but able to jump on it it's number one versus number two number four versus number five one night two blockbuster matches and the college football playoff rankings will be announced from those games will Alabama be number one Georgia law so there will be a new number one but Bama right now tied with Mississippi State first out of the 18 yard line they run Harris and he gets three to the 21yard line new offensive coordinator this year at Alabama with Brian De Ville taking over 17 seasons in the National Football League he goes back with Nick Saban to Michigan State he was a ga there when saving was the head coach of the Spartans good job he's done in seven hurts to the air again has being chased and throwing it out of bounds by a hit Jerry shooting no Greg I I'm okay with that right there you don't make a dumb play with the football back duck but what his ability to work through progressions dick within the structure the going to have to do is communicate news Frank top third he was outstanding on third down last weekend it continued here tonight really good job Hertz improving his game as a passer third Dan that shoulder to Wrigley and it's incomplete really well covered and land it out of bounds I thought he stepped out of bounds first and didn't preestablished anyway they review every play I think Nick Saban wants to take a longer look at it yeah I wonder boy goes snail it wasn't a complete pass the previous play is under review did the foot touch before his backside hit not about right but look he's out of bounds there does he reassured like he reestablishes himself it doesn't look like it to me so close of course on these reviews there has to be indisputable video evidence beyond all doubt to overturn right there it's so close it's so bangbang it's difficult to assume that they're gonna overturn this one again it looked like he was out of bounds and he went out on his own to begin with wasn't pushed out initially so he shouldn't be eligible to even catch them I think that's gonna be the question here guys because if you look at the actual reception he secured the ball with his left foot inbounds they're trying to see if he established himself I'm sure but the letter of the law I don't think he did which would result in illegal touching here but again he went out on his own went out on his own was not forced out a lot to consider here for the replay officials and those back in Birmingham at the SEC office this shift stain it would be four down but even on that play there you see the growth of hertz and the work that david who's done with him right yeah and then obviously the rapport that he started to develop with Calvin Ridley that's tight coverage well covered well thrown good job by Mississippi State but sometimes a better throw beats that good coverage but it looks as though they ran out of room there on the boundary for Alabama so again they're looking to see if he went out on his own first or was he pushed out to clear presents the ball was in Venice morning if you're pushed out by the defender you can reestablish but he was not there for you can't a lot of bounds on your own and then be the first guy to touch the football so it is an incompletion for town yeah that's a good job by the officials Calvin Ridley is having a chat with them trying to understand what just happened hang on saying I caught it fit fix it now the decision has been made and I think it was a good one Dedrick thomas is back JK scott had a killer punt the first time in thomas had trouble with it he also has a punt return for a touchdown this year that was last week this is not a good kick by Scott but it takes a couple of Alabama Hawks Thomas picked it up and got leveled right as he grabbed it by a Holcomb and Mississippi State will start at its 30yard line midway through the second quarter all even Allstate is proud to be part of the team that comes together to do good by contributing to participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal an extra point kick the date allstate has contributed millions in scholarship funds welcome back to college football and ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of Veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USA a Alabama ranked number two Mississippi State number 16 or tied at 14 packed house here in Starkville Mississippi State back on offense on its 30yard line through freshmen Thailand Nick Fitzgerald a quarterback he'll finds a hole and is able to get up to the 34 for a four yard run this is pretty darn good company for Nick Fitzgerald yeah it really is and it's in really good company too when the first words that come out of Nick Saban's mouth when you ask him to compare Nick Fitzgerald to a particular player that he schemed against first guy he said Tim Tebow yeah and then the second guy that Tom said was Matt Jones at Arkansas I think he's very closely resembles Matt Jones with how big his stride is and how much ground he can cover when he takes off with the football on second and six Fitzgerald peeping it and he's close to the first on the market guys what about the differences between him and dak Prescott and how the run game is with Fitz Jericho paired to what it used to be with that dak is a little shifty er a little bit better side to side Fitzgerald is more explosive when it comes to running north and south of course he's a little bit taller as well just a couple inches though so they're very similar with what they tried to do with Fitzgerald and dak but dak is a little bit better running between the tackles where most of Fitzgerald's big plays come outside on the perimeter the huge third one here for Mississippi State from Columbus Mississippi this is about 20 minutes from Davis Wade stadium move the change is a big recruit Dave a fourstar guy in state and this is a pretty deep stable of running backs so for Kyle and Hill to be able to get some turns on critical downs like a third down there that tells you how far this program has come under Dan Mullen in the caliber of athlete now that's coming to Starkville and they use Kyle and Hill in so many different ways his ability to process everything they're throwing at him is a true freshman it's pretty remarkable magnetic Adair is Williams a break he's got 14 carries all editing in this game he'll again this time Alabama's defensive line was better Quintin Williams is there for the tide from an offensive standpoint fellas I don't know if this game could have gone anymore better than it had than it could be because here's the deal you slow down the game now a sudden you keep Alabama's offense on the sideline you're frustrating them and you've got balanced run to pass which I don't even think Mississippi State coming into the game thought they'd be able to run the football the way they have here tonight in the first half and the time of possession numbers are just staggering Mississippi State dominating in that regard over 20 minutes now with the football Fitzgerald drumming the ball here wrapped up by Kieran Payne was there first on the 44 yard line third down and long here Mississippi State nearly three minutes to go in the first half you just have to stay out of these situations if you're Mississippi State coming into this game on 3rd and 8th plus situations it's exactly what this is they convert only 17 and a half percent that's 104th in college football they have to be more efficient on first and second down because trying to gain big chunks against this defense and third down is almost impossible Rush's five and a deep from the hands at the antenna receiver Reggie Todd but Tony Brown jumped in front that may have distracted the receiver it's fourth down that was hot the way the ball was flying looks like Brown almost touched it or he did touch it with that left hand and Todd he was all alone on the sidelines as he threw on the depth chart come into the season but now of course forced in the action just miss plated in the air look like a little bit it was really hard to tell if Brown got a finger on her another missed opportunity on a deep ball though for Mississippi State Marc's gonna let this one with the golf swing there he had some backspin on that baby all right Dave thank you coming up from the mercedesbenz halftime report Georgia number one team in the country losing to Auburn what does that mean app the playoff Catholics versus convicts Miami Notre Dame 2017 update there and of course well the biggest but games the year in the big 12 t soon Oklahoma Joey Galloway Jesse Palmer me coming up Dave back to you Dan thank you let's see how Alabama handles does first down from it's 2 yard line because starving it hurts in the pistol start going straight ahead to the floor and a few yard run Vick Jeffrey Simmons in the nose and a little pushing and shoving afterwards it's always difficult to be backed up on the road it's especially difficult to be backed up with your back to the student section from Mississippi State and to hear those cowbells go swing up very difficult to communicate in this part of the field you speak from experience I've been there it wasn't built out the way it is now it's a tough spot on the field to be for Alabama's where it's changing things up here Hertz running a star both laughing apart what sir Adam there is a penalty marker down on the far side of the field at the 5yard line dan mullen was going to call timeout but because of a double burger he came from the 44 big mistake by Cory Thomas Mullin was going to call timeout but not now so 7 3 and the 9 yard line it's Harris breaks a tackle stumbles just short of the line to gain Arras showing some power there it's 31 besides judge the referee of the timeout being called and he couldn't get its attention that's how loud it is on that side of the field tongue yeah there's no doubt about it you talk to the Alabama coaches you look at the quarterback Jalen Hurd teased back here they've got to communicate with all this noise all these cowbells behind us here and it starts getting cranked up so it takes the verbal communication out of the equation so we're gonna watch you and when you see teams in the shotgun from speaking and they've gone to the Handclap with generally pierces the noise but it's very difficult to do now that this stadium is enclosed in this end zone let's see how this play goes let's see if my Hey can hear at 14 to go we're to design here today gets the first day out to the 18 yard line I actually heard it a little bit there here is because it quieted the crowd a little bit with that first down we get to clunker take first out of the 17 Hertz to the air climbing the pocket delivering a strike cam Sims on the catch out to the 35 and let's see now if Alabama uses a timeout walk will start on the ready for play as they reset the chain bird setting up and it's better down Marquis Spencer here to be the one to get a hand on it second and 10 if in mind the field goal kicker for Alabama Andy pop Anastas long in the season is 46 yards which means they need to get it down around the 28 yard line movement by Alabama met Rome at the right tackle first your starter Smith to the penalty here comes the crowd fellas Ross Pierce Baker has not returned since angry to the air escaping the pocket and stopping the clock by scooting out of I'm forced out by Spencer and if they don't get it you would imagine that bring it on all soon way covered feel good about where you're at if your top Grantham and a guarantee all the players are saying cut the number three cuz he's the guy had lost place for their place it's a quarterback too long and hurts out to the 40 Dan Mullen should call it timeout here on fourth down and he does with 32 seconds to go so they'll have one timeout when they get the ball back but you also have an excellent putter and Jake hey Scott Nick Saban was trying to call timeout both INEC dan mullen beat him to it why wouldn't it save him call it team was rollin Elam he went out to the field and was given the timeout signal surprise it exceeded would call a timeout unless gotta go for a fourth and five from your own 40 but that's what making us no I don't think that's what he was thinking I don't know if there was a a miscommunication there's something but I applaud Dan Mullen forgetting the timeout down here because since 2014 Mississippi State is one of the best teams in college football when it comes to blocking kiss big blocks one already this year for a touchdown so expect him to come after it here be aggressive and see if they can't get a hand on it all right we all thought that maybe Alabama was vulnerable because of the injuries at linebacker but you surprised by what you've seen so far this game I'm not their offenses played very well right that a few big plays they've been relatively methodical the one thing that I've seen though is their defense they've actually gotten pushed around a little bit at the point of the tackle they've also given up their fair share of explosive plays through the air and the couple missed opportunities to for Mississippi State I think both teams will go to half feeling about where they're at and saying hey we control the next 30 minutes we're gonna win the football game look at this Mississippi State has nobody back they're just gonna let Scott Conant and it's not a very good kick that bags around the 30yard line doc the Mississippi State didn't want to come after that I wonder Gregg when they saw saving coming onto the field were they worried about a fakin so they said you know it was just be safety or not put a return Mandeep went with the actual defense on the field I mean they were lined up in the simple quarters coverage can't say that I've seen that especially when you've been opportunistic in the kicking game over the course of the last few years well it's interesting sitting and go for the block and now they're not gonna go for yardage they're just taking a knee here that doesn't surprise me we're on your own 28 yard line make it to half don't let anything catastrophic captain feel good about where you're at at 14 apiece Georgia number two Alabama lose tonight in Starkville tied at halftime you're watching veterans week coverage on ESPN brought to you by USAA welcome back to college football on ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton you're watching the SEC on ESPN number two Alabama and number 16 business apiece day even at 14 apiece as we get ready for the third quarter at the Craig McElroy M Dave Pasch Tom luginbill in the minute and Greg the story of this game is Mississippi State not letting Alabama's offense on the field Bama was out there for eight minutes the reason this game is tie because of the big boys yeah it's because Mississippi State saw a tremendous job controlling the line of scrimmage it's rare to see Alabama on the field for as much time as they were because they forced so many three announced that Mississippi State's commitment to the run game and a success that they've had doing it and I think that's something that Jeremy drew at the defensive coordinator for Alabama has to try to get a dress because Mississippi State did a tremendous job being the follicle throughout the port for the first 30 minutes 23 first half plays and they will start the second half on their 25yard line let's take a look at the Allstate All Hands in play Calvin Ridley has been a star tonight much like he has over force of his career big play in the passing game and right here in the scramble drill uncovered puts the mailbox signup race that right hand a tremendous throw by Jaylon Hearst the fencing game tonight has been outstanding in large part due to what Calvin Ridley has done in uncovering and make stamp right there is what we've seen in here as a young Jacobs on jet sweep here in the first play MIT ball is forward for a first down to the 37 yard line but you look at Ridley coming into the game 44 catches the rest of the team has right around 44 Simmons and sweat continue to push Alabama offensive lineman Ridley is explosive a wide receiver as you'll see not as big as a Mary Cooper not as big as Julio Jones but very quick and really good with the ball on his hand under two heads live in Texas in Alabama behind the bar a Cooper Burks to the air short pass to Jacobs and Jacobs hit with a stiff arm and it jacobs lowers the shoulder to the 44yard line gain of seven the fellows it's not too surprising dan mullen pretty pleased with the performance of his team in the first half but the one area he said they've got to do a better job in is not missing opportunities for explosive plays you remember the drop ball down the sideline with Thomas there in the second quarter they can't allow that to happen again if they want to win tonight they fake the jet sweep and let Harris fake finally down to the 10yard line Brandon Bryant tackles Harris and Bryant shaken up on the play Harris has been so good this season they hit the Jets we from the they take the jet sweet bear gets out the gate poor job at the second level by Maclaurin number 41 the safe he's sliding in there Paris great job bursting for a huge play he's been as reliable as any of the tremendous backs that alabama's had this year brian is hurt Maclaurin missed attack on a Calvin Ridley pass in the first half and does so here as well welcome back to college football and ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of Veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA tied at 14 early thurb at Alabama's got a first and goal at the Mississippi State 9 yard line Expedia reminds you we are here at Davis Wade stadium in Starkville matchup between Mississippi State and Alabama Crimson Tide if they win tonight they'll be number one in the college football playoff rankings he would imagine on Tuesday with Georgia losing big at Auburn meanwhile Brandon Bryant shaken up for Mississippi State on the tackle of Damien Harris he's been through so much his dad was killed in a motorcycle accident two years ago he thought about quitting football came back to play for Mississippi State and has played so well for them the last couple years threeyear starter that'd be a big loss great effort by him too chasing down Damien Harris they can see that hope he's okay his replacement is Jonathan Abram who did not play with because of a targeting call last week they weren't suspended for the first half of this week's game purchase head of the backfield and brought that's a huge play for Mississippi State Maclaurin was back there along with Adams just pressure coming off the lefthand side and the righthand side out of the flat to Wrigley bailando cleveland date of one it's going to be third and goal from the 12 yard line big to play sequence for Mississippi State after giving up the long run to Damien Harris the tackles for loss goal from the 12 the drain a chance to regroup Alabama has not as train twice daily goal hurts Enzo attendances Judy did not come up with it here comes the field goal team that's a massive stop Mississippi State's defense to high safeties trying to get that post route out of the slots of duty and really the first errant pass we've seen from Jaylin hurts tonight he has been in such great demand that one coming out of his funky taking a nosedive like a sinker that a pitcher throws off the mountain hasta sound for a 30yard field goal try to get Alabama please 17:14 the tide in front ESPN college football brought to you by Koch Industries challenge accepted and Chevy the

of the final four Mississippi State ended up losing to South Carolina the championship game but their final four banner was raised last night Morgan her teammates coach Mitch shame for getting their rings tonight and what myself I was like dad ratchet anima to pass the 20 and all the way to the 32 yard line nice return as we go to the studio in Edmund Burke well they passed the AT&amp;T field pass let's get you up to date what's going on first with big 12 action TCU and Oklahoma a huge game here Baker Mayfield the Greg Cal Cantera TCU known for that great defense but so far already get up 17 points and it's early in the second also Notre Dame Miami on ABC look at Malik Rozier on the keeper right now it is all hurricanes 14 nothing only in a second Dave Wow imagine if number one and number three go down and again number two only as a three point lead from the Mississippi State 31 Fitzgerald keeping and a nice run a lot for it was an outstanding game plan coming in tonight for Mississippi State trying to establish the line of scrimmage stick to the lefthand side because it sets up plays like this they fake that same run action to the left and they hit green on the seam route in the red zone it's been a nice mix of run pass but the amount of success they've had on the ground has really opened up their offense for Dan Mullen that eres Williams of the backfield with him Williams at 14 carries 60 yards in the first half Fitzgerald peaking here trying to get outside as the first Irish on Evan it is hard to outrun for Sean Evans and Fitzgerald just did it I was thinking the same thing you're breaking away from Rashad Evans he's one of the fastest most disruptive linebackers in the game clearly his speed is on display it's not often you see an Alabama defender beaten to the perimeter especially by a quarterback it just goes to show you just how capable Fitzgerald is with the ball in his hands again Fitzgerald pitching it to Williams in midfield again it's Evans on the stop but excellent yardage on first down that's a gain of six but they're staying out of obvious passing downs by winning on first and second down now and second and short then Greg to your point if you can run the football like this and you decide to just sit in the huddle for a good 30 seconds it's going to frustrate the defense that's used to dictating turn it keeps Jalen Hurd sitting on a bench more than four yards per play on first down four and a half here second and four at midfield it's a great play call Alabama goes with a little fire zone off the lefthand side which vacates that area and Gibson reels it in probably makes it a little harder than he had to but verse forward really good play called timely play called air by this Mississippi State offense Gipson gonna stand for first down at the 41 of Alabama Ivan it's gone by in the quarter Gibson and running right and again look at the yard again you just don't normally see Alabama's defensive line leaving at this point in the first half it's not about the linebackers it's the D line yeah you don't ever see Alabama's defensive line being driven back it's rare but to see this offensive line and this is the best offensive line that Alabama has seen at any point this season this group is tough they're big they're extremely physical and they really play with the chip on their shoulder this is a tremendous challenge for Alabama and so far Mississippi State's been up to the task second and six on a 37 of Alabama Fitzgerald to throw Dinkins defense which they've been frustrated but how they passed this off and you can see who d jones he actually releases upfield turns inside and runs vertical which allows the wide route to take place if who d jones would have stuck with that running back from the beginning of the play the would have had a much less much smaller chance of getting positive yardage instead it's first in ten right on the fringe of the red zone alabama only gives up ten points per game they've allowed 14 so far Mississippi State gone four more as that passes it's picked off I thought it was intercepted by Holcomb they will get incomplete but I think it may have stayed off the ground there it did but as Jamie Mosley was going to the field and sliding down you'll see the ball just trickle out of his grasp look at this but does it ever hit the crime does right there yep it did you're right but my goodness I mean that ball was thrown a million miles an hour to see how quickly it bounced back on the recoil and Moses unable to bring it in fortunate play there from Mississippi State on 2nd and 10 another pass by Fitzgerald kids Nick and is incomplete fitzpatrick got to Fitzgerald its third down to ten just right around the right edge you can see Fitzpatrick what a one against a running back Harris Williams whose solid in protection but Fitzpatrick is just so elusive came into the night a little concerned about his hamstring would he be full go would he be limited would they try to take advantage of him and clearly that right hamstring not an issue after last week the interested to see what they call they just run the ball trying to get more yardage to make it an easy kick nope Fitzgerald to get the first pitch gates fearless Fitzgerald when he escapes the pocket he's looking the throat it's not often that he escapes the pocket and keeps the football right there he sees that he's got a blocker out in front in the full head of steam and he knows he can get the yardage as clearly Nick Saban is displeased with what his defense is putting out there giving up 1/3 insanity with this defense go first down on the 15yard line Fitzgerald keeping drop that beats 12 by durante 3 art pickup down the way through the third quarter threepoint family congrat dragged a gonna talk with Nick Saban right before we went to happen he listed all the things we don't have the ball we had poor field position and we couldn't get off the field on third down I think that's the most demoralizing thing to a defense that is so used to dominating on first and second down and then they get behind the change and they have such an advantage they have not won at Mississippi State behind the chains here in this game certainly the second half all those injured linebackers for Alabama second and seven Williams already with two rushing touchdowns and see if they give it to him to try to get number three the quarterback keeps it and Fitzgerald hit by Jones heavy to Mississippi State looking to go back in front led twice in the first half 7 nothing and at 147 of will Dan Mullen call here a lot of options second and goal from the two I might try to get Nicki Fitzgerald out on the perimeter sprint him to the right and see if he can't find a receiver in the flat for half that potentially some green grass to the white side whose picture rolling the summit saved in there just a moment ago talking with defensive coordinator Jeremy Truitt probably wondering what happened our defense on that drive 13 plays 69 yards 6 minutes and 38 seconds and it's 21 17 Mississippi State in order to beat Alabama you have to have a superhuman performance from your quarterback Nick Fitzgerald tried to deliver and his coach loved it do it it takes Archer jeopardy have battles of KDF anyway Delta Jose that's to beat my first six Gerald after the touchdown feeling filled here to be vomiting on the sidelines the medical tent put his out and a deep kickoff and Alabama will started the 25 of her shoes that man thank you David AARP real possibilities studio update TCU in Oklahoma rocky Anderson 3 Street heard your games coming in at a 30 yard game and on the next play that 24 yard program the touchdown Sooners up 247 all over to see you Dave it'd be really interesting especially if Alabama goes down at the top three teams of the playoff rankings a great start for the teens at 14 nothing perched at the pier and the sense of hope the touchdown by Nick Fitzgerald he vomits on the sidelines we were looking at the replay trying to see if he got hit awkwardly in the helmet but didn't see that it they just went on 13 play drive it when the tent came out was back that is a true freshman he keeps on continuing sink an enchanted forest taken to 24 this is city state looks like it's coming so there first because of coordinator chop Grantham the pressure right middle and we could see in the floor and get in his hand on it jaelyn trying to get rid of it quickly on the quick slant it's not quick enough JK's sky to punt for Alabama from inside his 10yard line Dedrick thomas taken down right away there at the 36 yard line 17 correct take us back with our Buick Drive recap outstanding 13 play drive stay this right here on Nick Fitzgerald opting to keep it on the lefthandside picking up the needed yards and Fitzgerald calls his own for the touchdown all the momentum here midway through the third quarter they have dominated time of possession Alabama had the ball thrown the eight minutes in the first half Mississippi State holding the football here in the third quarter Fitzgerald turning it upfield oh man levels by deshaun hand ups to his feet though no game they've allowed three rushing touchdowns on defense the most under nick saban the last time it happened was what a freshman in high school right now I was actually a freshman in college and joke Pines was the interim coach that was the Independence Bowl and Joe pines famously said he got stopped inside track and that was exactly what he said that inside trap got us a couple times that night against the folks but good first down defense here with hand delivering the blow who Fitzgerald and off his Joe gotta run it again he's taken down at the 38 yard line he made the point on the last Drive of exhaustion perhaps of that 13th play driver and he's getting a lot of run here in the third quarter keeping it at the Senators it's not uncommon for him to half 15 20 25 carries he can handle that load he's that big of a body but with all the adrenaline and the emotion there's no doubt that I'm sure he's feeling a little bit he's taking some shots tonight too he has Gregg I'm watching him right now he's shaken is that a little bit and kind of loosening his neck after each and every play getting up kind of getting himself resituated you know we talked with him yesterday remember with dak Prescott we hear he was vibrant and this guy comes into a room and he stoic he tweet does not change emotion at all for a 10minute conversation can handle these moments 39 Jarrell's gotta throw it into some tight window I mean that looks great great separation that's an NFL drug that's the type of accuracy you have to display when you're trying to dissect Alabama through the air right on cue therefore Fitzgerald 22 yards and look what happens they go right back to the huddle take more time off the clock keep that Alabama offense on the sideline painful at times down they've been in Princeton tight territory eris Williams and Janee that of course the piledriving the defender that a 39yard giorgia lost earlier tonight the number one team the number three team Notre Dame is down 17 nothing in Miami right now and the number two team is trailing late third quarter and Starkville with Mississippi State trying to add to its fourpoint lead now the last time number one and number two lost on the same day you got to go back to 2012 I wonder when the last time number one two and three all went down might happen tonight so create a sport in the world never know what's going to happen on second and 7 of the run play a Williams again keeps the lakes rider get to the 30yard line for about three gonna bring up third down and for the Mississippi State the dread of really interesting play call here Tom third and five right tential four down territory albeit unlikely depending on how close they get to the sticks it'd be interesting to see if they run it or throw it here on third and manageable but there's so many options to Gregan and I don't think we can emphasize it enough how each and every one of these snaps that ball that the clocks going down inside 10 seconds and just frustrating Alabama 3 2 1 time of possession Mississippi State over Alabama if they get just past the 28 yard line if Fitzgerald will for by Wallace as tall as sit back inside trying to create some chaos with that bunch formation that's exactly what they got and picked up yet another big conversion through the air from the 11 yard line first and 10 Williams another player just waits till the fourth quarter Darryl Williams the left guard a little slow to get up the way this thing's got so far pretty sure they're not running any place we go to the fourth quarter you hold on before welcome back to the great see College Football on ESPN presented by Hanson by Hilton the SEC on ES Taco Bell a proud partner the college football be on the lookout for Taco Bell student

in fact it was January 1st 1966 so these were all folding the last time two top three lost on the same day Georgia lost earlier tonight Notre Dame down 17 nothing a huge third down and six can extend believe with a touchdown teakettle one score game Fitzgerald rolling out incomplete going for Jordan Thomas and then after the play pushing and shoving going on the officials have not thrown a flag yet the Mississippi State's gonna have to bring in the field oil team from our couch but Mississippi State was getting into it with a couple of Alabama players and he saw some of couches teammates go in there and rip him away from the fray big stop right there from Alabama that for Mississippi State has done a great job getting to this part of the field stalling there on a third and long but there's some bad blood in this rivalry there's no denying that you can see as evidenced by what happened after the play little chippy on the field Jase Fishman has not missed this season he's 8 of 8 on field goal talks 17 there is a penalty flag down at the 16yard line it's a fiveyear penalty it might make Dan Mullen running into the kicker be fair the fiveyard penalty still would have been fourth down the den Monsun yo we're taking the points we're not going to go for it on fourth and one so it's 24 17 this is a bee sting now you're watching that dari gene and Chris are watching this doing that and talking to this guy which means you can watch it all later when you tune in tonight on the SEC network welcome back to college football ESPN presented by Elton is part of veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA a fuel doll by Mississippi State going to keep it in one and running it out of the end zone as Henry loves a true freshman he gets a flop to the finger at the 17yard here in the second half FIFA support meter Todd Grantham is opted to bring a little bit more pressure with his defense they pin their ears back when they're rushing the passer this time only for the third bring him before and right there or in the a gap on the right hand side tip in the pass they've been very aggressive defensively the point of the game mentioned that winning streak of 30 straight regular season victories off the left side it's Jacobs and he gets good yardage about seven firstyear defensive coordinator Todd Grantham there was a Nick Saban protege coach Berman Michigan State excellent deport inator outstanding well respected as a Georgia for a Bentley over the last couple years here's Hertz taking out look at big guy Hertz and it looked at Hertz there the game on mclaurin out to the 33 fleet yards that just goes to show you just how strong Jalen Hertz is powerlifting champion in high school safeties with momentum was bounced right off of him and Greg go back

team in the country down seven here in the fourth that's a good defense they're playing I'm at ECU for a big 12 team they have really good personnel on defense Baker Mayfield just continues to do things that just don't make sense he is he's spectacular the splenic all took long 2017 yes go to the Talmud possession alabama's had a parole of 13 minutes in this game and a timeout called by Mississippi State they have to burn one on defense the Bulldogs have the lead the Nick Saban's squad is on the move right now tipped off your week 10 NFL Sunday with the countdown crew at 10 a.m. Eastern on ESPN also streaming live on the ESPN app and then our week 10 monday night football matchup is a good one between the Dolphins at forest board and Newton's Panthers at 6:00 and free kick off at 8:15 a fastbreak macro whites ha pollutant villain Starkville Mississippi state hasn't beaten Alabama since Nick Saban's first year back in 2007 9 straight losses in the last two years he's gorgeous 9 nine points against Bama they got 24 tonight the tide is moving first in 10 on the Mississippi State 40 her taxes Morris McClure saying every time they brought him with pictures at Lawrence eight o'clock mark big Lauren coming off the edge with the safety pressure and Jalen Hertz knows it's coming just doesn't have anywhere to go runs into Josh Jacobs and he's dropped for a loss big play and great Paul by Todd Grantham trying to catch Alabama's offense lengthen its second and 15 here's Jacobs tourniquet appeal and stepped out around the 34 yard line so it gets a big chunk of it back 11 yards we drag let's see what gap sighs to attack this time de Ville the offensive coordinator this could be for down territory depending on what credits setting on and in the pass in the church in women complaining intended for Devon basement fourth and four it would be about a 52yard field goal try for path Anastas whose long as 46 to the offense will stay on the field the agreement that he sees you do today in Florida for control I don't I would funny Judy indicated they have none going for the snake hurts to throw got a whistle and Mississippi State called a timeout so that will lead the Bulldogs with just one had a bit of a substitution issue yeah you could see Grantham motioning to get off the field they had 12 guys right and the last time they took a timeout they were having a difficult time lining up and then follow it up with a sack so let's see what Branson dials up it here on for find out what's called part of the substitution foul one Mississippi State they've got guys out there that don't normally play it's fun because of all the injuries they've had on defense in this ball game you see Dez Harris Brandon Bryant two starters go down with injury I'm out off the board though guys defensively this thing's got a lot of time to go 11 minutes here in the fourth quarter that's to time that you can't afford to burn if you're Mississippi State all right let's focus you guys on on Alabama offense leaders we're going forward here and forth before what should we look for I think you have to get Jalen hurts out on the perimeter it'll simplify his read the problem with that is that the ball is on the right hash and he's a righthanded passer so in a perfect world you'd love to run him to the right but since the balls on the right hash he might be forced to run him to the Hertz stuffs up the neurons and as the first one down to the 21 smart place saw that everybody was covered and took off and picked up close to 15 yards huge play how many times over the course of the last two years have you seen Jalen Hurd's and take off on a critical down of distance to pick up the needed yardage with his feet so many times he's been able to create on his own right there it hasn't been a bigger play in the game always seems to make the right decisions Hertz to the left side toward the turf at the 40 but that's seven yards on first down Errol Thompson shaken up and he's in there for the injured Dez Harris they're gonna have to go third string here at linebacker we talked about all the linebacker for Alabama that are injured so it's a second down in three coming up for Alabama but while we have a moment we'll bring an adman from the studio thanks very much today just want to update you what's happening with regards to Notre Dame in Miami so Ian's book is implanted whimpers that's Trajan banding the pick6 donor named quarterbacks have five completions and three interceptions they are gonna get hammered on abc27 nothing right now at the half you is back Dave man and and then you think about it Manny had some close games where they barely won and we thought of going into Virginia Tech oh they're gonna get beat by the Hokies it didn't happen they won't rather easily and look what they're doing the Notre Dame in that offense they are so good at the line of scrimmage defensively in front seven I mean their linebackers as a unit there is good a group as I've seen in college football they are off the charts good with quarterman and McLeod Pinckney literally making life difficult for a Notre Dame offense that is majored in running the football not having a lot of success clearly tonight you saw errol thompson walk to the mississippi state locker room Dez Harris is back on the field so that's good news for Mississippi State again three ACL injuries he got four earlier the quarters what is that down to 73 player to drive it's been mostly young girls here comes pressure air is straight ahead first Peter the chance for the target time what a drive by Alabama 10 plays 82 yards tremendous poise an outstanding execution really impressive with Alabama's ability to weather the storm deal with the Edison flows and we talked about Jalen Hertz that's just a polite conduct number 70 the offense 15yard 1450 the game so you heard that Alex Leatherwood who is a backup offensive lineman that's out there committed a foul that will be enforced on the kickoff which could be big that's a huge bat just when you seize momentum can make a mistake like that don't see that very often from Alabama happen is the tide again splits the uprights third different Alabama player to score a rushing touchdown in this game 2424 Alabama trying to stay unbeaten and get to number one in the country eyes the game back up here in stark go Tuesday a lot going on on ESP and we got the State Farm champions classic from the United Center in Chicago at number one Duke taking a number two Michigan State at seven followed by five against four Kentucky Kansas at 9:30 we also have the release of the latest college football playoff rankings they won't be Georgia at this rate when the pivot on Alabama just tied the game 424 here at Stark but a penalty on Alex Leatherwood took his helmet off and when it celebrated with the team while he was into the game so they got him for penalty so Alabama is picking from the 20yard line it bounces at the 20 and here's Tom that's the 31st in the studio thanks very much Dave stopping heard this McCory rodney anderson doing big things for oklahoma he has over 200 yards from scrimmage and four touchdowns and that's in the first of the Sooners against that TCU deep at 38 14 a huge route in Norman also coming up next Jose Ramirez he's fighting for water rights for farmers in California and the super lightweightt rankings he certainly ranks high top ranked boxing coming up after your game day and who does win this game will end 942 to go and we're even and great starting field position for Mississippi State because of celebration penalty on a true freshman for Alabama on the sidelines talked about the poise of hurts Nick Fitzgerald's been pretty good in that department as well tonight Maris Williams getting the carry beautiful stutter step he just started forward a heartbeat six of eight yards they have really committed to trying to run the football and have had success particularly running behind their left tackle Martinez Rankin and their left guard Darrell Williams those two guys up front with Mississippi State gave out helmet stickers they'd each get a few of them after the performance that they've had against what is a stout and athletic defensive line group for Alabama Harris Williams closing in on a hundred yards go get it again on second and two and if kids does a great job of being patient picks up the first down one carries down for air as Williams he added in the offseason got a lot stronger and you can see it's paying off tonight Alabama just having a hard time Greg with their run fits in me what's easy to sit there and say the inexperience that linebackers playing a role and it may very well be but it's those guys in front of the linebackers that's been so surprising to see Mississippi state control the line of scrimmage you get movement when they've had 46 rushing attempts Tom had really tried to commit to delivering those body blows to Alabama's front first down in Alabama territory Williams getting the carry for a third straight play stumbles for about to the Greg think about how Mississippi State's started this game they came out throwing the football the first three downs Nick Fitzgerald got pummeled and then the play that changed things for them was the punt with the penalty and that gives them a fresh set of downs and Mississippi State goes right down the field Alabama's given up 171 rushing yards they allow on the season just 76 Fitzgerald will run this time and don't get much good job by Alabama thunder on pain so good at the point of attack third and long for Mississippi State Nick Fitzgerald has had a lot of success on third down the night Mississippi State 8 of 13 keeping drives alive and they've had a number of third down attempts that have been eight or more which is very difficult and not a down in distance that Mississippi State has had success with to this point of the season probably the biggest snap of the game at this point with the Bulldogs right now Fitzgerald will throw on third and eighth fires to the sidelines it's classic straighter line the game Thomas on the catch Fitzpatrick in coverage and you got four to the bomb three do you try to pin them deep or do you keep the offense on the field and go looks like they're gonna cut it and I agree with this their defense for the most part outside of that last Drive has been pretty solid the night and their punter he got to give him credit as well good he's dropped it inside the five a couple times and if you can pin Alabama deep on this side of the field with the student section right behind you that's advantage for the defense this one had kicked too hard a touchback it will come out to the 20 that's a huge mistake by the punter logan cook this week's college football rankings brought to you by Goodyear they're going to look a lot different next week at this rate with Miami trouncing Notre Dame Georgia getting hammered at Auburn Oklahoma dominating TCU the Wisconsin Badgers who you said on Tuesday if they went out they're gonna be in the college football playoffs they stay unbeaten out tenon of0 Wisconsin initiative next week in Memphis 1966 January lots of the same day nobody has done 27 nothing by the way Jacobs past the 25 that's his Scarborough excuse me to the 26 so that's a good play on first down to Scarborough gets six yards this is where Scarborough has been effective over the course of his career fourthquarter late in the game you put in a running back it's 235 pounds he's difficult to bring down so when their legs are tired defensively dragging him down big number 9 is no easy task Scarborough again got the first down and more out to the 36 10 yards for Beau's Scarborough at Mississippi State defense is relatively fresh but right now Alabama's offensive line winning at the line of scrimmage and these backs are pressure they keep rotating with Harris Jacobs and now Scarborough thirdstraight caring for Scarborough another first down stepped out near midfield 13 more yards five and a half to go and Scarborough calling for substitution as he hobbles a bit to the sidelines he looked a little awkward going out of bounds right there if he could have tightrope that sideline there was a lot of green grass Brian Dave will the offensive coordinator calling the same play three consecutive snaps just to sweep to the right left wide side of the field first out of the Alabama 49 here's Harris off the right edge it's upended inside of the 35 but it's all about the run game here on the fourth quarter for Alabama just dominating Mississippi State with the rush in particular on the perimeter that play right there the exact same play if they ran the we try to get out on me yet 129 in the fourth quarter by 82 the first three quarters from the state 33 Paris again and this time they stopped up after a 1 yard game it's Errol Thompson who was injured earlier comes back on the field and makes a play here second and long really nice tackle by Errol Thompson right there there was some grass out in front of Harris if he could have a big number 40 but he drops him there for a short game second and a let's go throw it here facing flesh here and he just throws it away at the 31 thought grants of the defensive coordinator and you do account for Hertz Blake from fork and floor they brought pressure he broke they got a spy the quarterback they bless I'm 39 French taking a shot to Ridley down the beam into place a flag thrown at Chris Reaper there was contact at the 10yard line that's a good place to go at the ball because Ridley is so talented he's either going to catch it are they going to interfere with up on those jump balls pass interference defense in the 24 absolutely a lot of contact nearby Rayford good call by the officials not a popular call here in Starkville as you can hear from the crowd's reaction but the correct call nonetheless so it's a first down at the 16 yard line during the four minutes to play here in regulation that was a 15yard pass interference call and Chris razor hurts keeping it trying to and he steps out after middlegame to the 15 so this is where jaylen hurts it's been so good guys until I turn the ball over one time all year long but he has yet to turn the ball over in the red areas been perfect six touchdowns no turnovers he understands the moment in situational football in relationship to field position we have to wonder why dry and able has abandoned that wide sweep play here though Tom you think they might try to get back to that at some point on this Drive they had so much success with it earlier there is Harris lead in the backfield hurts on the world sanfur SAS by jeffrey Sinan although wait a second Hertz was acting as if he landed on that offender Simmons but they blew the whistle at the 20yard line so let's say big loss of about six yard once I heard says get up dog but we do jeffrey simmons at some point empty backfield is see fairness leading and down it's time to fire Andy Papp Anastas has made a 30 yarder tonight a season line is 46 he's 15 of 18 on the season it'll be a 44 yard old was good why to the left the path analysis who's been so consisted this year for Alabama and this asipi state takes over on its 23 with just one timeout 203 on the clock here in regulation it's a shovel pass and it gains only about a yard to fahrrad Green does Mississippi State go fast here or do they say you know what we got only one timeout let's be conservative I pay for overtime I think they play conservative but Alabama has to be thinking may have three timeouts in their hip pocket depending on what happens here on second down they could potentially decide to maybe take one and see if they can't get another possession I think Dan Mullins going off to run the football that's been the point of least resistance so far for Miss the snaploc take a shot on the hoodie Jones dropped it he had it and he rolled over and couldn't maintain possession oh my goodness Wow now it looked like he'd never had it actually on that replay throw his law would've been a great pick that he come up with it would have been a great pick just to miss communication between fitzgerald and the intended wide receiver he thought he's going to hook up over the middle I'm just surprised into the ball me too and they snapped it with so much time on the play clock when you're in a situation you back back to 24 yard line Fitzgerald design we'll call a timeout to stop the clock with 1:15 to go or will they know yeah they do they've been couple more seconds came off the clock there looked like it should have been 1:15 when that timeout was called board down really surprised by that sequence yeah me too from from Mississippi State opting to run the ball and then throw the ball not forcing Alabama to burn one of their timeouts now you're having to put it back to them giving them potentially good field position to give Papa Gnostic another shot maybe on a gamewinning field goal and he got Jalen Hertz to who has handled these situations so well yeah over the course of his career Alabama though the damage it's done in the fourth quarter Gregg has been running the football and out of the situation now without a lot of time left where it's probably going to be up to Hertz through the air with two timeouts you have a little bit more freedom to potentially run the ball from twos they need a good pun from cook and they kid they're caught by marks at the 32yard line tonight at 12:30 a.m. Eastern time 9:30 Pacific on SportsCenter following championship boxing on ESPN Kirk Herbstreit will break down showdown Saturday the impact of Miami's ups it over Notre Dame if it holds up also Sixers warriors Ben Simmons against Steph Curry Baker Mayfield may be running away with the Heisman at this rate Sports Center Linda cone stands erect also streaming on the ESPN a minute nine to go in regulation tied at 24 birds will fall out first down looking rolling out running stepping out and it gained only a yard 101 on the game clock the good job downfield guys by the secondary there for Mississippi State but more importantly the ability to keep your eyes on the quarterback come back and make a play and not let him yeah pull the ground that banal says just missed a 41 yarder his long of the season his 46 keep that in mind here of second in on hurts it's popped by ribbon at the 45 first down to the 48 yard line clock will stop as they reset the chains on Jalen Hertz I'm looking in the direction of number three on every single drop back hurts again to the air pressure covering ferrets on the roll of throws it out of bounds 44 seconds to go in regulation pressured by Lewis but now that you're at the 48 break just a running game come back into play here at all for Alabama I think that a quarterback draw could be the play call right here potentially because you have those timeouts you have to save one for the field goal unit but you have the luck running it if you so choose birds nickel a second time he gets hit Alabama that'll leave the tide with 136 seconds to go and they got five sects by Mississippi State in this ball game all right so drink you got third and long here thirtysix seconds remaining in the game not as Alabama handled this situation in regulation and a tie game like I said well in the last play I think it might be a quarterback draw because if you throw incomplete then you're potentially punting again and Mississippi State being as good as they are blocking punts and blocking kicks over the course of the last few seasons I think a run here right now see what you get and then evaluate how you want to play the fourth down conversion prevention however this thing shakes out what a day in college football number one Georgia Falls number three Notre Dame is getting blown out number two in regulation thanks necks hurts he's in trouble he said he steps up he's got clean but wait a timeout was called by Mississippi State nobody heard it prior to snap timeout Mississippi State third and final timeout of the half time at there's some boos but did you see how much running room hurts head off the left side there was nobody home was they don't know the ice the offense there that was interesting because they brought pressure and Jalen Hertz escaped and there was nothing but green grass out in front whirling dan mullen not liking what he saw from the defensive alignment or take a little addition time to take a peek what he wants to dial up does this change your strategy offensively now knowing the Mississippi State is palliative time battles on third you still run a quarterback draw and then if you get the first down great and if not you just run the clock out is you don't have to punt now right because you're inside 40 seconds to go on business city state doesn't have a timeout you can really take run every receiver as fast as human maneuver around showing books banning field goal range stepping out of the 26 with 31 seconds to go Todd Grantham the defensive coordinator for Mississippi State showed it you saw the pressure you saw the Blitz Brian Dave all knew it Jalen Hertz knew it delivered the slant on time to their best weapon at wide receiver cannot dismiss 140 43yarder from here than alabama they couldn't run the ball they have a horsemen to the goahead score with 25 seconds remaining live by the sword you die by the sword defensively when you man up in that situation you better be better than the opponent 3124 Alabama after Jalen Hurd's 11th touchdown pass in the season what an incredible sequence by Jalen Hertz in this offense blitz right in his face look Lauren off the edge and he finds Smith on the slam one of the most surehanded receivers on the team at the true freshman tension sit astride and defense bullet touchdowns mr. and mrs. Hertz are loving it pressed again with Jaylin heard to this moment and out Mississippi State out of timeouts they had to burn a couple early in the second half now you talked about Jalen hurts Dave and how he handles the moment just watch his body language whether you're in the peaks of the valleys of the game he carries himself exactly the same calling for for this football team on that sideline Tom really over the course of his career he's beaten so many opponents with his legs they city state knew that they said we're going to challenge you we're gonna blitz you yep uncritical down in distance he stands in there knowing he might get hit and delivers to perfect for the goahead score standing execution by the sophomore and it goes out of bounds what a terrible kick there what is he doing at the 35 yard line no idea why you would do that you get the ball now at the 35 yard line I know that he was trying to poach and keep it in play you've got to keep it in play there because now no time comes on the clock he got 24 seconds Grandda you got to go 65 yards without a timeout it's Gerald's got the arm though if they can just pick up ten or twelve or fifteen yards he can easily get it to the end zone in the potential Hail Mary situation so they put that second back on the clock no nope time should have come off there so they fix it to 25 seconds Fitzgerald in trouble chased out of the pocket go of Alabama you got one more of the sideline here 10 15 yards and then get two shots in the end zone maybe yeah I think so see if you can pick up another first down of course have to make sure everyone's alerted that a potential spike could happen if in fact the guy is tackled and balanced Fitzgerald building to his left now throws incomplete 11 seconds left Todd couldn't hang on a Verdun coverage two more plays you would think left here for Mississippi State and Pitt's here we'll take a moment and talk with his head coach Dan Mullen I get no timeouts Fitzgerald moving to his left again throws it downfield 20 incomplete Patrick downfield makes the play on Jordan Thomas five seconds to go one shot to the endzone that's the guy you want to target in a contested catch situation big Jordyn Thomas at sixfootfive coming off the field rather gingerly in a Hail Mary situation he's new you won on the field so that's a potentially big loss not out there on the field but Fitzgerald understands got to buy some time and heave it as long as he can into the end zone Alabama drops four guys deep in the end zone Fitzgerald backing up that's stepping up destroy Fama's rushing the field but we may have one more play here in Starkville pastor deters defense number 42 an untimed down one more shot to the endzone from mississippi state i have very rarely seen pass interference called on a Hail Mary but clearly Holcomb tackles the intended wide receiver made it an easy call for the official and it's a good call it's the correct call even though there's a lot of contact in that Hail Mary pit the correct call by the official so no time left Alabama has a timeout remaining trying to figure out where exactly to spot the ball was on the 49 yard line so 15yard penalty puts it on the 34 no time left final play unless a penalty on Alabama Fitzgerald backs up now launches it into the end zone Eddie throws two to four each the back of the endzone the game is over Alabama survives number one goes down number three about to fall but number two wins tonight come from behind fashion at Starkville what's got out to top coach how would you assess the performance of Jalen Hertz on that last Drive to take your football team down and win this game well I think he did a fabulous job in the whole second half great job in the last couple Drive so even when we missed a field goal that was a heck of a drive so really proud of our team that's a tough circumstance we had a lot to overcome God did a great job but your defense struggling to stop the run for most of the night but you made some plays late there in the fourth quarter how would you assess their before we got two stops when we needed to which is the most important thing and we didn't play that great but yeah technically looked like what we got to do to fix it and try to get it fixed with their play all right Thank You coach thank and there will be a familiar team at the top of the college football playoff rankings on Tuesday Alabama stays undefeated winning in Starkville against Mississippi State 3124 coming up next on ESPN top ranked boxing the Greg McElroy Tom Lydon bill our entire crew I'm Dave Pasch from Starkville
