try to stop it folks just try to stop it everything that we gained the success that we have now that's all the state time I saw a tosylate they put it on this last year no doubt about it baby knock off the Oklahoma Sooners frustrating to look back and know that you know they took us out the national title hunt last year hey big payback you are looking live at a crowd of 80 2112 Memorial Stadium and ready for the showdown between Texas Tech and a vulva my cleats won the toss no deferring he'll take the ball here we matched against the man he once worked for tops to win suits came to Oklahoma leach was his offensive coordinator Stoops telling us I know his offense as well as he does we're about to find out back in 1999 looking sidebyside for one year Stoops knew that leach understood Hal mumme highpowered offense at Kentucky when he was an assistant there and strict was down at Gainesville with the Gators so he brought him out the next is history and leach does not have a good record here and normal as many of you are aware our journey begins Louis back teeth and Lewis's down at the 32 yard line and Kirk's so many impact players to these games and we've seen Texas Tech really emerge here last two games Michael Crabtree arguably the top player in all the college football number five has to have a big game tonight Edward Britain on the back side Texas secta the good job of finding him one on one and then the two running back Shannon woods the leader the senior had a huge game against Oklahoma State and a more physical back and a great receiver his own right Baron bass number 25 peril hands at all down for a couple of yards with Shannon woods and here is Graham Harrell his numbers are just unbelievable car veteran quarterback 37th career starts and I played a lot of football because of that he understands his offense able to recognize defenses make quick decisions and throw an accurate ball he'll get pressure on Graham Harrell here in for a long night this first pass stands tall in the pocket first antennas he snapped it off that time beautifully tulaja Leon sophomore from Abilene what a great job here early in this game it's so important for Texas Tech to start out fast and have some confidence showing great patience comes off rial originally look to the right and it comes back to him again and a nice job of giving him enough time there by the offensive line he'll come again Blair here's woods spin for a couple of yards great the great big Brent about his game is Mike Leach because he worked with Bob sue there's such a familiarity from Oklahoma side of the football defensively and studying and understand Bob Stoops as much as any coach in the big 12 understand how they'll stop the Texas Tech office now it's a matter of going out and executing it and trying to do it throwing for a living and wrecked beautifully that time by the defense Austen box the redshirt freshman linebacker from Enid Oklahoma coming off an injury forced to fill in for Reynolds in the middle and what a play by the youngster he has gotten better and better obviously through game experience has been forced in as you mentioned because they injury to Reynolds the leader and has shown a lot of confidence in the last two weeks he feels he's ready to play tonight infect Brent Venables expressed all week that the linebackers have a slash on the inside get to that outside passing game that Texas Tech likes so much so blitz trying to get their influence that pass incomplete and it goes to fourth down Brent you indicated what a great job of getting Texas Tech here early this game the third and long and it's disguising and in bringing pressure at the last second all from the left the linebacker clayton is able to get in and that's what it's all about how do you stop Graham Harrell you get him into third and long you get pressure clayton brings the pressure gets the hand up it knock the ball down there is somebody Jonathan Lucroy we don't see him very often he did not Punk once not once again so far mistake feels it on the 22 by Ryan Broyles and now we'll see same referee how about Bradford's impact repla all the talk about Bradford and the fact that he's their star it starts with the running game big physical offensive line tonight from Oklahoma DeMarco Murray feeling more and more like his the old DeMarco Murray because of the help Tremayne give Grisham one of the top tight ends in college football look for them to try to match him up against the linebackers and a great group of wide receivers led by number nine Joaquin Iglesias who again has the ability to make you pay in a hurry if you leave him alone uptempo Oklahoma FFA's defensive in might have jumped we'll see how they sort that out if he goes to Grisham with the first pass of the game for ten yards it looked like the defensive lineman influenced the offensive line but let's see the out of the officiating Sakai second down Brandon Williams trying to get a head start there on fill load hope the left tackle it's an advantage of quickness for Williams that he tried to hit jump the count Maurice very steep in that high and again there was that's a false start that is against Oklahoma well sorry offense number 85 your parents Russian with a high end Bob asking for clarification now frequently tight end is just the term with Russian heel flex way off the line folks and really be one of their wide receivers got great speed to Miss Peale Sooners moving the first time they handle the ball great job by Brandon Walter the right guard and I just talked about the ability of this offensive line we talked about a whole Brandon Walker the right guard just took the Texas Tech defensive lineman interest pushed him five yards to the outside opening things are sticking on the ground breaking off the first hit but picking up only a couple of yards again is DeMarco Murray the sophomore from Las Vegas Sam Bradford he has the poise of a fifth year senior only have sophomore great anticipation great confidence and much like Graham Harrell great understanding of his offense and he make quick decisions second and eight in option look with Murray still handling for another first down breaking daylight across the 25 yard line out of bounds around the 22 yard line and it is the Sooner running game of Bob Stoops that has there ever a ters in retreat five yards a great block there by Christian to feel the inside for marlon wayans and then when you're a safety against this offense you've got to be able to make a tackle in the open field in that same best time Charbonnet misses an open field tackle an allowance Murray to get down field the officials have a stoppage of play because someone on the gang across the way was shaken up on that play so we have an official's timeout Mike Leach knows the importance of starting fast against Oklahoma they have dominated opponents in the first quarter outscoring them 201 to 27 with all this hype playing on the road pets need to start fast the other way with Chris Brown carrying the ball for the first time he's in fact got brownie back and he too is a talent he's out of Alexandria Louisiana last time we sold Homer there in Dallas against the Texas Longhorns they did not run the football very well that night coming back again with bran and he's going to be thrown down by darcel McMahon the free safety they didn't run the ball well against Texas put in the last four games they've gone back to that they haven't really been able to establish the run game and have tremendous balance and c250 charts a game in the last four outing I balloon Gundy flashing the signal out the Brethren one is hot and ones done Kevin Wilson calling the play Bradford his back as all day the question doesn't pass to the 3r9 a first and goal on their opening drive after stopping the tech attack Brian Duncan is going to go and drop on Broyles once he drops back it opens it up underneath in a huge hole in the Texas Tech defense and another great read there by Bradford Murray is back in as the I bag that clap is the lead pull back Murray thousands on the linesman's marking it very close with the need touching the ground the official rules and you'll see how close right there take a look at this quick push and you can alright Kong they could come right back with it using that clap the jr. epithet and a Red Raiders defense balls a timeout here if you take another look at this play you will see clearly that Murray's knee is down right there and that is the spot and that is an excellent call still Oklahoma favored to put six on the board when you come back second and goal and you talk about a census that has been highscoring in the opening quarter Oklahoma with 201 points that's more than about 18 teams overall and Maria stuff stood up beautifully that time terrific play by Victor Hunter Wow a physical play I was right well they're up six nothing and Victor hunters steps up gets lower and drills DeMarco Murray short of the goal line third down in goal goal line defense of McNeal hurries into position they going to go wide with Murray for the first touchdown of the game stepping outside to the writings and more Valerie in with the evenings first bucks Jimmy stands to attempt a expert my red shirt freshman from Oklahoma City so our first score of the but the only thing I can guarantee is it won't be the last Saturday Night Football on ABC routing by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fees Nisa when you need it most Nissan delivers and Samsung mobile proud sponsor of ESPN rivalry wait we are back in one thing to remember about Oklahoma kicking off this has been one of the few weeks box with the Sooners this year they have allowed three kickoffs to be returned for touchdowns most notably that one by Shipley in the Texas Oklahoma showdown in Dallas so coverage a point of emphasis for soups and this will be wall the defensive back from the five yard line for the Raiders much better coverage back to the story third down a goal Oklahoma's going behind the right side here Tripp Williams the right tackle in Elric that tied in opens it up very easily here to tail back to Marco Murray go look at the block on the right side and look how physical this Oklahoma front line can be putting on the finishing touches of a 10play Drive a lot of up tempo no huddle which we've seen all year from Oklahoma after splendid personal foul Oklahoma on the banned 15yard penalty first down Stoops will be unhappy about this let's take a look and see if we can see it over there you got to control your emotions in a game like this you got wall just trying to get back sooner posting yeah not a little bit of push it get on the field before the game I think their concern is trying to take control there we indict the young man but he should know but seven healthy now the sewers with the lead and Graham Harrell must get Michael crackery involved early you know how it is when a bigtime receiver gets shut down for a long period of time it begins to affect both sides Mythili that's the way I gain here I believe in sex is dead we're different on the road compared to being in water for the town delay again at home things have been a lot easier execution the pressure communication now they're on the road in a place they absorb it traditionally under Mike Leach there's crap retailer right wearing them another fly now Louis last thing that Mike Leach and his girls can afford to do especially early in this game in big himself a huge hole he talked about the numbers in the first quarter Oklahoma is too good to get behind a lot of points it didn't have to come back first and pointed complete there is crap free his first catch of the night let's check in with our Lisa Salters Lisa first of all congratulations on your alma mater Penn State going to the Rose Bowl that's my friend thank you but I have to Oklahoma safety Nick Harris earlier in the week what the we're going to do to try to slow down brown hair oh my god whenever this guy's playing horse for the entire game let's run through the etron lewis sophomore from college station great you always hear coaches talking about pocket awareness watch number six here feel his way around the pocket and inside the window in the middle of the football great job by Graham Harrell peeling away and finding an open receiver during batch and Shannon woods both of the running backs that's his only five he's an ambien this is woods I thought he saw something but the sooner jump it in Austin box was in on that decalin right now that secular Matt Winer with our first update of the night Matt thanks and hi everyone I'm here all throughout your game to let you know what's happening beginning with this Taco Bell update Utah's virtually guaranteed a spot the BCS bowl the win tonight over rival BYU but this is max mall with the touchdown run their Cougars cut the youths lead to three in the holy war and here it is 7 nothing Oklahoma and Harrell going long sideline and let's see if he incomplete in his waved off brothers was Nick Harris their big strong safety coming over on swindle I think he got his foot down watch the left foot come down Swindell 11 he catches the football watch his left foot it's down they're definitely going to take another look at this I just in a better ain't gains possession did he juggle the ball at all that we're going to take a pick the foot is down and it's just going to come down to if there's a an angle that shows there's a great angle right there it looks like he has controlled a football up there at the end line judge was running over to take a look at him when he was out of bounds and there he is right there the ball came loose after his body landed out of bounds it failed the player had a first down inbound but they may not make control to approve the ground I think he had control and then when he came down Brett his body hit the ground and the ball came out it's boarded pretty pretty quickly as he came back down you could see at that particular replay it was squirting out of his grab the line judge actually right in and had a good view enough to get instant replay review on the floor to for incomplete pass to maintain possession third down and ten the little guy Eric Norris has yet to catch his first palace he works those underneath routes beautiful ask her down they brought a lot of pressure disguised it and came late let's see what they do this time on 3rd alone Paris has crept up under five and now he drops back and from the other side to the Blitz trying to confuse it Beale was there Harold gets it off complete that well short detron lewis and that was Jeremy field a sophomore and as a rush defensive end he has played very well the last couple of weeks Brett even though they didn't get a sack the pressure coming wait creates enough confusion in lost Graham Harrell this time had some happy feet throw it off his back foot not able to sit in there and be able to throw the football with any authority they're creating hesitation in doubt right now especially on third down for Texas then there's a second time Royals is back deep again those dangerous there he's not around the 19yard line so we'll take a break Oklahoma has already scored once they lead by seven you're watching Saturday Night Football on ABC well I took a lot of heat when I predicted that he was going to beat Texas and he beat Texas can you see that he really beat him a lot of heat though it wasn't easy I have a lot of friends in Texas have a lot of big fans from Texas and man they gave it to me hard now I'm going to make another prediction he's going to beat Oklahoma and he's going to send me another ball just like this one because I like collecting them but coach you're going to be a wealthy man after this season everybody wants you guess what Donald you've just picked up a few folks in a long so there's the there is the coach Mike Leach rumors swirling where he'll go if nothing else if he stays a love of video Marie he's half to a bigtime start here tonight he had 48 yards and a touchdown on the opening drive of this game Reed making the stop and he starts off the series again if you remember a couple weeks ago in Oklahoma State play Texas Tech I talked about the depth of the safeties and how surprised how deep they were considering Oklahoma stay wants to run the football same things that I've asked temple offense slap it to the outside when he Chaney his first line of the play opportunity but we have another penalty in though this has been a penalty murder to start a family scoops cannot be happy with the penalties likes the fact that he scored in the first series likes the way his defense has stopped leach two consecutive series he and Harold I remember now Stoops believes he knows this offense number Texas Texas as well as leads them and as you look at the records through the years you would tend to agree with lock Brent Venables now the defensive coordinator and so far tonight in two series they've done a fine job against Grahame here first and 25 they'll come in underneath and get a view back that's Chaney Quentin Cheney's a senior he's from nearby Tulsa chains tena nice job these last four games with the entry to Manuel Johnson stepping up and being a great leader you can see here 14 reception to the last four games with Manny Johnson injured second 216 and Bradford going to go deep on the far side and completely over through walking anyplace is covers that time by Jamar wall Tamar wall left alone on the outside that time Tom challenged to match up with Iglesias because of his speed but wall the best corner the tech suspect has the experience that he has he brings to the table allows him to be out there isolated oneonone on an island big third down here broke Lahoma hit Kevin Wilson settles for some underneath they strike and try to pick at all a 13/16 he's got plenty of time diving for the ball was Johnson good time managed on stir just falls down I mean he's got to match up la Marie pretty good coverage there the ball is thrown great anticipation actually by Sam Bradford and if he stays on his feet he's got a real shot of making that catch and being very close to the first down so that a feed for Sam Mike no money for the first time and now we will get the young man known as the elf into the game for Texas Tech number 12 he's waiting here at the 32 a fearless help I might add well aerial coverage for tonight's game is courtesy of the Outback Steakhouse airship bloomin onion one the bloomin onion 1 airship fan favorite every week on ABC ESPN college football broadcasts this will be the third time that Texas Tech has handled the football and they have not threatened the red zone eeeh if not be able to establish any kind of running game at all they're not going to live and die by running the football but this is my Felicia's best running team that he has had and they haven't really even attempted yet to run the football against Oklahoma as both of his running backs back there is a couple pass the woods and woods on first down facilitate yards basically that's a running play defensive coaches certainly look at this as we take a look at what they have accomplished so far this season they're pretty similar most productive position on the offense averaging 26 touches in 190 yards the game is ranked team touchdown you put those two together receiving and rushing they put a Pilate on that stays in he'll get the first down beautiful run it becomes crashing across midfield to the 46 yard line and over there is Austin box it just cost about the running games you mentioned the shovel pass kind of is a part of their running game but this is also a big part is getting number 25 into the open space and landing him accelerant he's a physical back much more so than Shannon woods that time he broke a tackle picked up valuable artic to the Red Raiders time but can't find an open receiver finally far side and out of bounds horn for Edward Britain the junior Camila's Oh Graham heroines assault fence dispatches settle me down the emotions of the game are kind of settling down now it's just about going out executed always tougher doing on the road last few games at home you know they refused and against great opponents they made it at times look effortless it's very different on the world didn't have to calm down believe on what this key the flair to batch believe you got another first I would know be spotted by that line judge just a touch her right there at the mark the underneath route from Becca stack for so important watch the linebackers from Oklahoma trying to match up they're just looking for those crossing rounds and it left patch open to the outside they're so concerned with the crossers in that middle part of the defense you could see their heads on a swivel trying to match up they left 25 all along to the outside on the outlet when Judge Dredd this has been very very visibly boxwoods but bitch out there y'all handle actually bring the change across great to see some of the scores to my games today I did indeed watch the end of the Shocker in Southland unbelievable Adrienne damn please son yeah threw the winning touchdown pass bursaries I was so happy for her coach Robinson I know he'll be moving on but Phil he'll get a job as an assistant the NFL or with with someone in you know the college game he's a good man good solid football man just to get things turned around quickly enough to satisfy everybody up in Syracuse you know it's going to be tough up there and we will see what the Orangemen I would happy from Phil Fulmer to he came over great win for Greg Robinson put on the other side if Charlie wife Heidi Belle Riviere if he could be the belt that it's been a little with hotness out there they flew a Kenny next week which is usually about a 40 point long so it's going to get real hot yes sir 7nothing Oklahoma leading here they did get the first down going to batch on the outside and very fine play by Dominic Franks now Franks is the corner on that side he came you have to be able to tackle in space when you play the Red Raiders and Franks did exactly that what's his technique he's sitting in the corner this is something Graham Harrell has to recognize it's an easy play but you're right you do have to have that ability to take down the bulk here that's something an Oklahoma has put a lot of emphasis on this week is tackling in space and yards after the catch they have to eliminate him good job there by Tommy per sack he threw it there was a receiver there marking him down that is the first sack of the night every said he was under control that time he was in the arms of big Adrian Taylor who is an unbelievable athlete great athlete 35 inch vertical that let's face it these routes are being covered by Oklahoma at the coverage sack that allowed Taylor enough time to get there Oklahoma doing a good job of rerouting the Texas Tech wide receivers making them work to get open something we've not seen much of the last couple weeks so he's sitting back here Graham Hill folding the football and holding the football in Oklahoma just to athletic up front a 12yard loss the first sack of the night Taylor has about a 35 inch vertical leap in talking to print Venables the defensive coordinator he said Taylor may be one of our best athletes on this TV you can't believe the explosives there's another young man behind coach Stoops Brent Venables he's up for a head coaching job we expected a wideopen explosive high scoring game and guess what the defense's all the story here so far two minutes left in the first quarter and Texas Tech has not sniffed the end zone and that would be a first issue Crabtree all the way at the bottom and a big third down here if you try to make it to play dirty long second sack consecutive sacks Gerald McCoy was one of those hand fighting his way in and this offensive line has a load of trouble I get this sooner clock right now what equate a great twist a big cut here from Oklahoma the speed and athletic ability of McCoy right the middle goes to the outside around Taylor then he gets the oneonone matchup and just uses his speed and quickness to go right by Ryland read the left tackle Rhett Venable mixing up this defense what a great job with their pressure either when they're only bringing four to mix it up the look the poor fumbles a stick and does get it off that they had any kind of a block on they would have beaten him up and all are they lucky here that they didn't get a tip five Broyles in the turnover let's go to Matt Winer in New York for an update Matt high bred Penn State quarterback Gerald Clark picked a great time to have a career game and he's our nominee the AP MTE has been allamerica Player of the Week 341 yards passing for far two accounted for five total touchdowns gilben Nittany Lions trip to the Rose Bowl Castro takes the wood boat 5 1 2 3 4 on your AT&amp;T wireless telephone the offensive line must recruit for the Red Raiders as Chris Brown checks in a fight for 20 back here for the Sooners let me down final minute at the opening quarter and at brown will bring that clock down so the highlight of the first quarter has certainly been the performance of the Sooner defense against that Texas Tech front that has been your highlight the other one is the fact that Oklahoma took the ball on its first series and drove right down the field with DeMarco Murray banging into the end zone Bradford has all day joined a Christian who's wide opening in a foot race outofbounds at the 29yard line the Sooners running again when you won the football you start to get safeties and linebackers sucked in and that's what happened here you see the confusion wide open on the backside Duncan the linebacker trying to stay with Grisham not only is their big advantage there with his sides but also the speed there and a nice throw nice accurate throw by spam Bradford he's for six for 73 yards right now great walking again up front I'm telling you this Oklahoma often starts up front with the big boys that are able to just push back the Texas backs defensive line Oklahoma with a hundred and fifty yards of offense in the first quarter seven points more importantly they shut off Texas Tech and held them 250 yards it will return after this message of the word from our ABC stations this ESPN telecast available highdefinition on ABC HD Kirk Herbstreit Lisa Salters I'm Brent Musburger from Norman Oklahoma V favorite Sooners lead by 7 Chris Brown on the field as in money back Sam Bradford let's see if the Texas Tech defense can hold up and there was a penalty class like big Duke Robinson 5 did it hits our office number 72 fiveyard penalty still second down the lone hope Duke Robinson John Cooper Brandon Walker Trent Williams and the coach is telling us that Trent were their number 71 is having the best year overall they'll switch him to left tackle next year after load vote Frederick's rush for not pretty here's Gresham leather purse they've got to find a way to put some punter on Bradford he has all day in that back to find this he just gets back at the time look at the timing between quite a time Grisham turns around the football is aired in succession from Sam Bradford in the meal that he has right now for Jermaine brish of it very obvious eleven yards before they're able to bringing down across the 5yard line a hundred and seventy three yards and Counting for this Oklahoma offense this mention claims he does a good job of getting to the second level which opened in huge seam on the back side and gave Brown plenty room down oh you the problem is Texas Tech is facing right now is this balance if they load up to stop the run and momulla fraud if they stay back the prevents a big pass play then they're being run on that's why it's so nice to see an offense that can both run and throw and make you pay for over submitting the one spot that you're committed to to be able to slow down you go down the road don't hurt your throne Jimmy Stephens adds the extra point and Oklahoma takes a twotouchdown lead on Texas Tech Oklahoma leaving by a couple of touchdowns been long time since the Red Raiders didn't score in the first quarter of the ballgame we'll pick it away again filled it on the 20yard line and return out to the 37 let's check in with Matt Winer in New York Center right now is powered by Vizio right now the Utah use about nine minutes away from spots of pts full backtoback touchdown the first three minutes the fourth quarter had them up by 17 over whyville BYU earlier today Penn State played its way to the road Bowl for the first time in 14 seasons after dominating Michigan State Natural Bridge Joe PAS confirmed he'll return for a 44 season as head coach myoma Hill Tom headed in for hip surgery firing the Roseville wouldn't be surprising big drive here for the rent writers down a couple of scores they've been stifled that screen game has a going now they're going to try it on first down and they throw to daylight Morris and right now the Red Raiders are completely out of sync let's go down below to Lisa well first before they often came back on the field Mike Lee called all of his offensive players around him he says look guys every time so I have to try it this is just like you get all weekend drunk doing it on Washington right now I'm Washington s get pushed around way off mr. Crabtree now is off to the right side of the ball sends it and Crabtree the target at midfield so Crabtree with his second reception of the game gives them a first and 10 and maybe that will spark the offense what Oklahoma's doing a great job is taking away the screen the shovel passes and everything about five yards down the field and back into the second tech part of the line of scrimmage so they're going to have to start going those big just like that behind the linebackers they set the screen again with bash and blown up this was the practice for the defense on Thursday that we watch as soon as they throw to the outside the linebackers and the safeties try to crash in as hard as they can well Brent Venables wants it forced back into the middle he doesn't want him to get the outside edge on the screen pass and box coming over again for it that is Venables plan here tonight second down and 11 that breaks the first tackle nice run first and ten for the Renner ATAR perfect that was the powerful run he able to shake loose and get downfield it brought a corner blitz you see him off to the left here Jackson comes they take the chance if he makes the tackle it's a great play but once he's able to elude Jackson there's nobody left to the outside but you mentioned Brent Venables and what he's trying to do the other thing is just the Oklahoma defensive coaches led by Bob Stoops and Brent Venables another one one Oklahoma but they know they know this offense as well as anybody they can almost call the plays and he told us they're simplifying things this week based on formations and alignment and you could see early in this game almost like Oklahoma knows what is coming before the play has a chance to develop Shannon Ward's the money back I holds and drops in underneath to his safety valve there's the their inverse into the game and it was a it was my cleat you actually dubbed him the Alfie even has a young man has been Richard the elfin waiting and he said that this sounds old deviance one day dressed up like an open came to approaches me and chucked up on the table and started stomping around with those long toe shoes you just see Eric Marisa on table breaking up a coaches meeting at the avid three the way that the cramp replay that you all remember so well for the Texas game and pranks it not on my watch not this time they're jumping the round he actually paramedic custody outside watch off quick Frank jump big round and when you start to see that as a play polar to the quarterback you've got to come up with some double move you cannot just continue allow therefore the defense to be in your hip pocket on almost every single round also there are ever since taken to develop because Graham Harrell has to find his third and fourth receiver then show blitz Daryl detective the second time on a blitz that they have been able to deflect a Graham Harrell pass and young box is growing up here as their middle linebacker but it was a huge series protective debt that was third down Oklahoma's been bringing a lot of pressure he mentioned there is boxing came up the middle but I think that defect has no other choice and Mike Lee known to be a risk taker he's going to go for it here on fourth down Errol needs three yards for the post stepped away incomplete the Oklahoma defense is the story that's your headline here tonight so far it has been boomer sooner thrown to nothing but air Saturday Night Football on ABC brought you by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fees a flag ask about it at work at Chevy an American Revolution during his 10year career Bob Stoops has lost only two games here in Norman one of the hands of Oklahoma State and 23 games ago Keith year here is mariejeanne play for the 30 40 and luring having a huge night for the office that's 23 more yards for Murray as they approaches 100 in the first half the courts with the Denver running game great block downfield by Iglesias and managed on Savannah the Marco Maureen looks like DeMarco Murray before the injury that is sustained last year to Texas Tech he has much more confidence in that new Bunch on the left Bradford hasn't touched the ground yet and here's nori off the past 40 35 and Murray to the 30 yard line for another first in pen for LA Reef and bring him down but it is a 31 yard gain for the Sooners but the accuracy of Sam Bradford watch the feet distance welcome position comes over great throw in front of Maury and hit with DeMarco Murray in the open field you talk about the importance of making a tackle again this guy look as good as he has look all year the last couple weeks he's picking up again crowd on fire and leach on edge time for tonight's Aflac trivia question curvier and eligible Michaels case was all closed up as a coordinator 1999 hoses starting a quarterback that's pretty easy if here at Oklahoma there is wow looking worried the Sooners shirt at a meeting there love us with his quarterbacks there June techheavy used its final timeout of the half of his level 11 minutes and here's Brown McNeil the defensive coordinator got all over his defense during that timeout looking for a spark there's Ruffin on that far side everybody do their job that was the chest wall the corner comes up to help the Colby Whitlock and there's Ruffin on that far side we're kind of talking at the break there what can they do to turn this game around and you know the last two games that we call the Texas Tech against Texas at Oklahoma State their defensive line of linebackers helped fought Texas Oklahoma State these are the other foot spinning and another first down so it is so onesided right now as far as you already just concerned 235 yards for the Sooners circuit they're just getting such a great push right now and as I said Texas Tech it's about wanting it more and trying to be able to play as a group right now they look like they're rattle as a team play action going in zone touchdown Oklahoma Jermaine Gresham that was a beautiful play action freezing the backers just enough gresham releases into the end zone and Oklahoma is up by three touchdowns but you got to love about Oklahoma's sensing the Texas Tech is on the ropes and they just keep attacking and keep burying this Texas Tech team in the will of the Texas 15 Stephens tax on another article more folks that is for Oklahoma possessions and three touchdowns without a show in northern I think 6x jr. from Ardmore Oklahoma Jermaine Gresham he has been a nightmare momentum for defensive war bears throughout the big 12 and then they're not average games Obama had a good nonconference couple Cincinnati and TCU that will be part of their argument and the beats the computer is if they have to decide this I prefer the victim or side this is field it on the wrong on the 20yard line by wall wall runs up and out of bounds a fine return there's no question the running game helps set this up the pullback here clap will go right down the middle you'll see Grisham right here now it's a simple read for Bradford but watch Heinz the safety having to slaw just get lost and I don't know if he was caught up in thinking DeMarco Murray might have the football but because he kind of sat there in noman's land there's nobody there to take away Grisham even read an easy throw for Sam Bradford with that fine return to the 49yard line brandon l will see if he can get things going it moves michael crabtree into the backfield alongside of him and they run back out of that formation so the first four drives of the night here and you can see the Texas Tech of the 1315 12 and 47 Brent Venables is having a sensational night if clemson is interested as we heard and there was an interview they are very impressed with what he's doing against Mike Leach his offense here tonight it is second down and five there's batching he is blown up miss Lewis outstanding or redshirt freshman from San Antonio Texas linebackers have great speed and right now this Oklahoma defense is depending if there's back playing with so much confidence Graham Harrell came into this game as a Heisman frontrunner and right now he needs to settle his team down and make some great one at Crabtree let's see if he goes mic on fourth down here the ball is across midfield they're down by three touchdowns Harrell stays out on the field Graham Harrell stays and we should go all the guys focus his roll the guy down we want to get predator and the Sooners the ball right here with nine and a half minutes to go in the first half hate to say it's a must conversion but the way things are going this is his must of the gifts backpedaling in complete broken up by Brian Jackson and it is sooner football but when you have a quarterback who is rattled he misses throws and he was typically make watch here from the left to the right you're not going to be able to see him but BL Eric Morris breaks free right behind the linebackers he's wide open and this is even before Graham Harrell decided he needed to move and get away from the pressure but when you're rattled when you're feeling the pressure sometimes you make decisions you would not usually make the one thing I noticed at the end of that did that appear to you fans at home when you saw that replay should Crabtree have caught this ball this this football team I've not seen them perform like this I want to watch the end of this play now could shoot good shot put your play there by Jackson Jackson Lee I've got a hand in there and did a hell of a job over there on that on that far side Eric Morris breaking through the thoroughfare on the trial he's not done tonight but air forces for this the guy that I was looking at and Graham Harold ethereal pressure he's got him right in the middle where they had so much success in recent weeks and he's sensing and feeling that pressure right now that he's starting to get out of there even before the pressure gets there girl talking to his offensive teammates anything to rally the troops but the way things are going they're going to be down four touchdowns that was Moses with do his first carry of the night he's the third running back used by Kevin Wilson the offensive coordinator who works with Jay Norval and of course head coach Bob Stoops Kevin Wilson's name is going to come up down here in the south also especially if anything happens over TCU and coach Patterson goes up to Kansas State but Kevin Wilson doing a superb job of calling plays here tonight I cannot believe Bradford finally couldn't find an opening Sprint's out of trouble what a night Bradford is happy first and ten wall finally bringing him down the coverage here by Texas Tech and Pam Bradford not showing his athletic ability very often doesn't usually have to maneuver at that time steps up into the pocket and finds a nice crease in the defense and picks up that first down and we'll get the rush Mike straighten up probably a halftime that's load hold and here's a load folks at left tackle for the Sooners he goes 6 8 337 Colorado that's the system that you see working over the sidelines with Kevin worked so hard on with Northwestern beautiful offensive birch up there I've eaten grass he is an athlete played basketball in high school great golfer he just has not had to show this very often because the offense executes almost always in thing in this last two plays oh nice job of recognizing that of a bad play trying to make something good happen 300 yards of offense for the Sooners plain cake it's like practice juggled in complaint it was Russian again this is the one knock on Grisham is it as big as he is and as athletic as he is he looks like eventually a firstround pick in the NFL the big pine and look at a mismatch with his size but there isn't knock on his hands and that is a touchdown if he is able to catch that pass and get into the endzone meet seven on his third day keep it up easy touchdown Joaquin Iglesias that was like backyard keep away 28 yards and another suitor score remember the fourth down gamble near midfield when you give a redhot offense the ball with that kind of field position that's a bigtime gamble that Coach leach took will you go on fourth down he knows it better than anybody you've got to make it in that situation and they didn't and coverage underneath by Texas Tech and you'll see Marie come to the outside when he does that you've got a linebacker that clears out when the linebacker clears out look how open that is in the move and the open field peg Blake you one of the most prolific receivers in the history of Oklahoma football big strong but also very quick been able to get into the end zone Charbonnet goes down on the play and he's walking off on his own power he was shaken up and there is the glacis so with Manuel Johnson having suffered that nasty looking elbow injury against Kansas he has not returned to form but that doesn't matter with the Sooners they still have Iglesias Jani has stepped up and of course Grisham is a bigtime wide receiver and the Sooners are out five four touchdowns they have gone 76 yards 84 yards and 55 yards all in less than two minutes we are back and the sooner schooner started to pull away on this road trip to the Ren Raiders it is 28nothing her be with 745 to go in the second quarter we have not seen Texas Tech play this poorly but we've got to give an awful lot of credit to this Oklahoma defense down watching thinking you know Oklahoma have had two weeks to get ready for Texas Tech and vice versa but the Oklahoma diva it's almost like you see the wrist bands with toy trucks like Oklahoma went into the locker room to Texas seconds they can get some of the play charts so we know every single play that you're going to run give them all the credit the world because they have Graham Harrell and Texas Tech offensively wrapped and on defense they have no chance right now to stop this balance at his physical attack from the Sooners they'd love to get one on the board before the intermission anything to build on Morland commute keeping it on the ground and the Red Raiders with a loose football that the Sooners get at it this could be a backbreaker here in the first half expect the unexpected with scoops but the Red Raiders hang on this looks like a kicks it was just intended to be a squib kick it ends up getting the linebacker bird who's in there this loose ball Texas Tech very fortunate to get that ball back it's our hunter jumping into the middle of that pile to save the day football just sitting there and now we will see what Harrell and this offense under pressure can do pull down Jackson Jackson made that blended a short time ago on Crabtree on a pass play and now he comes up on run support the goal tonight for Oklahoma to keep it simple and having a defense that's going to play with awareness confidence and aggression well before that goal is accomplished that's exactly how they're playing and Morris to the 24yard line and he's Barkin at that defensive back Nick Harris there's a flag on it however there's the head now he pushes the back judge stepped in Morris and Harris we're barking as one another at the end of that play and a holding call bring this Plato so foul huh Panther faith defense number 96 when it gets upright for a first down the first break all night well the once I have one step that has gone against clearly against Oklahoma the penalties in this game that's 59 yards of penalties against the Sooners now and the Marcus stranger the rotating bodies and he can stick his hands up right into the face of Steven handy Texas Tech see if they could take advantage of the opportunity here deep in Oklahoma Territory in zone juggled incomplete at it for a moment it looked like Morris might have a touchdown and Harris has got a few words for it I know the Graham Harold's taking chances but Brett look at number two right here and look at the defense completely clearing out if Graham Harrell dumps that it's about a 15 maybe a 20 yard gain I like that he took a chance and he had a shot to get it in there he had a touchdown pass early if Morris had held on the ball he had more sofa he's going right back for it touchdown Red Raiders two main swindle and what a huge score this is at 6:28 as Harold just kept on bringing it attacking these last two plays the middle of the Oklahoma defense the safeties are out wide they're picking on the middle linebacker box he doesn't get quite deep enough make shitty muchneeded touchdown for the Red Raiders swindle loved that score folks he's a redshirt freshman from Oklahoma City and there's a penalty flag on the on the extra point many of you who have been with us during this tour of the big 12 South know that the the kicker who kicks extra points for the Red Raiders is dead ball delay again defense number 44 half in assisted a goal we're filling the pride and that is Matt Williams would be the kicker number 85 and in case you have not heard the story 1a kicking contest in civilian clothes during a game earlier this year you got a months free rent and a condominium and Mike Leach sent out a sister coach over it got his name brought him out to practice and he has been one of the kickers ever since he's had the extra point city he's been perfect on extra the ultimate Walker big play here protect his test and you have the linebackers in there right here's Bob he's going to try to think and here's the touchdown pass with the linebacker is trying to get deep and safeties out on the hash the guy gets to the middle of the field and boxed actually makes a pretty good play too trying to recover almost get the hand on the ball but Graham Harrell puts just enough on it to get it over bucks and pretty good concentration by swindle to come up with that touchdown talk about a team desperate to get anything going it's one thing we were talking during a break you kind of had a feeling that eventually the offense from Texas Tech might find a rhythm and might be able to put some points on the board you really wonder if you're Ruffin McNeill what can you say and how can you adjust to slowing down the Oklahoma offense and how physical they are that tells the story of the dominance until that drive by the öyou defense and Murray goes back to return this kickoff Iglesias and Murray are back deep for the Sooners and with Murray returning kickoffs that certainly means in the medical staff says he packed 100% ready to go we would not be using him to return kickoffs Corona gives it to him and the Glacia says they candy and leather come out of the 20 yard on let's go to manatee or for an update map here's a Verizon Wireless update from College Park Maryland where the terms have the inside track of the ACC Atlantic Division at least they did but they turned it over three times tonight all in the first half Derek Nicholson took this one back 22 yards on Jordan stay up 21 nothing there Oregon State it's two wins away from the Rose Bowl but trailing at Arizona thanks to a missed extra point 1716 alright and here it is 28 7 Oklahoma leading Texas Tech and the Red Raider defense finally makes penetration and can't stop Murray 12 yards they had him for a loss he broke the tackle kept on coming you've got to make this play I mean it would it would have been a great play by Dixon cuz he's fighting through to try to get off a block the tight end Grisham has him he gets two hands on DeMarco Murray but like I said Murray is just having a big night now that he is healthy it takes more than a couple hands to get on Maury to bring him down but Tech's going to have to start to win the battle at the line of scrimmage and they've not been able to do that at all Bar Kokhba campus three more headed for a hundred yard first half here with Brian Duncan out of the middle linebackers number 57 they're taking his night you're not told these game in Texas that we've talked a lot about 40 whitlock 93 in the middle of this defense Brian Duncan who made the play there Marlon Williams and Oklahoma run these players need to emerge and step up to make close to the focus there I love this nohuddle I think dehydrates probably the fastest nohuddle in the country this year insular Murray again it's within a couple of yards very manageable third now coming up and there's Josh you talk a lot about the coordinators in Oklahoma with Venables and Kevin Rosen and how they'll eventually become great hit coaches Josh Michael has a huge future as well this brown for the first time well the Aflac we asked you the question you seemly ask why I'd be very disappointed that most of you didn't get the same who was Mike starting quarterback when he was the offensive coordinator you saw a good shot of Josh there it's Gundy alongside won a national championship with Josh they beat that Florida State team and speaking of Florida State this Bobby Bowden works that game and Matt gave me the update to of Bobby's sons are here tonight working radio Terry Bowden and jump out are both the both in attendance here tonight Kevin Wilson told me this week he said you know Josh Heupel has had a lot to do with Sam Bradford he said the pretty similar their approaches players when Josh for the was a player he was a a cerebral quarterback made great decisions can also rate right here because going to future head coach Fung in the near future yeah I think but Josh wills had a lot to do with the development of Sam Bradford remember not Josh's father his high school there were so like you he grew up along the game and here is brown running the ball and Stoops I think bringing that clock down I think the one thing he wants to avoid here is letting Texas Tech suddenly jump back in with a 14point Emerson for the intermission he'd be very happy up 28:7 and we're going to take a high risk so far with it but then again Bradford has not been touched in that back though he's at whatever he wants to throw the ball the offensive line has done a great job and drops off the screen to Murray Murray drops back now going to lose some yards unless he can break free and he does turns it into a gain and a first down what a half for DeMarco Murray I said it earlier I just continue to marvel at DeMarco Murray this is the fact that I think a lot of people expected to see this year now that he is healthy when he gets the football touches the quickness when it's the power then he's running with what he lowers his shoulder you better be ready Oklahoma needs two things here tonight a win is as Chris Brown gives him a break the second thing they need BCS style points now they've still got a tough Oklahoma State game in Stillwater next Saturday but BCS style points are going to count if there's a threeway tie for first if Texas remember now Texas beat scoops in Oklahoma in Dallas and Texas dope who's upset because Texas Tech tried to call a timeout and if you see up here they're out of timeouts Blaze's number nine on your screen backward Brown on the clock staying in bounds and they may just get another score themselves here on the ground the way they're moving the ball within South time zone play opens up so nicely brisson again in ball rolled with the left tackle and in fact shown great patience letting the crease develop and in getting up field in a hurry Texas Tech being manhandled up front right now by Oklahoma that will be load hope Robinson Cooper Walker he wins Brown for another person to the 15yard line and now Stoops and the Sooners are thinking seven more what a great onetwo punch of having Marie and brown by rotating them in and out allows them both to stay fresh as much as Sam Bradford as much as he gets the attention and he's a great quarterback and they can hurt you quickly throwing it small about this running here comes again Murray first May I'm not bringing him down 108 yards you're in the first half score the game's first touchdown once you wonder if the tempo is also affecting Texas Tech you can see their defensive lineman hand from their hips under how fatigued they are as they continue to just get pushed around Devin's check the personnel sent down to play watch this Browns is running back and spray head goes brighter for the first now first end goal they picked up the first down that stops the clock momentarily they've got a minute and a half they would love to score this touchdown to make it 35 7 and go right to the locker room stoop just record that clock right now they're having a clock down in these over 5 minutes now on this Drive taking that clock down he would love a 35 to 7 lead Brown speculative and zone they have made it look easy in all the pregame hype and chatter about this game question was which defense which defense is going to stand up I think we big difference given a 401 yards in the first half the Red Raiders have the Sooners have had five drives here tonight as you check that they had six drives and five touchdowns stopped only once that was the second time they handle the ball look here in the offensive line Brandon Walker 73 coming around good block quite a fullback a clap his just same old same law you're right they make it look easy the execution up front just pushing people around and these backs just two running through arm tackles what if our staff coming up on the Capital One halftime report big John Saunders in the Craig James who has a son over there on the sidelines with Texas Tech I'll be not too happy of all what's going on of course the Flutie man Doug Flutie and they'll tell us from what the Red Raiders have to do here the second half and they'll have all the big stories and highlights and then we certainly want to thank the addback Steakhouse for the great views we've had that's the bloomin onion one up there happen Paul Heino at the controls of the bloomin onion in the captain Paul just come along with us the stow water the bedlam game next week my friend stay right here in Oklahoma game day water if I think the Winter Games a mayor to be setting up in Stillwater right now mayor to be there woowee we didn't expect this now father no no II didn't expect this you knew that the Oklahoma baby excited universe stadium would be excited they taught attendance off the Texas Tech elephants would be able to execute fielded back near the goal line and out to the 25yard line as we take a look at these Pacific Life game summary oh so the showdown between the two quarterbacks and it has been once more onesided the numbers but it doesn't show if the numbers is the way Sam Bradford has been able to manage and often they think fit in complete control of the football game who covers nine for the couple stores and foot patrol the story's been that way has controlled the line of scrimmage and run the football so we get 42 points in the first half folks but nobody felt what came would at 35 42 and here is badge interesting call without a timeout to vision Oh Mike bleaches always thinking about points to run the football basically this wasting 1520 seconds intercepted at midfield picked off by Louis Lewis with great speed headed in zone jump short they've got all three timeouts in 2040 seconds luis a converted safety didn't make it as a safety he is a heck of a linebacker look at that official get Harris away look at him get him out of there Larter was over there and harris and there was no question that something was about to happen and that official aggressively stepped in and now he goes over to students there was actually quite a bit activity that's why there's a flag down of celebration for Oklahoma pushing each other the plan ended first row file cactus number seven pushing and shoving after the touchdown and that's why I Harris responded to corner but this is if he's exactly what Mike Leach couldn't afford the pressure they are great great awareness by Louis but the big thing is Graham Harrell continues to look rattled with the variety of look from Brent Venables in the defense from Oklahoma activity came in this corner right afterwards now Murray this is softened in Norman folks an oldfashioned stop it they come prepared if you're going to play Oklahoma Jamie Stevens tax it on Graham Harold a quarterback who has set the bar in college football this year with his accuracy and decisionmaking continuing to struggle and Aaron throw Luis showing tremendous speed they say as a safety now linebacker he's a four or five guy right in front of the camera hero right there Barbour comes in pushing and shoving actually from both sides we medicine a moment within a sort of conservative woods check that Jamar wall I should say we can break down the BCS for the second half if you want a little time look down on the scene a ticket and this crowd will not be labeled no sir they're lovin every moment as inside the back pillow pass out near midfield it will lose the battle by Harris and a late flag after the fight ended after trade ended and the office 18 and authorities for a first our personal foul often we're 19 that's one of the wide receivers Leon but they don't want to be losing their composure you get your butt kicked you want to stay composed you've still got another half we got a highpowered offense if the defense can regroup a little bit on let's quickly go down Alicia what do you start what you sauce on your team man you soften yeah we just never got him settled down you know came out to hike and we never got everybody settle down try to make too much happen yeah it's disappointing because just doing little simple things is a game Texas Tech offense we just have competed yet why not I get a better job just doing our job making routine things happen and thank you Lisa the man you'd want to hear from in that situation and I'd like to find out what our studio gangs got to say John Saunders crate James and Doug Flutie's so take it away for the capital one half time report Big John Jacob Reb hair rattled and the Red Raiders getting rolled the Sooners by five touchdowns at the break Chris Fowler back with Lee Corso leave this is not the ability offense we've seen give up a lot of points in the conference what's different tonight well first of all you got understanding about forty five to Texas an average of 30 points a game in the last four and the difference is they're playing base defense for rushers they know exactly what they're doing to play a lot of zone and occasionally Blitzen but what they've done is paralysis analysis was a Texas game they're not doing anything but whoo manonman he was a better man that's the difference completely the tremendous number of plays were tackle either negative or very short yardage in 402 yards in the first half of the Oklahoma often their offensive line is a foot taller and a hundred pounds more than for Texas Tech they just roll off the ball ever seen this place like this electric in the series making a statement not for the second half after this session and a word from your ABC station to learn run them over me music people may be consistent Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines and we welcome you back to Norman Oklahoma where for the fourth time this season the Sooners have scored at least 42 points in the opening half Carter trying to fire them up and Sandra for Kirk is ready they go back to work and what do the Red Raiders have to do here now well I have to tell you what they could do I mean obviously the first time when you're just joining a Oklahoma has dominated the game it started with their ability to control the line of scrimmage got the running game going open things up for Sam Bradford the real concern for Graham Harrell is he's been rattled his first pass back game fire often it's been rattled late pick their camp reference and it's what I'm talking about baby they're feeling good right now when Texas Tech have to do I want to see if their defense can step up and put us on such one way not to start the second half well they knew that the Sooners were going to have it for the first series and now they've got it in much better field position is can't find any rabbits to that so I mean the mad scientist is not at a good time over there he's been trying and going to start off second half Bob Stoops probably told his guys remember who we're playing I know we're up 35 be alert for the onside kick and it's what you want to see is to give this off in the fourth year but they have one late in the first half in 55 yards and they march down under the false start yep so they start off with a penalty I've been somebody over there right on that far side sorry offense number one why do our penalty still first out yeah Menno Johnson the brach as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary there you see the comparison herbie with the two quarter Sam Bradford clearly having the better night and also just his offense has pretty much been able to do whatever they want his numbers are not gaudy but because they've been so effective and running the football for 226 yards for the first half he hasn't needed to be this is Murray had a hundred yard first half and let second down below Alicia well Brent remember earlier in the week Ruffin McNeil said that he lets the coaches above tell him about the body language of his team and he said tonight the typical just isn't there for us they're getting over the ball and we're not I told the guys look we got to attack and tackle 30 more minutes the bus is going anywhere you'll choke bradford rolling hard to the right penalty on these play the line judge on the near side I was Brian Duncan number 57 in pursuit of the quarterback Sam Bradford Ranford looks like he's a good one sure bugs holding offense number 18 general penalty still second down here's the offense for the season now in the first half look at the look at that Jose Arturo what they'd put up for game in the running yards they've really been physical heap last four weeks and now five weeks since the Texas game they've been here establishing the running game to set the tone Musa brought up a great point about welcome McNeil said they're struggling with the tempo of this no huddle offense that calleth been bringing them all him there's Maurice running on the outside I didn't maybe when the only times tonight we saw the defense there's stretch to play and actually take away that Lane that creeps in the defense that Chris Brown and DeMarco Murray have been finding almost every time they've had their hands on the ball there's a third and 20 to perform of five of six and four times and not favored here but they get more receiving an oncourt he went for everything else I just I'm so happy for DeMarco Murray because when we had them against Texas he just didn't look like he trusted his knee talking doing this week he said he spent so much time in rehab and that's you know how it is it's mental as much as it is physical they're going on fourth down but they're much better position with a huge lead at the 26 yard line Claire first I'm pretty easy wasn't it just pretty stupid learn him over there for the first down and Stoops is not pleased with somebody on this side but I'm not to do that linebackers got to get out there Marlon Williams lady getting out there and Marie not only running the football tonight but a pretty good job of catching it and they finally get Johnson involved now remember he's playing within a left elbow that is has a brace on a heavy price he suffered a very nasty injury against Kansas I tell you the truth if you watched it as I did her be a television at head I'm really surprised that the young man's playing again this year I thought when I saw the entry as well I thought it's probably unfortunately to be the end of his season but he hasn't been heavily involved but he is still out there and he's a big part of the chemistry this offense Chris Brown is now the running back instead of Maury you see the pressure over the right side of the formation it'll be ground Spence the 15yard line and Brian Duncan the middle linebacker Brian Duncan picture 100 maybe some stops form here tonight but they just you know the one thing every that we have not seen we just have not seen any kind of real pressure on Bradford they haven't sent any safeties or linebackers or trying to disrupt his rhythm at all third and six run the toss play with ground good stop that time Anthony Hinds Jake Ratliff the big reason I don't think you're seeing them willing to take chances I'm with you I know when to give up 42 in the first half you think you can fake to the Justin you come with pressure they're so fearful of giving up the big play that I think they're trying to a bend but don't break style and that's what's allowing Oklahoma to run the football here's Jimmy Stephens he hasn't been very busy this year for the Sooners they just haven't kicked that many field goals and this will be a 33 yard attempt and just kind of interested in what if kicker my do and they're pretty good did you know this is going on young man's going to be okay for redshirt freshman from Oklahoma City tiedye this ESPN telecast available in high definition on ABC HD we want to thank our production staff for reminding us that this Texas Tech Red Raiders team has one of the great comebacks of all time in a bowl game against Minnesota the greatest comeback in the history of the bowl and Glen Mason it cost him his job with the Golden Gophers so I am sure that Bob Stoops and the Sooners are well aware that there's a lot of firepower over here on the other side wall brings it up the 32 yard line let's go back to Matt New York for an update Matt what do you got for us Brent I've got a nominee for the punty a gamechanging performance from those Oregon State Beavers down at Arizona by a point Sean can't deal with Sammy slaughter 47 yards for the 7 to set up a gamewinning he'll go the Canfield was 3 for 3 on that drive cast your vote for this week's Pontiac gamechanging performance go to espn.com starting 9 tomorrow and Matt Cinderella lives 10 Oregon State a win away to the Rose Bowl they hold the right there over USC and now they are just one away from taking on Penn State which would be a rematch there cut it off for the readers and he breaks out to the 39 yard line to Texas Texas has been so unlike them tonight but it's because the job that rent Venables defensive coordinator and team the way they've prepared they're taking away all the gaps and all the seams did this office like to try to expose that because of the coverage they've been able to get pressure on Graham Harrell with things and quickly Louis wound up to help out after Gerald McCoy big 93 let's talk about the defensive line out Beal McCoy Taylor and Frank Alexander have done a fine job with that front the other thing is these guys are tired of hearing about Texas Tech and their all offensive line and how they are and I know the Oklahoma coach has played that up to two straight weeks challenging them he looked a little angry tonight the way they're playing a game on flaw see what they could do with his third in two Oh Lisa the Internet we didn't do the little things that's a little thing that's a person no they fumble it away and it's Oklahoma football the nightmare continues Kanan Clayton scoops the fumble up and brings it back to the two yard line then again it through the little thing and into the little thing and that's a big thing putting it on the ground and how about the speed of the Sooners defense when Clayton gets the ball he's in jail man he's pointing the top if the Jews were there but a freshman Austin bought and all those takes it into the end zone again watch his block coming in there or the fumble here so I was but what a big block there to spring plate and loose it's like a race to the end zone he can't get it through over so Brown is your running back laughs is your pull back I look back now to check the sidelines Brown will do suck it down a go let's go back and take a look at this block that Herbie told you about the hustle five players when they have a chance to help with teammate right there box and if you would have seen how far he came to put on that block gives you two check marks from Brent Venables for the hustle they're good shot by Austin Bob yeah and Frank Alexander yep leading the way too and Brown battling battling stop still going both into the end zone touchdown Oklahoma always talk to my eightyearold twin boys about never stop moving your feet how about the effort here by Chris Brown second third fourth fifth sixth effort never giving up kind of a defining play to the way this entire game has gone for Oklahoma it protects his head great effort there by Chris Brown his third rushing touchdown of the night Carter whitson Oh put the ball down Jimmy Stephens Nexon another extra point it is all Oklahoma Saturday Night Football on ABC brunching by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fees the OL new 2009 h3t pickup the most versatile Hummer ever samsung mobile proud sponsor of ESPN rivalry week and Bud Light the difference is drinkability a football game that has not lived up to its advanced billing it has been extremely onesided if you're joining us late Oklahoma has dominated on both sides of the ball it means an awful lot to the Sooners as well as the Red Raiders and that will be a penalty let's take a look now at the dr. pepper big 12 update and we start taking a look as a hurry we call it the bigger picture here now Texas Tech unbeaten then should they go on and lose this we would have Texas Tech Texas and Oklahoma all tie what's interesting is Texas actually need Oklahoma what happened tonight some people anticipated if Texas Tech has won lon and his Oklahoma word alone Oklahoma state it would be headtohead between Texas Tech and that's not good for the Longhorns the Longhorns actually need affairs to beat Oklahoma State could a threeway tie incomplete they're doing such a great job of taking away grant Harold's options there's just nowhere to go with a football everybody's matching up with a receiver Graham Harrell has nowhere to go with the ball this defense is so wellprepared I was Jeremy feel that defensive end number 44 Oh had him wrapped up because he's basically couldn't pour down lineman dropping the fakirs off they're picking up the receivers in underneath and that blow was delivered by Brian Jackson Brian Jackson Nick Harris and Dominique pranks have been outstanding in that secondary tonight we've got a flag I think there were questions are we coming into this game about this Oklahoma defending office number 74 10yard penalty repeat second down and deserving himself or the way they've given up some big plays the Sheraton Texas Kansas State Kansas and I went back and I looked at our big bowl championship game for last year against Oklahoma played Missouri by another only two starters tonight it started in San Antonio gets the very the coil foot and Nick Harris otherwise you have nine new starters playing right now compared to where they were a year ago getting a push match on the outside and then the linebackers in the defensive backs are taking him down Mike was over there and there's your offense less than 200 yards old six on third down or two on fourth down and it turned it over toys Oklahoma's keeping everything in front of them and then their game tackling warming to the football just a confident group right now this presbury on that biker screen coming into the middle breaking at tackling his most impressive play of the night his horse collar tackett on also a flag in the backfield it could be a holding call it looks like Oklahoma thinks it's a holding call and now we got a personal foul downfield so it offsets Nick Harris guilty that at horsecollar Crabtree Crabtree shaken up a little bit there found by both teams on the play personal foul hands to the head by the offense number 12 personal foul horse collar by the defense goes tunnel he's offset repeat the third down let's watch this by frat trade the big third down and boy its first time tonight fans had a chance to see his strength fighting through those tackles and it Nick Harris there at the end that was really menacing go down an 18 open Crabtree can't battle for the first down puts it on a ground wraps it up himself Harris came over to help out Frank's on that play Harris plays with an attitude plays safety that's why they tried him at middle linebacker one game he couldn't handle that after the injury to Reynolds cut the arm strength there by Graham Harrell all the way from the left hash close to the boundary there to give his receiver Crabtree a chance now obviously they've got to go for it here on fourth down Shannon woods is the running back rushing for he finds somebody he does on the move to the 25yard line is Louis Graham Harrell actually having some time here for men rushing and got a little mantoman underneath there and this time Lewis is able to pull away from Travis Lewis who is in critical position but an accurate throw by Harrell and indeed Sean Lewis showing what he can do what he has the ball his him bat jennife right back take by Harrigan says screen and broken up on the play Gerald McCoy the other thing that Oklahoma worked on a long time in practice was the screen packaged by the Red Raiders they know how much they love this screen put different variations of it in the defensive personnel they are so well coached in this game they're actually running out to the screen before the running back has a chance to turn back and want to catch the football second and ten Carol's got a lot of time strikes in the middle first down at the 10 yard line and that swindle this is the big mystery coming into the game with Graham Harrell have time to throw the football would it would Texas Tech protect him and allow him to stay in rhythm and so you can see there what it's different for any quarterback let alone gram heroin you give him that kind of time to sit back there and read a defense control the football putting a few passes here in the middle of that Oklahoma's he said something occurs because that a good job is taken away all night on the back of the end zone Crabtree was working back there this is really a good job here by Oklahoma's defense containing Graham Harold Brett the last two ballgames he had bought time by getting to the outside of defenses at this time Oklahoma's defense recognizing he was looking the role out to his right in Taylor and have moved to the outside to take that away from pre just took himself out of the game he's caught three balls for 43 yards Jacoby Franks replaces him to put pressure with box outside and deflected away from Jacoby pranks now ordinarily that would have been Crabtree over there but he had taken himself out of the game but the way the coverage was by Franks the ball was a bit late I don't know if it would have mattered who was in there because the way Frank jumps this route dominate Frank's the defensive coach is telling this is a firstyear stoner only a sophomore out of pulpit Union British jumping the routes tonight taking calculated Crabtree returns third down or outside of the copier screen comes back to the middle for a touchdown and that is Morris the elf they opened a little bit of magic because it looked to me that the linebacker there got his hands on the football Kenan quake what focus here by the AL Eric Morris watch right there yeah it looked like heating Clayton 22 right in the throwing Lane and luckily protects the stick Graham Harrell had enough on the ball to get that through the linebacker and Morris makes the catch Matt Williams to get the extra point five minutes to go here in the third quarter the sooner for the big lead that pass was deflected and Morris like you said stuff referee near the conclusion of tonight's game will select a Chevrolet player of the game from each team and Chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution each University general scholarship fund well is there anything prettier than a Flint shot of a stadium at night and we want to thank our friends at Outback Steakhouse proud sponsor the Outback Bowl the bloomin onion 1 airship fanfavorite every week Alys football Telecaster and ESPN on ABC Corona kicks one that will come out on the 20yard line meanwhile let us head to New York Matt Winer for sports center right now Matt I bred school Center right now powered by Vizio Penn State is headed back to the road Bowl first time in Boise after dominating mystic state Houston Darryl parks quarterback after Luke Joe Paterno confirmed a litter for a quota for the season as head coach could be a rematch he touched upon this Oregon State at a comeback win to beat Arizona he will go out the gun one it went over Oregon next week and the Beavers will meet Penn State that will be something man a rematch of a game won easily ball dropped incomplete one easily RV by the Nittany Lions but that was before they found that little running back up there at Oregon State on quiz Rodgers doing a good job it's an explosive offense in order to stay plus it was on the road right finally for whatever reason his struggle in September and then come on strong throughout the conference conference schedule hey Bradford's going to be tackled how about that huh today grass stain down there I'll go hit the quarterback turn him into a football player now what is it I noted for you folks he calm down I've got a little pressure there on it Jake Ratliff and Henley Bradford thought he was playing touch football they're down in the 13 and we're going to flag flying here we have had some penalties here tonight I'll tell you that and it's 14 penalties all most of them of interesting life gone against Oklahoma that's wrong negative legal Constitution defense to all people on the field in the substitutes of fiveyard penalty filtered out well this is not leaches favorite venue I will tell you folks that under Mike Leach in Norman completion percentage less than 60 total yards a game 380 total points a look at the points 16 points a game and his record Owen for well on his way to Owen by he wants he wants no part of normal and like scoops in like pervious told you Oklahoma knows his offense as well as he does they ran it for a year it got refined certainly Mark Mangino find it through a large extent when he was the offensive coordinator that was Chuck long and and now of course Kevin Wilson and of course speaking of that of that coaching staff with Mangino and leach Stoops told us wonderful story that folks I want you to imagine this coaches didn't have the wives here that first year and it all would meet like in a dormitory room at a hotel it was always man Gino's room probably cuz he had the best food they had the TV on and Bob and the guys that leave and that man Gino would go to bed and lease would be able to corner watching Howard Stern on television and he would say Mike turn the TV off when you look at you think you got a picture Mark Mangino trying to go to sleep and there's leach watching Howard Stern over there on each channel I don't imagine mercy all the assistants have gone on to be head coaches in that group Mike it goes Chuck belongs out of San Diego State those Mangino at Kansas Mike is over there in Arizona tough losses coming someone in Houston Oh when I created Brent Venables photo so without a doubt Kevin Wilson will be added to that list very soon yep now Penn opposed for me he was at what interview by Clemson and she told me the truth trucks napkin preffered that's a direct snap to Michael Crabtree and hey ABC Tuesday Herbie Herbie you got me hooked on this okay they told me it is Dancing with the Stars there's a fun show and it's it's all new Monday and I can't believe the Warren Sapp is still alive already pretty good he's being able to bone brands and you know the great thing he doesn't talk well he doesn't dance and that's what he said is bad a little personality than everybody came through joy we give me an element SAP die machen Shannon Walker oh that could have been picked up on a deflection there that was Frank's coming in Dominique you know what the last time there's been a full detective Tech has the ball Graham Harrell had all kinds of time to throw and it virtually led to a touchdown now this time comes out these first few times and there is a lot of pressure credible thing enough for that we don't care that it's 52 14 let's try to get after this job I'm still thinking about my Gino trying to sleep bleep songs now it's turn her down in 13 looks away but in deep trouble you know he's got a strong you know info you launched out of our eyes pretty good or somebody analysis o be brought about by Graham Harrell a bill was coming up he was it he was a prior to heat Crabtree was in the general vicinity pressure again the go check some well you know just one of those nights of the Red Raiders they've still got a game left it can maintain position with a threeway tie but I don't think again how much style points down as hard if this the fifth lead holds on is dominating is this is it's going to become a Texas Oklahoma discussion regardless if it's a threeway tie of them right Roy Lee's Ryan portals and you know Herbie I want to remind everybody about Monday night Aaron Rodgers doing pretty good is Brett Favre's replacement and how about Drew Brees old coach Joe tiller and Purdue today that's the Monday night are going to be Green Bay and the Saints and of course Monday night countdown it will start at all at 7:00 Eastern Time in the the Saints won the last game 3427 Beckham 2006 think about Erina logic what you think what I mean they came out a cow I loved him I liked them actually hit it now hit that year but he's finally getting his chance he handled the pressure very well as the belly play comes flying on this place let's go back to that discussion about Texas and Oklahoma be destroyed the threeway tie folks remember this the BCS rankings I will December 92 fiveyard penalty okay first M will determine the winner if there's a threeway tie look for it to be a threeway tie would have to go this way Texas Tech would have to beat Baylor and that will be down in Lubbock next week remember on Thursday night now Thursday night is going to be the Texas Texas A&amp;M rivalry the Aggies of beat them a couple of times in row so Texas will be ready for that games Oklahoma we would have at Oklahoma City I should say up it's still walk against Oklahoma State and if they all win it's a threeway tie and the BCS rankings decided now here's the issue Oklahoma looked a really good time okay really really good they may come protects is going to say well that's all fine but let's remember we beat them on a neutral field and doubts that'll be this huge debate style points Oklahoma getting a huge opportunity on stage tonight on stage now next Saturday night and it's going to be style points and the hot team in the big 12 it's going to be perceived to be Oklahoma because of what they're doing and Texas is going to say like you said hey we beat it I find that interesting Texas needs Oklahoma to beat Oklahoma State for it to be so here's my question here's my question which of those oneloss teams if this holds up will be numbered to come somehow the Gators have been redhot the horns idol this week what you're sort of feeling I don't like it well you six at all I feel I still think Florida's be the best team in the contract I think when I worry about you know yeah you're going to get me in trouble in Austin I want my good hey well I'm not worried about protection is it they went through a fourgame run when they were the school and because of the way they lost and all of a sudden they kind of just disappeared a bit off the radar and you worried for them and need to continued and brought up if they did beat Oklahoma heads ahead and that's going to be the their one thing Oh God beautiful play by Johnson Oh my guess is it worth it to live with it yeah with the injured elbow they go 66 yards for a touchdown we can't even talk about the PC is when I Ventura does that unbelievable pops do probably wants to show his appreciation for Manny Johnson because of what he's been able to do it the first time since the injury he's been able to come back there's Bob giving him a big hug to come back and have an impact and make a big play when I can't believe his left arm his left elbow has that big break and he brought that football in with his left hand Marie his first catch of the night six people the company was hired a bad misfire on the extra point let's let us go back to this spectacular catch by number one here he comes this is how Sam Bradford ditched his numbers if he finds the opportunity in a oneonone situation with his receivers against the defensive back a puts a very accurate throw great catch but a heck of a throw again by Sam Bradford let's go down below to Lisa hey Brennan here's something really interesting about Manny Johnson you mentioned earlier in the broadcast about how nasty the injury look a month ago when we saw it on television I asked him if he had to summit it to you and what we said are you kidding I love gory stuff like that I watched it at least at least 15 times everything I agree ridiculous would be usually don't hear a guy and he liked the film entry we're just finishing that set with Texas Texas the concerns you have for them is their bit off the radar in Oklahoma's become the team that everybody is going to be talking about because they poachers in this game this wall again we've been busy well let's go back to the the one loss of discussion Texas of course lost on the last play yep Texas Tech okay there's their top 25 wins good resume Florida lost at home we can't look past that to Ole Miss but still good resume lots of points lately Oklahoma a file Evan loss you need a tough question why should I put four to three let me ask you who do you put a head for Oklahoma I don't have a vote okay here my voter okay here to do all it you know help me live how should I know Oklahoma and Texas I've been voting Texas ahead of Oklahoma because they beat him headtohead and that's fair that grade you continue that would you prefer to but I can live with that I can live with that discussion however I will tell you that this performance in Texas Tech certainly then normal bit different and let us not forget that the Longhorns will be undefeated and I feel too that when we be country back from that pop up before the craft recap okay he should have had the interception the lollipop right wait get in a little cloud is trying to pretend now have a great career okay and he'll learn from this and he kind of kept it in here yeah you're right did he make the attention they were and they waited but hey it counts doesn't there's a craft Korea has done only three catches for 43 yards so they've really shut him down they've chucked Graham Harrell they've been a just a great performance by off go to the first down Louis where this secondary these linebackers have played well for for Venables tonight if there's any coach on this field who has improved his resume there is front Venables the defensive coordinator at Oklahoma and will return after this message and a word from our ABC stations 72 points on the board but 58 of them have been scored by Oklahoma seven fully favored coming in here now it is fourth down and one for the Red Raiders miss here and it will be a very short field for the Sooners bring the end around and he will get down Sooners football my pleats just trying to go into his bag of tricks and around here to speak sir Edward Britain and even this the Sooners have sniffed out this defense again wellprepared playing aggressively playing violently in the way they're chasing is called a Brent Venables has to be ecstatic with the way this group is performed there was a good shot of Bobby Jack right with the nut Bobby Jack right is one of Stoops best recruiters then work down at Texas knows Texas inside and out it works with the secondary here alongside Venables through outstanding coaches Madhu will check in as a running back and they want to give Murray a chance prior to the snap false start offense number 72 fiveyard penalty Phil Purcell well how about this Serbian American Music Awards lineup bigger than this all right Jimmy Kimmel is going to be hosting it tomorrow's at seven six central beyond any Western coalition house ahead how we reverse my couch Oh things on there the one nerd you have to know for me is the answer all right because your wife all legit all right give me give me your best shot what's with Lidle will she pick it did she pick it out at Lisa's upset or Beth how long am i dancing come on Alvarez colleano nice a Greg I know kenny chesney you've got an OB on uh all right okay she could be aware oh she's going to matter what she groans okay go ahead okay so I know what you'll be the winner I single baby didn't scare perform last week on SNL it was about a good question that we all were home before you about my three days pretty Oh most is trying to figure out what we're going next week and now we know that's right we're going to be in Stillwater Kirk Herbstreit Lisa you're invited to join us we've got Oklahoma and Oklahoma State uh pat boone Pickens Stadium Way be fun to see the food away from Norman yeah if they could take this same attitude on the road without its head they going to come back with a screen in themselves Royals in zone Wow what april foolís by the Sooners yeah one team still out there playing a hundred miles an hour in the red a Texas Tech defense right now it should beat down mentally and physically great effort here my boil foot had gotten everybody involved with this Oklahoma offense tonight building a 60 point explosion by the Sooners I got one for you Rosie what about the possibility of an Oklahoma Texas rematch all any Oracle I would love that can you figure out a way to better talk to Alabama Cooperative well the reminder to stay tuned after the game for your late local news over many of these ABC stations except in the West Coast of course over on ESPN you can check out SportsCenter and they'll have some of the BCS implications and they'll tell you about Syracuse coming back to upset Notre Dame and Oregon State beating Arizona and on track to play Penn State in State and Oregon State in the Rose Bowl they're invincible of course that would send USC probably to a BCS bowl as a wildcard bobbled by wall in to the end zone comes out on the 20th we take a look at our Pacific Life game summary now you look at the two obviously Bradford the bigger night and now with the four touchdowns no interceptions and he will emerge out of this game with the upper hand now over Graham Harrell for the Heisman Trophy discussion I still think the quarterback out of Austin Texas Colt McCoy is not only right in the debate I think it's he and Sam Bradford right there together I think tbo's back in the den he sure is especially the way the big 12 South could have put the votes three years running backs and you see Alexander brewing number 84 coming up that line that's why they like his upside he is a future star and it's been so important for him to develop he's only a freshman out of path Rouge Louisiana I thought how did he get out of the way of LSC but I guess they weren't on on him heavy Albarn actually wanted him if the injuries to Austin English and also the Allen Davis his ability to come on here for the Sooners has been very important he is through on Harrell incomplete Jeremy peel had him wrapped up and there's a penalty flag the bottom line to me Texas Tech has been exposed in the trenches on both sides of the ball tonight against Oklahoma now often we say that's how you throw a flag up here they say you gotta have it like this oh maybe he threw it on his buddy that's all the funnier things that see tonight it I'd see to foul play offense personal foul has to say number 74 deputies decline potential grounding number fifth off of the after swallow foul for down so Beale had him wrapped up how about the effort right now in Oklahoma's defense there are 51 points here in the fourth quarter and they're flying around like it for three point in there prior to hearing about sexy stuff Oklahoma State get ready from the end zone going middle and come play down what a blow by Nick Harris Nick Harris folks got a chance to play safety at that next level if his speed is as good as it has to be he's a bigtime hitter both safeties emerge here Lindy Holmes and Nick Harris to the left at Holmes and here's parent inter at your own risk when you come to the middle of the Sooner defense ball up in the air hanging Britain just focused on catching the football knowing that Holmes and Harris might eventually get there but they separated him from the football glad to see him walk away from that hit personal foul defense number five unnecessary contrast right I didn't say how many wasn't helping the helmet he he said the fin tied him in the shoulder and Holmes makes the first pin to the bottom second guy in in Paris oh I appreciate him trying to protect the issue but I didn't think that was very much that's the point of e will take the width in batch 13 minutes left and it's Todd Walker's perception is a Jew were to be a long trip home to love it but they've got Baylor next week and it's a shame that more than likely the BCS can only select two of the three from the big 12 as far as the teams that are in the debate about who could potentially go through he's in four games complete and that's a person 10 and that was Louis come over let's check that that was Leon wasn't always nice and you know there every way there is a scenario that's really could make it but if we're not get Missouri to win the championship we have a great great game oh yeah and with a loser to still be ranked number two right okay Fred anything though you talk to feed on and then those came to make it at large Texas or Oklahoma so there is a way yep but you're right it's in product and back to running back woods for a question that's the funny thing this huge debate about who will emerge from the big 12 South to get into the championship game it's almost like you talk to people it's a foregone conclusion whoever gets in to the championship game or they're given they're in the chain national championship it's like whoa wait a second tape Daly on the tiger and still playing football this year right it's going to be a game in Kansas City in the fuel that alongside Harold Iren and the linebacker not given in much daylight but swindle picks up the first down you know man Lindy homes making the slap there's minimal loss demon hard time climbing Charts and that of course of USC Carol launches one per the ins crafter he goes high in the air and thin complete I think he was out of the end zone I think that they they ruled that Nick Harris what an athletic play that was anyway take a look at number five coming over the top down off the tip pass five comes inlaid Harris and try to stretch it to put a hole he'd have been able to go for me to watch number five now boy Android but looked like it might have been panelist again he was wobbling the football I spend on the body it could have been no what if I break down breathe and he's got an athletic move there he was twenty full speed to hold that football in tumble was forced by Jeremy Beal number 44 Jeremy Biel was coming in got a hand on a football force the fumble oklahoma ball up 65 to 14 and Harold shaken up from it remember this Texas Tech offensive line only allowing five sacks the whole year tonight three against Oklahoma what a play by Jeremy hill what a prick moments why they so you defense here tonight Saturday Night Football on ABC rookie by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fees the OL new Dodge rad never backed down from a challenge Verizon Wireless and enterprise rentacar will pick you up these played like a champion here today and the backup quarterback Joey hauls Lee has come in Chris Brown is running back so Sam Bradford's night is done and here is balls Lee now and he completes his first pass of the game as he comes on in and hits wood routine so there is the young man he's the senior from money didn't Beach California of course last year he had to step in for Sam Bradford who was injured early in the game on the 4th play almost led the Sooners back to a victory after they were down early in a cave Brown spinning for about seven yards on that in a hurry there are so many impressive statistics and it was true of both these teams but but I couldn't help but look at this one Oklahoma and I'm counting tonight now folks Oklahoma this year has been into the red zone 62 times okay they scored 56 touchdowns ok there's 6 for 6 tonight getting into the red zone all touchdowns that's unbelievable yeah it means that that's on pace to be one of the best ever efforts inside the 20yard line Sam Bradford night is over for touchdown 42 now in the year they tied the school record do you think he'll set the school record next week the game is so honored very solid performance but the game his story has been the Oklahoma offensive line helping Sam Bradford DeMarco Murray Chris Brown and company out here is brown and we'll be up there Saturday night run football it'll be Oklahoma Oklahoma State and there's Graham Harrell that's excellent reports it looks like he's in pain there looks like they're defending the way left ankle or foot also size down the foot area but there's Brown battling just short but other first down differences just as soon as just trying to bring the clock down we've talked a lot about Brent Venables tonight Kevin Wilson the offensive coordinator as you mentioned how it's been sometime at Northwestern or Brandi Walker his really paid his dues as an assistant done a great job here for Bob Stoops is an offensive coordinator of calling plays and in my opinion and I think you agree as much as people are talking about Brent Venables getting his chance to become a head coach I think Kevin Wilson the way he is a complete coach not just an offensive coach a complete coach manages people well I think people wonder likely this season I'm sure will come in to talk to Kevin wolf yeah the late Randy Walker brought him to Northwestern from Miami of Ohio yeah and they studied the team wasn't very good okay they had to find a way to move the football and Kevin was summited that really is how he and Randy settled on the sort of uptempo spread offense with the quarterback checking over the sidelines he said we we took a lot of stuff from different people Clemson was was using part of it and nice job guys and says down there in the feet it is we've got a timeout here 827 and the Sooners are ripping Texas Tech area of coverage for tonight's game courtesy of the Outback Steakhouse airship bloomin onion 1 the bloomin onion 1 airship fanfavorite every week on ABC ESPN college football broadcasts will next week come along Stillwater Oklahoma Oklahoma State hosting Oklahoma the bedlam game and wouldn't the Cowboys wouldn't the Cowboys dearly love to have an upset in that huge rivalry game game is always competitive no matter where it's played but especially when it's played and still want it and I better get ready couple pretty good running backs out of their way here Harvey well we've got four great running backs playing Maria Brown huge games tonight again led by that offensive line and how about next week Marie Brown posted at Oklahoma State and of course Kendall hunters we're going to floor there's a great tale how is watching this tape again this week you've been ready for that game Zach Robinson Gundy brothers will be on opposite side lines the Elector storylines the nasty rival I'm sure boon himself will be there for that game there's a first down so it's a for those like junior the rustling amounts of down early sidelines that's him that is him in the cowboy hair right there that's junior he's got a rustling assignment tomorrow and normally he's on duty the night before but he told him I'll be the game that I hit he owns barbecue restaurants around here around Oklahoma City and huge huge sooner fan and and there he is he now he knows a good guy from a bad guy when he sees one and that there you know Brian Bosworth was here I got his autograph did you yeah over sooner legends in where we're staying yeah and certainly in his room no I mean Jamar Browns reloop said that was good Pro Bowl second year so and there's the bars right there that's Brian Bosworth Amy and there he was we had him in the inside of the hotel signing autographs so I did some big games of that I bet I did some Miami battles a little home in Miami Pierce Pierce that's the that's the boss's son right there and it was good to see I always had those funky haircut yeah yeah he's toned down a little bit yeah yeah suck it down and nine all the way out of bounds that at about the but the 10 out you don't suppose Oklahoma is going to hang a 70 on these huh I think it got to get rid it's filling up member style points matter my friend when it comes to the BPM a lot of people watching a lot of style points for that show you let me play it out it was a kind of style the only thing that stopped the Sooners is that clock they're just keep it well here's a third down now and of course question is what the Stoops do on fourth down they don't it's all timeout also everyone over the sidelines Josh wait for him well big game Bob again huh struggle a little bit in some of those bcs bowl games lately but here eleven sixty and two and i think we got it another good example of why he is so tough here well here's your BCS standings and I really I really do wonder who's going to jump to number number two Texas Florida's Oklahoma jump both of them with this performance injures the Trojans have just got to be saying hey Yoho can't we get any respect at the Allstate BCS standings but if Oregon State goes to the Rose Bowl and I will tell you in reading the Los Angeles Times over the last few weeks I really get the impression that USC and certainly more their fans and the writers do not want to play the big 10 again in the Rose Bowl they want USC to go out and play at Texas play an Oklahoma play a Florida play somebody and even if it's not the only rule they want to go to one of the BCS holes and meet somebody else from the different counties and you know what the pigtail might be happy with what's the way Oregon State plan right now they're going to get that chance that looks like it's not the five yards I could see as you a wonderful you know we the presidentelect Barack Obama we should ask Emily likes for number two and we put a piece in two million college before we know that that can help us that we're gonna need some help trying to figure out how to separate these things not a great job has the bobster cheers ten years at the Oklahoma justices sticking out far down that program at going back of the end zone a complete and was thrown to Iglesias last game was seventy plus that was against Newark he had that reputation early in his career big game Bob because they performed so well and then people have taken shots because of the loss to LSU in a national title USC in a national title and then of course to Boise State in West Virginia and you know would win when they matched up with USC that night and it got out of hand it was about like this but the other way that was just a great USC football team what happened against West Virginia boy because you can't make an excuse for it but they I think they just didn't necessarily respect and anticipate maybe how good those teams might be that night but when you plan here and you come in and you're ranked number two and they're at number five you're going if you're going to get the class for your graders got the fastball trying to kick the pylon is you stiffen it out of bounds here's a good thing I think that is the joke for this everybody else there's kind of smiling down there hey I took one for the team fourth down by already trying to get the 70 who I'm out desert 114 nonstick they're out there with the nohuddle did you spoil the heck sutures in trouble he's down to only one timeout eighty five thousand six hundred and forty six a new stadium record here and now we're about to find out if they're going to put a seventy up on the Red Raiders fourth down and goal going to run for it banging closely in zone and didn't get it so it'll be Red Raider football swindles had a big night there he caught four balls for 50 yards and yes sir did you call that big dick Oh $50 a big night I want you to search for certain oh yeah let's go down below to Lisa well Brandis you can see Graham Harrell coming back onto the field despite the score he really worked on in that entire time that he was over on the sidelines in his left foot he tried to throw the ball a few times and it seems like he is having trouble planting on that left foot but he's playing anyway thank you very much he's a gamer down 6514 they'll run back out of there bachelier runner and receiver tonight for the for the Red Raiders and thinking about that game next week with Oklahoma and Oklahoma stated Mike gun decision has an ability to coach in these kind of rivalry games where he'll be ready especially playing Oklahoma at home that would be a physical football game next week that's a Craig James's son here until the 27 hit making his first catch of the night and that is Adam James Richard freshman so folks a reminder Beyonce Jimmy Kimmel will host the American Music Awards live Sunday November 23rd it's a better than perfect okay take credit everybody's like forgive me a rematch with that gang I know I was awful the first time here's Harold thinking look the crowd 170 I can tell the ones which a lot of a lot of folks are leaving right now they follow the way out a lot of these fans go back how about my friend PJ Carlesimo this could mean our explicitly Fatiha Wow pulls out about tough new owner brought that stole that deviancy Havel how many games a big one probably about 1 in 13 or 14 something like that shailen woods there's Crabtree your big MBA guy well yeah what was you know I'm Haley I'm like a lot of fans I'd really get in from some of the playoff star so that's what kind of from the boring kind of pay a little attention to what's going on around July 4th is usually when I get going with the NBA heavy there be a yeah they do go late into the summer when they when they push down to the Suites month did you and they seem to get later and rested you later so third down at six a little pressure here with the backups dropped incomplete yeah this has been such a disappointing performance for the UH for the Red Raiders in this game what it does is truthfully it knocks it even if they went out and Oklahoma beat Oklahoma State in a threeway tie it's really because it is before it it'll knock them out I didn't see a discussion about which of the three will be higher ranked they'll they'll drop out it becomes a Texas Oklahoma discussion I would think that Utah might jump Nash Texas Tech does to the police will have to see you know because you know you got computers and you have to Harris pull guys and you got the coaches coaches look at things of it differently sometimes the the Red Raiders were the fourth and sixth oh they're one of four on four felony let me take you through some nice images some storage a big win for Ohio State I'm sure the rich Rodriguez the Wolverines couldn't wait for this season to be over see if they can regroup so the Buckeyes Embassy's not a high note regular season Penn State let seen a rose bowl bid with a big big win over Michigan State in here Billy bonel our producer extremely happy as his orange Shox know today Adrian damn please son throws the winning touchdown pass and there's your Utes 12 and oh and headed for a BCS bowl down there my friend and one others the best best story of the day for an iron roll defensive back for the Florida State Seminoles awarded a road scholarship and I believe he got to the game at halftime on a private plane was that the story that Lisa had last week when we were down in Tallahassee and the Seminoles with a big game coming up against Florida yeah at home you bet there's still one of those rivalry games you know quite put by Ted dropping out of that discussion Brent you know what happens to them for a full opportunity think about this morning when they woke up they're thinking about BCS there's thinking about national championship and now they're thinking about holiday or cotton yeah more than likely you're right and I'm so good about that you're going to have Texas or Oklahoma Missouri if they're able to pull off a shocker in a big 12 championship game getting to the BCS and sectors that could be left out big difference yeah very disappointing picture for everyone involved at the program they've been such a wonderful sort of Cinderella story all season long and they were so good for us and it was so much fun I actually get along its fourth and six now and tech is a little four on fourth down here tonight going again now Crabtree picks up another one so it will be first down with three minutes to go here for the Red Raiders you know what you know what else is really sad it really said that Donald Trump's not going to get another game ball yeah but you guys all crying about that one yeah 2:45 he's proud of himself over prediction not hard to this one but if incomplete and Robinson was applying some pressure it is still this Assad it's been a great season over Mike Leach and he's been a terrific story it you know there there you can see just the difference when we go up against boxers you know that little piece of paper we always see here it is he's got that little piece of paper but he always goes and you see with the pin during the game and you think that's his play chart in that binnacle says but what he is he checks off the plays as he calls him so he knows how many times they've only got about he's only got about seven or eight plays and he checks him off and it's how many times he's used him in it says he doesn't want to insult any play you know I know it's terribly disappointing for my dear tonight but he really has been a wonderful story and person to deal with for sure and you know thanks to all the people down there Texas Tech and Lubbock and for Oklahoma and Stoops they go on to the next big game and that will be next Saturday night on ABC 8:00 Eastern against the Cowboys of Oklahoma State and the Sooners hope to keep on driving hope to keep on winning and picking up brownie points if they finish ahead if they get a threeway tie Lee the important thing is for Texas Tech to regroup against Baylor at Baylor do they go home and they hang their heads and they don't come back you get a twoway tie the big 12 Texas is going to the championship game they got the tiebreaker Trent so Oklahoma a better shake some hands here and say you fellas regroup in place better football down in Lubbock next week and here comes woods which is down to the 35 yard line and you can think about the top five and they were maybe scheduled there you see Alabama the Iron Bowl they've lost six straight Auburn then they have to go to Atlanta to play Florida SEC champion takes effect at Baylor game we talked about that Texas with the Aggies Florida goes to Florida State found a seed in Alabama a sec Oklahoma we go to Oklahoma State we will have to see who plays Missouri for the big 12 championship there is more sin underneath with another completion the final seconds tick away a big big win folks for the for the Sooners you had to be impressed with how they played tonight how they jumped out on top and never look back not only they win this game they made a statement I mean they took advantage of an opportunity and now it's to the next phase next week against Oklahoma State complete and we got a touchdown for the Red Raiders beat Ron Lewis so we go into the 80s their point total but 65 Oh put up by the Sooners ten Texas Tech days we like to see moments earlier in the game but nonetheless detron Lewis Mike Leach feels that he could become their next great receiver here kind of gets overshadowed because of all the talk and all the love for Michael Crabtree 99 yards remember they left that ball back on the one you have on 12 plays four and a half minutes our Chevrolet players of the game they're in batch the running back 47 rushing and 33 receiving Sam Bradford threw for 304 yards and four touchdowns and wind and a recognition of their efforts Chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution to each University's general scholarship fund Brett you and you have a great Thanksgiving yeah Happy Thanksgiving you in the herb spree family and all those wonderful children of yours absolutely see you in the Stillwater yep the price of boone Pickens gasoline is going down it'll cost less to drive from the Oklahoma City Airport so there's our big 12 standings now threeway tie right now six and one Texas Tech I think this is an Oklahoma I think it's funny how Oklahoma needs to pull protec Texas needs to pull for Oklahoma and Oklahoma has to beat Oklahoma State everywhere because you need a three way time because like you said if you're Oklahoma and it's you against Texas here how did the discussion then two weeks we'll be at the big 12 championship game that's in Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium Missouri already locked up the north they await the decision that is probably not the way to at Texas Tech does against Baylor they're going to have to regroup yeah they'll be favored at home next weekend sure they'll get support from their home fans on sidekick did it go 10 yards I don't think it went 10 yards but we'll let the officials but it was possible with that out anyways rifle is it is going to touch it yeah man Terrell's trot now point out twenty four go fightin like clap the fullback at his hand there we go question the fast that's a kind of a celebrity they don't have a have two kicker and at the same time make it look like they're going to kick the ball a good strategy he began got to get the lino and one of the big guys Bruce that pretty much sums up your night does it a full foot knock it off the woods the runningback and that's going to do it well Bob soup said he can tell what Michael H is going to call and he proved it here tonight and now is persistent shake hands still good friends without motivation 35:21 Wooden's and what you are wrecking well you know everyone we played these guys a lot and we haven't been in Sudan I know everyone talks about that but that hasn't been the case when we played them so I want to say the humble good way we did expect to play well or for it not to be a shootout you told us yesterday and Branson said it's no secrets between these two teams you knew what they were going to be calling but how were you able to make it look so easy it wasn't easy they're a great team we really are Mike does a great job offensively our guys really played well really disciplined we covered well and we were in the right position and things are starting to jump we saw Texas Tech play the last couple of weeks we saw how powerful they're often is how was your defense it would be so dominant I know you said that you played well against them but we see these guys play how are you again I got a tremendous respect for second and Mike and what they do really for the most part through the years of really play to what we understand our guys with tackle in states would get good pressure we and our guys cover well and so again it's just fundamental we can't do anything faster just so normal stuff if I close to the board what message well worth the dust of all festival runners what love the way we ran the ball Sam Bradford has been is just out of this world the guys are quite a bit regulation sprint alright Lisa thank you very much again the Sooners roll 65 21 and over previously unbeaten Texas Tech next Saturday now we'll be in Stillwater Oklahoma for number 5 Oklahoma versus number 12 Oklahoma State and that 5 will change for Oklahoma it will be Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines at 8:00 p.m. Eastern next Saturday night so for Lisa Salters and Kirk Herbstreit I'm
