============================================================

ESPN Bowl Boise Idaho the locals call it Treasure Valley the city of trees a city that has opened its arms of the first ever humanitarian bowl matching Cincinnati against Utah State the Bearcats make their first pole appearance in 47 long droughtstricken years quarterback Chad Plummer has run and passed the Bearcats to Boise Cincinnati is a team with a dangerous return man and the best outside linebacker in Conference USA for Utah State John L Smith had led the Aggies to their second bowl game of the 90s Matt sock has a bigtime arm growing for nearly 3,000 yards and defensively no one's bigger than Ben Crossland the Big West Defensive Player of the Year welcome to Boise Idaho Cincinnati and Utah state they are not household names but may soon be two programs on the rise and meet today in the firstever humanitarian Bowl and hi everybody I'm Craig Boyer jacked along with Mike Golic welcome to Boise today it's Conference USA taking on the Big West and two conferences not very well known so these two schools not only playing for themselves and their schools but league wide recognition Mike let's talk about Cincinnati the Bearcats come in seven and four and they got to Boise because of a very versatile quarterback Chad Plummer this guy is something else in the Bearcats want the ball in his hand he's an option quarterback the team as a team they have 22 rushing touchdowns but he is the catalyst either running the ball or in the pocket if he doesn't find a receiver too quickly he is going to take off but Craig a little surprised the second series Chad farmer goes to wide receiver and beyond take care the truth freshman comes in a quarterback the coaches love his arm for Utah State the best way to describe their offense is explosive and Mike they can hurt you three ways a quarterback wide receiver and running back boy and the Cincinnati Bearcats are hoping this is not their Bermuda Triangle quarterback Matt sock wide receiver Nakia Jenkins and running back to Mario Brown have put up in cret impressive career numbers and the most impressive Wow probably four hundred and fifty yards of total offense per game on defense the Defensive Player of the Year in the Big West Ben cross with 24 career sacks this guy's got great feet great hands next year you will see him play on Sundays the Big West Defensive Player of the Year Utah State is ready to hit the

of a coaching controversy John L Smith went to Louisville two days after the Aggies finished their last game he accepted the job but he hadn't told his players they say they had to hear about it on ESPN and they were very upset so when he came back the players said they didn't want him to coach in this bowl game the president of the University George a Mert stepped in and they took a vote he gave them the option of playing in this game without John L Smith and the six coaches that he'll take to Louisville or retaining the coaching staff well the players finally voted to retain the coaching staff so John L Smith will coach in this game although he is currently the coach of Louisville and the players say where they were once rebellious they've now reunited behind John L Smith Craig all right Thank You Holly on the other side of the field today is Rick Minter in his fourth season has his Bearcats in the first bowl game since way back in 1950 trying to even up his record of the 500 mark 21 22 and one for December 29th Mike Golic it could not be better in Boise Idaho 43 degrees at game time humidity 45% mostly sunny and calm know there will be no persist participation in this football game today it is a beautiful day and I was talking to some of the Cincinnati coaches they know Utah State is a throwing team they were kind of hoping for a little bit of snow flurries so when something they made it a little more difficult but they're little bummed out that Utah state's going to be able to sit the pocket throw the ball today last bowl appearance for Cincinnati had got a flip to counter to back to 1950 the Sun Bowl Utah State under then head coach Charlie one of a 1993 in the Las Vegas Bowl Cincinnati won the toss chose to defer into the second half the Aggies take a knee nine yards deep and we'll start up on offense we know about Matt socket his good arm Mario Brown a tremendous runners had some injury problems this season but can break the big one wide receivers it's a great threesome Nakia Jenkins leads his team was 73 receptions up front Mauricio Jordan and Mark Rommel to all Big West first team selections they will anchor that big front line for the Aggies so the first play of the humanitarian Bowls suck on playaction good downfield covered by the Bearcats sock will throw and fired complete down to the 30yard line and Hopkins the quarterback number 21 made the tackle the Cincinnati defense Derrick ransom oh he's a good one they call him the big cat 15 career sacks the linebackers you won't find two better hurry the middle backer Brad Jackson the outside linebacker they've combined for over 300 tackles this season tinker Keck a great free safety but maybe even a better punt return man but we already have a flag late hit moving the ball up the field already not the way Cincinnati wants to start out but to see Utah State make no no question about it they are gonna hit the pocket throw the football they line up with three wide receivers Stevie Smith the motion man lines up in the slot first and ten from the 45 yard line and the first look of the day for Demario Brown picks up a couple to the 49 yard line well Utah State gonna try and mix it up a little on the run set up the pass John Cabala the big defensive tackle you'll see you'll hear his name a lot 275 pound senior he is the anchor of that defensive line as far as stopping the run great season for Matt soft nearly 3,000 yards passing 16 touchdowns 10 picks to lead the Aggies to a 6 &amp; 5 season and the Big West Conference championship Zonk in trouble Brad Jackson the outside linebacker allconference USA first team came in made the sack the 26th quarterback sack for this Cincinnati defense and here's one of the best athletes on the field today and Brad Jackson the senior outside linebacker they run the variation of the old buddy Ryan Philadelphia Eagle in Chicago Bear 46 defense and they're going to use a Brad Jackson as that guy to rush put pressure on the quarterback possibly drop off in to cover some they says he's probably one of their best cover men too but I think I like that guy coming at the quarterback to Jackson phenomenal year averaging over 15 tackles a game second down 11 color third down 11 incomplete so the Aggies will be forced to punt opening drive here in Boise Idaho normally on special teams that's when a lot of people may hit the fridge you don't want to do that here not with both of these punt returners tinker check coming up for Cincinnati right now four touchdowns odd punt returns he ties an NCAA record don't be don't be shocked and they will kick it to him and a good punter for Utah State Jerry Aguayo 44 yard average a school record this season and I think the Aggies do not want tinker check to have a chance to return the football so Cincinnati will get the first try of the afternoon after the 22 yard punt the running back Orlando Smith will get the start today he's the bigger of the three backs he practiced well this week and earned the starting position a wide receiver keep your eye on Cornelius Bonner leads his team in receptions with 27 and it's a big front line for Cincinnati Jason Fubini a threetime Conference USA first team at big front line averages Mike Golic 65 306 I'm not playing anymore sad Plummer wants to hand it to the running back that's Orlando Smith and he weaves his way past the 40 to the 42 yard line on this blue astro turf of Boise State John Delk Artie made the tackle let's set the defense for Utah State Ben Crossland we talked a lot about this young man he will play at the next level the Big West Defensive Player of the Year the middle linebacker very good allconference picked Tony D'Amato and the Utah State corners and free safeties John Delk Rd what a season over 100 tackles and that bacteria swarming defense Utah State not much in fact a yard loss Caleb Smith made the tackle back at the 40yard line well again you see the option with Chad Plummer you're going to see that a lot and as we said at the top Singh today he's going to find a way to get the ball in Chad plumber's hand the next series most likely he'll be out a wide receiver with the I take Ken our quarterback and they'll try and throw on the ball they said the more touches Chad plumber gets the better shot they haven't winning this game Plummer was six passing touchdown seven rushing touchdowns on the season but the playaction stands up in throws pump plate oh what a catch inside the 40 down to the 39 yard line party made the tackle and that was the tight end Rodrick more only his third reception of the season and Mike it goes for 22 yards I don't know how John Dale Carter missed that one he had a beautiful break right in front of the ball what sets it up and why he's open for a while is a great play action Plummer lays it up there gives time for cardi to come on over you want that ball a little more on a rope to get there carding plenty of time to come over just doesn't make that interception and the Cincinnati offense does not rely on the passing game much the ranked 106th in the nation at annually 114 yards a game they go back to the ground and picked up a good chunk to the 33 yard line Orlando Smith the ball carrier now this guy he was the third string running back of this year the starter was Darrell royal he had 148 carries Robert Cooper 137 two of the four players that carried it over a hundred times but the coaches felt Orlando Swift practiced the best over the last 12 days and he's gonna get his opportunity you know mike royal and cooper combined for over a thousand yards between the two of them from the iformation cincinnati with her first offensive threat of the day we had whole left side and banging her yarded inside the 15 to the 14 yard line that was Orlando I checked that 36 that was Landon Smith the senior check out the hole the big offensive line we said they have its 306 pounds you could drive a whole lot of a whole lot of vehicles through that hole and Landon Smith is 247 pounds Orlando Smith 245 pounds so that's my addition is correct they've got just under 500 to hire our 500 pounds of beef in the backfield Bearcats average over 215 yards a game on the ground that was an 18 yard picked up back to the ground this time Orlando Smith inside the 10 may be squeezed out a yard maybe 2 to the 8 yard line Craig Miller number 8 made the tackle for Utah State well what's happening here is the running backs aren't getting hit until the linebackers and the cornerback show when that happens when you have big running backs you know you're going to get a lot of yards you see that you see the size of the line right now 306 pounds for Cincinnati against 266 pounds you know there's no question with the game plan is it straight ahead clock continues to run 942 and Counting first quarter Bearcats very impressive bank is Orlando Smith to the six yard line tackled by D Amato via models the guy they're gonna have to count on 124 tackles he led the team in the middle cincinnati tried a little trap that time the Amato came up from behind and used his speed to catch it from behind but this is a guy that's got to stick his nose I've been there he's six foot 240 pounds he's like a little fireplug and against his big offensive line he just got to stick his neck in there and try and take up space and not let those running backs run downhill too quickly Mike d Amato a junior college transfer at Alonzo Santiago he hated transition very nicely to tight end set for Cincinnati third down and short that dancing good defense the blue jerseys the posse alive maybe a half a yard let by Tony D'Amato well again D'Amato is doing it from catching it from behind it's playing a little bit on the back side to running away from him and he's doing a nice job of coming from behind that time good job by the defensive line we've seen it earlier I'm getting blown off the ball there was some big holes that time they held it up the back had nowhere to go Dee Amato able to bring him down from behind that's a gutty call early here by head coach Rick Minter fourth down call it one and the Bearcats will go for it 50% on the year on fourth down Orlando Smith he was stopped before he had it second effort tackled at the 10 and Utah state's defense led by Donald Zico stops Cincinnati on fourth and one well again the person who made this play was Tony via motto they tried a little trap they pulled the card to go around the set on the Amato just blew it up in the middle the guard was not able to come around the Amato made some good penetration so you come around the middle 66 on the pole you see 46 just blow it up in the middle there's nowhere for Orlando Smith to go he's got to break it out and he is not an east/west runner he needs to go north and south and deco came from the backside to wrap up those ankles and so the Aggies dodged some trouble early 8:05 to play opening quarter and were scoreless in the first ever humanitarian Bowl and the skies have parted it's a blue sky in Boise Idaho today you know these are two teams no common opponents so coach is really burning the midnight oil trying to prepare for these teams watching a lot of film picking out tendencies so you may see the first few series really trying to feel it out and see if each team could stick with their game plan or if they have to make some adjustment and my Creek mentor told us yesterday that he felt like maybe John L Smith got a little bit of a head start on him because he is going to be coaching Louisville next year in Conference USA he's been down there recruiting he probably grabbed some games over on the way down I might have stuck exactly offensive series for the Aggies a couple of yards up to the 11 Brad Jackson made the tackle on to Mario Brown their total offense consistency nine to six 297 nine in the NCAA four hundred forty nine yards a game and they're averaging and most of that is to the air it's 280 through the air a little over a hundred on the ground not not a real big running team they won't do it much unless they see an opening four wide receivers set on second down let's call it eight for Utah State threestep drop oh hello hello Brad Jackson absolutely just put the hammer down well normally Cincinnati is a go fu man type of coverage this time they were in his own because there were no running backs they drop off into his own Brad Jackson sitting off to your right he's going to come into your screen and lay the wood laid the wood on London McBride and we saw Jackson earlier get the penetration upfield they're gonna rush him they're gonna keep him back I mean this guy will be all over the field Jackson phenomenal Mike when you consider he's been involved in over 22% of all plays on defense third down stop Wade's fighters and complete down at the 32 yard line so for the second time Utah State will be forced to punt it away via Jenkins the intended receiver and that was on Matt sock he had Jenkins wide open right now I think Utah State our sense of a is confused a Utah State a little bit you look at Cincinnati's defense normally it's attacking mantoman on the outside and put pressure on the quarterback they're dropping seven guys off though off the line of scrimmage down playing a deep zone and I think that's confusing that sock right now argüello back to punt he's 2 yards deep in his own end zone first time he touched the ball 22 yards and there's Tinker Kent he's returned four punts this season but touchdowns two against the Louisville off the side of his foot and they will mark this at the 39 yard line Cincinnati will come back with fine field position where score the Boise Idaho the first ever humanitarian Bowl back after this sweet Pizza Delivery actually it's not deliveries to Jean where is it from I believe I said it's not delivery its DiGiorno you just say deliver it's not delivery its DiGiorno to show the rising quest pizzas the frozen pizza with a crust that bakes up fresh like pizzeria pizza right support don't make me hurt in freshbaked pizza hope it's not delivery its DiGiorno your heart's pounding drilling pumping they like job you go yes Phillip Hollywood's hottest stuntman to switch antiperspirants and try degree what spotty heat activate it probably means when you get warm that it starts working as your body heat rises degree releases extra protection when you need it most I heat it up and it cooled me down I was on fire and I was dry I don't like guys to see me sweat this stuff kept up even in the 40foot high fire balls the baby body heat activated degree your body he turns it on well Cincinnati brought the band why not first bowl game 47 years I bring the whole town hey the coach has said this is the biggest game in Cincinnati's a 110 year history they said they just want didn't want to let the players know that get him nervous now this is the second series for Cincinnati we talked about this early Deonte Kenner the freshman quarterback is in and Chad Plummer who started at quarterback moves to wide receiver that is an odd occurrence in today's game of football and this they're hoping Cincinnati is hoping that this is the I take Kenner's comingout party these are freshmen they wanted to redshirt but they had some problems with the hole or early in the air he had to come in and do some holding and that cost him his red shirt so they're sorry they didn't get him more in more this year so they want to see how he does throwing the ball and Chad Plummer hey he's just as dangerous and wide out to throw him the ball highly recruited out of high school lines up in the slot and during that last series he put the gloves on so he's ready to catch the football they dumped it out of the backfield and it's incomplete on the first throw by Dion take inner now to Hopkinsville Kentucky and you mentioned the Rick mentor told us yesterday hey this is gonna be a tale of a game to see how good he is how well he handles pressure and is he the quarterback of the future if not we come back Plummer's only a junior and we start next year and we see what happens and they may even switch them around next year the difference being like at Ohio State where they have two quarterbacks they did it at Florida a couple of years ago here the other quarterback isn't leaving the field Chad farmers throwing out the wide receivers so they're both being utilized under seven minutes to play first quarter second down 15 dinner vistas man falls incomplete and you know that Utah State is gonna kind of picks things up a lot they want to throw some blitz packages at this young guy right there yeah we saw kind of a fake drop in a late blitz they got some pressure on him late he saw two passes they've tried to keep it safe for him the first was green the second a short one he's just right now I think he's a little hyped up he's putting put a lot way too much speed on the ball fall time get these couple of passes out and hopefully he'll calm down third down in 15 from the 44 yard line of Utah State good field position for the Bearcats after that punch a nurse stands and fires the arching a spot at the 31 Plummer one quarterback to the other decoe the strong safety made the tackle but what a combination we're seeing something special here yeah this is something brand new a quarterback rotation where the other one stays in you see he's got time they love his arm he is a pure quarterback good to see Plummer as you said highly recruited as a wide receiver here he does a little nice inside move arm over to the outside and remember he's tall he's six foot three he would go off after the ball the Florida State wanted him very bad Chadd plumber and now he goes back and plays quarterback we can run the option looking looking that comes back to the other way he's got a blocker at the 30 25 down to the 22 yard line Oh what an arsenal Tony D'Amato the middle backer for Utah State chased him down this has got to be so confusing for the Utah State defense who are they going to play the option quarterback the passing quarterback here you see he's reading it the Aggies are letting him read it he decides I'm not happening that way I'll pick up some blockers going around the other way and obviously the offensive line knows this guy is going to make things up as he goes along so he they get out there and get a nice block best probably the best athlete offensively on the field today first first name that comes to mind is just a Kordell Stewart exactly quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers first down and 10 from the 22 let's call out the 21 yard line of Utah State their cats come right back to the ground game they've been so successful and been Crosland the Big West Defensive Player of the Year in on his first stop of the day knock him down Cooper let's go downstairs in Holly Rowe Craig one thing to point out about this switch at quarterback is that it's friendly check plumber respects Deion take Henner and he wants to move over to receiver he realizes that he's a better pro prospect as a receiver he only played three years in high school as a receiver and one as a quarterback so he understands what the future holds for him he's a tremendous athlete a champion high jumper a champion high hurdler and so he's willing to go over at receiver to help the team win and help improve his future prospects Thank You Holly second down plumber trucking runs for the 15 to 14 yard line and he was tackled by deco number 45 to strong safety good blocking out front you see again the people making the tackles are the the corner backs and the DBS you know the linemen have to start getting involved a defensive lineman we've seen that do model we've called his number a few times he needs to make a lot of tackles today a great matchup to watch today Craig is Jason Fubini the left tackle for Cincinnati he is another guy who will be maybe a first rounder next year in the NFL on the offense inside against Ben Crossland the right end as we talked about the big west of to central player the STB a great matchup today two wide receivers set to the far side Cincinnati inside of the 20 yard line on the season 81% it'll play action mister plumbers goes across the middle he's got a man touchdown well that was a play they let develop in the plank because they've been successful running the ball they run this play action to kids the kids chant plumber a little more time with the ball to find his receiver for an alias Potter who actually came all the way back across the field you see he fakes a little half bottle up and barns gonna come in from the left of your screen all the way across the field John Dale Carter gets caught turning and running his back Stern he can't get up and bake the pipe bond with extra point up and good so the combination of chant plumber and Cornelius Bonner puts Cincinnati on top in the humanitarian Bowl water with the second touchdown catch of the season oh it's a beauty we'll be back in a recent college grad Horacio Porter Texas Christian track star went to an Air Express company Georgia Tech basketball star

Bowl week continues as Wisconsin takes on Georgia in the Outback Bowl Wisconsin Georgia Thursday at 11:00 on ESPN Boise Idaho the foothills capped with snow but in the valley just a beautiful day and there's the man of the hour so far Venegas Bonner 14yard touchdown receptions and Chad Plummer pretty impressive two drives they didn't come up with anything Mike on the first time down the field but they have marched through Utah State yeah the first drive nine plays 57 guys didn't come up empty but they are holding on to the ball bounces out of the end zone on the kick ESPN continues his bull week coverage tonight at 8:00 as lack champion Colorado State takes it high flying offense into the Holiday Bowl against the surprising Missouri Tigers to end tonight ESPN for all the Bowl we could siphon Missouri at Colorado State here in Boise Idaho the humanitarian Bowl in Cincinnati has trucked first 14yard touchdown from plumber to Bonner and we're seeing kind of what we talked about opposite the passing attack of Cincinnati which really they don't depend much on and it's Utah State that really hurts into the air now they're going to the ground if de Mario Brown picks up big yards to the 35 yard line tinker Keck had to come over from his free safety spot to knock him down tamari Oh Brown had seven power 971 yards on the year in just eight games this is a guy that went over 100 yards and six of those eight games and they keep this offense balanced it would be a pure passing attack if it wasn't for the running of de Mario Brown they love to give him that ball kind of set things up they actually use the pass though is set up running in a psychology major so he oh he's a thinker out there huh first down from the 36 yard line soft fires and closeup all may have been tipped he was looking for a Nakia Jenkins had him open in the flat but the ball was batted down Freddy Smith on the coverage the corner I don't know Freddy Smith got it or Brad Jackson got it on the way out there Brad Jackson you see right the body image screen coming out takes a quick look back and gets a hand up I think he does tip that he gets a piece of it first and knocks it off course for Freddy Smith so again Brad Jackson we've seen him three or four different way the way he's already helping his defense well Matt saw a 50 percent completion rate on the season so far Mike only 1 of 5 in this football game the Mario Brown spinning breaks a couple of tackles and after all that a yard to the 36 yard line asan champion on the tackle there this is a great stat 17 points all season in just the first quarter what you're going to see the running game for Utah State they like to give the ball deep to the Mario Brown but this defense for Cincinnati when they see a running set that again that 46 defense at old buddy Ryan defense they want to attack and penetrate and that's very very difficult for a deep handoff team to make yardage third down and 10 Aggies come out with a three wide receiver set soft depth in the pocket throws the rainbow got a man and just overthrows Nakia Jenkins down inside the 30yard line song has a big time arm boy he sure does but this is twice now to third down plays where he's had Nikita Jenkins wide open and he's missed them so right now sock he's had just under 3,000 yards passing 16 touchdowns he used to settle down a bit and he gets those open men he's got to hit him tinker check it was back to receive the punt of Arguello you know twice narwhale has tried to kick it away from him and he's had horrible kicks out of bounds they just need to let him Punk the ball straight down the middle of the field good snap good kick and ham up the hang time check underneath it at the 27 kicked up the middle pick at the 40 and tinker check why he is ranked number three in the country and punt returns battles to the 44 yard line 37 yard kicked a 17 yard return Cincinnati by 7 it's Arizona's biggest party Tostitos brings you college

six seven eight five eight one five how'd you know and my size and everything it looks good thank you it feels good thanks happy holidays happy holidays Broncos Stadium Boise Idaho and it has filled in nicely on this December 29th day humanitarian Bowl Cincinnati making their first bowl appearance since 1950 with a seven nothing lead and the quarterback situation now has shifted back to chant Plummer which would make you think Mike that the Bearcats want to run I think that's exactly what they're gonna do big hole up the middle Darrell royal first down 11yard pickup down to the 44 yard line let's go downstairs in Holly Rowe hey Frank a member of the Utah State athletic department told me this morning that he was worried that Cincinnati was more prepared for this game and taking a little more seriously during their practices they've been going three hours hard like for a regular game whereas Utah State coaches were treating this more as a reward having their players practice for an hour and a half doing light walkthroughs and just having a lot more fun right now you can sense that on the field Cincinnati's skipping out to the huddle they're running on and off the field a lot more energy right now from the Bearcats poly a 47 year drought from Bulgaria to do that for the plumber on the reverse dances past an Aggie maybe to the 43 yard line D'Amato made the tackle Mike what do you think you have a coaching change he's going to Louisville there's been some controversy yelets put everything behind us the Aggies say but yet has it been loose you think Cincinnati takes this game at a more of a of a serious attitude I think it's tough as a player as a Utah State player to know your coaching staff is leaving you almost in a way feels sold out a bit you know when you recruit it they're in it I know they had a tough time for about a week or so before they straighten things out so I think it's a little more turmoil on the Utah State side double tight set and they go right back to the ground royal and a swarming Aggie defense led again by D'Amato number 46 averaging 11 tackles a game when I tell you what we talked about the matchup adjacent Fubini the left tackle on the right end been crossing paths so being just absolutely destroyed cross on Fubini a better run blocker than a pass block but because it's Bearcat offense is a more run oriented offense but he asked you can Grove then cross them into the ground and then pound it on him for good measure it's third down and four and Deonte Kenner now at quarterback number 7 Plummer lines up as a wide receiver Kiner throws the up and out and a first down at the 32 yard line Livingston made the tackle watch say this will mix you up I'm just thinking of myself defensively you have just to be kept kinder comes out plumber goes back into the quarterback well the one thing that could make it a little easier for Utah State is knowing all right hey if Kenner's in there they're gonna throw we'll get our package in maybe a nickel packaging when plumbers in there a little more up in there because he's throwing a nice touchdown pass and we've obviously seen the way he can run the ball so I think it's a little tougher when Plummer is a quarterback the lone back Darrell royal final seconds of the first quarter ticking down Plummer on the option here comes Roy the big man Rumble over an Aggie inside the 25 to the 22 yard line John Delk Rd hung on there the free safety number three to make the tackle cardi Boyson Mike at 187 and royal tips of scales around 230 that's on that's before the meal before the little free game that they had so we might be pushing to 40 now big block by the tight end Rodrick Monroe he got out there on Jeremy Hunt Lovelace and absolutely drove him about ten yards downfield we have to talk about mom Roe he's a good story a tight end for Cincinnati really his first year on the football field since high school that's amazing come in for division one football have not played has not played since high school loyal again final seconds ticking down down the sideline bumped out of bounds at the 11 yard line again by John Delk rd the free safety had to come up so that ends the first half and the first quarter that is dominated by the Cincinnati Bearcats they lead Utah State here the humanitarian Bowl by seven we'll be back boy see a quiet western city boys never a dull moment he said hey who delivered actually it's not deliveries to Jean where's it from I believe I said it's not delivery its DiGiorno would you say deliver it's not delivery its DiGiorno toujours no

this game and Cincinnati Mike on the front porch knocking on the door first down just outside the 10 yard line Plummer likes to run the option he has stopped let go and tackled behind a line of scrimmage and good pursuit Caleb Smith number 52 wouldn't let him go the second time and they throw him for a loss back at the 17 yard line Smith finishes up to play with Tony D'Amato again the one the man with the penetration as we look at some first quarter stats 152 total yards look at the time possession well that's a running team if they're winning normally is going to control that possession Utah State 28 yards Matt's locked their quarterback it's going to have to start to come to the table a little more for their team only one of five in the first quarter of play second down from the 14 they changed quarterbacks Beyonce Kiner is in throws it underneath and the ball falls incomplete that stops the clock for 14 17 14 16 to go in the first half okay let's Smith read that very well for Utah State paper this is second time they tried the screen that what they're doing is they're running it too fast they need to set it up a little more let the dline get a little more penetration Caleb Smith never even got penetration up the field and Kenna threw the ball almost right into his hands third down Aggies coming with the Blitz Kenner stands up took a hit throws fires touchdown Bonner with the second catch of the afternoon goes for another six and he reached up climbed the ladder and put the flypaper on well this is what they want to see from quarterback Deonte Kenner they said the difference of him and Chad plumber when plumbers in the pocket he sees suppression he'll take off and run they said Kenner is a pure Florida back even when he played Sandlot football he wanted to control that he wanted to control the game stand in there and throw it they said he will take the hit he's not afraid of contact which means you know he doesn't really want to run they said he's not afraid to take the hit and he took one to put the ball right on the mark buhburn Elyas Bonner his second touchdown of the day Joe judge kicked the extra point up and good 14 nothing how about the arm how about the catch Bearcats by 14 everyone remembers this college highlight but I bet you've never seen these North Carolina quarterback Chris kaldorf counseling teenagers

mmm lean beef potatoes vegetables Chuckie always hits the spot where'd you get sit off that's my mom oh yeah which one Campbell's Chunky soup it would be welcome back Craig Buller check Mike Golic and Holly Rowe and Boise Idaho after this game just strap on the skis and let's go well this is a great play by Deonte Kenner he sees Lovelace right there on the Blitz he knows it's a blitz he knows there's room over the top right in here right where the Blitzer came and that's exactly where Bonner goes does a nice inside move on Craig Miller and wide open a good job by Kenner reading where the Blitz came from and knowing where the open part of the field was Steve Smith at the goal line at the 20 at the 25 30 still on his feet 31 yard return to the boy what have what a run by Stevie Smith explosive you look at the scoring drive Mike 9 plays 56 yards 323 off the clock enough so I can touch down plumber to Bonner in the first quarter now it's Kennard upon her well you know in three drives they've had nine plays seven point nine play 25 plays they're controlling the clock they're controlling the line of scrimmage more importantly Utah state's doing the right thing Wendy I take ken are the true freshmen it is in a quarterback they're blitzing them and trying to make a make quick decision pretty problem for Utah State headers making the right decisions that's suck under center one of six on the afternoon for 11 yards it's early but he really picked ell Brad Jackson and he had open at an open lane to the end zone Brad Jackson does a nice job of playing underneath they have a little man deep Jackson comes back and goes underneath into the flat and he's looking at the quarterbacks eyes all the way you see him break Matt's sock never really looking off he's looking at Nikita Jenkins the whole way he needs to look off a little more maybe Brad Jackson doesn't come out there's quick if he sees Matt sake look at him off a little bit so I go down 10 soft now one of seven on the afternoon Mike I was saying it's early but I would think important series right here for Utah State absolutely they coming with the Blitz soft on a trouble throw sideline and it's out of bounds Adrian Pearson was in the vicinity but boy they brought them all Robbie Lucas led the charge of white jerseys and this is this is what they call they beat EF in Buddy Ryan old term the old Rex Ryan used to be the defensive coordinator here plays his dad defense it's called blitz the formation they'll see a formation and the middle linebacker Philip curry will call and this is what case it was Rob Lucas will call the blitz right as they're at the line this time they brought the linebacker that's the beauty of this defense you have to have smart players yep their players had a study film and can make adjustments on the fly 1350 remaining and a half a good look at Matt sock who has missed his last seven throws three wide receiver set they're cats bringing pressure and soft it's the blue turf den of the 22 Derrick ransom Oh ransom came in at six sacks on the regular season let's check in with Holly Rowe hey guys before that last sack Matt sock could run over to the sideline and was talking to his offensive coordinator Petrino the problem is there is a lot of pressure he is having to scramble a lot but he's not making the easy completions he has had some good looks downfield and not completed them so well they're trying to get this offense started you've got to get the easy completion check at the 42 tinker is upended at the Aggie 45 yard line so once again Cincinnati will start with fine field position a tough start for Utah State and their quarterback max suck Aggies trail by 14 hi Daddy what you doing oh just working I am I'm at the new Double Tree don't forget

of Utah State yesterday he's on his way to Louisville very emotional time for the head coach and his players well I think we're gonna be excited I think once it's over it's gonna hit everybody you know I think the night before tonight is gonna be his toughest there is because we get together would be some things in the evening today some things I think that's gonna be the saddest parts in addition to said but again it's it's like we talked about that and that's what football team either sometimes there's up sometimes it's down but get up and get going John L Smith as we talked to him yesterday a long ball thrown by Cincinnati they wanted to go for another touchdown it fell incomplete but it has been a tough I think even tough on the fans that only sold about 2,000 tickets to the Aggie faithful and Logan's not that far from Boise Idaho there's been some there's been been some turmoil yeah then Logan Utah there's been some hard feelings you know he's taking six coaches along with them or six total going and that's tough on the players thinking here these guys recruited me and now they're kind of they're kind of leaving us out to dry plumber the option sauces and not much not much as Darrell royal was stuffed by deco the strong saftey good deadline pursuit by the guys in blue well these guys in blue as you said they need to stop right now Cincinnati three drives have gone right down the field the first one they didn't score just because they ran out of downs inside the 20 you see hands on hips on Utah state side of the line these guys got to be tired they've been out there almost the whole game they really need to stop for they're confident and for the offense confident on the quarterback shift Deonte Kenner back in three wide receivers set on third down Agee sent in some pressure up the middle hitter on the run and throws in the flats incomplete Utah state's bench wants a flag oh they're gonna get it that was no doubt that was intentional groaning there was absolutely nobody there this isn't the pros and the pros did you break the pocket and throw the ball past the line of scrimmage it's not intentional grounding that not in college he broke the pocket you still have to throw it close to a receiver his receiver broke deep over the middle the pressure by Tony the Amato intentional grounding five yards lost down fourth down our referee today is Chuck McFerrin see he's going to break the pocket to his right your left CD Amato with the pressure and his receiver cutting over the middle and he throws it to the outside again can't get away with that in college a good call by Utah State's defense defensive coordinator you know the young guys in let's bring it they blitz them a couple of times the first time you hit it right throws a touchdown pass I still think it's smart to get it get some pressure on it Steve Smith FB 18 oh look at the first two speed at the 40 and they say stepped out of bounds at the 31 yard line boy Steve Smith the

that three or four times a game this guy averages 16 yards every time he touches the ball whether receiving running or punt return touch the ball 92 times earned a a regularseason Bearcats jean blitz softclose it up he's got his man Oh big catch now picked off blackjack tinker kick at the 40 down at the 15 he's got a lane still on his feet look at Tinker 1020 live tech to the eighth like a big country church bro we'll have to see this again but Mike Mike goodness it looked like Steve Smith had the football it sure did good pressure you're gonna see coming up the middle again they're blitzing they get the fresh on them sock throws it up there you see kick he is he is the centerfielder he's got to come over make that play just times it perfectly I thought that was going to be the first big play before the Aggies and the run back well he ran about a hundred yards to get back here's the Blitz and the hit he takes right as he throws the ball good hit by Duane Gossett the freshman who's on the All Freshman team for Conference USA and there's kick that was nothing like but a big punt return for him his fourth interception and to see their leading the team all is going right for Cincinnati right now 59 yard return the Bearcats mic picked up seven wins on the season when they forced 24 turnovers during that seven win period the four losses came they only force six plumber is the quarterback it will start up in the I formation those are seven wins they forced 24 turnovers during that stretch during the four losses only got 60 OS and of all the stats they use that's probably one of the truest of wins and losses return on the stand their chants chewin up some yards inside the 15 to the 14 yard line ball carrier Darrell royal soft on the afternoon only one of nine eleven yards and the interception what they need to do it for sokka's they need to go back to some short passes quick passes get his confidence back as we take a look at takes effect with the beautiful interception got a couple of nice punt return also today but Matt sock got to get back to some short throws get his confidence back a little bit he is not used to being one for nine double tight end set royal in trouble ships and hops back to the line of scrimmage good tackle by Utah State upfront it's John Lou to let su part Milla to the allbig West second team and that's what the Aggies have to try to do to stop Cincinnati's running even though they're doing pretty well passing the Bearcats are but running they have to get some penetration again that Bearcat offensive line averaging 306 pounds they're tough to penetrate but that's the way an Aggie the smaller defense that's how you stop the option option and the runs get penetration and try and mess it up in the backfield Kiner the freshman is back at quarterback once I hit Plummer on a slant rule Plummer took a shot down inside the 10 to the 6 yard line courtesy of John Delk Rd along with Chico well let me tell you Chad Plummer is 63 230 pounds I guarantee you my card he might have felt that hit more than Plummer he popped up on that no problem at all again this is what they like about Kenner he just drills it in there there's three guys in the area and he finds the seam and plumber at 230 pounds not afraid to go over the middle of the field now plumber picked himself up off the carpet goes back underneath Center on first and goal from the 6 and the Bearcats want to pound it in little royal 230 pounds pushes into the three yard line Caleb Smith number 52 wrapped him up well this Aggie defense has got to come up with something some kind of a big play some kind of stop here if they could try and hold Cincinnati to at least a field goal attempt they can get some kind of satisfaction out of that right now they've they've been on the field just too long and with the size of Cincinnati they're just gonna wear him down second and goal from the eye they send Bonner in motion Aggies been but they don't break cardi John Dell Carney the free safety made the stop cardi averaging 10 tackles a game all Big West selection boy tough kids 6 to 187 but I tell you when you're free safety and we've called his name a lot today when he's the one making the tackles that means things aren't going too well especially with a run now if he's making the tackles on passage that's something else but when he's got to make them on runs that means the running backs are way into their defensive backfield third and goal Roderick Moore and Ashley hunt double tight set for Cincinnati touchdown and they gave it this time to Landon Smith the senior fullback 250 pounder and went off the left side behind Fubini Joel Galinski Brian you'll the big front of the Bearcats again the offensive line will be the unsung heroes today they're the ones you know grinding it out for the back so you've got to 245 250 pound backs no makes no sense but you just go ahead and run it straight up the middle again this Aggie defense they've got to be getting tired they're gonna have to start taking chances down 21 and up and they've got to start pulling something out of the bag of tricks John L Smith in his final game cuddles up with his team on the sidelines they're down 21 here in the first half and a lot of time left on the clock 8:30 here in Boise Idaho you know I really do think there's a lot to the fact that that he and a lot of his coaching staff are leaving Craig I think that affects the players again we talked about a tough week or so where it took the players to kind of trust this coaching staff again and you know we talked to the offensive coordinator Bob patrina one of the coaches that's leaving and he said you know there were problems of players maybe letting things go in one ear and out the other saying you know why should I listen to these coaches anymore they're leaving they're not going to be here next year it may be a whole different system so I really think these coaches leaving has an effect on the players more than more than we may think now Utah State has made a hire that didn't waste much time in fact John L Smith gave his blessings to Weber State head coach Dave R saline Ian who is a former college roommate of John L Smith so they look for an easy transition but still you have to think there is a little hurt that goes a long way Smith at the for Smith kicks it outside this guy has burning speed and is knocked out at the 30yard line Chad Plummer Mike has been a versatile man we talked about how versatile he is we've seen him at quarterback we've seen him at wide out and again he was a great wide receiver coming out of high school you can just tell the net for a swim move he used this to get over a defensive back here on the option look at this versatility I'll go the other way I know my linemen will come back and block he runs about a 10yard game but runs 40 yards for it and you do it through the air that's a nice time puts it on the mark the one of dr. Conners two touchdown passes 21 nothing Cincinnati the Mario Brown has just been shut down so far in this game spinning a couple of tough three yards to the 33 call at the 34 yard line Ted Grubb number 94 made the tackle there's plumbers numbers two or three passing 36 yards in the one touchdown rushing about five of 15 a couple threes I mean it's a distance receptions we're looking at the college version of slash right now Kordell Stewart of the Pittsburgh Steelers and and Chad is smart enough to know he didn't start playing quarterback until senior in high school he knows if he's going to go to the next level it's probably going to be as a possession tight end if you gain some weight for a wide receiver Brown boy second effort close to the first down marker outside the 40 Derrick ransom finally brought him down to Mario Brown was stopped not once not twice about three times and still still able to get close to the first down well you know somebody's got to be a spark for the Aggies right now down 21 enough and that sock having a very very rough game throwing the ball Temari Oh Brown six rushes for 31 yards so he's averaging five yards of pop so maybe let this guy be your workhorse for a while and then you could set it up with some playaction get stock to throw some of the short passes get his confidence back and hopefully get a big play nearly a thousand yards on the season and only eight games played battle some injuries would be knee and ankle soft in the pocket throws deep and incomplete he has been long on the deep ball so far in this game Stevie Smith the intended receiver number four and I don't understand at all I'm on first and ten why why you're going deep he's he's already shown he's not on the money thief he's even missed some receivers Nakia Jenkins short you got to keep it short passage maybe a hitch pass a slant pass a screen pass something to get this guy he's just stepping back in the pocket and Lofton in the air not even coming close one of 10 for 11 yards and the interception has missed his last nine attempt in a row keep it short The Doors stuck got a door that sticks don't call a carpenter call a golfer because a golf tee here

done it higher walk faster all those stores you here they're all true we're back in Boise Idaho our apologies for some technical problems 21nothing our score Cincinnati leading Utah State Aggies unable to move the ball they punted away and a big return by Tinker kick has the Bearcats in fine field position once again Mike Billy and how we have to we have to specify every series one since the day it takes the ball just who's the quarterback actually almost every play sometimes they're switching every other playing right now it is Chad Plummer so you just expect suspect a little more running but don't rule out now cuz they're running so well a little playaction pass also under the sixminute mark left in the first half of the total yards 173 236 Plummer in trouble Plummer will throw fire now the last time that happened the flag was out they're gonna call that one incomplete and the Aggie bench disagrees Lindsey hassel made the pressure brought the pressure in on plumber and plumbers a guy that can get away from the pressure you're gonna see it come right up the gut again and it breaks out to his right does a nice job getting out again in college somebody still has to be around the ball you can't just throw it away and I I don't think there was really anybody by that by the ball I think 10 yards look like a team balloon 17 I think they should have got a flag day I think he's don't need anything else going against them LD on take enter now steps in under center the freshman quarterback third down at 10 523 to play and a half Aggies bring the Blitz Jenner steps ins fighters incomplete no victim in drop in the hands of Bashar Livingston the cornerback at JC transfer out of Monterey Peninsula had it and dropped it cincin a did a nice job of picking up the Blitz again Utah State any time Kenner is in a passing situation they're gonna blitz this time they bring them from the outside they pick it up as I'll see D'Amato coming up the middle also hand from the outside he had him crossing route over the middle just threw it behind him Doug Johnson will punt he said 17 pots down inside the 20 and it looks like another one at the 11 yard line for Doug

11 yard line Soph the quarterback that trouble swings it out of the backfield is to Mario Brown spins out of a tackle and drives for a first down to the 19 the 20 yard line Kevin ward coming back from his defensive tackle spot number 77 chased down to Mario now ABC New Year's Day full lineup it's a good one the comp USA Florida Citrus Bowl Florida taken off penn state without Curtis eNOS and one o'clock Rose Bowl bottles Michigan and Washington State Mike price in his Cougars and in the Nokia Sugar Bowl Florida State and Ohio State at 8:30 what a day ABC New Year's Day Bowl lineup huh sit my bag of chips sit right in front of that TV big bag big big bag wings again to Mario Brown a couple of yards a first down for the Aggies up to the 22 yard line champion made the tackle Halle Rove let's go downstairs I'm standing by with Dave our Slaney in the new head coach at Utah State Dave this is a little bit of an unusual situation you've been on the job for about a month but just observing and recruiting huh well I'm the backup head coach right now because the starting head coach is running this game I've had the opportunity to do a lot of recruiting I've had an opportunity to attend practices and observe the players and right now we just need to get some things going on the field how much of an emotional toll has this whole situation taken on the players it seems like they're a little flat right now on the field well I think the biggest thing right now being a good gesture being that there's again he'd have two practices outdoors there's a good play right there we've had two practices outdoors in a month now and our offense the scheme's we run on offense I'm talking like I'm part of it right now yeah are really geared for for a wideopen field and it'll take a little bit to adjust I think we'll adjust we'll get going all right well adjustments all around Craig back up to you all right thanks ollie and thanks to Dave our selenium who will take over for that man as soon as this game ends this afternoon John L Smith that not the Louisville of Conference USA that was a 23yard past play the largest gainer of the day and saw hooks up with the kia Jenkins a big one to threaten and that should open up the ground game Demario Brown to the 50 down to the 46 yard line shy of the first down but all of a sudden Mike Golic you see a spark what you're doing you saw the short pass to Jenkins you let him get the rest of the yards to Mario Brown he hasn't been he hasn't been tackled by the first guy that's hit him yet you see the draw play how many guys you go through one he just driving his feet he gets another five six yards just by keeping his legs going you always see those legs turning right now Mario Brown the spark for this offense and again keep the pass too short let the receivers make the extra yard in the ward andhe Mario Brown great hips if he has a set today he is dancing through and he pulled a couple of Bearcats for a first down inside the 45 to the 44 Philip Currie the backer made the tackle well Utah State again amber is just a shade under 450 yards a game today you see 81 yards give a lot of credit to the Cincinnati defense again that 46 old buddy Ryan style of defense and that's been a difference too here Craig Rex Ryan was a defensive coordinator here for Cincinnati he went to Oklahoma he's gone he didn't coach in his bowl game Kim Dameron has taken over as defensive coordinator sauk steps and fires swings it out of the flats Brown wide open makes a nice inside the 32 the 29 yard line and the Aggies have found life a first down Brad Jackson the outside linebacker came up to make this stop but hey you you get a touchdown here before half changes tempo absolutely and Brad Jackson got hung up with the wide receivers and he went way too far downfield to see him come into the field of play and make the play but he's supposed to be out in the flats taking any underneath droughts away he just turned and ran and this is what the Aggies needed now they're mixing up the pass in the run very well no John L Smith knows de Mario Brown is a fine runner but who likes him better Mike after the reception Salkin troubled sty steps it got stiff on the hook still alive looking for help swings it down and it's picked off Brad Jackson the outside linebacker soft trying to make something happen and he throws the interception Wow he did a great job just to get where he did I really can't blame him for trying to throw the ball he woulda lost so many yards does a nice job here of avoiding the rush by a signed champion then he does a great stiff arm job there on drunk Duan Gossett then he's just trying to get rid of the ball before he gets tagged and Brad Jackson you know we talked about Chad Palmer being the best athlete offensively Brad Jackson for both teams probably defensively the best athlete Brad Jackson allconference USA first team also plays a little basketball they traveled to fit right after the season he'll he'll join the Cincinnati Bearcats basketball team as a guard old fumble old bounces right back into the arms you think things are going their way today Orlando Smith lost it look down what a what a hop I mean you would think the football was shaped like a regular ball and just bounce right back to him this would have been a golden opportunity for the Aggies you get it back you see Smith rumbling outside the ball comes free but look at that right back up to him he gets it in stride and again there's John Dale cardi making the tackle your free safety making the tackle that is not good block running that interception by the way stopped the longest Aggie drive of the afternoon Kiner the quarterback to pitch to plumber stops the clock at the 31 yard line let's check in with Holly Rowe Holly guys you talked about the frequent flyer miles that Brad Jackson has been logging but you don't know just how many over 6,000 he joined the basketball team for the Bearcats because of three suspensions they needed him on defense but that was before they knew they had a bowl berth so he has been practicing both sports all week in fact he came out here to Boise practice flew out to Cleveland to a game where you see the UMass in double overtime and he said he had a good game he had a couple of rebounds and he played 14 minutes but now he's back playing football he says he loves it everybody's dream to play to sports and be a Deion Sanders of sorts now right now the dion of sorts is cramping up a little bit at 6,000 plus miles will take it out of you yeah I think they're kind of stretching his hamstring out on the interception he was trying to keep both feet in and he kind of jammed either his hamstring or his lower back and you see him trying to stretch out he made a great play on the interception but in his effort to keep his feet inbounds I think he kind of jammed himself up a little bit we'll take a quick break 2:30 to go before halftime Jackson gets some help on the sideline and we'll be back we know all those stories you hear about how good it was the how much fun in the head and how young we all used to be and all matter and how much we all cared and how no one has ever done it higher faster all those stories you hear they're all true welcome back first annual humanitarian Bowl since and any leads by 21 let's check the studios and Chris Fowler Christmas well it's her mobile studio we're out here at Pasadena will have halftime will take you down to Miami will talk about the Orange Bowl in Nebraska quarterback Scott frost also a preview of tonight's holiday Bowl Oklahoma or Colorado State against Missouri and also the latest in sports from the SPN news all right thank you Chris in the mobile studio oval studio I take that thing all over guys they're everywhere they obviously fulltime they're there at all points in the country giving you the best coverage you can get that's what you call frequent flyer miles there you're not kidding but he upgrades pretty much yeah oh yeah plenty of upgrades Jenner is at the quarterback spot two minutes to play in the half then Crossland for the Aggies has been been pretty silent to them he knew he had a tough task with Fubini and also Galinski the left side of that Cincinnati line that goes deep downfield it Skinner and he hooks up I believe is that Plummer yeah Chad Plummer Donald dqo made the tackle but how about that's the second time today that the new kid hooks up with the old guy you know the quarterback switching and it's working this is amazing and now and now Kenner just runs off the field and Plummer will go back to quarterback again we'll see Plummer at the wide receiver and he's got must to have a special relationship with Kennedy because they're in the same meetings all the time a quarterback he sees it's a great job his route was over the middle to his left he saw Kenner in trouble broke background and followed the quarterback great great job of reading the quarterback and the trouble he was in nothing fancy Plummer hands it up maybe a yard Caleb Smith made the stop for Utah State now you mentioned last timeout Utah State defense has been on the field way too much in this first half and they did have a stop a series ago for Cincinnati to punt it they need to put a couple rolls together now seeing that their offense the Aggie offense went down and had a little bit of a drive shouldn't gave him the defense a little bit of a boost but right now Cincinnati trying to grind it out and run the clock out off for the half Mike it's the number one ranked defense in the Big West but you can get tired in a hurry out here i formation minute to go and i have one of the play fake dances and throws and complete still on his feet flags are down but the hook up to Jason Collins Baker number 83 looks like a hold and that's going to be the call by Chuck McFerrin our referee so bring this one back anytime you see the flag back there and the referee throwing it it's usually holding but the play itself well Chad Plummer gets in trouble and starts to scramble that makes the linebackers come off their coverage because they know Chad Palmer won't like to run the ball and that's freed up Jason Collins banker or Baker right behind him what would have been a great play if not for the hole but maybe that's why he escaped the pocket because of the hole holding on the offense 10yard for the spot of the foul still second down penalty brings it back to the 30 yard line check the hole we'll see if that's what frees up Chad Plummer yeah that's on number 61 jolt Alinsky to left guard and he's holding John Allah to with to try to make a move back across and Olinsky had to grab on for dear life and got caught you look at delenn ski six to 300pounder he can also switch over and play center if need be Jenner is the quarterback Utah State needs use some of their timeouts here Robert Cooper the ball carrier not much off the right side Crossland been Crossland the Big West Defensive Player of the Year made the tackle I don't understand this they're letting the clock run not using timeouts it would be third down right now they could use another timeout go to fourth and a punt and you down 21 enough and I don't understand that at all that when you're losing by that line first half complete of the humanitarian Bowl Cincinnati leads by 21 let's go to Chris Fowler in the mobile studio Chris all right guys tough for Coach Smith to get that team to come back for him when he's taken off for Louisville along with six assistants 21 nothing Bearcats at the break coming up at halftime Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit with junior we'll talk about the Washington State defensive line they faced the big challenge against the Wolverines big offensive line but many believe they are ready for it we're back and pass it in after this when one game ends another begins and for 95% of studentathletes it's the big one that's why every student athlete needs a program like champs life skills a program that helps athlete's own their personal and business skills develop a commitment to volunteer and service work and prepare for leadership while pursuing excellence in academics and athletics champs life skills preparing studentathletes for the big game just a routine day of training not quite that best for America's most elite firefighters but for their leader was a prison break nature Killa see if you're still not a fly firestorm greeted our January night only in theatres who loves team Cheerios the stingrays were stunned by him down south the barracudas are chomping him down the Sharks are in a frenzy four teams all over gate team tree was a triumph they loved it cuz it's three awesome homes teamed up and sweetened up with frosting and brown sugar for an amazing sweet crunch your team will love don't forget the mighty sand crabs yeah they've done right in team Cheerios ace your team will love humanitarian Bowl halftime from Pasadena nestled down in the Arroyo Seco the famous Rose Bowl where Charles Woodson and Michigan will square off against the man it was third in the Heisman voting hawaiian leaf and washington state the big dog ballgame just three days away for as much of the pregame focus has been on washington state's prolific offense in the passing game of Ryan Leaf in the Fab five but don't forget at Washington State defense now statistically they can't match up with Michigan's but remember the plane of the pac10 conference are playing a lot of very good offense and they do have one advantage going against that Wolverine ground game the guys up front are very big this is not your average weight for a college defensive line big Gary Holmes 6 7 3 16 the Volkl Leon bender backs it up with 299 pounds of muscle Dorian boots also an NFL prospect at 282 and Shane Doyle the little guy at 250 full per which did a lot of places is a very average sized defensive lineman Wazzu defense did go up more than 150 yards rushing in five of their 11 games this season but their size their athleticism certainly has captured the attention of Michigan's coaches and also its quarterback yeah more of a Smash Mouth idea of football and running the football a lot more and they throw a lot more in the pac10 and I don't think that their defense has seen the kind of running game that we have and you know when you can run the football you know you can always be successful and so and in this game that'll be big for us Lee Corso in Kirk Herbstreit join me Brian Griese he's been confident about their ability to run this football all week long but again that's not the typical defensive line the opponents the Michigan played we're in bowl games averaged about 20 pounds less forgotten wazoo you know Washington State's defense line probably has the biggest challenge of any area in any ball games the reason is everybody knows that Michigan's going to line up and run right at them but don't be surprised of mishit Washington State's defensive line led by Leon bender doesn't play a little bit tougher than people expect the reason is they're better than people know of because nobody's ever heard of them I mean who's ever heard of these guys Leon bender 300pounder right well I agree with you but at the same time I think you're gonna see the linebackers be heavily utilized for Washington State to try to stop Michigan also look for the safeties coming up to stop this effective running game for Michigan if you go back to the beginning of the year that left side of their offensive line was a major question mark both the guard and the tackle hadn't played one game of college football they have stepped up and grown up in a big big way for the Wolverines they are now the strength of the team Washington State's defense though has one simple mission get Ryan Leaf back on the field his Ouachita's gonna want to keep him off the field and that kind of positioning is going to be important in a game like this ABC has the ball game of course as you know on New Year's Day D Jackson Bob Griese Lynn Swann from just behind us here that follows the cop USA a Florida Citrus Bowl shorthanded Penn State against Florida and in the evening Florida State and Ohio State in the Nokia Sugar Bowl the bold season wraps up a course with the Orange Bowl and all the focus the entire week and I guess the entire season has been on Tennessee's quarterback Peyton Manning it may be fitting that Nebraska's Scott frost in the final game of his career is once again seen as the other quarterback frost disrespected a bit by big 12 coaches this year only third team allconference despite the fact that he accounted for 24 total touchdowns ran for a thousand and threw for a thousand yards corby Jones perhaps are deserving all big Polk quarterback in and Michael Bishop a nice player but Scott Ross third team in any conference well that's ridiculous I think the first two the looking at their would bitch up and also Corby Jones a little bit more flamboyant and if you look at Scott frost here's a guy that has really taken advantage of the system at Nebraska you can look back at all the great Nebraska quarterbacks and everybody's going to compare Scott frost and I think some of the people in Lincoln still haven't warmed up to him but the man goes out any wins football games and I don't care what style football you play as long as you're winning that's all that matters I'd like scars process the beginning of the year I like him also but there's another guy that nobody ever talks about it's the fullback Joel makovicka the reason why I could talk about him is the inside game is the key the Nebraska's running game makovicka averages over seven yards per carry the inside inside and they come outside pitch it and kill you but makovicka is the key to forcing everybody inside so they can get to the outside beat you nobody talks about them except you you are if the fullbacks get loose and the big Reds gonna be in the pink League just like you sure come on I'm max well back to ESPN news studio for an update in the world of sports then back to Pasadena for

first this very subtle programming reminder there's more college football action in store tonight on the ESPN family of networks Mizzou and Colorado State doing battle in the Holiday Bowl on ESPN a game that promises to provide many offensive fireworks they will kick it off at 8:00 Eastern you should watch to the NFL where after his team's third loss of the year to the New England Patriots Jimmie Johnson promised changes for next season Johnson didn't waver from that at today's news conference he made it clear the problem is not Dan Marino it's personnel decisions the coaching staff made about the guys who are surrounding the longtime Dolphins QB Dan Marino's our quarterback you know he's not gonna be traded he's not gonna be released you know how many times do I have to say it Dan Marino you know Dan Marino is one of the better quarterbacks in this league and I won't Dameron Oh back you know with Miami Dolphins now can Dan Marino carry the offense on his shoulders maybe there was a day that he could but I don't think that he can right now and so it's my responsibility to give Dan Marino help it's my responsibility to correct the problem areas and so I don't I'm not pointing fingers at anybody other than me I screwed up this was just the second postseason loss of Johnson's career in nine all time playoff games clearly the offense does need to be retooled there 162 yards of total offense yesterday an alltime franchise playoff low if Dennis Rodman would be voted the NBA player most likely to be involved in a major Franca's there Coleman would probably be a close second his were meanness has been on his best behavior though this year which left the door wide open for Coleman and Derrick walked right through it last night let's check out the highlights he was the kings battling the Sixers Corliss Williamson attempts to swat it away from Coleman then check out the spot shadow where interesting things always seem to happen live dad Thank You ver CS the play progresses and Coleman and Williamson going at it Williamson attempting the clothesline and then everything goes crazy Larry Brown in there trying to break it up players from both teams involved although no one left the bench is that of course would be an automatic suspension speaking of suspensions here they are three games 15,000 dollar fine for Williamson Coleman suspended two games and fined a ten thousand in addition each find a thousand for being ejected if you're watching the humanitarian poll you're headed back there 21nothing cincinnati thanks to to Cornelius Bonner touchdowns

few thousand gallons of paint used to beautify the Rose Bowl field almost one hundred and six thousand people set the jam New Year's Day when Michigan takes on Washington State right here meanwhile tonight on ESPN the Holiday Bowl perhaps over the years no Bowl has provided wilder games highscoring unpredictable results than the Holiday Bowl Missouri in a bowl for the first time since 83 Colorado state champions of the WAC come in riding an 8game winning streak for a preview we go to San Diego rich walls rod Gilmore and friends thanks crest the deck of the USS Kitty Hawk with San Diego in the backdrop Holiday Bowl time top 20 teams in Colorado State and Missouri rich Walt's rod Gilmore and 20 of our closest friends here in San Diego let's talk about Missouri first Larry Smith's rebuilding process they took a huge step forward this year at seven and four so Larry Smith does that all the time he's done it at other places USC Tulane and Arizona what a surprise here I don't think so but he's got a great quarterback corby Jones Jones is perhaps the most dimensional quarterback in college football right now he can throw it he can run it he's a Heisman Trophy candidate for next season he had 2500 yards in offense all by himself let's talk Colorado State Sonny lubic has a very good defense a defense that's gonna have to stop Corby Jones forget about it that won't happen the best way to deal with it is to keep the ball away from them Kevin MacDougall Damon Washington too great running backs together they can keep the ball away from Cory Jones I think the WAC has something to prove they're all into in ball games they haven't won this holiday bowl for a long time well if they don't get a win this time they're gonna get a lot of grief around the country for not having a strong team this is their number one team this is their best chance all right so it's Missouri it's Colorado State it's the holiday ball us to civilians we'll carry on Chris all right Thank You Haley he's been borrowing your stuff forget about it and I gotta stop Corey Jones I like that Corey Jones the exciting a sec Missouri is there for one reason there's seven and for a bowl game because quarterback Corby Jones has had a sensational year he he accounts for 55% of the Missouri offense over 232 yards a game I think one thing Corby Jones is a great enough player that he can beat Colorado tonight by himself he's a great player let's see playing linebacker I don't I don't think their defense is struggled this year and they're going up against the defense it has great balance Kevin MacDougall and Damon Washington the onetwo punch in the backfield both went over a thousand yards and their quarterback is very experienced in bowl games Moses Marino over 2,200 yards and 20 touchdowns I think that balanced attack of the Rams tonight is the difference in that game haven't seen too many bowl shootouts so far except for Marshall and Ole Miss but good night it could be typical Holiday Bowl you remember their Lee you and you were there 38 37 meanwhile it's the Alamo Bowl tomorrow on ESPN the Builders square game matches Oklahoma State and Purdue both those teams appearing in a bowl game for the first time in the 90s Cincinnati a long way from home the staff up in Boise button dominating Utah State this is Diaw great pen earthy Heather quarterback with the Bearcats she finds Cornelius bata what a few finer touchdown 21 zip there again these teams are appearing in bowl games for the first time in the 90s we're seeing Cincinnati at daylong along 46 year grad today winning at halftime meanwhile West Virginia not on that screen but the Mountaineers have gone six bowl games without winning one West Virginia Owens six in their last six and Georgia Tech has not been in a bowl game since 1991 they meet in the CARQUEST Bowl Amos zero A says he plans to play despite that injured foot that freak accident in practice he needs to go because Marc Bulger the quarterback although he threw for a lot of yards one touchdown and three picks in the last three games you're talking about quarterbacks Georgia Tech goes in the ballgame with a hot quarterback in Joe Hamilton in the last four ballgames he's completed over 70% of his passes six touchdowns interesting stat here no interceptions in 112 attempts I think the tech excitement gives them the advantage over West Virginia Chris I think you bring up a good point I think the balance of West Virginia has been a very very strong strong thing for them offensively Bulger has really stepped up as a quarterback and the health of an aim is zero way is key in his football game if he's healthy the Mountaineers definitely I think can win his football game I think it's the morale game whoever is prepared better wins this football game because West Virginia and Georgia Tech struggled at the end of the year losing to their archrival exactly in West Virginia returned a lot of tickets for this game so the fan base not all that excited one of those morale games you're right if they want to come out and play and finally end a bowl losing streak that's the motivation the second half for Boise is coming up Utah State in a big hole to the Bearcats that's after those I was hurt I feel like I've been take decision Belfort in bird sport are going ends ahead for your business and yours all

with him we're becoming sports fans the more you've know about the game the more you want to know what's going on that's why we like Cox cable I mean they just have so many games and there's so much more information and they just have better coverage do you think and now we have the time to really explore the things we want to do we have to stay in touch and attract investments politics that's why we like Cox cable because we can see the things we're gonna do to the needs of student athletes programs include degree completion scholarships choices alcohol education grants life skills winning for life and sports journalism scholarships the NCAA Foundation enhancing the present and future of student athletes this message provided by the NCAA halftime at the humanitarian Bowl and so far it's all been Cincinnati they lead the Utah State Aggies by a score of 21 to nothing Craig Bullard Jack back along with Mike Golic and really Mike so far in the first 30 minutes has been a tale of two quarterbacks which is kept Utah State's defense on the field for nearly 19 minutes and I tell you that Utah State defense has got to be tired versatility of the key here for Cincinnati four players rushing over 20 yards three receivers with over 20 yards each in receptions total yards for Utah State 97 Temari owe Brown has accounted for 70 of those 97 yards let's talk about the first half and show you some highlights because really Cincinnati is not known as a passing team they go to the two quarterback set and Plummer comes out and shows he control the football boy he did you know and he is running well too but I'm sure every now and then he'd like to show his versatility throwing and then you bring the young guy and Deonte Kenner they wanted to check his arm up well there he reads the Blitz beautifully and throws a beautiful strike here match Sox had a tough tough afternoon for a 15 there's one of his two interceptions kicker Keck gets the pick off and then thinks he's returning a putt he's got four punt returns two cuts out I'm sure he's got that going through his head kids I can the Bearcats some great great field position and Mike you look at the first half numbers first downs dominated by Cincinnati rushing yards passing yards it's really two to one in total yards 205 for the Bearcats only 97 for the Utah State Aggies and a very very tough Utah State Aggies offense at averages of nearly 450 yards a game and the amygdale Smith's career coaching here at Utah State he has been shut out and backtoback quarters I think time of possession there is key and I think something else Craig I know we've harped on it but it's got to be said as this game goes on if Utah State is staying down you know I think there's gonna be a little bit of rough time on that sideline with those coaches I mean you got a lot of coaches leave it I think it may it could turn bad Mike you compare the two quarterbacks Plummer 204 Kenner came in five of nine 36 yards for Plummer 59 for Deonte Kiner touchdowns one apiece a total of 93 yards but a team that averages 114 I'll tell you what the head coach Richt mineral were there he's just licking his chops well this whole test was for Deonte Kennedy knew Chad Plummer could play quarterback and wide receiver this was to see how can I reacted the true freshman they love the way he throws the ball and if he looked good in this game then next year they plan to run this type offense the whole year flags are down on the kick remember Cincinnati won the toss to start this game they wanted the football to start the third quarter shucks McFerrin will give us the call first down you know if you just joined us do not I repeat do not adjust your television set Boise State Broncos Broncos Stadium is a home to Boise State and their colors as you can tell blue and orange and you walk into the stadium to go hold on where am i but yes this is the color of the turf blue and I think that would leave kind of a funny looking turf burner it's your whooping jab plum will start the third quarter as a Cincinnati quarterback they lead by 21 and Cincinnati will start on the ground and this will be a big test for Utah State here you have to wonder what was said in the locker room John L Smith final halftime speech to this ball club yeah I really think there's gonna be some friction I know we have Holly Rowe on the sideline and I'm sure she'll find out some of that information on their silent just to see how the reaction of player and coach and assistant coaches with all the assistant coaches going with them is going to be as this game progresses players may now start to think hey you know this is it they're leaving you know again in one ear out the other the longer this game goes against Utah State I think the worse it gets on their sidelines Darrell royal to lone back on second down Plummer fires and throws complete to the 30 yard line and D'Amato made the tackle well Holly Rowe knows what happened inside that Utah State locker room let's check in well John L Smith is uncharacteristically being very quiet he's letting his players take over tomorrow Smith Demario Brown took over he was leader in the locker room and then he led his team back out onto the field and said let's take the field with some life we're playing like we're dead out there let's go out with some style and quit playing like chumps there's 30 minutes left to reprove ourselves all right Thank You Holli iformation third down let's call it one plus a quarterback wants to run the option little drip misdirection and the Aggies good down line pursuit by the guys in blue and it's gonna be a fourth down situation Shawne Hansen led the charger right in that's a that's a big stop for Utah State they needed that Dobbs 21 nothing and I really like what happened in that locker room when Holly roll just told us John L Smith he's going to be leaving he turned it over to his team and said alright guys this is your last half you guys do what you have to do in de Mario Brown against 70 yards of their total 97 I'm glad he stood up and let the players put it on their shoulders and kind of keep the coaches out of it Doug Johnson will kick to Steve Smith and we're very happy to have in the booth Jerry Kramer played at Idaho a draft pick of 1958 the 4th round pick and then went on with great career with the Green Bay Packers and has been here as part of the humanitarian Bowl festivities and you presented Jerry the players into the Hall last of two nights ago which was a very emotional night I understand Craig was a wonderful wonderful evening Billy Mills was an incredible inspiration Mel Blount the story that you could spend a lifetime on Kevin Johnson another great story these two young men's in the University of Cincinnati from Utah State have already both achieved a great deal of humanitarian good deeds in their life so the whole evening was a very special evening you know I normally when you get a banquet with kids 18 19 20 years old they lose interest pretty quick in this one they really held their focus this was a wonderful evening and a wonderful message for young athletes and young people all across the country of course that's what the sports humanitarian Hall of Fame is all about the young athletes and get them to focus on being a positive role model and have a positive impact on their society it's a wonderful idea you talked some what about the this year's inductees but it's a very impressive group KJ his mother was here Mel Blount who has a fistful of Super Bowl rings and Billy Mills who really turned the crowd on wonderful wonderful group of guys Billy started talking warriors and then Mel Blount came out and start talking about warriors and then kgs presenter that there were three warriors there tonight and they're all working for the humanitarian Hall of Fame and for the humanitarians in in life and in the country itself so it was a wonderful evening well you've got a couple of championship rings yourself you ever win any on blue turf I'm not used to playing in this kind of weather this 51 degrees I played the championship game well the troubles continued for Utah State Demario Brown fumbled the football after another nice Aggie Drive here to start the third quarter but Cincinnati recovers and Jerry let's take a look at the inductees so far during the short the short life of the humanitarian Hall of Fame which is located here in Boise Idaho and it's a great group a great group of people here there have been so many wonderful athletes Roberto Clemente Chi Chi Rodriguez Dale Murphy great for Johnson and I think Chiefy chichi said it best he said Jerry you know winning is good for the pocketbook and good for the the status he said that the sports humanitarian how's Fame that's good for the soul yes and it's a great list of inductees and talking about this game as we take a look at him right there talking about this game you have a head coach for Utah State Aggies leaving with six of visit coaches what effect do you think going back as a player with that would that have had have you knowing coaches after their last game there I don't know if you want to say bailing out on you but moving on people that you trusted when they came into your home and recruited you there's gonna have to be an impact Mike there's no question about that but John al is a very emotional human being who's a very very guy and if anybody is gonna get his team ready to play the second half Jarnell is gonna get him ready to play the second half I think what we heard in the locker room was classic Jarnell and I expect to see a pretty good second half all right Jerry Kramer thanks so much for coming by a class act and Super Bowl ring real quick oh my I never got close count of one that's great Jerry Kramer thanks sir thank you good thanks mate clock continues to go just under just over 11 minutes to play third quarter after the turnover Cincinnati for that 21point lead trying to build on it Plummer Dodge's trouble throws fighters and complete down at the 31 yard line and what an afternoon today Craig Miller on the coverage Jason Collins Baker with the reception again you see the the mobility of a Chad Plummer if he's not running the ball he's in the pocket he's scrambling in the pocket what makes him so dangerous when he starts to scramble in the pocket people can come off their coverage because he thinks he's gonna run and then you know he's got to be he's not a great accurate quarterback with a great arm but he's got a good enough arm to get the job done he actually looks like he throws the ball better on the run first down for the Bearcats at the 31 first man through to fullback Landon Smith 250 pound fullback Plummer for six on the day for 58 yards between a nice job at quarterback and wide receiver again the big question was Deon take Kenner and the kid is coming and throwing the ball nice I think he's answering some questions for that Cincinnati staff so where next year they could pull this off a little more and they'd said a lot of it depends on the team they play do they need to switch it up like this so that you just need to hammer the ball running where they keep Plummer in do they need to throw a little bit more if they're down where they can put trustee on take Kenner to throw the ball Bob Coppola the motion man 954 to go big hole like a tank is Cooper inside the 22 this 17 yard line and another first down for Cincinnati Craig Miller came up to make the stop junior quarterback number 66 on the pole he hits D'Amato and just opens up the whole big 66 that's Ken big 65 290 pounds again this whole line averaging 306 pounds and they're doing a job not only they can come off the ball but to see bigs pulling that big body around the center and coming up field and making a block when you can block in space like that you know it's to just come ahead and Road grade is one thing but to be able to move your feet and block in space that's up now Robert Cooper needing some help off the field after that run now flags come out well we got a somebody cool souvenir football on the field good arm she did it made it a long way and I'm not gonna make a mad sock reference right now I won't do that too it has been a tough day for Aggie for the Aggie office this could be the start of a of a nail in a coffin hit field cincinnati puts this one in the end zone the look at Chad Plummer again they're gonna ground it up on the ground royal a couple yards down close to the 15yard line D'Amato again on the tackle let's check in with ollie guys at halftime I had a chance to speak with Rick mentor and ask him how his great quarterback experiment was going he said he's very pleased he thinks Deonte kenner is showing extraordinary poise especially during blitz situation but he wasn't happy with his team he said they're shooting themselves in the foot we should be up by a lot more right now than just 21 nothing we talked to coach a minute yesterday he's a very serious hardnosed guy loves his kit you know come from Notre Dame as a defensive coordinator your turf good fella at one time back in 92 93 had a pretty good couple football teams yeah and a 21 and 2 record there and a couple of nice ball games we'll take a break Bearcats by 21 sweet sleep

pursuit of excellence takes you to victory every coach we talk to every player they want his speech in their back pocket he was holding all kids I mean you could just see in their eyes it's just just

load it would be national carbonyl bull weed continues as Wisconsin takes on Georgia in the Outback Bowl Wisconsin Georgia Thursday at 11:00 on ESPN Jan Plummer has thrown and ran for a touchdown one reason why Cincinnati leads by 28 this was a nice play and you're gonna see how kids set up his inside traffic is gonna get cut off right about here number 45 Donald dqo gets caught in a situation he's got for sure Levingston out there but he's caught where do I go I got no help in here do I help out here do I come back he's caught in no man's land Plummer sees that and just cuts right back I'd eCos left holding the bag I mean he's trying to help Levingston on the outside because there's a lead blocker and he gets no pursuit from his inside linebacker so he's really left on an island Blum around the day 33 yards rushing 58 yards passing 38 yards in reception yardage for a total of 129 yards of total offense 1:29 326 off the clock cincinnati has scored and scored quickly in this football game boy they really have it and one thing we're looking at we talked at the top conferences Big West Conference USA these teams playing more for just the Cincinnati and Utah State they're playing for that national recognition from their conference and right now now for two SI is really really making a big big statement about the type of football they play you see steady improvement we take a look at Rick mentor of his team's over the years he's been there his goal obviously is to find a permanent home for the first second third place finishers at Conference USA sock is gonna go up top quickly and caught but incomplete by Nakia Jenkins at midfield flat ball hung up there big rainbow Sean Ferguson on coverage of Nakia Jenkins Jenkins 73 catches on the year 1 today sock has missed him a couple of times wide open but really he's been covered very well and this is the type of defense against Cincinnati comes after people and they put a lot of pressure on their cornerback you know Mike we talked to Bob Petrino the offensive coordinator his word on Nakia say he had a great week of practice great practices mean great games and so far from Nakia it has not been and i he's got to get his quarterback to get him the ball the Mario Brown up the middle still he's a thought you cannot just handle him the first man through it takes a couple to get to Mario Brown down tackled by Philip curry you know unfortunately he's really the only player you know you talked about how he talked about emotions they had in the locker room the Mario Brown right here carrying the ball he's the one that stood up and spoke up look at the way he's running churning those legs not going down unfortunately there's not a lot of people following his lead he's got 12 rushes on the day for 53 yards and he's really the only one playing with a lot of that driving emotion averages over five yards of carry on the season third down five soft frozen fires complete folks up with Steve Smith stuff on his feet breaks a tackle another he said to the sidelines miss got speed Smith down the sideline touchdown Aggies 75yard but I mean he must have run 120 what a great great job and a great job in the kia Jenkins blocking downfield at the end sock does a nice job reading coverage this time Smith is the slot man and they're playing off of him he says all I need is five yards I'll hit him with a quick hitch does a nice job of reading that and that is the first third down conversion that the Aggies have had today and it turns in so hopefully seven points after the kick come on that will kick the extra point Darryl young the holder 75 yards and the kick is true and the drought ends at the 731 mark of the third quarter Utah State on the board well here he is in the slot and they see him playing off so it's just a little five yard hitch get the first down get down but Smith says oh we're down way too much I'm gonna get all I can and he does he cuts a bat back breaks one two three four five six count along if you want that's seven there's eight and now look at Nikita Jenkins down the sideline getting the last block to free up Smith to the end zone a good job blocking downfield after seven broken tackles able to shade our trail Hawkins the corner and now the two can celebrate Nakia Jenkins on a block for his running mate Steve Smith lesb in college basketball tomorrow 5:30 ESPN Clemson and Western Kentucky Clemson led by the nation's best backcourt to real McIntyre how about this 45% from behind the threepoint line great Buckner leads the team in scoring is Clemson and Western Kentucky on the deuce tomorrow well Utah State you see right there there used to score and quick they haven't been able to do it today but during the season almost half of their scoring drives have taken less than two minutes this one three plays eighty yards in a bucket let's see what kind of turnover that has for the Utah State defense and stop in Cincinnati no Hawkins breaks it on the pitch and is knocked out of bounds at the 39 call it the 40 so a fine return Cincinnati this has been the story for the Bearcats all day fine feel position on every possession and even though you got seven 21 left in the third quarter and there's a whole nother 15 minutes left in the game so over 22 minutes this is a big big series your offense just has a big play your defense has been on the field a long time they need to make a stand Tony de Mato has been playing well in the middle John Dale kardi has been asked to do a lot at free safety now guys like Ben Crossland have got to step up the linemen have got to step up it and not let this option take effect Deonte Kiner the quarterback bad pitch picked up royal has it it's a busted play trying to make something out of nothing and the IBEW swarm him down at the 32 yard line so a big loss of eight Jeremy Hunt Lovelace led that Agee charge but not a good pitch by the freshman that was a nice job of pursuit again you see Lovelace with with the penetration it's just a bad pitch basically just a bad pitch goes there I guess they got lucky the bounce comes right back to the running back numbers on hunt Lovelace 64 tackles on the season tackles for losses four for nine yards second down a loss of eight a nurse wins it out of the backfield hooks up about what a one loyal got the yardage back and then some to the 46 yard line D'Amato chased him down normally it can be a hot route at the end but this is planned all the way because look at the offensive lineman that end up in front of them this is a swing pass it's almost like a quick screen watch the linemen get out in front of them you see number 63 Vince burg getting out number 79 is out there Don shakey this is a plan play all the way a lot of times it's a late hot route this time it's almost like a quick wide screen third down in five pockets to six minute mark of the third quarter 28 7 Cincinnati Jenner the quick step and a quick hitch and he hooks up with Jason Collins Baker number 83 on a Detroit in Michigan C Kenner took another shot there again he'll hang in the pocket he's got a nice arm on you know there's like two when he was a senior in high school only two high school players that threw for more yards than him Redman who was at Louisville who now John L Smith is going to coach and some guy named Tim Couch at Kentucky you threw for a million or so easy now huh yeah Kenna Kenna was right behind those two Flyers 7 of 11 78 yards and a touchdown to bonnet got my dolphin down the middle hooks up with plumber well that's the third time today the two quarterback tandems who switch off have you been watching from start to finish here Jarnell cardi made the tackle but those two they've got something special they they they're reading each other's eyes and the break and good throw across the middle are they really doing it and they do that they're on the same wavelength right now what happens here it's a nice move over the middle but John del cardi number three he's the free safety he goes with the fake it's a fake away from where a plumber is and then it's a playaction pass cardi falls for it he flows that way and that gives Plummer the middle of the field absolutely wide open counter puts it there dinner comes off the field plumber after the reception goes back to play quarterback and usually that means ground game Lando Smith picks up five six yards of the 15 yard line decoe made the tackle for Utah State well I hope after they're out this season all of these running backs Landon Smith Darrell royal Orlando Smith Robert Cooper take all these offensive linemen out and buy them some nice meals does this offensive line does a nice job of just moving the pile and letting these guys run downhill it's a big offensive line there's a few subs in there get the chance to play bench bird number 63 is over at left guard now Doug Ross field is the center not much this time for Royal Ben Crossland shot the gap and knocked him down and if my memory is wrong tell me is that the first time we called Ben cross Wednesday maybe first or second time you know he is not had a big impact in this game you see he's up at the top right here he'll make penetration in comes back the plays actually supposed to go wide he comes underneath which you can get away with if you're quick enough because you do have contain he comes underneath the block does the right thing gets back out wide and makes the play they need more plays like that from Ben cross since he's been a durable player for John L Smith making his 38th consecutive start Cincinnati 3 7 of 12 on third down conversion the slant Jenner came in and threw a bullet at that time they used chant plumber he was in the slot as a decoy he runs an out pattern to take the pressure off you see dqo running out of there where decos running out number 45 Bernoulli a spider just fills in as a nice job that's a little crossing route to try and take the defensive act out of the zone you want to throw Chad Plummer as a slap man now does the job takes people out of the play and kind of puts the ball on the mark inside the 24 of five today for four touchdowns three and a half minutes to go the motion man is Bonnard Plummer hands off Orlando Smith nothing but he keeps driving the picks up three oh he was stood up straight at the line of scrimmage but second effort gives him three yards that's a wide body there in Orlando Smith and here's a great story as we watch our Lando Smith just pulling up the middle he originally signed a few years ago with Michigan State he failed his entrance exam and on his own on his own money became a parttime student at the University of Buffalo to get his grades back up and Cincinnati was right there to offer him a scholarship and he hurt his ankle had some injury problems and they said he has practiced the best out of the last 12 days of the other running backs robert cooper and dell royal and he got the start and it's paying off today it was an official's timeout ninth play of this Drive coming up second down very deflating for Utah State after coming off the big score here's where you need your defense to come up with that big big stand and the Cincinnati offenses you just said nine plays already or nine play coming off of the drive just taking the win right back out of the sale warmers the quarterback Landon Smith the fullback with Orlando behind him one wants to throw protection all day all day fires incomplete smart play plumber had a man in the vicinity throw it into the turf no way the Aggies could pick it that's a very very smart play covered probably double covered there's a flag down on the other side of the field but a smart play by Plummer to get rid of the ball not get the intentional ground and call but we have an illegal man downfield which happened which can happen a lot of times when he scrambled that much especially with a chant farmer who likes to run now he starts to scramble the offensive linemen think hey he's gonna run the ball I'm gonna go down and get a block Chad Plummer pulls it back and throws you got yourself a little bit of confusion in a little bit of trouble Plummer will now go to the white out Kiner back in a quarterback declined to be third down what's impressive for Cincinnati as they have only been practicing this type of offense switching Kenner and Plummer for 12 days and it looks like they've been practices it for 12 months I mean it is really really running smooth we call that 12 the 12 days of December they've done a fine job they're down goal from the 7 yard line Kenner they throw the blitz at him swings it out here Lando Smith rumbling in that right there is just a nice play call that's from my offensive coordinator Gregg seaman he just lines up all his receivers to the left gets all the defensive backs over there and does a quick little shot out to Orlando Smith makes a nice run into the end zone that's athat's a nice cause we take a look at John L Smith as he sees almost a spark and his team and kind of snuffed out by the ver Cavs Lando's Smith had one rushing touchdown during the regular season that kicked by judge is up and good and so Cincinnati after giving up the touchdown to Utah State they picked the seven points right back to 28 to go in the quarter and the Bearcats lead the Aggies of Utah State 38 to 7 I roll the dice straight it's Arizona's biggest party Tostitos brings you college football's biggest party and Tippi tostitos fiesta bowl block party one duel ticket get you both great event

north here this is a beautiful beautiful college town great things to do many things to see absolutely beautiful you can see the mountains in the background and today the snow is stayed on the mountains and he's not made its way here by the way that was not a pass the official stats tell us it was a lateral so they're gonna count it as a running touchdown right well land us with the PI rather have a running he'll take that he's a running back absolutely no return for Utah State they trail 35 to 7 well you look at total place Cincinnati's run 62 total plays Utah State only 33 and that's that's number one a long time for the Aggie defense to be on the field and a short time for that offense to make someplace even though they are big play offense this defense from Cincinnati has done a nice job shutting down that soccer and the Aggies sonck averaging 263 yards a game during the season stifled today great play fake wide open Nakia Jenkins makes it turn bumps out of bounds at the 46 yard line that stops the clock with 216 to go in the third quarter let's go downstairs and check in with Holly Craig you've been talking about all day what an outstanding job athletically Chad Plummer of Cincinnati is doing at both the quarterback and the wide receiver position but let's talk about mentally he has to know all the plays he has a lot of latitude at the line of scrimmage to call plays he says every time he goes to the line he has three or four plays in mind in case the defense is doing something he wants to change it but then he has to line up out of the wide receiver spot know the route know the place from that angle as well so a tough day mentally and physically for Chad Plummer good point Holly he knows that to play ball very well again hooking up Jenkins bumped out at the 40 by tinker CAC and the Aggies Mike in this third quarter have shown signs of putting their offense together but you got to think to the 35 points you see on the board now Utah State trying to answer back with some tough defense these guys just been on fuel way too long and what's happening also you see them starting to hit a couple of nice passes but the Cincinnati defense is starting to play back a little bit they're playing off they're not as aggressive they'll probably mix in now a few blitz is now that the Aggies have completed a few passes they're gonna say all right enough is enough we're going to come in come after you and shut you down Soph eight of 20 bookshop fans breaks a tackle turns it for the inside and chased out of bounds at the 15 yard line Hawkins number 21 but Steve Smith continues to impress he has great breakaway speed after the catch but this guy five foot eight a hundred and sixty seven pounds he's a guy you almost really want to get up on the line and mug here he's an open space look at the little shake and bake he he absolutely does Eric Harper the strong safety and moves on dogs Hill throws a little stiff are in there to say okay I might be 167 pounds but I could throw down a little wicket he's a guy you might really want to get up on the line and jam before he can use his speed Melvin blue number six who did a fine job backing up to Mario Brown during his injury section they swing it out they hook it up to the tight end the Moody and the Moody inside the five neither gonna mark him down at the 6 yard line one good to Mooney big tight end weighs around about 265 a junior and a Monterey played a Dixie junior college this is the offense that we've expected to see off the bat from a team like Utah State that average is 280 yards passing a game mixing it up you're seeing slant you're seeing outs you seeing dropoffs to the tight end unfortunately maybe too little too late for him inside the red zone 41 opportunities this year they've come away with 30 touchdowns soft looks one way looking the other you may have to tuck and run he does bumps his own lineman and gets back to the fiveyard line picks up one the hard way Philip Currie the middle linebacker with here's Philip Currie nearly 500 career tackles 487 before today's play middle linebacker in this system and this 46 type of defense system he has to be almost a smartest man on the field the middle linebacker in the free safety which is Tinker Decker they're the ones calling the plays they're directive directing traffic blue and it aligned and that's a pile up folks to the for curry again in on the tackle curry is the first Bearcat with four straight 100 tackles season I mean that's just incredible he stayed healthy for one but a 6footer 240 pounds on a Pontiac he is something else and he shared the team MVPs with his linebacker mate Brad Jackson the two of them make a very formidable pair of line back there's not only in Conference USA but the nation's blue breaks it touchdown when Melvin blew the last five games 82 carries nearly 500 yards and now seven touchdowns blue has done a fabulous job in that backfield helping out to Mario Brown during some injury time well and to Mario Brown we've seen running all day turning those legs blue does the same thing on this touchdown run he's hit the line doesn't stop his legs and breaks it to the outside and almost walks into the end zone a nice Drive by Utah State even though I think Cincinnati backed off on their covers a little bit they still did a nice job getting down and sticking it in the end zone Vaughn could not connect on the extra point so it's 35 13 you see it's gonna be a mosh pit right in the middle of the field here he says ok it's not happening here look at he keeps the legs going keeps him going to break to the outside arm tackling going on by Cincinnati and he walks in for the easy score there's Melvin blue had nine rushing touchdowns during the regular season ESPN continues its bowl week coverage the Alamo Bowl tomorrow at 8 o'clock 24th ranked Oklahoma State and doubles red quarterback Tony Lindsay tackles 16th ranked Purdue in the Big Ten's best aerial combo and Billy dickin and Brian Alford Bowl week continues tomorrow at Melvin Blue getting a little congratulations on the sidelines he ranks in the top 10 in the Big West Conference in four different categories of versatile versatile player is high at 224 yard hog foot against Idaho so he can run I mean they have some running backs to mix in with the passing game but it just has not been clicking for Utah State today no Dave our saline Ian who will take over as the head coach after today's game for John L Smith you get de Mario Brown back next year along with Melvin blue and tomorrow Johnson who's a freshman running back he got a pretty good threesome bathroom in the backfield flags are down Don McKnight the return man to the 21 but a flag is down at the 30 yard line and I'm what you said you wonder if they stay a passing team even though the Big West is a passing conference math sock he he graduates the freshman red shirt of Brian Benza will take over next year but they do have a nice stable of running backs that this may turn into more of a running team and Brian Benza as you mentioned the redshirt freshman good athlete he has a lot of potentially 10yard penalty first out and of course an option quarterback in high school a reminder once again the Alamo Bowl 24th ranked Oklahoma State the Cowboys taking on the Boilermakers uh Purdue ranked 16th in the country as tomorrow eight Eastern five Pacific on ESPN the bullets about Purdue yeah what uh what a shock they had this year good for them unfortunately I was in Notre Dame they took us to task a couple of times Joe tiller the former cowboy head coach of Wyoming doing a fine job rebuilding saw pepper the old coach there down at LSU now they're there coordinator was actually writing down the defensive schemes he

experiment that Cincinnati came into the game with the two freshmen Deonte Kenner playing quarterback Chad Plummer going to receiver and it's been very very successful today so something I think

play at the humanitarian bowl ask you a little chilly it's good to have that fur hat on here in Boise Idaho 35:13 cincinnati jeb plumber has been outstanding as quarterback and wide receiver and you look at this snowcapped foothills right here by the way yeah and over here those are the ruts you left trying to ski yesterday yeah I wasn't on my skis a whole lot I know you we're not backside a little bit and yes the turf is blue the only blue turf and college football as number 86 with the reception Roderick Monroe the tight end party made the tackle areas number 3 for Utah State and like you looked through three quarters the biggest stat jumping right out at you at the time absolutely yeah cuz Utah State is starting to catch up and first down in total yards but a couple of things almost done over double and time of possession and three turnovers Utah State has had has resulted in 14 points for Cincinnati maybe the biggest dad of all when Cincinnati leads after three quarters of five and ohm not much Rosslyn for the second time does the old swim move comes down and shoots the gap and gets the sack we talked about the matchup with fen Crossland the allconference and what he does he's going to make a move right inside he's on Jason Fubini who outweighs and by 30 pounds he said well you know what you're bigger than me it could take me on head up I'm going to come inside and that's a smart move because Jason Fabini the 67 322 pounder for Cincinnati has been having a good day gets Ben cross him to see he's 277 pounds so he's given up a good 40 50 pounds also had a beautiful year near Defensive Player of the Year in the Big West but he's been quiet today a few tackles and it seems to do it when he's slanting and moving more than just going straight ahead also a third team allamerica Kiner back in throws out Chad Plummer falls incomplete decoe was on coverage Crosland has made a name for himself in Aggie blue but maybe the biggest name ever to wear Utah State Aggies blue there he is Merlin Olsen 59 61 the Outland Trophy winner of course since things grown a few hairs on that face they got a cue card players Louie a gr from the cheese Kevin Alexander from the Giants Greg Cragen Carolina Panthers in rich khillski the Jacksonville Jaguars four players right now from Utah State that are in the pros Alexander fine wide receiver a gr we've got pretty good foot for Kansas City it sure does take it on the Broncos in Kansas City this weekend Jenner the freshman stands fires rainbow up top Oh diving catch incomplete the intended receiver and he was stretched to the limit was Jason Collins Baker the freshman white out from Detroit a tough throw for the freshman quarterback he was trying to drop that one in no need to put this on a rope this is a touch pass you see a nice little loft on the ball watch it take off and it's just out of the reach of Jason Collins Baker pretty nice touch so just a little long Doug Johnson back at his own fiveyard line Utah State you'd had five field position after this punch Steve Smith at his own 37 high snap Aggies get a break it's Britt passing 40 for the freshman linebacker 10yard return for the touchdown and never had a chance to punt that ball you saw quick little adjustments right it right before the snap for Utah State front a couple more guys up to the line confused the Cincinnati blocking team got two never a chance to get that one off now what was turning out to be a blowout now with 1302 to go interesting ballgame beginning beginning to develop here at the humanitarian Bowl and they're gonna go for two down 35 19 that you connect to here it's a two touchdown game soft going the other way put two on the pole McBride balls it down 35:21 with 1302 to play we have a little discussion here with the referees first nice play though to bring it within two touchdowns if it stands they have ourselves a little bit of a ball game here now you know after what I saw over the weekend with the Giants it's not over till it's over all zeros on that scoreboard Vikings were just credible incredible comeback almost look like they were trying to give the way a game give the game away at first Chuck McFerrin will give us a call on the play there was illegal touching by the offense that's lost down no good on the fire still burns in John L Smith well he is hot you have to control himself he didn't pick up the flag that could hurt him a little here they're still within a couple of touchdowns if they can convert a twopoint conversion illegal touching we'll take a look at that to see what that's a call you don't see much well you know what it might have been McBride may have been on the line of scrimmage like a tight end meaning but at the end of the line not being eligible receiver take a look at the block part well really wasn't even if you never really had a chance it comes from the outside and you see Johnson never really has a chance he pulls it down because he knows it's going to get blocked reject his smart move if he could have just sidestep but he loses the ball altogether past he picks it up and goes to EZ ten yards you've never had a chance to punt the ball again Johnson really did the right thing by pulling it down but then he lost control of the ball and says thank you very much we'll make this a twotouchdown game John Dale cardi brought the the pressure to cause the fumble and the steam is still rising off the neck John L Smith well I think McBride was lined up on the line and not in an eligible receiver position that's what I think happened there because they try to a weird kind of an offensive set because the whole play started one way and then went back up there was a throwback to McBride I think he was an eligible receiver on that as soon as he catches it it is illegal touching Brad font hasn't eat up good strong hip at the goal line is Hawkins Hakan friends it nearside tackled down at the 19 yard line la ESPN continues as Bowl week covers tonight make sure you tune in to the Holiday Bowl watch champion Colorado State taking on now the surprising Tigers of Missouri Tigers ranked 20th to the country Colorado State number 17 ESPN suited in for all the bull week excitement what an exciting team Missouri pretty remembers that game against Nebraska when they lose it with the kick in the end of wow that was that was an incredible game when Sonny Lubich has done fabulous things with the Rams at Colorado State while mother quarterback nothing fancy the Amato we have called his name we're going into double digits easily for Tony D'Amato Robert Cooper running back he is may have made a lot of plays and of course your middle linebacker should be the leading tackler again we talked about John Dale Carter at free safety making too many but the model 124 on the Year sixfoot 240 he's just he's at the fireplug that can actually move and he can really really fill a hole guac runny going up on the 12minute mark second and nine one of the pitch all done by people did not turn the corner good downline pursuit led by Bashir love Easton and overseen we've seen a little excitement by Utah State we haven't seen it the whole game this is great pursuit again just flowing down the line flowing down the line giving them nowhere to run a good job by Levingston coming up and fill it first decode keeps up the lead block and Livingston is right there to make the play yeah Bashar live in some second team allbig West let's go downstairs and Holly first time in the game that I have seen energy on the Utah State sideline all of the players are standing out score we're going for two so finally some energy from the long time coming today Jenner dumps it over the middle complete and a first down for Cincinnati after the fine run by Cornelius Bonner Frank Miller brought him down nice play the linebackers just cleared out of there way too fast and left the right right behind the line look at how quick the linebackers are going to get out of there 46 and they're all they're all out of there he's blitzing they're gone there's nobody there Kenner sees that said okay he has learned very well throw where they're coming from he sees the Blitz he sees where they're coming from he knows he's going to get a receiver to go that way he puts it right where they were 13 yard pickup now Kenner look at that 10 of 15 125 yards and a touchdown to Bonner I think we convene we experiment a success at this point we first plummet gonna float back Angie's trying to read it defensively plumbers got good speed guns and complete a little trickery in Utah State didn't bite Utah state's doing a good job now of staying home keeping good pursuit and staying across the board not giving it we saw a lot of big holes I mean that defense early in the game that cincinnati was exploiting right now they're all hold their positions really really well I wonder if you wanted to throw back to Kenner on them I think he did a lot of times you'll see that that that reversed and then the quarterback comes out for the swing pass now when he stood and looked there were three blue jerseys looking at him 11:27 to play now timeout on the field Utah state's gonna call timeout there first of this half 11 27 to go down the stretch we'll be back boy see a quiet western city oh never a dull moment oh no not an offer for another credit

hmm I'm not some credit for my good idea National Car Rental Bowie continues as Clemson battles our bird in the chickfila Peach Bowl cleansing Auburn Friday at 3:00 on ESPN L Chet Plummer has shown the nation Cincinnati Mike Golic in good hands was number four good hands good feet good everything here you see the option almost too easy his linemen could have got through that mole he does it with his legs and he doesn't with his hands here the I take enters a quarterback does a nice job get home over the middle and here is the freshman on a little swing pass to Orlando Smith who does the rest again the experiment Deon take Kenny Kenner has come in at quarterback Chad Plummer has gone to wide receiver that has happened almost and at times every other plane it's been very successful they have not missed to be 35 in the 19 with 11 27 to go Plummer under center their cats gonna stay on the ground chew some clock Robert Cooper the sophomore tackled by Lindsey hassel great story on Lindsey hassel number 51 of Utah State played a Dixie Junior College transferred up to Utah State walked on right and then coach John L Smith saw me practice I think of the spring game he ran and had five sacks it who was this guy yeah that's how you get scholarships ends up get ends up getting six starts on the year nice job there and you're gonna see Cincinnati you take a look at hassle Cincinnati will try and burn some of the clock now 63 tackles on the season came into seven sacks oh yeah that's that's what the scholarship sure is tuck and run plumber not much good read by Utah State to the 41 that's going to bring up a fourth down and the tackle was made by so phone yeah first time we called Rover back another linebacker really a second team pick all Big West number 58 he did a nice job of staying home that was a quarterback draw all the way it's a phone you stayed home and made a good job of making the tackle on plumber who's been very very elusive today for Utah State is a chance for Stevie Smith to break loose ranked third in the country and punt returns myth of the 21 Smith at the 30 and is tackled at the 33 yard line 40yard kicked 12 yard return John L Smith his final game today sad to go yes but the futures ahead well I think we're gonna be excited I think once it's over it's gonna hit everybody you know I think the night before tonight is going to be as toughest and there is because we we get together we do some things in the evenings some tradition things and I think that's going to be the saddest part for me there's gonna be some tears shed but again it's it's like we talked about that and that's what football team yeah sometimes there's up sometimes with them to get up and get going talking to John L Smith yesterday and yet some misty eyes at times he has taken some criticism he has felt the pains of believing this you know he said Steve Smith one of his favorite guys he's like working much with his quarterback in soft and on coaches say well you'd move on it's it's a career move yeah the money's better yes yeah but you know we start to see it more and more coaches leaving and we talked about this you know what about the player that was recruited by that coach in that system you know maybe should they be allowed to go somewhere else and not lose a year of eligibility I thought it was a pretty good idea we may open up Pandora's box a little bit but the idea is tops pretty good sock with the toss to Mario Hannah Lawson and again is just elusive slips sliding to the 40yard line and when John L Smith makes his move to Louisville they've already made really the move he's taking six coaches with it yeah here you go you see all the coaches that are go with him virtually the whole staff is being gutted new systems to learn next year and we talked especially to Bob Petrino the offensive coordinator and he said you know it was tough at first you know there was some resentment from the players and then of course there's some maybe well you know what I don't have to listen to this coach anymore he's not going to be there I think it's getting it's a very very tough transition third Gantt showing blitz on third down five soft reads it up top incomplete over the shoulder Nakia Jenkins but the ball was thrown out of bounds and that brings up a fourth down tinker Keck playing some good defense forcing forcing the Nakia Jenkins of the sideline almost like a basketball move kind of boxing out forcing them to the sideline to where the ball is only catchable out of bounds this is it this is a tough area here in the 40yard line fourth and five you know there's eight minutes to go but you almost wonder if Utah State maybe should have tried this one to go for would have been a big chance but you know they're down 16 Big Bounce tech takes it up to 21 and is swarmed under at the moment he touched the football so that stops the clock 8:28 to play in the humanitarian Bowl and Cincinnati heading down the

see little Joe and the work no driving I was given directions that's a dangerous combo Orlando knocked out of bounds at the 30 yard line Tony D'Amato once again making the tackle that's 18 stops on the day got a player down no I think it's actually a coach or a cameraman her summer behind the bench there he caught the full brunt of 245 pounds of Orlando Smith and that person is not getting up too quickly now let's hope he's okay ESPN continues its all week coverage Wednesday 3:30 when Lee Roberts leads 22nd ranked Southern Miss in a delivery Bowl to take on Pittsburgh who counters with 30 touchdown pastor Pete Gonzales Bowl week rolls on only on ESPN Pittsburgh showing a nice improvement this year and I guess we have to call the Pittsburgh now they're no longer it's not Pitt it's for Fitz Berg the nice little like Halleck type of writing across their Jersey I think we have a civilian down behind the bench there Rolando Smith got bumped right at the out of out of bounds mark and he still had a head of steam going let's see if we get some information from Holly roll it's the gentleman that holds the down box that that let's know what dot what box it is his right knee is injured they're examining it right now but he isn't a lot of pain it doesn't look like he will be coming back to hold that down marker all right Thank You Holly I'd say the sidelines is a very dangerous place to be you know you have to be heads off yeah you got off two always two minutes today Jed Plummer the quarterback Orlando Smith breaking through a tackle and got the shoelaces down at the 45 yard line good tackle by John Delk Artie another name we've called a lot today and again you know when you're running that's not a good thing for your free safety but John Dale card is showing you is a very very sure tackler one hundred and ten tackles this year he does a nice job of keeping his body in front of the the runners and the receivers and hanging on one of the team captains for John L Smith and the Utah State Aggies only a junior out of Miami also has six interceptions which is 10th in the nation eight minutes to go fourthquarter 35:19 Cincinnati and they're just taking their time running it the play clock down to five now for the bruise the Aggies if they can with the run game Landon Smith the fullback decoe and Vaughn Harrison team up to make the tackle mallets road grader left rope Gator right the plays are very easy to call now in the huddle you see a Utah State the Aggies are stepping up trying to get right in the gaps trying to make some penetration for that line of Cincinnati is just doing a great job to see the linebacker stepping up a for Utah State trying to get that quick penetration from the eye second down six a couple to the Aggie 48 and again Tony D'Amato who's gonna end up that's his 19th tackle and that's just tied his careerhigh he had 19 tackles against Oregon State and that's the multi he has had and he will surely go past that in a bowl game though that doesn't count for season stats but then again this is the first humanitarian Bowl so he will definitely have the tackle record for this bowl there's no doubt about that he has been he has been one of the few bright spots for Utah State today until that record will stand for a while let me tell you that 19 tackles total yards Cincinnati nearing the 400 mark Utah State of 286 again Doron in a nice tackle to trip up number 33 Robert Cooper and cellphone yeah but they get enough for the first down they move the chains they keep the clock running after the chains are set it'll get started again the 619 there it goes Utah State just has two more timeouts to use you can use them judiciously very good somebody wrote it down Plummer again working the play clock down to four now three this is nothing fancy folks land and sniff the fullback picks up a couple and the clock will continue to run good look at Rick Minter fourth season at Cincinnati told us yesterday nup not done still and still I'm on track but not exactly where we want to be and this is his third straight winning season that hasn't been done since 1974 through 76 and it is a contract year for me it is up this year and I'm sure he will be treated very well and come back and I'm sure to keep this staff together this Bearcat team looks to make a nice run over the next few years we have a good head man in which minute and Cincinnati ended the longest bolas drought in division 1 football 47 years as they make up their appearance today Orlando Smith may be a yard to the 37 let's check back in with Holly roll guys we've got to say something about left tackle Jason Fubini for Cincinnati he's had a big day today but an even bigger week on Christmas Eve his wife Joanne gave birth to a baby boy Jason hunter 6 pounds 1 ounce ironically the baby was 3 weeks early but Jason the dad says it worked out great because he was coming out here to the ball game he goes straight from here to the eastwest Shrine Bowl and then the Senior Bowl so he feels very grateful that he was able to witness the birth of his child get in all this hectic football stuff at the same time a 6pounder huh I'd say a Fubini dad 67 322 we'll see what the Sun will turn out to be huh plumber on the option 5 to seem stiff arms turns the corner could go bumped out of bounds at the 20 by Bashar Livingston and Livingston comes up hobbling Plummer continues his big day for Phoenix you imagine the size of him holding that child whose eyes are that fit in his hand get a good look at Chad plumber coming back again next year again he'll be a quarterback he'll be wide receiver he's 230 now and I talked to him yesterday he can gain some weight 24250 and in the AFC West and the NFL you have you know the Dudley the Shannon Sharpe Hopson these guys are all like 240 250 more possession Tigers and receiving tight ends he could do that or keep his weight where it is maybe drop a little bit and play wide receiver he knows if his future is in the NFL it'll be a one of those two positions another first down for Cincinnati Plummer hands it off Cooper and the big blue swarm led by hassel knocks him down no gain on the play you look at a plumber he's got very much like a sharp yep looks a little bit like John Stallworth back in the old Pittsburgh Steeler days he is a goodlooking athlete runs well he's got those long strides and again you know a 230 pounder as a wide receiver you know he'll go over the middle as you see all his numbers today 61 passing with the TD 49 rushing at 64 receiving that is a nice afternoon of work 3:45 to go plumber 5 the scene and he is still working hard the whistle had blown the ball dead the ball popped loose Jeremy Hunt loveless made the big hit on Plummer brings it down to the 16 yard line so the Aggies call another timeout one remaining and we'll take a break 326 to go here the humanitarian Bowl the Bearcats lead 3519 can your radio doing this only one radio can

sports good look at Rick mentor in his fourth season he has taken huge steps with this program but he doesn't want this to be the last there's plenty more to come we just have to use this as a platform and as a as a sounding board to say he took a look at us here whether you be a recruit whether you be our fans and say this is what we're capable of doing it's not the end it's not it's just part of the journey along the way everything has to start somewhere and we ended a forty seven year drought but we don't want to start a new drought next year yep the 47 year drought is over the next step is to make bowl appearances year after year and the Conference USA is gonna I tell you in a short period of time they have really begun to to get some attention around the country another team in that conference USA Southern Miss playing in the Liberty Bowl this current drive here for Cincinnati that was their 11th play all running plays and they are showcasing themselves very well for some of the kids around the country you know looking at colleges hey Cincinnati upandcomer humpin coming team you know opportunities to play you know like the style of what they do running and passing this is like this is a one of the best recruiting techniques you could have is success in a bowl game play clock down to two and hit in the hole and hit it hard Robert Cooper the sophomore deal Tony D'Amato how about twenty twenty tackles on the day and I'd say mentor has got to feel good fortyseven year drought 1950 the Sun Bowl last time the Bearcats made a bowl appearance and interesting story about that as they said the first official ball game of the Rose Bowl of 1902 but the former Cincinnati letteth directors ghost Roberts said he has a manuscript that says in 1897 southern Athletic Club in New Orleans invited Cincinnati to come down to a postseason game on New Year's Day to New Orleans so 14 members of Cincinnati and the coaching staff went to New Orleans and defeated southern Athletic Club's 16 to nothing in a postseason game and at the victory party that night Louisiana State was there and they challenged Cincinnati's who came they played again the next day and beat Louisiana State 28 to nothing so they think they were actually at a postseason ball before even the Rose Bowl was officially credited with the first bowl game but they say I've got a football you come over and play me up Steve Smith from saw big gainer up Steve Smith from saw big gainer to the 37 and the Aggies refused to quit Brayboy made the tackle taught 227 as they stopped the clock to reset the chains again this is the type of offense we expected to see from the gun but as Holly Rowe pointed out on the sidelines you know in the beginning of the game and then later on there was no emotion at first now later in the game they started to get fired up and again with just 223 to go it may be too little too late 25 yard pickup he's swinging out that the Mario Brown dropped it a little behind him poor son in tendency would be Mike is I want to catch the ball I got to catch it before he can run but that ball was a little behind his left hip yeah it wasn't and he was going nowhere if he caught it anyway there were three Bearcats right there they have to go downfield earlier in the game when sock was sore a lot of incomplete balls I said hey throw some short ones get some confidence he's hit some down the field you're down you know 16 points with 218 to go you've got to make the throws downfield swing passes aren't going to do it now second down 10 three wide receivers set to the far side the Mario Brown out gonna reverse it Cody Smith oh what a block flown by sock and a bound go Steve Smith but what give a game ball to sock you see that well I tell you what quarterback threw his head in there I mean that that broke it didn't get as much yards as you'd like to see a reverse game but it came more because of Matt sock block and I tell you what it luckily Cincinnati doesn't have to really watch films on this because did you get knocked down by the quarterback you really get mocked on offense brings up a third down and five again they set up trips to the far side alone background chants coming with the Blitz soft frozen picked off its tinker down to the 45 Brad Jackson pardon me Brad Jackson that was a nice interception he looked like he almost took it away the ball was a little behind and throwing very hard Jackson did a nice job hanging out of the ball is going to come in from the lust meter screen they run a flit so Jackson's in man coverage the ball is behind him the Kia Jenkins hadn't even turned around it went over his right shoulder behind him Brad Jackson does a very athletic move for the catch look at the ball behind him Jackson hangs on and then the ability to break that tackle and running gained a few yards big big play for a third team allamerica selection by Sporting News and football America Brad Jackson a senior out of Akron Ohio first interception of the season Plummer at quarterback I'd like a broken play he's gonna swing it out chase from behind and Plummer steps down at the 45 yard line that stops the clock with 153 to play you know go back to Brad Jackson he's 62 to 28 he's a senior here's a guy at the next level might be a tweener not really big enough for linebacker and maybe too big for DB but it's starting to kind of go that way in the NFL the Dexter Koch leaves you know shorter and lighter that have made it in the NFL so you know Jackson may get a shot that way but he he may be too small for a linebacker too big for a defensive back who went to punt right between usually Gatorade somewhere they make that pile of I have a feeling Rick mentor may get a shower from the eye and off goes off to Cooper not much lost a yard back to the 46 feel of brought him down tonight's job since today now has all backup offensive lineman and everybody's getting a shot to play in this game what you like to see in bowl games you know couple stories of the game has been time of possession since today's really held the ball a long time for turnovers for Utah State just one for Cincinnati and those turnovers to turn into 14 points for the Bearcats and right now it's a 16point game so turnovers again a big difference in a ball game Utah State you know give him credit they've done a nice job fighting back since halftime and to Mario Brown standing up in the locker room and saying guys it's on us you know John L Smith the coach who's leaving said hey the players you have to take over there is a timeout with 143 to go we'll take a break come back for the final minute 43 don't go away we wanted to leave a better world for our kids we're sure leaving a different one but they understand it better than I ever could

never knew it was coming you've gotta wonder with all the Clarke again oh they got him good good set up see the other offensive line we're out in front of them kind of talking to him set them up

now the hugs are coming big win for this program again three winning seasons in a row first time in 23 years that's happened first bowl game in 47 years this program really really on the upswing Bearcats are looking at fourth and 16 Steve Smith will get one more shot at it Doug Johnson back to punt we've got a very deliberate approach to the ball Smith with a fair catch at the 21 yard line for that last play time of possession Cincinnati 41 minutes and 20 seconds Utah State 16 minutes Holly Rowe what's up guys the big interception last series by Brad Jackson I have to tell you a cute story about him he's been getting technicals well he's been playing basketball for the University of Cincinnati you see he's a big trash talker and it's okay to do on the football field with your helmet on but he's been getting caught when he's on the basketball court in a game last week they put him in on a defender they said don't let him get a shot off so he went up to his guy and said hey you and me it's bumping coverage all night buddy sock with the playaction prevent defense by Cincinnati over the middle all what a catch what a catch fight the tight end that was on the Moony one gun to Moony on a Dixie Junior College of Junior Monterey California home and he shot he caught that a ride around the ankles well that was nice you don't normally see tight ends that far downfield especially ones away 266 pounds but referees are conferring you know the same thing the same thing happened again they're saying to Mooney was an ineligible receiver does the set up they have he is on the line and he's an ineligible receiver but the catch is definitely worth another look look at him go down low to his ankles and make this one outstretched all hands that's the way to catch a ball with your hands you mentioned his weight at 266 able to get down the field and make a nice grab but all for not see the happy Cincinnati players on the sidelines they have a long flight back the flight is all that much more joyous after the wind 37 ticks remain now the official step in that's twice Utah State got called for that something in their alignment that time it was the tight end on the twopoint conversion it was a wide receiver London McBride lined up like a tight end illegally both times they want to put more time back on the game clock there's 36 seconds remain it's been a tough afternoon for that man he's come on late in the game Cincinnati playing off a little bit on some of the completions halftime he was four out of 15 and Utah State had dug themselves in such a big hole at 21 enough and very very tough to come back from that they've made a valiant effort they've come out with a lot more fire and passion in the second half to pull it to within 16 but as you see with 36 seconds left it's not gonna happen today now the clock runs 8 on the play clock 32 on the game clock okay they wind it down they stop it again 27 seconds Jim coin 25 years of officiating retiring his last one remember to last one you always wanna gonna have and help you she'll do it we'll get caught up in the pile in the middle soft glowing deep pink complete the intended receiver the Kia Jenkins dun McKnight back up corner in on the coverage that stops the clock with 14 ticks and a flag is down yeah we got a little frustration going out on the part of the Aggies mixing it up and Cincinnati coming back either be offsetting or they'll get the person who threw the second punch no doubt it's got to be frustrating for Utah State one of the linemen on the blocking grab the facemask and it was even after the play when it happened it's and then that's out of frustration been a tough long day for the Aggies of Utah State a very happy day for this team 14 seconds remain they're gonna back the ball up now inside the 10 at the 8 yard line John L Smith his final seconds as an Aggie head coach he took the Louisville job back on November 24th just before Thanksgiving he's been back and forth recruiting for the Cardinals and then honestly back to Utah State trying to prepare for this football game we measured this afternoon he'll officially have the reins over to Dave on solanum a former college roommate who think voting a Weber State for the past nine years long ball incomplete two deep stops o'clock six ticks remain don't forget bull week coverage continues tonight

the game in Cincinnati humanitarian Bowl champions great game plan by Cincinnati a great test with Deonte Kenna the freshman quarterback coming in and throwing the ball and Chad Plummer the normal option quarterback going to wide receiver a definite success if you look at the plumber in the day he had and that will I don't think without a doubt be part of their package next year Mike talk about what the bowl game will do for both programs obviously obviously it's big recruiting Cincinnati will get the plum Utah State seen nationally some kids will know that as well let's go downstairs Holly Rowe but come in or you didn't want to just show up and win this game you're using this is a platform to keep building the program how do you feel after this win well I'll tell you what my hats off to
