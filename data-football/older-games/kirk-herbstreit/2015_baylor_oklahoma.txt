============================================================

paralyzed and rising again she died Monday the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC the new horseshoe when the banks of the process blacked out tonight as the unbeaten Baylor Bears July with Oklahoma Saturday Football on ABC fours nmi Walmart energized McClendon Stadium two playoff contenders with two options victory or virtual elimination buckle up for a wild one in Waco tonight we expect high tempo high scoring and of course I think Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit ready partner kaizuka business is going to be blasting off the starting line at about 13 minutes from now high stakes because Baylor sit in number six in the selection committee rankings they feel little disrespected misunderstood by the committee the schedule so far it's been pretty weak but this stretch run is very very demanding and our brows believes if they win out they are in but Oklahoma thinks they're on the hunt too if they went out Oklahoma is a team that's looking at Redemption probably more than anything else especially against Baylor I don't think they're worried necessarily at this point about their resume be you're right about Baylor I think Baylor is a team that was frustrated a year ago with the committee and now they're looking at their season and everything is in front of them they feel they can win out they're going to have a very strong case but tonight is that first real big hurdle against Bob Stoops in the Sooners soups calls our trials a genius you use that word describing the offense the Bears play faster anybody score more than anybody gain more yards than anybody and they are surrounded by playmaker and I think they stress you as a defense more than anybody and it's because it starts really with their formations we'll talk throughout the broadcast how they do that but they'll they'll stretch you from sideline to sideline literally and they make you basically make a choice on what you want to try to stop they're very confident Rocklin would as an offense they're going over 300 yards a game on the ground and if you get too concerned about what they can do in their running game going to find oneonone matchup to look for Coleman on the outside to try to create favorable matchups this is an offense you've heard Bob and Mike Stoops talking about all week it's all about stopping oneonone matchup so George Stidham is a true freshman he's going to make his second start he looks great in his first one against Kansas State in Manhattan different deal tonight athletically against his Oklahoma defense just turn 19 but he is very confident they have full belief in him Oklahoma dominated better for two decades they've lost three out of the last four the last two have been really embarrassing and you use the perfect word stressful that's how they feel on the defensive side dealing with these bears yeah and I think what's interesting with Mike Stoops is the defensive coordinator and with Bob is the head coach every change that they've tried to make is about tonight defending this offense it is because of the last couple years they've given up 41 and then last year 48 when they couldn't stop them from throwing the football they feel that they're better in the perimeter they feel that their secondary matches up much more favorably because of the athletic ability that they have on the edge and you're going to be seeing it can this secondary led by Zach Sanchez right there number 15 in the middle who's missed the last couple games with an ankle can they hold up against Corey Coleman and the Bears fleetfooted receivers they better save their energy they're jumping around but it takes a lot physically and mentally to face this offense it's going to be a lot of fun in the big 12 conference in the next three weeks it begins in a few minutes here in Baylor and we'll see if Oakland we can get that Redemption they so desperately need as their freshman class the Baylor line ready to form that cumin tunnel from which the Bears will take the field Baylor and Oklahoma on the banks of the browses tonight with a playoff spot in limbo everyone's worried how's it gonna look about stuff Russell the true freshman did not struggle Oklahoma's a huge opportunity the game that will have significant implications of a big 12 grain hay baler welcome to November now's time to really play some football cows before you say and crazy cousin big hair crazy place Wow is trouble with the ball on the game you believe what you just worth down at 25 you get a fire to the sideline sky the first down and get a lateral as back balls on the ground picked up by college alex has got rue still alive 23 seconds left unbelievable coldly upstairs work craziness today and as the bear is make their entrance with the fog and the flames and the fireworks surely the potential for another playoff chase taping game tonight Bob sits in its 17th year used to own the Baylor Bears but not in recent years rifting so much cook soup with so much riding on this game how have you helped your players understand what that they can't still play like they have nothing to lose well they just have to play within yourself we practice guard do what we do we don't need anything other than what we're capable of and the third excited about it hopefully we can play well coast from point production to scheme to tempo Baylor does present some challenges what's the key defensively to stopping their attacks got to be great against a run game and then you gotta challenge them and make plays downfield let's get to it thanks coach Chris Sooners underdogs for the first time in the last 22 games Art Briles meanwhile still feels like they owe Oklahoma a lot of payback for those years and trials never lost in this stadium their kendo McLean Stadium and they have a long home winning streak as well 20 in a row going back to October of 2012 Kirk for so long this was Oklahoma romping and then Baylor began to turn it that 2011 Robert Griffin touchdown pass here they won three out of the last four we said the last two have been lopsided has been completely lopsided Oklahoma does not forget about that and Baylor wants to remind them again so there's a lot on the table here for both of these teams the sauce typically they might defer not against Baylor they want the football they want to avoid falling behind which everybody seems to do against this quick scoring Baylor team Spencer Evans to put it away for the Bears it will bounce into the endzone so Baker may feel the junior from just down the road and Austin who beat out Trevor Knight with a starting job because he's been taking care of the football you recall at Texas Tech it was a good freshman didn't get an offer sat out here a year ago Curt but he's been very sharp so far well he is provided energy to this offense they've got a new offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley comes over from each Carolina this was the side of the ball as much as we want to talk about how does Oklahoma stop Baylor Bob Stoops made some adjustments on this side of the ball and Baker Mayfield is the straw that mixes the drink you know about the running game with samavyapti ride tonight they've got to make some big plays in the passing game with Mayfield in his receivers Vick near on a 230 pounder approaching a thousand rushing yards this season you've got in the first day and muscle for about four Kirk let's check out particularly impact players Oklahoma has a lot of playmakers they're going to go tempo here just like Baylor will here on in the backfield alone with Joe Mixon sterling Shepherd number three if they get him isolated one on one he's got to make big plays you'll see Shawn open number two getting pressure and big Andrew Billings in the middle got to hold up against Iran in the Sooners run game second and seven Mayfield it's safe to go down sat on the flip and rebuilding is combining with Shawn Oakman they get pressure off to the right and it's a matchup you're going to see Baylor hope to be able to exploit and he's a true freshman going up against your ball Palmer of seniors gruesome me Samia who is moved into the starting lineup after detective Dame he's done well remember a true freshman is this atmosphere on the edge to that offense the line against the senior at the top talents go mixed in the very Frick freshman back to the right of main field on third and 12 buried so pressure again and bring it green Westbrook trying to escape breaks a couple tackles very near the line to make go spot and I believe just short good effort but it's four down you're going to see a lot of pressure Bill Bennett's the defensive coordinator from Baylor believes in pressure especially if he gets you to third down and that's exactly what they did creating a little confusion on that first series for us Bill Bennett is attacking the true freshman drew Samia the right tackle with pressure Austin Seibert through pressure for the best punters in the country so far and this is a good boot you know fair catch made at the 20yard line the nut Kirk we're going to see Jared Stidham and his Baylor offense and scored a touchdown every first possession that only seemed to do it true freshmen you can see a great dual threat quarterback but in this office really more of a thrower especially with the injury already to set Russell and he's got command in this office remember he was an early enrollee so he was in school in January went through winter conditioning went through spring football it's almost like when you get in early as a quarterback it's like a redshirt freshman but he is still a true freshman and he's the key tonight making good decisions and getting the ball out of his hands he's played in all eight games but of course the road game at Kansas State windy night hostile environment was his first start this is his first home start and he goes right away to the top receiver one of the best of the country Corey Coleman the Sooners Jordan Thomas right there and again that's that's the matchup the receivers oneonone against these Oklahoma defensive back there was an Achilles heel for the Sooners a year ago Corey Coleman number one is the goto man he's a guy that can make so many things happen now chuckling one has it creates Lynwood him in a secondary still our right to tackle son running some infield got Lynwood shut down at the 45 by Charles tapper but a huge play in this productive run game watch the left tackle Spencer Durango he follows him and he they were accelerating the second level this is what makes Lin was so good a stiff arm to that safety Thomas he goes for another 15 yards 34 yard gain get him Jace escape dumps it down and Lynwood is tackled at the line of scrimmage does a flag where the quarterback was it after he dumped the ball off Jordan Evans was tackling did he do it too late oh for sure Jordan Evans he'd buried Siddim just buried him well after the ball was strong personal foul roughing the passer he's been living 2302 the quarterback with the weight of the body Oh 15yard penalty first down Oklahoma's trying to send a message balls gone having he goes out of his way to elevate the quarterback and then bring his shoulder down then he's going to help him up yeah like you didn't know the ball was gone but Reggie script very descriptive in that he was sure was who's the ball to the 31 so Baylor threatening for just a few plays in a penalty Linwood knock down after a fouryard gain shock Linwood is a junior from Linden averaging 131 a game that's on pace to be the bailer record yeah it's incredible 130 and as a team think about this 309 yards a game on the ground now in the flat Linwood makes the catch knock down a couple yards short of the marker you get caught up with our trials and his formations in the way they throw and how fast they scored you think it's all about their passing game they pride themselves on physicality and being able to run the ball over 300 yards a game on the ground see it's not just trying to start stop Corey calling the receivers you got to be able to be physical at the point of attack on third down Linwood a physical waters wrestled down but he gets the first down easily he's the award am a tackle yes the level of competition is suspect but six point six for us to the seat yeah it'll be more of a challenge tonight but it's just the wood look at the formations look at the receivers look at the defensive back the line with the receivers so you basically form a little box there with the defenders inside trying to stop that run they haven't stopped then with yet that's a terrific first down gain of eight Evans on the tackle it's a numbers game for the quarterback Stidham and he's looking over the sideline he's always talking getting and getting a feel for what he needs to do but he's evaluating the defense and looking to see where they're committed to stop the Baylor offense Lee committing to the run he'll throw they committing to the pass they'll run Devon Chafin number 28 gives degrees of Linwood he's a physical back step forward it's Kirsten goal Baylor at the five Alexander on the stop but once again right out of the starting gate this bears often growing and we will talk a lot about Linwood but just talking about an offensive line has played a lot of football a lot of experience up front Jason walks into the end zone the Bears awesome are very quickly and wait go again eight plays 80 yards to thirty nine most of it on the ground all but in one yard of it in fact as a heck of an opening drive for Shaka Linwood and the offensive line of Baylor really asserting themselves and not just scoring a touchdown with sending a message when you run 465 of 60 50 yards on a drive to open up a game after all the buildup and this game you're sitting a message that is handled and the whole door cold Edmundston stumbles forward so a misfire on the extra point that's the first one they've missed in 62 tries this year so Baylor get to stop and then just overpowers Oklahoma's defense to jump in front six nothing as always our aerial coverage provided by Goodyear take off your drive with tires that return superior performance Goodyear more driven our official aerial provider on Saturday Night Football this blacked out night bears in the allblack uniforms off to their typical fast start nine for nine touchdowns in their opening possessions team an FBS to do it Alex Ross and John vixen deep to receive Evans kick the line drive it goes out of bounds so a penalty there and the Sooners will get good starting field position and after the opening bears drive some emergency all of a sudden for the super they're going to have to we talked earlier about Spencer Durango the leader up front with a great block here early in this game frees up chocolate look at that stiff arm right there and then he runs through the defensive back Jordan Thomas and here comes their angle again it's the same play what was interesting to me is Oklahoma committed one extra guy up to the line of scrimmage Smith the theory for my groups there's you've got one extra hat to stop the running game and then still move eight plays 80 yards and a majority of that on the ground with shot Linwood and now even though it's so early when you face an offense like this you better believe the opposing offense feel stressed not just the defense key back look here I'm and Mixon this is mixed in flipping if he makes the cut and he's brought down quickly Jamal Palmer came around from the end and it's an Oklahoma offense that made some adjustments after their Texas game in their last four games they have been much much better I have a good corner 95 yards the game on the ground rolls out has room fires nearside sterling Shepard makes the catch it's across the 40 suitors top receiver shows his hands but it's still third and three part of playing in this environment like any tough environment is you just have to weather the storm especially against the office that you're facing so getting a few first downs and getting some points very very important if Oklahoma wants to stay in this game early there's have been a good third down team 45% on the season now making a sauce he feels gross farside kept made Doron kneel at midfield houses sooner first down the heck of a Thrall a long pro but it shows you the confidence that they have in Baker Mayfield to be able to make that throat and Neal who last week had ten receptions now they're going to crank the tempo up themselves after that first down downfield shot from a field overgrown so important to connect when you have the chance the Westbrook was covered by two bears that done and it's avian Howard it's the corner that usually plays close to the boundary as experience has talent Oklahoma you got to like the call to just try to challenge the bear defense vertically sometimes even when you don't hit that it can open some things up underneath is to kind of remind the Baylor secondary that you're not afraid to take some shots Shepard is in a slot to the right of the formation there's rust floor may feel flush and not escape from us knocked down on the far sideline by KJ Smith the left end and the crowd didn't like it but a flag comes in as the emotions a baker may feel that the coaches like and at the same time they wanted to control it and you can see he's involved he's not going to be a quarterback that's just going to get back and go to the next play Lincoln Riley said he's matured in that area after the play personal foul oh they got Shawn Oakman what necessarily necessarily a vicious hit but it was just well out of bounds he pulls him down it was where he pulled him down that the penalty third Baker Mayfield again he's not going to back Oakland got a smile on his face sure the part of Bailey's part of their their approach to this game is especially live in a bowl you especially when you play it here in Waco Oakland 69 to 75 mm forever night out of the game last was going to the ground so the Sooners certainly remember that first down after the penalty Mayfield cannot escape ramp I'm sure bond Blanchard things are getting feisty early a helmet ripped off of Vila Casa Tommy the offensive lineman has got to come out he sure does what a great play here by Blanchard watch he's going to make this read right here he felt he was taking P Rhine so he decided to pull it and keep the ball and then he ride obviously carries out the fake Mayfield holds on to the ball and Blanchard make the play disguise that very well empty backfield on second 13 bears show pressure they jumped outside Stafford is corralled and hit for a loss there's our active up front Brian Nance from his end position will check the marker looked like they jumped off quickly honey Taylor young the linebacker was starting to cheat up may it jumped as well offside defense number one fiveyard penalty repeat second down Reggie Smith and his crew going to be busy tonight yeah this game has that feeling to it I want to go back to that Baker Mayfield where he's he's kind of going face to face over Sean open that kind of been hit what we have brought to this offense some energy so I kind of like to see him down from Baylor and stepping back up into their face a little bit they filled on second date looks at the P right in the flat gets a couple of blocks muscles in the 25yard line he told me that he felt he'd been sumo from early in the season games against Tennessee the loss to Texas use tongs that sort of harness that a little bit curve yeah Lincoln Riley's mentioned that as well how they fit crowd how he's grown and matured in that area they're in short pier I'm backers first down at the 15 and now the Sooners are in business in the red zone boy T Ryan one of the more physical backs in college football a year ago new offensive system with Lincoln Riley I think the last three or four weeks you start to see him and the passing game far side nowhere to run for a micaiah quick short game Sooners offensive lines start to settle in a little bit started to control that line of scrimmage on this five and helping Baker Mayfield especially here on we think that chances it to run the football offensive linemen lost pony taxes to the NFL and has starting it backward through freshmen on the right side ooh back look on second down and eight is mixing stutterstep dives down to the six looks like Nixon's having trouble with his traction in the early going it does a little bit but I I like to see mix it in P right in the backfield together because I think it keeps the defense offbalance and guessing a little bit they're both versatile enough that they can walk they can run they can catch keeps us Baylor defense on it here on on third and one flips again regained his balance and scores looked like he might go down behind the line but it's powerful back who has great balance in folklore my chance to take the lead we got it left hand down is why he had balance on that play I think it's a little flick from the rain that we're having here you're right right here he loses it gets the left hand down and then he runs over his own Center they're talking to him to get into the end zone put a big answer by the Sooners after the quick cut down by Taylor with their first series there was and Austin Seibert gives Oklahoma 76 lead 11 plays 65 yards in 348 and for the machi P Rhine is 11th rushing touchdown for the big 12 get ready touchdowns are coming out plenty more on aurilla Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart stop by

from Fort Hood Texas the 1st Cavalry Division band sitting in the sand so on with Baylor's golden wave band formed back in 1856 travel around the promote spirit Cavalry Oklahoma has the lead that drive in which they were aided by 20 yards and battle penalties first plaque to boot it away if you nicked oxen give it away and knocks it into the endzone the Cassidy Hubbert's with an update from the studio Chris Taco Bell's studio update to the big 10 LaShawn Daniels jr. capping off a drive that was 17 slaves to a 91 yards lasting eight and a half minutes Hawkeye is up 7nothing over Minnesota back to you guys Iowa ranked just one spot ahead of Baylor so the Bears fans will keep an eye on that one a very different style of football which was interesting to the committee to make their judgment we'll talk more about that as this story unfolds tonight so Baylor trailing now for just a 17 offensive snap this season only trailed for 435 on the clock just to not go down easily or Chaffin exceed because would look like much but it's about seven yards chippy on this side of the ball to Baylor has been able to really control things upfront it's almost as if they're trying to get Oklahoma locked into the run game to set up their big plays in a bat safe and again have a first down at the 36 ball comes out Sooners say they have it it's in scrum they drew turnover Oklahoma Jordan Evans knocked it loose Devante bond was just kind of standing there he thought the play was just about over he happen to be standing there he looks down and sees the ball I think he just jumped on top of it number 23 come in from the left here Sam he's just kind of standing there the ball pops down and he jumps on top of it before nearest lake nor can Sooners haven't forced to take away again Baylor since 2011 Burt play there Evans made this trip now many hitters diving in there they'll probably take another look or two with this just to confirm the call downstairs look so much from that angle but the ball came out before the backside Dibble fumbles is under further Illyria Don capper Luther big foam can't play official and turnovers in a game like this where possessions are so critical I mean you're talking about a lot of points they're going to be scored in this football game whoever wins that turnover margin is going to have a big big advantage obviously in any game but especially in a game like this before Chaffins back hits the ground you can see the ball come out it's it looks like your ends we have to look at yeah yeah those are the only two shots they have to peek at the hard I think to overturn that based on what we've seen so far they've desires our rules expert in the booth Dave if you were reviewing this what would you see well we go with stands for the very reasons you guys are describing very difficult see when the ball comes up but Chris you made a good point in that it looks like it starts moving before the back of the player hits the ground and it's going to stand Baylor has committed only ten turnovers coming in there plus 11 in that department a big part of their success after further review the ruling on the field of a fumble is confirmed for sound a huge play Mike Stoops defense sets up the offense now the baler 38 you're kidding our Browns about breaking serve and on how he uses that he uses that term and they really filled it that you know one or two possessions here there sometimes can be the difference in a game for a lot of points there's four let's see of Oklahoma takes advantage main field throws a dart across the middle and Sheppard makes a catch in a first down at the 25 yard line by great timing and because he rhymes running watch the linebackers bite up on Pierre on they bite up it creates a knifethrowing line and he throws the seed right behind the linebacker into sterling Shepherd and rhythm by Baker Mayfield where's Shepard motivated his missed the last seven corners against Baylor couldn't play last year was knocked out early in the game two years ago what he has two catches the right hit behind the line and dropped for a loss at failure defensive line FERS getting good penetration the big man and true Billings is finally healthy and he is motivated to play well now that his ankles recovered he walked into our meeting kind of look at us like I will give you a few minutes here but I got work to do I am ready to go that weekend he's six to 310 pounds and playing the way a lot of people expected into play the last week or so looks good tonight I'll feel good start they like that matchup that gets darlings and the Sooners Center don't they number 75 second and 11 may feel vixen shot in the endzone overthrown for Dede Westbrook with a flag that's come out in the holding zone here thrown right at the offensive line after the ball was was thrown I don't know if that was Mixon Joe Mixon got involved there that running back defender looked like it went up high to try to back the pass down yeah Nixon hit him after the play personal foul unnecessary roughness awesome number 78 is that for the block I mean yard penalty it second down that's a freshman making a big mistake it was after Nixon makes the block watch till Mixon a running back goes up makes the block and I watch 78 come down on top of it go get it yeah and it's second time we've seen Oklahoma making critical error as far as a little bit of too much for the extracurricular activity and that is in excused out twice q brain grant lose the ball back to the 41 but you got to be able to control your emotion that's what's frustrating Bob Stoops right there you want guys I'm done right you wanted to speed up everything in Alderson planner control third in 26 me feel escaped don't I still go and now not down at the 40 it's a whole lot of running to think about a yard and the Sooners may have squandered that take away well you appreciate his heart he's trying to keep this play alive but it this I think is what drives the coach is a little bit crazy when he does a little bit too much of that I mean this is early in the game it's live for the next play throw it away or try to find a receiver downfield but if there's nothing there the creativity at some point you've got to give up on cyber it's been very effective at knocking punch dead inside a 20 yard line and a fair catch is made by Auburn at the NA missed opportunity by Oklahoma and a big stop by that Baylor defense done now stepped Russell an athletic dual threat quarterback tough guy but made a decision to lower his head in three weeks ago against Iowa State and suffered a fractured neck so he has been an embrace he told us the other day that he's got to go through three more months before they can evaluate it see how that vertebra is healing the model teammate really hurts not to be a part of this team trying to support didn't Kirk in any way that he can solutely Baylor has been running the ball you almost feel like they're getting ready to start attacking through the air Lin whoa caught up in traffic and knocked down after a threeyard game coming into this drive averaging nine yards of carry and what happens when a team starts to run the football like that those linebackers and those safeties they're going to start cheating down in Lynnwood create some oneonone opportunities on the outside for Corey Coleman did on his three completions for four yards nobody takes more deep shot from Alex football than the Baylor Bears hit eight twenty yards completions last week in his first career start at Kansas State it is raining hard it's the pass again a little trickier they finally on cue take it Jack Coleman a leaping catch skating around almost came down with a circus catch Thomas was in coverage there it is you knew is coming I'm sure Bob Stoops and Mike Stoops knew it was coming oneonone matchup this is an area that really hurt Oklahoma they feel much more confident with Jordan Thomas now as a sophomore and Zach Sanchez number 15 on the other side at timings in good position and actually used his body to force home into the boundaries and third and seven a whistle before the snap Sooners were trying to get set up one defender there was some confusion they called my mouth their first timeout of the half those suits defense looking for another stop when you come back to Waco Katzie huh birth here let's take a look at who's getting it done presented by Wells Fargo Stanford trailing Oregon until Christian McCaffrey gets in for the touchdown the Heisman hopeful puts the cardinal back on top 1714 and they're in the red zone right now Chris Erbe back to you he has to be thank you Stoops furious he felt that he should not have had to spend the time out his defense really wasn't allowed to sub forget that Baylor had substituted so third and seven sit up in the pocket Coleman makes the catch first down accurate throw from this very gifted passer and that is a great job by Cory home and notice it's beat store good by people this time it gets zone just nips in the soft spot his own in a heckler throw by cinnamon Linwood caught up in traffic you've seen a lot of quarterbacks throw the ball this 19 year old kid when the ball comes out of his hand how many guys in Kasbah fall ever have you seen throw a prettier spiral I'm sure we could sit back and think of me Marcus Mariota comes to mind last year but not as a true freshman we're very rare to see a true freshman have the rotation and the spin on the ball the way of Statham does fiveyard get a roommate the Dixon you're Spencer Durango quick off the mark you can see we've got the clock in Baylor averaging about 16 17 seconds in the first half between plays and sometimes even the veteran gets caught up in the tempo makes them to say absolutely this rain is really picking up your hand we've already seen some of the players slipping around they're on record pace that they can play this fast rest of the season fit him there's a drop wet ball and a flag came out the quarterback was being projected Katie cannon on the drop is who drawing over there this Oklahoma secondary has heard it all not just all week they've heard it all offseason what this Baylor offense did to them last year in the year before they welcome the challenge we'll see how they answer the call tonight on the perimeter so far holding up well against Coleman and company personal foul shot clock often number 69 another 32 out there for the gold Franky's second down the Wynwood combining with pat.over the tackle is a little questionable to me look at the right tackle Colburn he has to be engaged there and this stage would be great to come in if the lineman is engaged and then he gets Submarine by another player that's where the Chop Bock comes into play it really looked like the defender had gone around coal dirt there and what wasn't even really instilling working with China deal with the tackle in the line in the office the brave back there chopped it second and 26 Lin would wrestle down for a short gain by Eric striker and this thing's going to get out of control there they're some hot tempers on both sides you're going to have to get control the emotions because if you don't they're just going to continue to motions will continue to escalate but Oklahoma's defense after a few mental mistakes by Baylor really pin their ears right now in attacking the line of scrimmage going on one play of 15 yards or longer tonight did a fix it downfield Joe little missed the ketchup and field this Jade Lee excuse me one of the receivers who's emerged in the last few games nice ball from Stidham yeah this is the inside receiver matched up against a safety and you can see even though he's got size at 6:32 20 he can run by you it's not just the outside receivers you got to worry about mantoman they attack the inside receivers against Nickelback's and safety 34 yard gain well loop it for Pullman nearside overthrown out of bounds hey what honest is going to battle : all night india thomas is a sophomore and he's being left on an island against one of the most explosive receivers in college football and right now he is not backing down and hold up just fine the rain was going to move out if it came it was going to arrive in the first half and then leave I think both quarterbacks would like to see that forecast come true it's tough II it's hard to tell on television but the rain is coming down hard the game's been going on right now substitute Oklahoma substances Leacock was it it's very rare they let it run down that far in Chapin has known him to run it's a little bit of strategy by Bob Stoops Kindle trials and the Baylor offense substitute and theoretically the official sander with the ball until the Oklahoma defense has made their substitutions and they get in position and Bob Stoops wasn't necessarily in a hurry to be able to make those substitutions now the center choice backpack third and nine baby I'm home came in motion Siddim stepped up wants to be very careful about running has to slide down before Jordan Evans could hit him II don't want this court back to take thinking he shot now the date they once they get to about midfield on four you're usually going to see them willing to go for this and let's go get a quick kick there they're lined up to go for it here on fourth down at midfield this is Baylor football Didem hands couch bunt did it against Kansas State they've gone for it now 22 times final minute of the first quarter it's the foutch this is all a lot better than the one he tried the last game and it's going to roll dead down inside the 8 yard line the Oklahoma's defense never stopped they'll be pinned back after the 41 yard fun well the watch ESPN app is where you can stream every game live just download the Africa to watch espn.com our boy Nathan Followill a huge sooner fan it's just wedding anniversary TONIGHT I see they're in a restaurant they're in a restaurant but he's got the watch out be told me dialed in on this game she let you get away with that there's the watch that travels with me he's a good man anything's again very nice yes fries that allow him to have that at the table he's probably the biggest citizen out there King DeLeon drummer and his brothers and bandmates as well so Mayfield you got to be careful here with a whip football they hand it off the pier I'm breaks a tackle cuts it back Savanti pier I'm now near the first down marker and they will move the chains across the 18 that is a heck of a run by samajis piranha he could have been tackled for about a threeyard loss by paler young he ran right through that arm tackles picks up a first down now it's mixin who makes the cut and the Sooners play fast and wedge in one final play before the end of the first quarter a lot lower scoring than we thought mr. Herbstreit end of one and Wako back after this message and a word from your local ABC station you then for the start of the second quarters Saturday football on TV sings percent of I am Walmart Sooners with a onepoint lead Baylor scored first but mishandled the snap on the conversion me field had the ball knocked out of his hands get the nice bounce and recovers it very fortunate he right up off this field turf into the hands of Mayfield via Lawson third down Brian Nance is undersized been incredibly athletic he gets right by the freshman and knocked that ball loose they feel fortunate to jump on top of that but when Oklahoma's throwing the fall football it's an obvious passing situation the right tackle through from there the true freshman is being challenged by the period speed of Baylor's edge pressure Lincoln Reilly will risk a throw here at buildeth in the ball lankan pond they feel pressed to get it out brick font size Shepard on the screen cannot escape is knocked down at the 24 and the Sooners will have the one a good job of leveraging the football and third down and anticipating by chance wise and safety to come up and make that play for Baylor's defense really that was set up by Brian Nance on that second down play being able to get the penetration and knock the ball loose from Baker Mayfield Seibert drives off horn back to the 22 and the coverage team takes care of the rest Thomas a starting corner flying down there and coverage to backup baylor cassidy Hubbert's if you're dr. pepper championship drive update Stanford in a battle and Vernon Adam finds Darren Darrington who somehow gets behind the Cardinals D 47 yard touchdown Stanford just take the field goal they had him pass 23:20 block I call shootout relatively low scoring so far here as a handoff goes to Chapin he's knocked down interesting and see Baylor's attack for the most part on the ground but we have seen them throw the football and they've shown some versatility and how they've attacked whether they're facing mantoman or or zone Coleman to the left of the formation is a couple of catches but they have limited yards after contact in the bears with Chapin test the ground game again Kirk but it's going to be third long yeah third down and as you get a freshman quarterback in an obvious passing situation in Oklahoma's front they can crank up pressure you know Charles tapper 91 does a good job of getting after it will about Eric strikers at seven and a half sacks coming into tonight feel the depth and the athletic ability with it Sooners defensive line is more accustomed to what you've seen over the years and Norman with Bob Stoops this year the moonstryker around the lock he was in the face of the quarterback and he will be right there to combine under fact he's knock him down Jordan Wade and another stand by this oud fell and that they coverage sack when you've got a young quarterback as talented as he is you want to try to put him in a position where he has to be able to look into the face of this defense and deal with a lot of different a lot of different white jerseys and the Crimson helmet look at the coverage downfield there's nowhere to go with the ball and as a young quarterback sometimes on third down you get a little anxious you look at your primary he's not there your eyes go down and you start to bail that's exactly what happened to get them their group deal it's just a low kick we'll bounce in front of Shepherd and we'll take a good Baylor bounce still rolling down inside at the 21 yard line Sooners back on offense of a point

forever rainy night in Waco as Goodyear provides our aerial coverage kickoff your drive with tires that return superior performance Goodyear more driven our official aerial provider rain continues to count down as the Sooners take over protecting a onepoint lead from their 20 dear I'm it immediately Taylor Young's as weakside linebacker came in to flag it down od was awesome number 56 10yard penalty we came first the center garland has matched up against Andrew Billings all order blocking us dude he is and he actually gets involved here with with Oakman as well he's coming in on the right here locked up of Shawn Oakman this case grabs easy call for an official Oklahoma continuing to make some mental errors and miscues giving themselves first and 20 in getting off schedule Iran makes the cut and spins and muscles across the 20 other on the Rainey sideline Chris an update for you on Baylor's vline they're down one starter and one that's not 100% Bo blacks gear right now out with a right knee injury they reshape it from mid calf all the way up from this guy he is not going to return they'll reevaluate him at halftime and see if they can get him back in meanwhile Shawn open he is out there guys but he is not a hundred percent dealing with left knee last week and now has a right foot injury to add to it Mayfield rolling out throws downfield West has a staff it's off his fingertips he was in front of Howard and just overgrown well they take a chance we've seen this Oklahoma offense tonight be willing to take some shot twice to Westbrook he had been couple steps on him and boy the ball Judd Braun gets a little bit too long he put a little bit more air under it Westbrook walks underneath to that and into the end zone he got by X Howard on that play nice plays like that potential we can define a game like this right who can connect on the deep just this Oklahoma offense has such a different feel in 2015 and whose they've been the last three or four years Mayfield and a whistle it's timeout called by Oklahoma spend a second will be third and eight and the join continues down there you feel come times can't help himself he's a very emotional guy after he took the snap he'd the time out came from the sideline and a couple defenders came in and there again there they're sharp in and they're giving him a little bit of an elbow and actually three Baylor defenders their wants and he's letting him know he's not going to take it Oklahoma scored on their second possession the bear is on their first since then nothing shocking in the big 12 five possessions turnover and four points probably has as much to do with it is anything whistles blown that's why so I had acquainted stuff yeah yeah yeah you're doing Baker but I think that the Sooners have have a attitude about open and I understand why he began the knock the quarterback a year ago he's not afraid business down there in the scrum that's for sure number two as Heather said playing through some pain tonight Bayfield on third down again looking for Westbrook and there comes a flag so the hammer fighting it was Howard defending the crown in Lincoln after after defense number four to see your family remember automatic we've already seen Westbrook get behind Howard a couple times and I think that has as much to do with this as anything he's by trying to get around and you see the left arm working him and try to prevent him using the arm bar to try to not allow him to get by him again that would have been a third time potentially he gets fired obvious intent to impede is the way that rule was watered there's a lot of it that goes on in this conference because the DB is under some stress to put out in space the eyes are most part of the game plan go on come on in Iran hammers a head just wrestled down after a three yard gain by grant Campbell Lincoln Riley has brought a new energy here as a play caller an offensive coordinator and one of the things that he's doing is he's trusting Baker Mayfield and Heath Dean Feeney Westbrook as a target he wants to go to they feel fine Shepherd on the far side dives for a first down Riley graduated Texas Tech in 2006 I don't know if that makes you feel this all divided beautiful guy one of the upandcoming offenses Carolina after he was in Louisville did great things with James Harden a year ago to East Carolina and I got Bob Stoops and attention mishandled attempted handoff he pulled it back in then Mayfield on that exchange was again lucky the ball bounced up to him that's twice already I hope that he didn't give up on the play and he you know he's trying to pick up yards there's still more pushing and shoving but you know this his own read defender comes down he reads it correctly just doesn't enable he's not able to hold on to the ball but he's not giving up on his play Taylor Young had a chance at him he runs through with defender there and right there in Howard the corner picked up a few yards and a broken play good fortune so far for Big Chill tonight swinging lamp shepherds almost escaped made the catch him was trying to get away from the tackle from Vaughan's there it is first time he epitome of a slot receiver in college football ooh the space to the right there you get sterling Shepherd a matchup and you create a little bit of space he can make things happen after the catch here I'm hit immediately hard behind the line of scrimmage and knocked down for a two yard loss I'm Baylor does a good job of attacking down and his Taylor young he's been very very active in this game he's 510 225 pounds out of Desoto Texas he probably been the most aggressive of the entire front seven so far tonight they've got oneonone matchups across the board Baylor up tied at the line of scrimmage bringing pressure Mayfield backpedals guillotines it downfield for the goal line catch made and now Shepard they call the touchdown shut up in a terrific play battle into the end zone that's the ruling on the field and this would be interesting I'm glad Dave khatai is up here because we always hear about finishing process and extension one on one match and we said they don't have any safeties back they're blitzing what a wellthrown ball he reaches for that pylon and that's when the ball came out we have cameras Kirk in the pylon here is as good a look as you'll ever see Shepherd reaching the ball makes contact right there hard to baby it down it looks like Dave he made two steps after the reception he makes two sets with the football in his hands is the Anna bonds before he reaches that ball to the pylon or down I don't think so it looks like a touchdown to me another look from pylon cam the ruling on the field of a touchdown is under further review those cameras are tough and that's a good thing that's poor of you get you the pylons and that is a terrific look and what a play whether or not it stands by Shepherd well when you get oneonone matchups and Baelor basically showed they tip their hand they showed we're blitzing we're playing man we saw it up here mantoman across the board you got to find sterling Shepherd he's your guy that wins those oneonone battles and he got separation the ball was perfectly thrown by Baker Mayfield right over the shoulder another look what a heady play it's a milestone catch for Shepherd that 200th of his career for 39 yards again this guy couldn't play last year against Baylor after further review for ruling on the field on the touchdown and confirmed more eager and pumped up on the offensive side of the ball than Shepherd for this year especially after the last two years he's wanted an opportunity he's one of the leaders day let's bring in Dave decided to confirm what we saw their day that was a really good call the reason is secondary at an extent the ball and hitting a pylon that denotes completion to the kids with that secondary at that effort by rank standing okay correct Seibert knocks it through a terrific John by the holder there Graham closed them back seen it's not good folks in had to collect a snap that was behind him so either team automatic and conversions in a wet night but the Sooners up by seven go back and look what was great about this if you're an Oklahoma fan is Baker Mayfield on the road tough environment recognizing mantoman coverage and he gets to the matchup that he wants the sea Shepherd at the bottom but Washington running backs Margie Kieran watch what he does here right there on the block to be able to give him just enough time Brandt Campbell came on the Blitz semaj appear on pick up the Blitz it's an area that you can really see how much he's grown Mayfield still gets it by the way but there's the extension and a touchdown in the oneonone matchup which is going to be a battle tonight with sterling Shepherd against that Baylor secondary you my name is joy man watch it Constance kick will not be brought out so the Bears playing from behind the deficit now seven points Monday night the red right for the guy Andy Dalton and the undefeated undefeated since 99 goals who did they get on JJ Watt then the Houston Texans six o'clock moneyman countdown kickoff 8:15 also watch ESPN app about that ball playing pretty good Andrew Whitworth to the board they are now you're not going to talk noise you've been talking noise the first half is he setting it down in appendix ours okay exactly my keys Tina boys getting into town Cincinnati shows cruising Baylor has not faced a sevenpoint deficit yet this year they've been the the kings of team control that metric that looks at how much dominance they have throughout the course of the game when on Khalistan with suitor groups warming Linwood again get the one long run early but they've been all over him since unbelievable what they've been able to do in the way they've settled in at first tried eight nine plays 80 yards in a touchdown it looked like hohum that's typical Baylor but look at these last three drives and now to start this drive here another stop l'action the ball off bialya terrific hands brown just two inches off the turf at the 32 it'll be third down Wynwood that duck hit fighting hard will not get first down yardage is that Sanchez the corner came up in support at 179 half and he comes up a watch Charles Walker Chris watch the defensive line from Oklahoma if everyone they were getting pushed around look in the middle look at 97 get extension he's just throwing he's throwing the fat full of covert the right tackle back into the backfield and Sanchez cleans it up essentia has got knocked to the ground but he grabs it again got ahold of thumpin but that defensive line from Oklahoma and that all three plays is a little bit of different feel for the Sooners confidence that they have right now I'm a four straight empty drives for Baylor you just never see that Shepard making the fair catch Oklahoma back to work Midway second quarter up by seven they like our buddy Chris Palicki here in Waco with the nickname of the bear and he's always going to deliver our Aflac trivia question what'd he have tonight there talked to myosin trophy here for you for rg31 to 2011 Heisman Trophy a couple Baylor players may be in contention this year who is the only other bear to finish in the top five seismic voting mmm was it Singletary perhaps so he thinks maybe on the other side of the ball may be a trick question with the bear it's always a trick question up with you almost Singletary first and then mixed emotions back in its a two back look and Mayfield pumpfake but damn field we're into a proud broken up intended for Neil his wrongs in coverage that's five completions by Mayfield have been disturbing separative he targets his staff receiver smart you're on the road in this environment against this offense you know that number thirtytwo P Ryan and number three Shepherd have got to get their hands on the ball as often as possible remember he's been taking shots to the left into the boundary 211 Westbrook against Howard see if he tries to go back to Mayfield steps up Birgit short again at Shepard trying to make the corner gets the 41yard line very near the marker Trayvon Blanchard stop them your hope on the fan you're obviously optimistic but you remember it was 14 3 in Norman a year ago and then 45 straight for the Bears and the beatdown during short me field on the keeper take the shot knocked down by Howard will be close I think it's going to be a first down yep Sooners fighting for every inch there Baker Mayfield you and I were talking at the break he's had a great start to this game is that a couple plays where the ball is bounced his way but he's got a little bit of an edge to it a little bit of confidence and swagger that his offense seems to feed off of nitrate humane theta in danger throwing traffic clancer the linebacker for the take away the kind of thing Mayfield has avoided a season this time they were all over a top target he throws his fall behind Shepherd which allows Blanchard could get underneath it and remember Blanchard Bill Bennett tells us he runs a 440 play corner and hi Sophia Shepard has to wait for the ball that allows Blanchard when his closing speed to step right in front of that football and what soft hands by Blanchard they'll hold on to the ball get his body underneath before he hits the ground and potentially loses possession of the ball rain Queen Creek watches the awareness to roll the body not let the ball hit the ground what man what expect the Blanchard his second of the season almost like Baylor needed something to kind of spark this stadium this crowd and give their all offense great field position Blanchard provides it one take away for each the offensively continues to that hammer shock men wouldn't even stop them after about a four yard game they have a lot of confidence in that offensive line we talked earlier they're averaging over 300 yards a game on the ground they'll keep going back to it set up the flag fake it to Linwood Jim gets around the edge and getting on young man that's what our brows is thinking Eric striker was in the neighborhood it'll be third and short together well Chris Baker makes bail just went down his entire offense and said hey that one's on me my mistake it won't happen again I'm going to continue going deep Kirk you're talking about an asset that they're exploiting he wants to continue past Ludwick break free first sounded much more down to the 22 yard line among Thomas on the tackle but he took the blow this time we offense the opening drive we've not seen him be able to squirt through there the doubleteam opens it up and wood again who bears love to play extra fast after making a first down that's gone not down for a loss you know what's happening in some of their past plays the reason we're not seeing big plays is Mike Stoops is elected to rush for and drop seven and play zone and that Baylor only has three wide receivers going out for some of these passes you've got seven defenders only three guys out going out for a rout good job by Mike Stoops Coleman has uncovered suitors are confused on defense there's a run by Linwood as a flag in the play there was an alignment running off just before the ball was snapped and Coleman was basically uncovered in the slide against the 12 players on the field he was uncovered but you had DJ war trying to get off the field 12 men on the field he felt fiveyard penalty happens a lot trying to defend this tempo office mics oops it up in the booth for the first time he's been in a sign line his old career he's frustrated right here you see him he's confused well my honor by off my own he's the 12th man you're right they stress you not only from a scheme but the mindset and who's in and who's out and let's make sure we're matched up with the personnel groupings station running behind the largest human in a football uniform I think like Wan McGowan is six seven four hundred ten pound tight in flash lead blocker was in that time number eighty when in doubt just follow the big fella look at him when they speak it on third short they just all that defensive line is McGowan joins the scrum it will be first down being laQuan the big truck they call him I shook his hand yesterday and I lost it I lost my hand I mean it is he's got we watched him catching the football hands he does him down in this red zone area don't forget he threw the one pass last year the bowl game he does have soft hands for a big fella 500pound bench press size 22 Didem batted down at the line he was trying to get it to Coleman on a slant but tapper got a hand up that's been a big big emphasis this week in Norman is the ball is out fast with Stidham in this system and if you can't get in there you've just got to be athletic enough to try to time it up and tapper does an excellent job there Thomas on Coleman to the left of the formation curve second and ten and a quiet start to this game for the Heisman candidate play clock winding down to five option look keeper fish get delivered Stephen Parker came up and not the quarterback down you don't want to get him net but down here in the red zone you got a running they feel yeah the speed option was a part of their offense and his started in Manhattan and they feel he's athletic enough to run if you're right there isn't a lot of talent a lot of experience behind spit and you got to take some chances you can't speak to protecting your quarterback he's got to minimize shots like that Parker hit him hard third and five they can make a first end of the one we talked about the matchup up here at the top Thomas has done a very good job as well well against Corey Coleman has been almost impossible to defend the single coverage and sometimes beats double coverage an opportunity for Jordan Thomas are really shined tonight share his football world is watching him all right bear we have this break we guest Mike Singletary might have been the highest finish here for the Heisman here Baylor until RG 3 wanted what is the answer for the Aflac we have to go all the way back to 1963 dr. Crowell quarterback at Baylor finished 4th to Roger Staubach the Navy quarterback I think you might have another a navy quarterback in New York this year invited there Keenan Reynolds put up great numbers hey are you serious porn in a 1993 carajo what what is he what you throwing a lateral there son number 10 Hall of Famer just Don troll this do that's my bowling technique right there they're stumped us well we'll skin the brows dialup for sitting here the freshman quarterback on 3rd and 5 well they've new trick to the left here they've moved home and now into the slot try to change the matchup you promised that to the outside way at the top and they've created a different matchup now the inside for Coleman fake it to Jason didn't scrambling and is going to be hit knocked down at the 5 yard line Dominique Alexander's waiting for now they slam him down and here comes a fly another mental mistake by an over aggressive sooner defense they had him stopped who's going to be a field goal attempt maybe after the play personal foul unnecessary rough number one absolutely for the goal automatic first good lift rates oops is that you got to be kidding me that is a potential fourpoint play right there Mike Stoops it's probably a good thing he's not massaged didn't run out and strangle somebody it's better to have him up there tonight with with some of these mistakes that they're making and the problem is it's coming from their leaders Alexander here the junior the number one defender in that second level we've also seen Jordan Evans he was miscues in the state's costly for Oklahoma at crucial times as well Jake went unforced and gold as Watson seven when it's it's been three if not four the personal foul and the Bears a chance to tie it let's not forget to give a Trabant Blanchard and assist there with that big interception to give the Bears great field position to get the crowd back into this game and it's a totally different feel now potentially a tie game if they hit this extra point if not but automatic tonight each team has missed an extra point wet football some troubles with the snaps and the hold is Chris Callahan there at his first miss attempted PA field the season not this one through so 39 yard drive after the interception by Blanchard you check the marker in a scrum after the p80 tempers continue to flare up here very feisty first half oops but now Alexander know that was a crucial mental mistake Baelor first and goal sort out penalties are here Reggie Smith we fought his crew might be busy tonight and they have been Evan Chapin who scored a couple of touchdowns on the ground the result of the plane is a successful try for point after the play unfortunately conduct Oklahoma number 94 is picked a player and by rule and fiscal if I himself on the game Brisbane forth on the kickoff that's Matt diamond who has been ejected from the game meanwhile Baylor has forced the turnover for the 25th consecutive game and it's set up the touchdown well you can see Bob Stoops of frustration this is your eyes what set it up Blanchard makes the interception gives this Baylor offense to feel positioned that they need it this is after the penalty first and goal shaping just walks into the end zone just beautiful blocking and not much for the bunny back to do but just waltz in then with the starting defensive lineman here Matt diamond has now been kicked out of the game for kicking a baylor play a player very hard for us to spot it we're looking to see if he can give you an angle of the officials though spotted it in their little punting of the Baylor crown can diamond as he walked on into Katy Texas this team came in here soaked up you knew they were hungry for redemption they have lost their cool at key moments here though already in the first half was right in the middle right there over the snapper Landis was right on top of the fright theory this brings his foot down on the long snapper officials all over it he was laying on his back and then brought his foot down on his facemask yeah the immediate flagged there though a tie game you've said Oklahoma down he starting defensive lineman for the rest of this game and after the penalty the Bears will kick it off from midfield try the pooch kick the fair catch is made my oklahoma at the 29yard line so 258 to go until halftime tied at 13 so our week 10 in the NFL insiders will get you covered in this sunday edition at 10 o'clock Eastern Time the run ESPN followed by Sunday NFL countdown at 11:00 streaming live with a watch ESPN em it's been surprisingly low scoring group the defense and made some play as couple takeaways a whole bunch of penalties a a very feisty first half you have one timeout for Oklahoma with this under three minutes to go with the way Baker Mayfield is played I'm sure they're going to be aggressive and try to get in position here for some points a motion Mixon into the slot and at the pier on has both teams in the football as he powers ahead for a 5 yard game you would have thought with all the build up in the hype and all the talk about the big 12 in the month of November and early December and all the points are you going to see yeah 13 13 score here potentially it's a half Mayfield pulls it and fires across the middle gets made by Shepard at the 50 already Shepard with the touchdown catch and that has eight receptions tonight now watch he's reading this linebacker and because he came up he pulls the ball out and then he finds his crossing route the backs cross Mayfield rolls and fires far side again a low throw and a catch made by Shepherd is having a monster purse out you know by going temple like this it not only helps you get it field position but it allows you to have such an edge to you as an offense it gets the defense on appeal second in short Mayfield sneaks it for a first down to the 40 Sooners had to spend the two timeouts they have just one but 201 to work with plenty of time remember Shepard has been bouncing around he's been in the slot he's bent it to the field he's been to the boundary right now he will be up at the top of the screen Liefeld lobbed it down and nixon out of the backfield on a real rap got open down inside the 25 because you have Shepard on the same side he's able to catch a lot of the defense's attention he's going to go right down here on the wheel round but you see the safety has to respect Serling Shepard it opens up that sideline for the wheel route to Mixon 18yard gain and now be Rhine runs the right side weight Lincoln Wiley that young flake all over in a nice rhythm has and he really does and I think the combination of mix it in P ride in the backfield together yet Starling Shepherd out there making plays we've not seen Mark Andrews the freshman yet have an opportunity but he has great side especially down here sixfive he's been out up at the top he just came in for Shepherd blinker Enders six touchdowns in a 16 catches single coverage to the right of the quarterback Mayfield pulls it grows back over the middle and the catch is made by Dmitri flowers in the HVAC rustling down through the one for the flow all the way to the right gets the defense's attention they've been going down that right sideline and he just puts the ball up in the air and hopes the flowers will come down with watch the defense flow to the right and it opens up the middle of the field and he relies on the athletic ability of flowers to go up and make a play that's trust right there by Baker Mayfield throwing it to his H back flowers who goes up and takes that big hit and almost works his way into the end zone Ryan Stewart who is a big hitter in the secondary he delivered the shot but he took the worst of it again turns and physical flowers Oklahoma has run 41 plays 21 runs and 20 passes and his outstanding balance to start this first half by Lincoln Riley Stewart collided with the other safety was against Kansas State he actually not was out of the game and you could see that he's struggling and that would be a serious loss of this Baylor defense that counts so much on their safety oh yeah trying to get off the field then went down again so 56 seconds before halftime the Capital One halftime report John Saunders Martin may and Mac Brown coming up and also ABC News one of update on the aftermath of the attacks in Paris yesterday Stewart is help off Obama in two minutes and two seconds so far has moved 69 yards for anything to retake the lead again in Waco they on cells number 26 jr. and for Stewart to back look and work on that play clock they can work it down and leave the way Baelor can score in the way they move the ball she worked that down as far as they can they feel funny says right go be Ryan the Keefe's appalled it told me for the defense touchdown Oklahoma but a first effort may feel the zone read Chris he fooled you you writing bull Baylor Blanchard came down hard on P Ryan who had a great first half himself catches the linebackers attention and Baker Mayfield does a great job as staying on the ride and pulling that ball out a perfect read and he walks into the end zone cybers no trouble with that conversion 28 seconds and halftime Sooners back up by touchdown calmly let the play clock go down he's going to make this read right here and because Blanchard collapses makes it very easy he's collapsing down on P Ryan there's nobody out here to the outside and he walks into the end zone I love to see quarterbacks take their time he worked the play clock down and then he doesn't predetermine what he's going to do with the ball simply makes the read off the number 48 Blanchard holds it gets into the end zone Mayfield on that drive for four for 61 yards ran it a couple of times and finished it off here fifteen a 2182 on the road in this environment run the football handful of times Baelor just 28 seconds until half done we'll get the ball to start the second half but this crowd rest in all black came out charged up I think they thought they'd see a typical Baylor offensive firework show the Sooners defense not having it in the ground not at all this is Corey Coleman he's going to bring it out one give it a go not receiver doesn't return kicks too often he is not down hard Sooners have terrific coverage units there's a flag down Daniel Brooks one of the backup linebackers was down there to knock Coleman down which every market or a block in the back on the play it's first down Western Mutual presenting college football playoff selection mini rankings clemson struggled a bit but won by ten at the dome survived in advance Ohio State workman life Iowa with a 10point lead over Minnesota there's Alabama with that one loss another impressive win and four down five the Oregon event rivalry game in the pac12 North the LSU after the loss last week in Tuscaloosa struggling against Arkansas I'll just came out and they got a little bit of a fracas with LSU pre kickoff in Baton Rouge tonight nothing but so far they're back in it up goes to them leaves it near side and the catch is made a tea can and one of the speedsters knocked down short of the 30 and they'll move to change 14 seconds of math let's see if they're able to try maybe one more shot here but Oklahoma's defense and again tripped up dives tries to get out of bounds and does at the 33 to 7 seconds left they have been able to keep seven defenders against the pass and coverage for most of the game and they've taken away Stidham in this explosive passing game and they're saying you know what if you're going to move the ball it's going to be shocked Linwood we'll take our chances with our talented defensive line in linebackers against the running game but they're not going to hit the explosive downfield the past and then we'll just flip it again to Cannon and with one second on the clock either we'll have one chance to keep it down now they're talking about it whether or not the catch was going to count and fill the reestablished in bounds prior to touching the past it has been completed goes down the call they've got so much attention last week in the Michigan State Nebraska game here cannon definitely stepped out of bounds and came back in so he's ineligible less repercussions on this play than a menthol certain backfield didn't he tries to heave it long that discredits oh it's short now the catch is made by Davy and Harlow has some Running Room but now we'll be surrounded by Sooners and brought down this offense that averages 84 yards per play bet in the FBS averaging far less than that tonight end of the first half here in Waco the capital one caps on before is coming up John in the gang in the studio and Heather Cox will speak with Bob Stoops right after these messages welcome to the capital one halftime report Baker Mayfield and sterling Shepherd hooking up and that's one of the best tandems in the big 12 and Bob Stoops happy with the way things went in the first half so to take a sevenpoint lead into the locker room how have you been able to establish control so far well controlling the run game after the first series and then other than a few penalties defense is really held up and then the offenses kept the ball and moved it as well you talk about those penalties you also had a player ejected a lot of emotions what's your reaction been to this chip enos yeah you know we just got to play smarter yeah we had a chance to force a field goal we give them a fresh set of downs and they get a touchdown that's big I think same set for the second half on Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart here in Waco Texas the rain is letting up as we get set for the final 30 minutes the surprising first half surprisingly defensive Oklahoma with a 20 to 30 lead Chris Fowler back with Kirk Herbstreit but Kirk the Sooners have been here before they play great defense for 30 minutes now what's the key to sustaining it because in the second half the Bears have stepped on the gas allows couple years against them no doubt about it I think their defensive line really started to assert themselves after the opening drive where Baylor went right down the field and put points up on the board and because of how well they played up front it's allowed them to defend the run with their front and then still keep a lot of guys in coverage and it's made it really hard on Jarrod spit I'm the freshman quarterback we'll see if they can maintain that you know the same effort from Oklahoma in the second half and if you're if you're Baylor it's about trying to get your running game going taking some of the pressure office didn't which they tried to do but stick with Heather Cox before the kickoff all right guys I talked to heart brows who is frustrated with the rhythms that we just got out of rhythm out of sync early we never got back into it and that turnover really personal met him one last night guys keep your eyes on quarterback Jared sidam our brows admitted to me that he got banged up in the first half he's dealing with a very sore back but we'll continue in the second half we don't want to get this guy hit because there really is no experience behind him the Pacific Life game summary big first half for Sterling Shepherd again who missed last year's game of an injury had nine receptions at 118 yards he's putting his heart and soul into this effort providing the leadership we talked about Jared Stidham 9 to 13 but the Sooners keeping everything in front of them very few passes it's one of the few passes downfield where they hit Jala and that's what their daily and that's what they're going to try to do here try to get some big plays in the pass game Denham takes a shot that score back won't feel any better after that big blow from Matt Romar remember we have that diamond out of the game for kicking a Baylor players so Romar along with Charles Walker have got to get it done in the middle and much like the way most of the first half win again that sooner deal I'm Linwood knocked down after a short gain it'll be third and long this is a Baylor offensive one they've given up only nine sacks on the season Browns is not used to seeing this offense shut down as a murmur in this place indeed 14 you can see seven and coverage here sinem it's a shot for Coleman fingertip catch flag comes in he's not good around here the Oklahoma 40 let's check the marker it's got to be pass interference I think on the Sooners and will Johnson trying to prevent Coleman from getting around him yet hand fighting that goes on down the field defensive back and receiver prior to the past holding defense authority of the climb was on the flames were found and you could see that Jordan Thomas who Oklahoma wants to have on Coleman with the formation they'll they somehow got Coleman matched up with the Nickelback will Johnson and that's the matchup they'll take every time why it's first half for Coleman only two catches for 14 yards he got 37 on that third down play now Lynwood is just mobbed and lamb down by Charles after another loss on first down but again I can't say enough about the way this defensive line is playing you're talking about not only going up against the team that can score but you have a veteran Baylor offensive line a physical back in shock Lynwood a team that's averaging 300 yards a game on the ground in Oklahoma with the rotation athletic ability will battle Lynnwood a zit cream at the ankle there by Alexander prevented a bigger gain it will be third and four very soon negative plays with his offense only 40 all year the suitors did a very good job at happening behind the line on third down Linwood mussels Ford don't even need to go forward on fourth down because they will move the chains to the 31 but our crowds been an interesting point with Heather talking about it got out of rhythm they had some penalties and miscues and turnover and kind of got away from what they were doing early fit him thought about running now just dumps it off on the sidelines at Shannon making the carrots quarterback knocked down again completion to the 25 they brought a late lid from Stephen Parker the nickel back to right there number 10 he leaves cannon Stidham eventually teased that he probably should have gotten that out there a little bit earlier to cannon but he did take a hit by Parker Lynwood tried to cut back gets the air shot Winwood another clock down inside a tenfoot and gold bears I think that's what makes shop Lynwood so good this play is designed to go into left it's a counter play he's going to follow his linemen but look at this play is supposed to go here he cuts it all the way back because of the vision in the field and he has there but the good job of coming off of that all the way back there plays Devine to his left looking for fur touchdown and getting it is dead in miss Jason the display 37 yards kirkin at third and 14 to keep the drive going and check them with a hat trick kinda hell the opening drive in a game started really for Baylor nine plays 75 yards here they go right down the field 232 is almost identical to that opening drive to start the game for their their first touchdown the ATS have not been automatic tonight callahan who nuts this one through and this game tied once again at 20 baylor quick out of a starting gate and the second half this is they were in the first three touchdowns four to eight bridges across the process normally lit up reading goal for Baylor home games but red white and blue tonight the colors of the French flag and support memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks more than hundred 25 killed in that city prayers for Paris from even as far away as Waco Texas and all of its here joined in our thoughts and wishes 20 apiece the Bears had by the score quickly their first possession at the third quarter Evans big shaken at the four by an Alex Ross it was a very dangerous for Turner last year at a couple of touchdowns but they haven't been that strong in this department this year celebrating its 11th year is sponsoring the good hands bill go that's all state makes contributions to the general scholarship fund for each field goal an extra point kick all that is contributed billions to scholarship funds so far this Oklahoma offense from the 26 yard line Baker Mayfield so sharp in command in the first half can they keep it going he is almost stopped which is good news for both offenses here I'm bounces off a man gets to the air trip one through the tackle of Stuart and they'll move to change together well some defensive news for Baylor as you'll recall defensive taker both last year injured his right knee in the first half they evaluated at 1/2 times he will not return also certain safety Orion sir is out there but battling back seven better thank you firemen bonds one defensive tackle already out with a nice trim now Kirk blacks here unable to return as a report of an Oakland is dealing with a couple of lower body injury alligators you have Andrew Billings down he's going to get up he's been fighting through an ankle injury for the last few weeks sure have still not under present he buildeth Mayfield hold it pump fake take the shot and close the far star that Neal who's knocked out of bounds at the 45 yard line here's a quarterback who's in rhythm right now yeah no doubt about it they're starting to run the football when you start to run the ball it opens up spacing underneath in this offense and boy he had he had Shepard matched up against Stewart there beer on hammers away at that shorthanded defensive line the linebacker Campbell came up to meet him oh they are doing everything they can to hold up physically the strength of their defense is their defensive line with their feet numb which means the linebackers and safeties are going to have to get more involved Mayfield is big has room Mayfield the 30 goes to speed gets the corner knocked out down inside the 10 Blanchard finally ran him out but another big play from the quarterback I'm telling you we've not seen an Oklahoma sooner quarterback that brings this kind of life that is often in years it's creativity look at the effort he's not going to give up on his play he's not looking to slide he's picking up his mini hard to began 34 of them on that Stamper first and goal great block downfield by Westbrook to help him give him more yards dear I'm hammered immediately that was Campbell coming up again to join in on the tackle with KJ Smith as much as the Oklahoma defense has taken the brunt of the criticism about why they can't play with teams like Baylor at TCU it's really been more about the offense tonight's a different story with Mayfield and company second ago Mayfield has its near sod off the hands of Mark Andrews the ringing Dean freshman receiver was a big red zone weapon for the Oklahoma thing trying to back shoulder pay to the bigger freshman it's six five to go up there ball is in perfect position and answers good unable to hold on to the football exactly where you want to put it if you're a quarterback that back shoulder fade with a 6'5 receiver as you put it up in the air it's almost like a rebound the timing was good he just lost his footing and his balance to hold on to it kermin go Mayfield on its land touchdown Shepard went down low scooped it up in Oklahoma takes the lead again Chris lookout Baylor's walked up they're blitzing which creates a nice big void right behind the Blitz Baker Mayfield at time finds it waits for the right moment you'll see Blanchard go up in the air he throws it right behind him right flow in a way where it needs to be conversion good shepherd now 10 catches 125 yards and two touchdowns and Stoops offense converts again in the red zone back up by 7 Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart stop by a store or visit us at Walmart com2 she'll wonder every day boy we go further so you can and chickfila we didn't invent the ticket just the chicken sandwich conditions have improved for the blimp here aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven our official aerial provider rain seems to have moved off to the east see if both often just get it cranked up each scouring to open this third quarter in Oklahoma again has reclaimed the lead Thompson drives it into the end zone most of his kicks are touch Benson that one is as well hooker Tuesday night not ESPN dropped if the kaga with his special time the new college football playoff rankings presented by Goodyear will be released Reese you others I guess from the United Center in Chicago between games of the champions classic so we'll see how developments of today might change the committee's outlook Alabama be impossible to drop them after they hammered Mississippi State on the road Clemson and Ohio State winning Iowa involved in Minnesota tonight and we by six but style points do County they do especially this time of year sinem wanted to take a shot downfield that is rolls and bounces the ball in there incomplete to halt this offense is known Curt for all these deep shots that this is an example of what you're going to see you're going to get a guy down here down here but look if the Oklahoma Sooners in coverage look how tough this is defined an opening to throw the football to jacob carey and it's going to be third down again Alexander on the top it's interesting to Mike Stoops he's come up with a plan he's looked at the entire offseason and it's all really relying upon having a dominant defensive line and playing the way they're playing physically it's a line of scrimmage against the run game and pressuring the quarterback which frees him up to drop linebackers and defensive back then coverage against the big play ability to pass third and 7 inches plant off the fingertips of Coleman who was closely covered fourth down coming up and more join between Coleman and DV Thomas it's a tight window and you know Coleman as good as he is he knows when he goes in there there's a chance you're going to you're going to feel a linebacker in this case it was Alexander gets around Thomas the ball is thrown where he can make a catch on it but he short arms it just a bit fearing Dominic Alexander close it in bear has had only eight bring announced all season coming in and was their third tonight Kailas much busier than usual meant not a very good fun bounce backwards and see where they spot it will be at the 43 as oklahoma takes over up 7 Chicago my town where past champions will play and future champions will be decided the champions classic and college football playoff top 25 all live from Chicago's Tuesday and ESPN the 27yard punt was a funky into it watch Dakota Austin number 27 down and coverage employed but lucky that ball happened it bounced out of bounds for Oklahoma magic that bounced back in this Kapila play been alive long said perform at the 45 build on the sevenpoint lead mixing the running back at the bottom of the formation if Iran has got it makes to cut Tamachi beer I'm in the clear stiff arm 55 yards and the Sooners go up to scores physical pomp and fast this cannot believe the job at Lincoln Riley has done with this offense for the way they looked against Texas to where they look these last five weeks including tonight he has 15 has 67 yards rushing against Texas longest run allowed by Baylor this year and give Lincoln Riley credit here Chris because look at the formation he's got Sheppard over here by doing that he gets a linebacker and a safety over him there's nobody and run support on this side and the reason that's important is once he gets through you got a blitz right there you get a nice block from the right tackle to my Samiha and it just frees it up and I say the big fella has speed when he gets out into the open field but look there's nobody there Blanchard blitz is he gets picked up right there and there's nobody left because the formation moved to safety into the boundaries here's like a pylon camera Sivaji Steve roll into the end zone it's shorthanded Baylor defensive line down Blackshear already missing ponds Oakman and Billings both of them banged up beginning to wear and you're right Lincoln Riley on a terrific game really is it patottie the right guard Samiha the right tackle both with two blocks the spring pea Rhine lose that we the formation and moving the safeties and linebackers out of position that really open that up and again drive to kick deep rip flats going to bring it out knockdown across the 15 the ESPN's got you covered tomorrow morning and a bill insiders Sunday edition at 10:00 Eastern semi NFL countdown with boomer in the gang at 11 also on the watch ESPN app tonight Kirk jarred Stidham second start of his career the first one at home in this big showcase game facing a twotouchdown deficit composure Art Briles has been here he understands you just got to keep sticking to the game plan and doing what you do the blink of an eye they can get back into this game but they've got it start to challenge their offensive line to start winning some battles upfront because they even lose into that defensive line first down run again and Steven who's wrestled down by Zack Jim thanks Anne says cinemas had a couple of big plays got off to a slow start I'm just see that the big 34 yarder in the last touchdown drive to Coleman was key there is just not in that rhythm not playing with their usual tempo are they not at all an offense that snaps at every 16 or 17 seconds sit up break3 and then slides down across the 20 it'll be third down and the long four there's an example again there's just nowhere to go with a football you've got underneath route getting in this area right here and look at the Sooners and coverage you're a freshman quarterback where you going to go with the football great coverage again by the Sooners and try to move know where to run Chaffin is stack up oklahoma defenders getting stirred up it's a four three and out for baylor there's been star that making in charles walker you know how many great defensive linemen we've seen over the years in norman charles walker doesn't get the attention because it's happening some of the others but right off the edge ninetyseven it gets extension uses his quickness and speed to go right by pack over a senior you're talking about walker as a sophomore a 62 and 300 pounds at a garland texas great athlete up front our pile of likes to use the tennis term that'd feel like i helped introduce service breaks bears having their service broken left in right here tonight and oklahoma now a chance to really take a commanding lead if they could find the endzone again midway in the third quarter we all safe us ernest joined this down here in waco you can enter the allstate it's good sweepstakes chance $100,000 plus a VIP trip to the old state sugar bowl and the national championship game as well as weekly prizes what you just said is big in a game like this it can go potentially back and forth a couple big stops oklahoma has been gaining momentum and confidence as a team that they've been embarrassed by the last two years this is a huge possession the way this game is going tailored offensive the sooner offense it's here I'm they try to tenderize the shorthanded defensive line other Christi injuries for the Baylor defense continued to mount now starting safety chance laws just went into the locker room he has got a left shoulder injury they're evaluating it right now they're recalling his return doubtful remember last we get a neck strain right now that same area being evaluated from there was your eye right was knocked out of the candidate game it hit from his teammates Stewart who and they're also said is is playing hurt on your right Turkey there's this emergency but this Baylor game Santa's used to playing with the lead and protecting the lead and now a bunch of guys out punching guys hurting and filling fill been ago Bennett's doing everything he can he's bad to move some people around even when he came in tonight 56 KJ Smith if they can hold his thumb open but he's a defensive it they've had to move him down to play defense to tackle some is it being baked for the bear that they could get off the field here I'm 34 Liefeld it stinks going to make the first down more another scramble from the Obama quarterback down near the 35 hey weapon this kid has got something special this kid is special third down you're gonna play mantoman he's got mobility he's got feel he recognizes it takes off and picks up the first down here on Namor's ahead and escape and is tackled at Jess's he was trying to get momentum by cells I thought he might pull out of that and look Chris I thought he looked like he was down this guy had such balance watch him run low center of gravity somehow sneaks out of there and if it were not for the effort by Bell he's into the end zone again watch some his runs this year I think this guy has got tremendous flexibility here a really powerful guy that held soon he could come sounds a more complete back though he's more actual he's got more lateral movement last year he was a full Mayfield loops the ball for Shepard far side out of bounds overthrown Lincoln finally going for blood right now this is this is Baylor like what they're doing that's what I think we're all sensing how big a possession this is whether it's Lincoln Riley down there calling plays or the viewers or you and I this is the crucial point in football game looking for down bears are showing Brecker and remember when they'd show this clip he has an opportunity to be able to try to get the football right right here to sterling Shepard Mayfield instead take the shot for size jump all broken up you're on Neil very well defended that was a terrific play by Ryan Reed is at backup corner he has been a starter in the past and he is stride for stride here does a good job that is textbook right there by Reed heap sent the hands and the eyes of Neal and that's when he drew his arm off to knock that football away great play Oklahoma going for here on fourth and five a paler brought pressure the last play Chris let's see if they bring pressure again in create those oneonone matchups gear twice a field screen Shepard yeah tatianna Baylor makes the same 11 catch for Shepherd but couldn't escape Terrell Burt and the Bears take over that's you know verbs involve put the guy who made the plans for Vaughn Blanchard by getting around the block potential block of Mark Andrews some bigtime stop here by Baylor watch 48 off to the side here that's a good job of working around right there Watson works around Andrews getting balls horses him back inside and that's where Burke the rest of the Baylor defenders were but we talked about how important that possession was before it started they got to stop and now you see what Baylor can do here all pensively can they find some rhythm with this true freshman quarterback play action on first down nowhere to throw the ball sit him back pedals and now just Chuck's it into the Oklahoma bench again great coverage seven guys in pass coverage Mike Stoops and always upstairs looking down watching this this plan it was put together is working up to this point and it has everything to do with keeping people in coverage and dominating the line of scrimmage with a great defensive line ominous to the left of the formation because usually you have to commit numbers that in shock Lynwood in the running game that leaves you vulnerable in oneonone opportunities in the past and by accidently flipping across the little catch made blows delivered and still running discus pinning the fly in with a huge fly down to the 30 as Broyles dials up a little deception he came right out of the backfield right here he looks like he's going to lead block and then actually just sneaks behind the linebacker Alexander the ball had to be thrown in a hurry because of the safety that Ahmad Tom is coming in so quickly and that's exactly what he does he reads it feels it gets the ball thrown in a hurry it was only pinnacles tackle there yeah only Pennings fifth catch of the season you can see it he volatile mr. Stoops there's a much calmer in the booth that he isn't a sign lines looking down as pending is attended to and now help to his speed 250 pounder from Michigan that many guys in this Baylor roster from outside of the state of Texas but he is a big target 66 250 you're pretty good wheels after the X again well last face but ran over Jerome on Thomas and then did show some some speed gotta love how Baylor just kind of keeps pecking they keep looking to keep trying to find it not working in the run game Coleman's not necessarily working they decide to go to Gus pinning West or receptions on the year sneak him out of the backfield he was keep trying to find a weakness in your defense Vick laQuan McDonald number 80 is lined up in the back 39yard game set them up on first down sit him on the front face Liam zone jail ears wide open drop it boy off the hands of the senior receiver should have been seven a stutter and go on an island against Zach Sanchez and he had it he gave him a little stopping however right right through his hand off the face mask but back Sanchez who's a little bit of a guesser jumped the route early and it was very easy for Lee to get around and just drop the ball Linwood runs forward and again when you try to make up a 14point deficit drops like that amplify the importance that Baylor can't find the endzone on this Drive it'll be one he'll remember the quarterback ten third down but obviously four down territory Lynwood chased down by striker for a loss Eric striker makes his first big play of the night not just a sack pester yes striker involved Jill so had the middle linebacker Jordan Evans here striker he can attack he sees the formation there's not a tight in there it allows him to collapse in a hurry Jacques Lynwood never had a chance with that closing speed of Eric striker makes this fourth down boy a little more complicated amounting eight yards after the law sit up on a plant cannon thanks occur inside the five first and goal clutch for Katie cannon in the quilt about the middle of the field of line open watch the ball and he airs the arm strength that we talked all week about from Jairus Stidham bears wanted to play fast but as sooner is down on the field never look at the catch look at the arm strength that ball is thrown as we say on a rope there between the safeties behind the linebackers this is where they like to attack they get their speed out in space they love to come into the middle behind those linebackers here's his arm strength I said tight spiral we've seen from him this Charla's tapper goes down for the Sooners star defensive lineman but it's it has been clutch they had the third and 14 they got the big gain in the last touchdown drive 23 yards on that fourth and eight for a young guy he does come across is almost unflappable as far as the pressure doesn't ever seem too much for him you said it well though yesterday as tapper has helped up it was so easy for him almost effortless in his first start a tough environment but listen for any quarterback much less a true pressure going to have those nights where it suddenly it's not going to feel as easy as effortless you have to work through it and we were watching and practice he's loose today we've been here since January rolls out in Manhattan camber throw three touchdowns over 400 yards and kind of a walk in the park you new tonight against the suitor defense would be more challenging but you got to be impressed with the young guy and the way he's just kind of hung in there and he's given his team still a chance to compete to try to get back into things so first and goal the big truck McGowan number 80 shifting around he's on the left end as an extra offensive lineman flat tight end now a timeout taken by Oklahoma Baylor tries to cut into this lead when you come back Baylor Bears used to pretty easy victory is nothing easy about this one they still face a 14point deficit but have a first and goal at the five they have been physical they've had their chances tonight inside that 5yard line Devin Chapin usually 28 has been in there their power back both teams kerkovich perfect in the red zone each three for three with touchdowns do you think throws the big fella McGowan big eighty he's got great hands very soft hands on the left side in the tight end position Chaffin already with three touchdowns they fake it to 410 pounds touchdown our files in a twinkle in his eyes and come on you get involved the big fellas you might see something the outside slot to go there if there's ever a time to fish first and goal the big 400 pounds tied in you got to get in the ball the only other time he's had a chance with in last year's bowl game against Michigan State we saw the practice we were mesmerized by how soft his hands were catching balls onehanded he's a terrific story Terry he wanted to be an NBA star growing up and outgrew that went to high school and a Boys Ranch which he actually asked for he disciplined director in his life as you can see the talent soft hands good feet for a big fella huge fella it's actually a really good call because they're not anticipating him sneaking in behind they're thinking the Chaffins going to run the ball so he just does a nice job there just shows a little bit to Devante bond right here just give his hands up and then just comes off with it Stidham gives kind of give them a little time has the patience there to be able to get him takes a little bit of time for 400 pounds to get a row you know we know any score touch it you try to lift up the guy that scores are you kidding me they tried to who's trying to lift it I tried to lift the whole car terrain joke I'm up Heather what do you got hey guys laQuan Miguel is large as you guys talk about he wears a size 21 to but during game he squeezes into a 55 18 he says even though his hell is open it helps him run faster and that his per exercise feels too heavy on the field and when you're younger imagine trying to find a size 21 shooting with competing in sport at the Dallas Mavericks for help at the Cowboys for help they didn't have shoes big enough so Shaquille O'Neal sensing shoes when he explained for the Phoenix Suns so we'd have some shoes big enough tickle and bounce out of bounds all he does is score touchdowns Kirk career receptions three touchdowns big laQuan go to Cassidy Hubbard for an update from the studio thanks Chris Taco Bell's studio update Houston came back from being down 20 Memphis with a chance to retake the lead but chase Elliott misses the 48yard field goal Houston survives to stay unbeaten meanwhile Stanford ena twopoint conversion for the tie with seconds left and Kevin Hogan incomplete pass or get upset Stanford 38 36 Chris hurry back you wow what a huge win for helpers and the Ducks and that's obviously a critical lot for Sanford playoff chances and probably for the whole top works as I said this morning if Stanford were to lose and I get outscored by Oregon that could really crush the pac12 and their chances of getting into that at top four remainder than when you saw I suppose only the glimmer of hope from them lead so the Sooners up only seven now and disappear on who breaks another tackle gives another stiff arm and makes another good first down game now here's our flag a helmet was ripped off under the defensive lineman that was billing as who lost the hat I don't think he came off on its own there are two guys just swinging at each other Jonathan Alvarez the left guard and you said Billings but they were going after each other Reggie Smith trying to sort things out there with his crew if had their hands full tonight been a hottempered game mental mistakes on both sides personal foul and to the face offense number 58 number 75 telling it to come on 15yard penalty from the deadball spot is second down number 75 may remain in the game Jonathan Alvarez guilty of a penalty mental market back 15 yards Wow again another event was a penalty which is just kind of a guy losing his composure at specifically the big guys down of a pit who done so and is a crucial penalty to put the Sooners way behind the change as the rain begins to fall again Mayfield rolling out under pressure disclosed it away Blanchard is that a pink knife was given chase third in 20 types of misdirection with that fastflowing baler defense the Bears in that that speed able to chase Mayfield down and now after that huge mistake by Alvarez probably just run the football here and try to avoid a mistake energy is back on the claim stadia pick time they do hand at the pier I'm we've got a squadron of blocker at the Barrett defect knives through that was Edward and Blanchard combining Oklahoma at the punch you're right you can feel a different energy in here right now after the touchdown and now they get a three and out to get the ball right back the chair instead him in his baylor offense but again that's major penalty just really killing that dr diver an excellent player not one of his better efforts on thorn comes up bottled it tried to make the fair care chip out back into his hands now to wrestle for it at the 32 yard line so trying to sort out who has the football Baylor's going to keep it come on thorn I just would have been a huge mistake he said the rain has come back and bought wet got his legs there to help him and look he was out he has his leg his knees to help him I think that ball bounces on the ground right into the hands of George Thomas absolutely Annie catch the elements once again perhaps a factor if we thought the rain would move out that's what the forecast called for it stopped for a while coming down again and the wind kicking up as well still a long way to go in his football game with the way these two teams potentially can move the ball Linwood as the hesitation didn't wanted a polo ball and what didn't want to give it up and what about keeps it for a short game that's the zone read play with a quarterback and the running back remember they're not sure who's going to get it depending on what the defensive lineman does and Walker doesn't really commit so you got Linwood sand you better take it he did them saying you better take it you're lucky to get back to the line of scrimmage now it's fitting fire intercepted next Sanchez have got it we're we displayed at inside the three in this communication between receiver and quarterback and Sanchez makes a big play that's exactly right Katie cannon not on the same page with the young freshman Stidham and in this offense this is about timing and them gets the ball out he read at certain coverage there's a lot of adjustments to coverage cannon didn't even know the ball was thrown he runs a quick plan and spit him expecting something else because of the coverage that he saw you can see the ball is thrown cannon has no idea Bartel Taylor's offense again the receivers in a quarterback being on the same page and reading the coverage together here the receiver read one coverage the quarterback read another not on the same page and Sanchez is waiting for that interception his fourth pick of the year he's been nursing an ankle trouble you can see at the end of applause uncle's kind of got rolled up the Alpha of that secondary that's the Sooners up at the 28th and Mayfield want to take a shot on first down we'll sit down Wilkes effort makes the catch down to the 12 yard line well that is a Meeks now slow to get up it's a big arm you're throwing that in the college game from the left all the way to the sideline and he froze it again on a rope where the safety that time Bert has no chance to come over and make a play on the football your back look on first at a low snap and that play didn't work them to start mixing this dropped for a loss but the timing thrown off by the snap in this Baylor defense trying to come up with a stop final minute of the third quarter right that had a weird feel from the beginning here it really didn't have much of a chance Baylor all over it with the timing arrived because of the snap all young made the tackle for a loss of three yards second down clock at 15 seconds in the third quarter Lorraine picking up even more now mix it want us to make the edge hit hard another loss consecutive losses as Jamal Palmer came up to hit the running back and tempers flare again Mixon lost his helmet this defense is flying around right now how about cells Chris how physical he is stepping in for Stuart well Oklahoma threatening up 7 as the rain falls in Waco a hotblooded hardhitting surprisingly defensive game back with a final quarter after this message and a word from your local ABC station certainly helped the national championship trophy presented by dr. peppers waterresistant to be awarded to the winner of course January 11th in Glendale Arizona Baylor still bothered they weren't given a chance to compete for that curfew last year going to make their playoff pace with a win tonight but Oklahoma trying to build the lead as we begin the final quarter third and 14 they going to get down to about the two yard line empty backfield bears back out rustling three Mayfield looking for somebody still looking fires endzone broken out tried to get some more Andrews is it a couple of opportunities he's holding his left arm well who's in coverage in fourth down Mayfield did everything he could to keep his play alive and eventually finds Andrews who has a chance here it's the second time tonight we've seen the young freshmen have a chance to make a critical play that's a beautiful view of the right there but unable again to squeeze the ball for a first down maybe a touchdown here he's been a reliable target his fifth touchdown catches so instead cyber from 33 to make it a 10point game and he knocks it through so Baylor thirteen seconds into the final quarter once again down by a double digits Pacific Life game summary we begin the fourth quarter here each team with a couple of touchdowns in the third quarter Shephard having a monster evening for Oklahoma 12 receptions of approaching the single game Oklahoma record which is 15 he's got a piece of that record he's trying to make up for the last two games against Baylor in one night trying to put three into one option to boot it away here's a work into the wind here in the final quarter this kick will not reach the end zone as miles de Moura as a chance and gets a couple blocks Zamora runs by the kicker to midfield and knocks down inside Oklahoma Territory by Stephen Parker but a big play from the special team stepped up Baylor well what a great job and you know the coaches told us about Zamora and his big play ability as a wide receiver and he is a big range he guys a freshman is sixfour twotwenty and i that the kicker just slowing him down just enough allowed Stephen Parker to eventually catch up to him and that was just great blocking and hitting the crease and having some natural ability in that speed at 6:00 for the Morro with a 58 yard return and now Stidham set up at the 49 the 39 I should say and leads it off the line Wood is wrestled down Jordan Evans came flying into the backfield and that reoccurring theme with Oklahoma's defensive line in linebackers doing a very good job on early downs of pinning their ears and attacking that offensive line at veteran offensive line getting off a blocks and getting into the backfield Linwood on second and long and until he drops to either stones eBay will lose yards like this I mean you're talking about a back that averages eight yards of carry and a team that averages over 300 yards rushing and it's been tough sledding up there this is another example look at the extension look at the linebackers closing lineman getting off a blocks and they're just chasing him down two runs lose five yards arrested them facing third and 15 and I don't care how good a freshman quarterback you are and it's how good this offensive scheme is third and long like this is top playaction denim tip at the 50 inflamed down by tapper what a standby the sooner defense said to the big tick for turn that the Bears up well Charles tapper is in a printer stance you know he's at five sacks in the last two games coming into tonight and there's nothing that Stidham could have done here watch the speed rush right here watch out quick tapper gets by this offensive line powerful or one of the better linemen up front this cannot deal with the leverage the speed of Charles tapper that time as I said third and long you know what's going to happen and tapper pinned his ears back and just put that said speed rush on him figure Kirk no way in that series are they going to ever Punk the ball but cinema's hurt on that sag and on fourth and 21 miles much as he hates that the punt away cover team is a great job a hustle down and that was Patrick levels just dropping the ball at the oneyard line so the Sooners up by 10 will start from the one as pylon cam shows you this if the special teams play Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought you by Pacific Life

world everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go that instance as far as where they roll into yours Goodyear more driven the official aerial provider of Saturday Night Football Jared Siddim an obvious pain genic British teeth not let his teammates see it at that Zack my tapper Oklahoma takes over at the three they find it there at four levels first touch the ball covering it but here's here's big tapper hammering the freshman who again you get a taste of what college football is about you can see him grimace right away they don't really have any experience at all behind and Chris Johnson's a sophomore that's not a tentative pass and three is get at Reddick British seat that hang in there except Russell's the opening day starter who was injured second down mixing hammers forward across the ten it'll be third down until Briles visiting Hassidim seems to be okay make sure he's ready to go back out there clear his mind and get ready to play football meanwhile mayfield chased around a third down barely stays out of the end zone he griffith the football and drop him at the one jamal palmer and again trip on blanchard in there Blanchard's had a heck of a night to the fairs defense and i got a love filled minutes mentality we've got a pin back let's pin our ears back ourselves we've seen oklahoma doing that a lot we I think we poach jamal palmer and to round Blanchard's name more than anybody else on this defense tonight they've been out on the edge they've been glimpsing from the outside making plays against this very talented Oklahoma offense all night now you're right Hill been doing a heck of a job staying aggressive both pretty long athletic guys Lancers and to pick earlier cyber backed up in his end zone and this Airy very good freshman punter drives them back to the 45 yard line so Jared Stidham written his teeth back to work with good field position as the Bears of the Lebanon one to play but a cut into this lead remember the Bears had the big kickoff return looked like they had some momentum and then of course they end up having to find how important is special teams they put it inside the 5yard line the Sooners go three and out and now instead of even after the sack and a disappointment they get the ball right back in plus territory still only down ten with 11 minutes to go in this game Stidham gained 28 pounds since he arrived Baylor is early enrollee to this skinny kid in high school he's been rooming with two offensive linemen including drengo so maybe hanging up the oline has helped him up and and survive hits like that last one first down throw far side it's low and Jaitley couldn't come up with it you know we showed him grimacing we showed him with a coat on with all the rain we showed Kindle Briles talking to him Seth Russell talking to him the one thing we didn't see was him throwing I was the product the first ball that he has thrown since he came off after he got body slammed by Charles tapper and that was not like him the throw that he just made right there as far as his accuracy and velocity there's a second throw downfield shot coming back for the ball his cannon and he's wrestled out with a first down soon sooner defenders turn didn't really thought of all well Parker never finds the football and Tannen does a good job of coming back to the ball it's a bit under trawl as he could see Parker's just lost in oneonone coverage and that's the matchup who's going to win those matchups on the outside if Katie can in there they got 27 and now Didem tries to escape again it's the roll for the end zone two receivers of the area in a tuck lightly Kanon meanwhile the second receiver who almost collided with Lee is out of the corner of the endzone not how they drew it up but they'll take it right anytime you see two receivers in the same area almost crash into each other there's there's a mistake but you're right see Lee coming out and right there the ball is thrown to Lee how cannon got involved I didn't keep started to improvise a bit that ball is thrown right over the shoulder Sooners defense confused they're jordan Evans for Oklahoma was also hurt on the play and off from walking to the sidelines but what a gritty drive for this quarterback an obvious pain comes out uses the field position and now Baylor the p80 away from making this a threepoint game he said nothing automatic tonight Callahan to the hole Cole Edmondson no problem at time toughguy quarterbacks showing his grid as the Bears fight back at home threepoint game and Wako a soak but suddenly much happier crowd here in Waco jumping around at the timeout going to give the barest of energy a threepoint game guys and the sidelines doing the same number seeing that sign over the years in the very birth underdogs and pulled off surprises come in and as favorites tonight over Oklahoma another handful Evans with a breeze in the back oops it to Ross who will bring it out Alex rocks straight up the middle drag down at the 23 hour LG v10 moments of the day two unbeaten teams and two rally in the fourth quarter to stay unbeaten Oklahoma State was down 17 an Iowa State came back to win by four not scoring the Cyclones 14zip sets up the potential showdown at home next week against Baylor Michigan a late touchdown to force overtime one in double overtime in Bloomington and Houston they were down by 22 Memphis in the fourth quarter 135 34 for the big rally late as the Cougars stay unbeaten in Oregon knocking off Stanford on the road ending the Cardinal playoff votes mix it Faris trick them out from full off the exhaust shot ultimate get penetration a slow mixing down but how about the rest of this defense anticipating run and being mixed into the corner there they try to outflank them there's just nowhere to go watch the speed in this defense open get some penetration slows him down but looking at outside there the whole hood black jersey come on Blanche here again just selling out with effort at play may feel rolling she throws it into the benches he threw out the flag comes in Blanchard with pressuring him so is Palmer Mayfield slow to get up personal foul first caller Pacal's defense number 48 sissie yard penalty automatic first down she wasn't exactly did grab the horse collar at main field that's Blanchard there as he was throwing the ball away Blanchard again with that speed right there with the right hand pulls the back of that Jersey right in front of the referee such a potential for injury and a tackle like this pull backward you could see I may feel grabbed his leg after the task looking at the ankle or the knee he's up though and ready to play the next down and brings the field position up to the 32 a field still he's in the both quarterbacks series rented elegantly through his hands now it's Bert Sorel birth to safety just in a secondary on his back that was that was a called injury by Baylor's Ryan Reed number nine he told Burt you're supposed to be hurt go down I've never seen anything like that my life watches he actually go know you're hurt you're down okay man I got you what what are we doing here why do we do it he said it's a called injury yeah yeah it's like oh yo yo yo you're down you're down that is I'm wrong I'm not sure that actually even helps the defense at that point I mean big thing was hurting himself now he's gonna fake a limp I mean if that is bush league I don't get that that's the kind of thing that you like to criticize soccer one of my favorite sports for the kind of acting job of it is its football it's unethical you don't do that that's awful now you're going to fake it all the way through then hustle back out player to later what would be possibly hurt then got up and tried to get off now he was ready to play they're carrying through this thing they're good didn't you meet Nazi charade first dinner they filled that time but it has a lot of room Mayfield shaking diving to midfield he is ripping his arm both quarterbacks just battling through some pain but they move the chains again again mantoman coverage with an athletic quarterback you've got to be very careful if you're not going to spy on spy him with a linebacker he's going to have a lot of room to run in fact we've seen Baker Mayfield tonight recognize that man under coverage and take off and run and pick up big yards get those rubber pellets that are in the field all over its faces base in the past given care Iran muscled forward for just a few you know you talk about this conference Kirk and that's all about to be nasty it didn't really hit or tackler play deep as we're seeing the opposite of that today without it down if people not seen a lot of big 12 football they're they have to be appreciating the contact physicality the way these teams are playing on both sides of the football yeah you're seeing some point you're seeing two defenses fly around and make some plays and you're seeing two defenses you're really good to be under stressed aren't they in the final nine minutes both offenses to begin to crank it up and run lots of snaps play action on second down Mayfield has time did he find a receiver flips it complete first down at the 40 yard line and DD Westbrook he took a shot at the a play what he did there as he was trying to get the ball to his main man tonight throwing the ball to sterling Shepard but he's taken away watch him come off of him in the middle shows the patience then eventually fini Westbrook breaks free good job of improvising there by Westbrook and a nice Delphi Mayfield seeing him good toughness the receiver had to know he was going to take a big shot after that catch here I'm hammers a head down by the ankle but he's got a first down inside the 30 it was singleton saving a touchdown he follows Orlando Brown the freshman left tackle and Jonathan Alvarez watch the two big fellows lead the way on a counter play opens it up and again he's got the confederation for his size at 2:30 on Ridgid 57 yards for be Ryan as a matter of course Dan Ron hard affirmed yard Baylor linebackers and safety starting to really get involved in the run game doing everything they can to try to slow down some by JP Ron the battle will be seven minutes to go here at threepoint game there's using some play clock here second down throw near side catch make effort at around first and go Oklahoma oneonone matchup sterling Shepherd matched up against a safety singleton who is in this football game right now look at the cushion that singleton gives Shepherd because of the appreciation respect of how he can get by him vertically but a mismatch when you have your best receiver in the quickest receiver up against a backup safety in that time Baker Mayfield is allocated to make a nice throw targeted 15 times he's made 13 catches he goes out now Andrews the freshman has had a tough night back in the game to the right of the formation and the clock was running down Oklahoma has to spend its second time out Stoops frustrated did not want to get back to five yards there that's for sure Bob wants this one today he's got a little bit of fire going tonight he sure did in the pregame warmup he was extra involved he would love to throw the headset but he kicks it it had a visor and the hood let me throw that thing in it Oh tangled up so they did not get the time out that's why I was frustrated was a delay so first and goal they sling it far side Mixon and I break a tackle muscled out by Blanchard again talk about a difference in what may transpire here in these next two or three plays Chris under six minutes to go you kick a field goal you go off by thick and you get Baylor the ball you score a touchdown and you go up by ten and it's a two possession game this these next two or three plays are vitally important will they be a fiveyard penalty but the source of fury for Stoops fake it to mix it may feel on the run keeps it knocked out inside the ten there will be third and goal I'll spot the ball down has the seventh we've seen sterling Shepherd in somebody's red zone here is checked out of the game for the larger Mark Andrews at six five and looks like Andrews will come back into the game but this time you're going to see sterling Shepherd stay in the game if you lined up in the slot there's Andrews dirty' go another huge play vodka suits longest time out he was kind of working his sideline prowling towards the official couldn't tell he was people make the call or not what will the suitors call third and goal coming up next the Baylor defense has lost three starters injury tonight Orion Stewart and chance Volvo safety than both last year kind of dig in deep Kirk on third and goal Oklahoma comes out in the exact same formation where they have the taller receiver Andrews and also Shepherd right here the slot here I missed the back Phares rush only three may feel working working scrambling retreating fire Julieta perfect senator flowers extending the play showing patient to look at Trevor Knight last year starter off the celebrate would may feel there that play is kind of symbolic of the night in the season the Baker Mayfield his habit is Oklahoma Sooners offense you thought he might give up on the play you thought he might throw it away put his H back who was in blocking Flowers talk about Mayfield was going to get the credit with Dimitri flowers with blocking he wasn't even going out for a pass and he turned around and figured out keep your eye on this guy right here and this play takes a long time but he is in blocking waiting waiting you think he might run and then he decides right here to take off and try to get out into the open field I can't believe none of the linemen went down field in fact the freshman Samiha the right tackle actually did the right tackle 75 promote Lahoma he's almost here the goal behind again blame the Mayfield is failing for 15 seconds back there the Flowers has made two catches tonight both of them huge one setting up a touchdown and now that touchdown gives Oklahoma a 10point lead instead of five minutes to go and may have been their crucial play they also Sooners get some payback against Baylor I cannot say enough about make Baker Mayfield the energy the heart that he possesses and how his team feeds off of him remember he made the mistakes Blanchard had the report he went right away to the offensive lineman it's took ownership with a mistake these guys hang with me I'm going to make up for that and he's played beautifully since that mistake yeah down this whole offense is done such a remarkable job since the game in Texas against the Longhorns where they lost and had a miserable day offensive ly I was wonderful it couldn't find a scholarship in the 100 I'm just saying this one yes the engine gets knocked down at the 30 yard line so Baylor's got to show serious urgency over on ESPN tonight after the wazoo UCLA game stick around for Sports Center at night to recap of another eventful Saturday in college before SportsCenter at night also streamed live on the watch ESPN app maybe you're talking about a Baylor offense specializes in scoring and under two minutes they can score in a hurry and that's exactly what it's gonna take right here from Stu them in his group of wide receivers to make some big plays something that's been tough for them to do into sooner secondary sinem downfield intercepted trying to take his shot Ahmad Thomas came across and make the catch and that might do it for Oklahoma this secondary give him so much abuse and grooves so embarrassed but the last two meetings how sweet is this celebration well it's an amazing way to potentially wrap this up Mike Stoops deserves a ton of credit taking so much heat Norman for the way his defenses afforded some of these bigger games giving up a lot of points giving up a lot of plays they put a plan together and his players went out and executed tonight Amon Thomas in the middle of your field he actually does a good job of reading the eyes at a young freshman quarterback who stares down jaylee when a few times we've seen him make a mistake show his youth he stair J lead down in amman Thomas to junior for Miami read it and jumped it and comes up with maybe to play the game third turnover for the Bears who are a minus two in that department we were plus 11 coming in Iran short game again look at the last couple years rush yards 377 Pass yards last year again ripped up on the ground a couple years ago didn't have a takeaway neither game kirkin three tonight yeah I think that's the difference of you can see there's still some points pins for but Patek Baylor I got a news story I don't care who you are you're going to give up some points when you try to slow these guys down and I think there's just the it was a different plan there was a different level of confidence in the secondary tonight from Oklahoma and on the defensive line those are the two areas when you look at them the last two years on film and you look at them this year totally different group of athletes on the defensive line depth and that secondary they played their hearts out if you wondered Oklahoma came from 17 down to win over time in Knoxville just failed to show up in Dallas everything that wrong against Texas you wonder what's going on in Norman is that no energy there's no vitality the certainly Sheppard told me they had a players only meeting a team meeting they told the coaches hey we got to start practicing faster with more odor to be playing faster and this seemed still had a lot to play for at that point will be wondered Kirk with the last four games they were blasted people but how much of that was level of copy how good really was this team for finding out tonight and that was only fair it was only fair to look at how much they had improved from Texas and to wonder you're right is it because they're playing sexist back in Kansas some of the others or is it because they've actually improved I think look tonight especially on the offense from where they were that night that they played in Dallas because where they are now it's a totally different feel and different looking team first in the big 12 was all going to be about the stretch run for all of these containers and Stormin Norman work element is he see you comes calling trevone Boykin and leaves the game and ugly whenever Kansas today with an ankle we certainly hope he is okay and then Baylor if they don't come back here off their first loss got to go regroup playing so otter where they've had their problems over there in Oklahoma State survived today and Ames and remain unbeaten and remember everybody has to go to Stillwater all the contenders Baylor and TCU Friday after Thanksgiving and then bedlam of course Mayfield depth up delivers Hereford one more cast Sheppard spins and knocks down at the 40 yard line and Shepherd within a catch now equaling that school record for reception in a game he's got 14 Oklahoma not stepping off the gas a fan of it sterling Shepherd a senior a guy that probably could have come out last year his father played for ou you the story's welldocumented how he was around the locker room after his father passed away Bob Stoops reached out to him when he's just a little guy he grew up around the locker room grew up loving the Sooners and got everything he can in glass two or three years he's been disappointed at times and trying to put it all together tonight has had a career night here I'm first down Shepard again knocks out in the first quarter a couple years ago in the loss couldn't play at all last year was injured had a groin injury had to helplessly stand and watch his team get blown out at home and he just sent every vote from a player we talked to the eagerness the energy the anticipation for this game that I mean it's played out yeah their pride was on the line you know what I mean they they felt that you know all due respect to Baylor and when Baylor is done to them they body dies it missed him and they fell to a weekly we still have a lot of pride as a program and we're embarrassed by what's happened let's go to Waco and see if we're good enough to beat a really good team dear I'm short game talked about instead Oklahoma game this is going to be the fifth straight game the Sooners have gained 500 yards offense their streak of 50plus points maybe stop it this is Devon fence is going to be very difficult for anybody yeah especially with Baker may feel the way he's playing you know we heard this week about Jason White who won a Heisman Trophy and Sam Bradford who won a Heisman Trophy in Norman and you start to look nine or ten games into a season and you compare what Baker Mayfield has done to two guys that won the Heisman he started to look at his numbers did he begin to make sure that this solution got out there tonight he has him and he's been basically big he should be I agree this is the County game again elevates it here's the key before the quarterback the slides on my carpet for a first down and they'll continue to chew on clock and that's good just about do available just one time out because what doesn't show up and if you watch this game for four quarters and you watch this team play this year they feed off of him that that's the difference the intangibles the heart the fire again I have not seen an Oklahoma quarterback in a long time that had such an impact on his team so it's not just putting his stats next for these others it's what he does to his team and how they feed off of his energy great different County quarterback from Sam Bradford who was a yayan player more cerebral perhaps I rehab acutely but that in fact that he's got his guys in a way maybe not with the fire but we've seen the recognition tonight from from this young man he's made great throws this is a touchdown earlier in the first half I've been blown away to see his arm strength in person and of course he has what it takes the improvised create the mobility to be able to try to keep a play alive the ability to extend plays and this is the last touch timing instead of giving up on it he believed in his team his players and his own athletic ability and comes up with big play after big play bears are going to lose for the first time in McLean Stadium they have been average margin of 32 points and their 20 game home winning streaks goes back to Floyd Casey's snaps here board wrapup show with Cassidy Cassidy Hubbard is coming up right after the game the Sooners are in victory formation a very very satisfying win on that level but also a crucial omegas Oklahoma C ranked 12 for this legend a very shaped thing as we start to stack these oneloss teams after what we've seen from Oklahoma since their loss to Texas and with everybody that potentially they're going to start losing ahead of them Oklahoma throws their hat into the ring with all those other one loss games and they still had TCU and bedlam with Oklahoma State in front of them boomer sooner comes to Waco and beats the Bears very different handshake last year when soup suffered his worst home loss ever at the hands of Ryles cursory and a handshake browns to Mayfield Shepard monster night didn't quite get the record fell one catch short he didn't care about that dad Heather my chopsticks Chris thanks so much coach congratulations after two years of frustration against this team what did your team show you tonight like really well they executed well both sides of the ball came up with big plays you know played within ourselves and played a good game your offense is an entirely different offense than it was even at the beginning of the season how did it help you tonight but you know staying on the field making big plays Baker Mayfield again was incredible and you know when you're going to play better through you got to score keep them on the bench and move the ball and we were able to do that five games ago hard to believe this very same team lost to Texas since then what has changed about the Sooners well we're you know the execution overall is has improved every week and they come in here and their place and when here was another good win and let's talk about your brother and what his defense did for you guys slowing down this very prolific Baylor often how did they do it yeah the entire defense was great first we controlled the run game after the first series and then we made we cover them we we challenged them our secondary they did a great job covering break into the ball and challenging the receivers Congrats on great well thank you Chris the Oklahoma fans Kirk in the upper Decker whooping and hollering as the Studer celebrate in the opposite corner Bob Stoops very very satisfying when this has to rank up for him in recent years this is a huge win for for Bob Stoops it's obviously a big win for the program but Bob Stoops you know he has dealt with some things where fans and and you know media people kind of gone after them as a program in the big game Bob moniker that's been out there and people kind of kind of taken some shots at him so this this was big for him and big for this team is they try to compete in 2015 but just in a broader sense for his legacy and showing people that Bob Stoops and Oklahoma still matter in the big 12 big night video fest for the AT&amp;T strong for who wants to focus on the three offensive stars for Oklahoma Baker Mayfield threw for 270 and three touchdowns ran for 76 yards and one here on at a buck 66 Shepard again 14 catches and two touchdowns back to Heather with Mayfield thanks so much Baker had in incredible numbers Chris as you mentioned also wipe the game ball here now that tucked away in his helmet he told me not to tell but I had to bust on you Baker you think they're going to find out yeah they'll find out now you get you busted me what was the difference tonight back and forth you threw a pick six early and you gritted it out what do you think was the xfactor just focusing and doing our job I mean that that interception is all my fault if I'm going to miss anywhere on a pass I gotta miss outside and that kid made a good play on it and so I learned from my mistakes and I was more aggressive from there I heard you go to your offense after that after that interception and tell them you know what you just said it was my bad it won't happen again where is that belief and that confidence come from I believe in my guys and right now we have an incredible team I believe in us and I think we can go wherever we think we can so I mean I'm process and so I mean I'm confident us right now that's where I come from what has changed about this offense and this overall team five five games ago we saw you guys lose now we see you guys just conquering the world out here with an incredible often what's been the difference I mean we went into Texas and we were kind of I mean we were focused about the atmosphere I mean we weren't focused about doing our job and the details and that's what this whole offensive about it's about doing your job down in and down out and so when we do that we're successful that's what we've been focusing on Congrats on the great linnbaker enjoy that game boss who don't give it back secret your mother's situm tough second star for this freshman will have a big future yeah Oakland when you look at that that Red River performance it really is one of the outliers of the season it's the one really good game that Texas has played all year wondered about Oklahoma as you see Mike scoops bath of the press box celebrating the nail Kurt you have to really rethink Oklahoma as a foil and agender why not a oneloss team from this conference if the students can take care of TCU and as of now unbeaten Oklahoma State we're going to move up obviously this week in the rankings and now they start to become we said earlier one of the teams of all the one lost teams the Texas loss will hurt them if they get into the end of the year and it's a one loss Notre Dame who who took care of Texas and a one loss Oklahoma that could hurt them potentially but a thing you have to remember is baby Baylor and Waco a good Baylor team they still have a chance to play TCU they still have a chance to go out and play Oklahoma State in Stillwater so a lot of visited is in front of them and if that happens every year teams are going to lose in front of you if you keep winning you're going to keep climbing at the very least if they were to win out they're going to be in the discussion for sure Baylor which came in with strengths of schedule issues you would have to feel like this loss is going to knock them out of contention they could potentially be a spoiler our brows wouldn't like that label but they go to Oklahoma State which had to survive today names we're down to five unbeaten teams Clemson Ohio State Oklahoma State Iowa and that which came back you and I have covered this Oklahoma team since 2000 many many times and we've seen them even win national championships I don't know if I have ever seen a group of Oklahoma players and coaches so excited after a win than what we're witnessing right now this obviously meant a lot to them the opportunity and the challenge to come to Waco to take on this talented Baylor team yep the pentup frustrations the embarrassment of recent years but also what it means for their season the Oklahoma Sooners come as underdogs to Waco and knock off the bears by 10 putting themselves very much in the playoff conversation 44 34 is the final for Oklahoma here at McLean Stadium tonight's game was produced by Bill Bernal directed by Derrick mably for our entire crew which braved the elements here in Waco and for Kirk Herbstreit and Heather Cox I'm Chris Fowler saying so long from Waco or Mayfield and the centers are elated with themselves tonight and why not the Ford wrap up show coming up right now as we kick it up to catch the hover Cassidy you
