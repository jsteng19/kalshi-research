============================================================

Jim Tressel's the calm before the storm a short time ago the Buckeyes made their traditional walk from st. John arena into the horseshoe where they've ripped off 13 consecutive wins one of the great settings in all of college football Ohio Stadium in Columbus better than a hundred five thousand on and today is a 12th ranked Buckeyes take on the Akron Zips and of course one of the most enduring traditions in all the land script Ohio performed by the Ohio State University marching ban and the donning of the eye everybody alongside Charles Davis Tom Tom Brennaman welcome to the Big Ten Network well Charles you and I saw these Buckeyes in the national championship last year stars all over the field especially on offense and especially at quarterback where now they try and replace the Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith so it's 2007 that means it's time for a new star quarterback and Todd Beckman wants to be that guy his first start for Ohio State against Youngstown State last week very efficient with the football he threw the ball quite well 17 of 23 his head coach Jim Tressel gave him great opportunities and he produced two touchdowns aided especially by his junior wide receiver Brian Rowe Biscay got all agonda gate very strong in his first game nine catches 153 yards the only thing he didn't do was get in the end zone but Ohio's day one please not worried about it now the Akron Zips won their season opener last week beating army 22 to 14 they returned nine starters on defense so they very much believe that is the strong suit of this team as well as they play a different style of 3:35 defense and last week one of their quarterbacks the aptly named Reggie corner led this ballclub a 74 yard interception return for a touchdown against army turned the game around and led to a big Akron victory today that 335 defense must control the frontline of Ohio State for Akron have a shot so here we go week number two of the Big Ten Network the Akron Zips in town to take on the Buckeye you SiC tender for football is brought to you by US Bank home of the fivestar service guaranteed by Cooper Tires don't give up a thing and buy Buffalo Wild Wings you have to be here along the Olentangy River we welcome you to Ohio Stadium in Columbus JD Pro card in his fourth season 42 years old a native of Denver Colorado 19 and 18 coming off a season in which his hips were 5 and 7 Jim Tressel 54 years young from Mentor Ohio in his seventh season at Ohio State and what a run it's been six bowl appearances for BCS games for 10 1 years 3 Big Ten titles and a national championship the pleasure to be joined by the third member of our broadcast team today charissa Thompson hello charissa alright last week Jim Tressel got a win over the first team he won a national championship with Youngstown State this week he looks across the field at another familiar team trouble first job was at Akron as a graduate assistant where he got his master's in education in fact the last time that Russell has faces it was six years ago to the date and by the way that was also started the Jim Tressel era here at Ohio State hard to believe isn't it Charles it was seven years ago now take a look at young coached Russell just married just graduating from baldwinwallace and here he is 30plus years later the main man at Ohio State University and described in that media guide as one of the bright young coaches in the country they knew what they were talking about didn't it Russell of course taking Ohio State to the national championship game where they won in 2002 they were losers really in a stunning game last year Charles you and I were there in Phoenix Arizona went Florida just wiped out Ohio State and many wondered how this team this year would recover from and I think that most of the people that were wondering is more of the fan base I don't think the team ever had a doubt that they would recover because of how they do things within their program they use it as fuel but they don't dwell on it they have moved on to 2007 to start anew well the Buckeyes have won the toss elected to receive and we mentioned last week one of the rule changes a significant change in college football you now kickoff from the 30 rather than the 35 five extra yards of coverage space for the guys running down field means you're probably using more front line better absolute guys to go downfield and cover kickoff here kick returner fuel up this new rule longer return it's Anderson Russell and they run deliver coming back the other way and that is Brandon saying the freshman sensation out of Piqua Ohio a 39yard returns so a great field position for the Ohio State Buckeyes and we will be calling Brandon Saenz named a great deal today a 10 3 8 100meter sprinter watch right here here comes same this way and the wall is set up back this way for him nice job by safety there's one or two blocks then he uses that sprinter speed the 100 meter champion in Ohio last year all right from the 40 world we're going to hand it off the prints were when he lost his footing and picks up maybe a yard Todd Beckman the redshirt junior he's 23 years old out of Saint Henry Ohio that's the same high school that has produced Buckeye greats Bobby Hein and Jim Lachey a very solid debut as a starter last week did not throw an interception through two touchdowns and hit on 17 of 23 wels aunt Maureen swells in the backfield shorter and it's incomplete to Brian Hartline Ohio State in their backfield and their wide receivers some very talented players but extremely young Deante Johnson the only senior of the group will Biscay coming off the nine reception game for 153 yards last week upfront Kirk Barton the firstteam allamerican candidate he is one of the truck captains for the Buckeyes Alex Boone returns as a starter so 250 brennan third down and 10 on a shotgun Beckmann incomplete so it's three and out for the Buckeyes as Beckman has taken down to the turf by Breann Stokes the senior linebacker out of Charlotte North Carolina Jim Fleming the defensive coordinator for Akron loaded up on the third and long and blitz Todd Beckman and played straight man to man coverage in the secondary neroli gamble that pays off for the zip very dangerous return man and Andre Jones in the third quarter in the opening weekend against Garden he returned to punch 63 yard aj4 Pacho puts a foot on it and it will fall and check back up and it's gone by simpler the 24 yard line so now Akron will take over on offense we told you the Zips won their opener last week against arming at 22 14 they have a firstyear starter at quarterback who until last week had never thrown a pass in fact had never played a game Chris Jeff Levine a sophomore the Painesville Ohio very athletic and he just edged out Carlton Jackson for that starting quarterback spot Pacifica playing firsthand a squeeze and a pretty good gain on first half nearly a game of nine to Brian Williams the junior out of Akron bucktail high school take a look at Akron in the backfield Dennis Kennedy rushed for better than 900 yards last year despite missing almost two full games Joe Perry Arthur coming off a monster debut 11 catches for $125 in a touchdown Chris chemi will up tackle grew up about five miles from here when what's up erotic in high school a firstteam All MAC performance Williamson motion are going to put the ball in his hands again and not much room he has run down and thrown to the turf by Larry great what they did was they spread out no one in the backfield and number six larry grant makes the play what they did was they tried to run a screen a swing screen with to lead blockers but Larry grant was unblocked came underneath the play and spilled it for nearly a loss well as you can tell by now it is a hurryup offense for the shotgun just seen look at more than no public did not curry the tenth I have no mother being there played from the Crime Line Road clock down to warm a pair was getting off and a handoff finish to Kennedy when he's out close to the 39 yard line defensively for the Buckeyes boy you talk about young five sophomores a redshirt freshman for juniors only one senior they lost Lawrence Wilson along their defensive front last week Robert rules a man who replaces him mister everything for Ohio State the middle and in the secondary Malcolm Jenkins a firstteam allamerican candidate after just to patrol a free time on third down they're going to cash in on third down here crossing midfield and in the Buckeye territory is to Barry Arthur a senior out of Montreal Quebec Canada when you play against the spread style of offense every coach will tell you tackling in open field or in space is critical look at the move to Barry Arthur number 12 late on Malcolm Jenkins number two one of the better tacklers in the secondary jenkin he was shaken on that play by deber√≠a Arthur low again at 16 that went on the move back to back first hands wide receiver on a short catch and that again is Jim Barry Arthur so he's off to the kind of start he had last week against gar me on the first drive live as imps he caught four passes for 53 yards in a touchdown Charles our Suzuki keys to the game for Akron it's Rover in the band at the two positions in the second area that are hybrid safeties and linebackers if they can wreak havoc on Ohio State's offense that'll help Akron Ohio State Bexon beans Todd Beckman the quarterback throwing the ball and beany wells the running backs they need to get him started after a tough place to hit in the opener movement along the offensive front for Akron it looks like we talked about without the lesson I'll start we often remember 74 second down that a steep payment on referee today they can't make those kind of mistakes to have any hope today and they have such momentum going on offense right now the last thing you want to do is shut things down that's Christmas candy number 74 the young man who grew up would you say about five miles from here if that Upper Arlington High they faked the handoff Jacklyn under heavy pressure and closed it away den lagarde trying to run him down along with Doug Worthington it was the first one there they're liking what they're getting out of Doug Worthington number 84 he's the guy who had to jump in this year with some losses along the defensive line he got bigger and stronger during his career and they say he's had an excellent fall or receiver set here obviously 12:2 gotta keep an eye on Arthur at the top of your screen the screen is better than the man you just talked about Doug Worthington got a pawn and he read it so well it wasn't just making an athletic play it was a smart play he read his key and when he Briana said screen watch Worthington here 84 when he sent his screen see that he's already on to the play he's backing up into the pattern and used that big paw to knock it away and that penalty really hurt him on that run they were second and three it back him up to second Nate you nailed that one as soon as soon as it happened you said Akron can't afford those types of penalties and it came to pass installed their Drive John stucked upon it from his own 45 row this key will let it sail over his head and then inside the three by his hip the Amaury dips and flying down the field excellent work by step solo the Buckeyes started from their own three on their second drive the guide punting there John stick I'm not sure how much work he needs to get done right now this pooch kicking because this one is absolutely perfect going to Penn Ohio State deep down by number eight Amari Dixon's the captain of the special teams for Akron Ohio State has 98 yards to go now they try them set Johnson leading the way for way and he crosses out a safety boiling for an official signal says on the ball spot looks like they're gonna say he's outside of the end zone yep Breann Stokes again coming up to make the stop and JD Brookhart saying you sure hey Brianna Stokes is off to an allconference year right now not just today well that's close cuz beanie well barely getting the ball out of the end zone watch where he's sit where he's hit see where he's hit but watch where the ball lands right outside of the end zone Ohio State fortunate on this play there's the initial contact by Stokes and the ball lands just pass the goal line Tom Stokes had a terrific ballgame last week I think they're replaying this Charles yeah well they should be because you want to make sure you get this right you do not want to take away a great play for accurate see where the ball hit from that angle you would be inconclusive so you see if they said right there from that angle it being conclusive so you have to go with the play called on the field that's deep payment the referee getting the word from up top John Langdon the replay official take a look from this angle Stokes put the hit the contact down looks like the balls hitting on the goal line now they have to determine whether he was far enough over the goal line again from that angle again inconclusive there let's try this one again he's reaching it out goal down you see the goal line kind of underneath here's my you know what was I oh for one last week on this huh alright I'm going to go for another one they're going to say that the play will stand as called on the field all right well least you're going out on a limb why not man while it is starting to rain here in Columbus and that certainly was part of the forecast we heard last night and early this morning the oldest part of the country has had very little if any rain the entire summer after review video replay reverses the ruling on the field the runner was down smoking interface here I'm all for to smoke the Tulsa Safety Day Akron has a two nothing lead after the great punt by step pinned Ohio State from its own two yard line on a first down carry by wells he's dropped in the end zone twonothing zips the play that was made was terrific by Briana Stokes who last week against army came out and really played well last week he had three tackles for a loss including the sack now we've got another tackle for a loss including a safety Briana Stokes playing at a very high level early in the season we talked to Jim Bollman the Ohio State offensive coordinator about not naming an offensive alignment of the week the Parker award as they give out and he said well the media and the fans made a much bigger deal out of that minute you got him right but clearly I mean untouched there with Stokes on an unquestioned running play on first and and I would never be one to question a coach he's in there every day in the trenches with his guys I've watched a lot of the Youngstown State game they did struggle on upfront and my estimation they had trouble moving people even though they were playing eight nine men in the box which makes it harder Ohio State's gotta find a way to start getting knocking some holes in the defensive front we're not opponent of course from their own 20yard line and bringing it out across the 20 to 30 and lots of Running Room all the way out to the 47 yard line is Andre Jones so all of a sudden the zips here and we're not even five minutes into the game certainly have everything going their way including a douse cloud and don't forget this last week against Army Afrin was very strong in the return game that 274 total yards in the time including the interception that Andre Jones did a great job on punt return and Brian Lynch a great job on kickoff return first concepts from the 37 that great field conviction don't be surprised if they hit the sack convicted night on Ohio State on their yield exist for another five we just again get it on Jaclyn and on the pressure walks it down the sidelines a dangerous road and defend it beautifully by Ohio State defensively Malcolm chickens hard to pick on him take a look at our yield guard Beatty triple Defensive Player of the Week in the Big Ten last week and I was shown Lee of a Nittany Lion dan Conner gets all the attention at Penn State and rightly so because he's a great linebacker DeSean way made it made his presence felt again for it international terrific opener for him what coming out to the quarterback he's able to jump it off and then the Laurinaitis wraps him up from behind maybe a gain of two that will bring up third down and long for the zips likes the pressure immediately that flushes Jeff remain the quarterback that's where he grant number six Worthington number 84 with the second bit of contact on it so he has to find a place to get rid of the football and had to flex it short and allow skate swallowed it up we're down an eight they need to get to the Ohio State 43 they ran out of time throw down all these fans at Ohio Stadium new the rain was in the forecast they all brought plenty of rain gear and they're making plenty of noise they were they got into their rain gear in less time it takes a sprinter to run a 40yard dash the deepest coordinated gym Haycock want to heat up a young quarterback here jackeline through the hands and nearly intercepted by Jenkins right through the myths of Kennedy so again a big penalty by Akron and they'll have to punt it away exactly Jim peacock this time he brought an extra man on the pass rush turned into a five man rush and played played defense behind it and when the ball went off the kennedys hand now the Dickens had to play in front up and just unable to come up with the ball that was a nice defensive possession for Ohio State stunned a brilliant punt it's pinned Ohio State inside its own two yard line the ensuing safety and now will this keep hands at his own 17 angling towards the sideline will this key lets it mountain all the way inside the 10 and down to the 7 yard line perhaps a mistake there by Brian Rowe Biscay which you always tell your partner Turner to go get the football don't give up the hidden yardage 51 yard booth by step today thank you very much Miami takes second in the Eastern Division of the midamerican conference behind their bitter rivals Ohio University the Bobcats run that division last year Akron took third this year and Chris Wells tumbles his way out to the 10 yard line much was made about Wells in his opening game performance 16 carries 48 yards 20 of those came on one rushing attempt and obviously this is the USA TODAY's high school player of the year yeah and they've been talking about him trying to trying to find the holes to run through as well as running and that was the three previous play on defense for Ohio State finished off the drive work hopefully they got an extra rusher on the play finish things up but they've got to find a way to get could run started if he's going through the Bellefontaine tailback they put the handoff that controls that and dumps it up to his tight end Rory nickel and he's out maybe a gain of three so another third down for the Buckeyes they're looking for their first first down today and the guy who made the tackle was number 19 John Mackay remember I talked about Rovers in bandit he plays one of those position a hybrid guys strong safety outside linebacker type who's always around the football Akron has a lot of quickness on defense so anything you throw it short they feel like they can run it down third and four pole monsters are coming out to definitely delivers it but good enough for a first down again at the Titan Rory nickel who only caught one pass last week has backtoback catches they move the chains for the first time after a gain of six and you can tell early in this game that Jim Fleming the defensive coordinator of admin has a lot of confidence in his defense why because this is the second time at least a team with a brush seven and played great man the man in the secondary they're not even playing with a free safety over the top to go oneonone coverage and he feels like his guys can play with the Ohio State guys Ohio State having to spend a timeout it is a sluggish start to say the least I'll stay for the Ohio State University offense Floyd flock was all the way down to two seconds and they had to spend their first timeout twonothing acronym front 717 to play in the opening quarter take a look at our US bank Big Ten records only three losers in the conference last week and a first significant run of the afternoon for Chris Wells he's out across a 25yard line a gain of six back for the sophomore out of Akron Ohio so the obvious thing in the conference games of course with Michigan's loss last week without Blatche and state that's the first thing you focus on Minnesota walked at home to a good Bowling Green team added to Mac in Illinois of course lost a rivalry game against Missouri out of the I formation forget it swells and that's been the story through the first game and nearly a quarter for Chris wells behind his offensive line not much running room a stop made by the junior linebacker from Tampa Doug Williams he also had help from mr. great too early to draw any conclusions but based on what I've seen so far to combo not much room to run and Chris Wells us a little bit tentative at time you might have to just put his head down and create his own space at times when there isn't anywhere to go course Wells was injured an ankle in the spring as you look at Jim Fleming the thirdyear defensive coordinator for the Zips really aggravated that ankle in doing in the summer and now they set up the screen the freshmen Blandon staying in what a play made in the open field by reggie corner a preseason old Mac performer and his court year as a starter for the zips watch to the left of your screen Reggie corner beats the block by the freshman Dane sods and baakir number 12 and comes up underneath to finish off the play very nicely done on the corner by mr. corner the late great Trapasso will punt from his own 10yard line Andre Jones waiting back and a good punt by Perpetual over one at a 25 and a fair catch made like their way 50yard booth by the junior from just down the road and Pickerington Ohio well now Akron will get the football with a two nothing lead 5:16 a plenty opening quarter and certainly JV Brookhart has to feel very good about the way things are started they look like a corner man at a boxing match doesn't get the towel over his shoulder but so far his team joins including their own puncher they had it all look keeping it on the option is the quarterback check women and he's tripped up by Marcus Freeman end by Anderson Russell whether to show for all big 10 fans featuring highlights analysis interviews and so much more the big ten tonight every night right here on the Big Ten Network 10 he's been nine central good pickup four yards now supplemental looking over the side ride and checking on state moving around a lot on defense to give him different work they pick up the Blitz and dump it off the Tuffy he was over in tack where the ball is loose it looked like it was last touched by Ohio State but went out of bounds and so they have to spotted where it went out of bounds last touched by Donald Washington and I believe it will bring up third down and short it should have been a first down I think Tom because I thought Ozzy right here after the big hit and then Kurt Coleman pops the ball free he was close to the first down marker but as you noted walking mountain and where it went out of bounds was behind the first down marker what does he he is a load out of Mayfield Pennsylvania 230 pounds pull back and he just ran right through Washington and the quarterback has moved out as Dennis Kennedy the tailback taking the snap and he's going to keep lunges forward appear to be short of the first down yeah I think that Ohio State stopped them there that's a pot that the formation has become very popular now when you have a multipurpose running back I like Darren McFadden at Arkansas where you ship the quarterback out direct snap it to your tailback and he can run her path from that kind of like a single wing football go after that third down and less than to Ohio State steps up defensively denying Kennedy the first down to the zip so punished every now and then time he's almost out guess yourself on offense yeah and get things working sometimes just want to keep moving the ball the way you should because anytime for a surprise doesn't pay off and you know I deflate the team a little bit you try something like Oh coach we were moving it bump it snap but stuck able to get it off row Biscay from his own 25 and a cloud of zips around him and he is shot down by John Mackey and yes that's the John Mackey who's here leading tackler on defense and what a great name a Hall of Fame football named John Mackey the great tight end with the Baltimore Colts this John Mackey is an allconference rover back well Big Ten fans next Saturday the action continues on the Big Ten Network it all begins with a pregame show and we look ahead to primetime after an early game will feature the Wisconsin Badgers against the Citadel but it will be Duke taking on Northwestern or other regional action check local listings for the game in your market package Gerald Wildcat have a chance for a really nice start to their season rain coming down even harder now and that man rolling left to throw on first down and it's Brian Hartline a first down out to the 41 yard line again a club nice job by Beckman Rowland they split the protection to his side meaning the lineman moved with him in order to protect him what they call front side allowed Beckman is set up and delivered downfield for a first down well Bettman better get him up to the line of scrimmage to play clock down to five maurice wells alone set back and he'll get the terror off the right side him is across the 45 to the 46 yard line a gain of five for maurice wells and decorated running back came out of Johnsonville Florida where he rushed for nearly 6,000 yards in his high school career there was talk last year after Chris Wells came on board and Antonio Pittman was only a junior last you decided to go to the NFL there was talking about Maurice wells perhaps transferring trying to find a place to play now we've got two tailback on the footer Maurice wells there and Chris well the two tailback no fullback play fake to Chris Wells and they roll out Beckman first down throw again Brian Hartline the longrange e sophomore out of North Canton Ohio at two catches last week backtoback catches a gain of eight on this Drive get the sense that Jim Tressel and Jim Bollman his offensive coordinator don't feel like beating their heads against the proverbial brick wall they're going to try and throw on nine throwing down in order to try and loosen up its Akron defensive front the shifting and moving and making it hard for them to run the football though the Buckeyes on the move crossing into Akron Territory for the first time today let me get over complete step for step wooden was D'Avanzo tape and had help behind him from Andre Jones that was actually well covered by Akron hate as you noted step for step foot heart line and has good position on the outside and Andre Jones coming from the inside the sandwich him over the top nice play by the safety always is deep as the deepest receiver if you're doing your job Andre Jones was exactly that but again it was a first down throw top nontraditional down Jim Tressel showing the ability to change up and play calling they're gonna give it time and then go all the way down to the 24 yard line so the first big gainer of the day really the first big gainer of the year for wills he picks up 24 he might be hurt so they throw the ball on first in ten incomplete come back with second and long looks like it's a path down they go with a basic run and Chris Wells breaks out for a huge gainer but as you noted Tom comes off the field seems to be holding his left side a little bit and now he's bent over almost like he's trying to work out something in his back so look at the blocking up front great job and a great job on the corner by number 86 Jake Ballard the tight end setting the point of attack and setting the corner look like oil just came down hard on that bit hopefully he'll be able to take it off and get back out there Maurice will comes in first and ten at the eccrine 23 and here is Maurice well and coming up to make the play is Mackie maybe getting back to the line of scrimmage as wells now we haven't heard a lot from Brandon saying the true freshman from taqua Ohio Ohio's mr. football last year a great student and a phenomenal athlete and runner they think he has big days ahead of Ohio State they thought they were getting a guy around 200 pounds coming out of high school but coach Drecker cost us a 223 or something like that guys 1 into 10 three 42:53 100 meters that's powering speed F take the hand off drop it off again Nick over tied in but right there with him step first up unable to make the tackle as Kevin grant cleared down up coming after a gain of two I think with Jim Tressel and Jim Bollman are discovering it throwing the ball short against Akron is difficult because of the three three five you have a lot of guys close to the line of scrimmage and an easy distance to cover the tight end in the back so Jim charcoal trying to push it downfield a few times to try and loosen them up Chris wills back in the game first pick third down play for Ohio State Beckman with good time and throws intercepted down at the 6 yard line by Reggie corner so clearly miscommunication there between Beckman and Brian Hartline who went to the inside rather than the outside and a huge defensive stop for the zips and that's one play where I think they'll tell Todd Beckman in the meeting take the sack watch how he double clutches before he even throws to think takes the sack at that point or just try and put your head down and get something and as you said a miscommunication you have the receiver going one way ball obviously going the other Akron the beneficiary so a sudden change now for the Ohio State defense this will be the final play perhaps of the opening quarter rain continuing to come down I'm down rather hard isolated on the left side is Stephan Brooklyn and he has shoved out of bounds of the fiveyard line actually the play clock continues to run and that will wind it down to the end of the opening quarter so through the first 15 minutes they're shaking their heads in Columbus Akron a 2 nothing lead and we're back to the horseshoe after these messages if well after a porter here in Columbus JD Brookhart asked appeal extremely pleased the way things of all it's a field position for Jessica Ohio State and down the middle glue the hand of the intended receiver Stefan fuqua let's send it back to Chicago for an update here's Dave Robson Tom bit of an upset brewing for you guys to things going according to the script in West Lafayette Curtis Painter here hitting Greg Orton for his second touchdown passing today boilers on top of Eastern Illinois 17 3 well Dave thank you very much meanwhile Donald Washington a sophomore out of Indianapolis and a starting cornerback for the Buckeyes is injured on the pull on the play he's making the play on the receiver and goes through him balls already gone tried to stripped him and comes down but he's walking off the field under his own powers that's always a good sign well they love the future of Donald Washington they talked about in last year even though he was saying like I say limited blowing time now he's a fulltime guy I said field position possession town here it is certain law Ohio State can get the ball back in great position stopping here for Adam seven is left in the cover and it's incomplete we'll stop indeed defensively for the Buckeyes for their defense has been lights out but the same holds true for the Akron defense so far the only thing missing for Ohio State on defense and creating a turnover they have not done that in their last three games going back to last year which is unusual for an Ohio State defense are playing well but they might need a turnover to help kickstart their offense then a great start for the sophomore out of Delray Beach Florida John Sketch this time he punched from his own endzone and Brian will this key stand in the field it's a nice pass for the six and then continues to roll inside the 40 so another excellent job by John stuck a 51yard punt a good field position for the Buckeyes if you want behindthescenes access then look no further than coaches QA the hourlong show gives you nothing but the best quotes from your favorite big 10 coach as they'll break down Saturday's game and get you revved up for next week's matchups coaches Q&amp;A Wednesdays at 7:00 Eastern on the Big Ten Network Tom you've already noted how well Akron is playing on special teams in this game those bark doesn't hurt when your head coach puts his full attention to a JV Brookhart heading up the special teams draft room the aforementioned Brandon sane comes on and he carries it brought the 40 out to the 43 yard line a gain of four for the freshman we talked about a moment ago a true freshman from pepper Ohio not only Ohio's mr. football but also the high school state champion in the 100 meters in the 400 meters and you know what they say about the 400 meters don't you that's a man's event because that's a fullout sprint at the long way to go that's what you used to run no no I've made it about 200 and then I've done seems still in the backfield a playful turn this time and they're looking down the field for 50 and it's intercepted about it by the cover man into the hands of John Mackey and guess who made the play initially we talked about of his Reggie corner number 20 he was the cover man because Todd Beckman this ball hangs up on it way too long in the air he's got to leave the receiver Revathy now goes and tries to play defensive back and knock it down but it goes into the hands of the huskily john mackey the rover position player who makes the interception Wow how about this start for the Akron Zips leading to nothing early in the second quarter for the patented pass by corner into the hands of Mackey second interception thrown by Cobb Beckman who did not have one last week and his hip tackle football and a firsttime carry is Alex Allen for a pickup of two and looks at it downstairs to charissa Thompson quick update on Donald Washington who went down a couple plays ago no official report from the Ohio State sidelines but they did put a back brace on him so it appears to be a lower back situation but he is back in the game Marissa thank you very much but she in the hospital area Koya over all over that way thank you for that update but they might have a little bit of screen based on that did a painting showed their decadent long now for Akron we got the call found out into the fog master possible they hand it off again to Allen and again just not much running room the Buckeyes are saying the football is loose and is it no in stripes making any movement but you give it a shot right absolutely inside handoff if the defensive end crashes down inside the court if that pulls it out of the belly the running back and takes it outside we're down at 7:05 on third down conversions today I think they're going to go after him right here I go how they want the time free the good play the play clock nearly expired so the ships have to say hang on a minute it's their first charge timeout but a crowd of over a hundred five thousand looking for something anything to get excited about nothing Afrin with 1224 to play the Hat put it down upcoming for the Akron Zips leading to nothing early on in the second quarter they need to get to the 26 Lew the team jack will mean now first out of the pocket and just throws it away under heavy pressure by Goulston and Larimore nice job by Jim hey cocky defense Cornero house that he showed pressure it looked like Ohio State was bringing everyone and at the last second they pulled out and went to deep coverage and I think that threw off Chris Jacqueline Mane's read to those guys looking den they've been vacated out and went back and covered and now he's looking to throw and he sees Marcus Freeman in his line of sight he sees number 5 Tim de Zeeuw qua number in his line of sight nowhere to go with the ball so now coming from his own end zone his step they're forced to his own end zone standing at his own five step has had an outstanding day today police it and another real good pot here will Biscay the fair catch and steps out of bounds at the 34 yard line so while we have a moment let's check in once again with Dave Robson from our studios in Chicago Ohio State not the only team that's in a little bit of trouble Tom Michigan State is as well Tyler she and a bowling green here Tyrone pronti the Falcons tie this one up at 7 they are on the move again against the Spartans we'll keep you posted Tom well Dave thank you very much as midamerican conference teams Akron another one of them I'm not so sure how much you want to play some of these teams they play good football in the back and they've made a nice done nice job by creating a good rivalries will they look at the first five possession the for Ohio State the safety that's our lead two to nothing on crystal a tackle by Chris Wells in the end zone and two interceptions lickle the tight end in motion wells alone set back they fake it to him and then around a hard line looking for anyone to forward maybe a yard shy of the first down a gain of nine for Brian Hartline you never want to look at a nineyard gain and sneer Tom but when you run reverses when you run counters when you run a little bit of trickery you're hoping to break those plays bigger and so if you're Akron you're actually embolden a bit by okay they ran a nice little you know reverse at us we held it to nine yards you know it didn't break big it didn't become something to bring the crowd back into the game second act a play for the place here grabbed by the facemask by bre on scopes Stokes hung in there after getting a stiff arm but it looked like he got his hand on the facemask of Wells as he tried to reach up after the stiff arm that's when the penalty occurred mishmash v v number 43 at the 15yard penalty with an automatic first gun is reaching up trying to grab claw instead gets the mass because Stokes makes a terrific play actually he got it right initially right at the beginning he get him it wasn't even after the stiff arm he was going to make the tackle first hand in ends up getting Wells by the face map which was negated it is he Akron last year 111 penalties most in the in the country but look at the next 418 Florida won the national championship with 110 USF Arizona State both Bowl teams only 78 yards of total offense for Ohio State through their first 21 plays on offense and Chris Wells tripped it inside the 35 down to the 33 Tom what I found interesting when we looked at that graphic about Akron leading the country in penalty you know Porter wins the national title 110 USF wins a bowl game Arizona State goes to a bowl game sometimes penalties are signed up a team that's aggressive in nature not necessarily a team lacking in discipline second down and three and Rose is whistled down to the ground another nice play made by D'Avanzo Tate in the open field you know what I think people are looking for with Chris Wells not being taken down oneonone and open field because what's happening Stokes first even though he got the penalty watch this play by the vent D'Avanzo tape number 5 excellent job keeping his feet normally the great backs the first guy oneonone he misses or you plow through him that's what people are looking for maura from first well blur down in three for the Buckeyes Sain and wells in the backfield and Beckman to throw short track for this team first down to the clip will this be a huge game in a season opener nine catches for 853 yards that's his first catch today I like the read by Todd Beckman the quarterback he's got it back looping out and coming right in that area here comes Verbinski it's coming into the area in the middle because you got the back looping sometimes that attracts the attention now you get the ball stuck in the middle of the zone two tight ends in for the Buckeyes and again a hand at the world runs into his own linemen and picks up maybe three they ran into Steve wearing number 71 who was making a move to try and get into the hole ahead of it but did what I liked about the run there even though it wasn't a super impressive run they just put his head down and just kept moving forward once he bumped into the lineman he just kept plowing them compiling wait I'm gonna get as much as I can on this flag wells comes off the field Maurice wells comes in joined in the backfield by Seine on second ad at the eccrine 17 Declan to the corner 450 and there's just nothing there I mean isolated in coverage with D'Avanzo Tate it's four or five times today they've air either gone to row Biscay against eight or hard line against corner and they're just being blanketed I'm not sure when he was trying to get done there I've measured you know if he thought he was going to try and get him in the back of the end zone there should is a little more arc on the ball trying to get it there look more like a flat throw excellent coverage on the corner by D'Avanzo take a bird down upcoming left me to sit on 7 to 13 only 44 yards and to intersection play clock down to two they get it off Declan across familiar part line Shoveler hands on first down Ohio State and a penalty flag is down on the near side of the field along the sideline there's a nicely run route by heart line very aggressive in running his route to shake free the leadership on the offense number 33 on number 88 most of that set for one second prior to the connect that's a fiveyard penalty from the previous spot remains third down so the route by heart line negated by an error by Ohio State and movement to their formation on offense we talked about Akron being a before it you know not being able to afford those penalty Ohio see we had a first down that got negated by a penalty another backed up all the way to their own 22 yard line Bergen and 12 they need to get to the ten to convert and peplum just dumped it off the well for the right here is he called around him and he just gets back to the line of scrimmage and really that should go as a lateral that should not go on Todd Beckman passing record because the way he threw that that's a lateral should be a running play which doesn't help much because there's no first down but that would be a distinction in the statistics a nice job out dives at Brandon Anderson number 28 Exxon tackle in the open field so now Ryan Praetorians the backup kicker last year Aaron Petry won the job in the summer this year at 37 yard field goal attempt out of the hold of John Toma and this one is hammered a light down the gun so the Buckeyes at the 754 mark of the opening hand are finally on the board and notice is not a baseball game this is Ohio State 3 Akron to Ohio State a 32 lead nearly midway through the second quarter on Columbus and the Holiday Inn Express scoring drive for the Buckeyes culminating on that field goal from 37 yards away from Praetorians 9 place 46 yard but of course they had that reception made by Hart line that would have made it first and goal from the seven negated by a pending run his own seven at Brandon Anderson and great special teams coverage by the Buckeye that's Brian Rowland boy today like his future a linebacker out of Florida a true freshman whose cousin Antrel is a starting cornerback for the Arizona Cardinals but how about this speed and aggression right there by Brian roll look at the closing speed on the kickoff great that's it that's just terrific play their time well they have some dynamite young players on the defensive side of the ball Ohio State maybe three kick maybe we know why it was so fast they were offsides on the kickoff average because many coaches have told me already with kicking from the 30 the extra 5 yards on offense on a normal kick off most kickoff CAS may will land around the 8 or 9 yard line they figure they should never start offense any left than the 25 yard line most times at the 30 or beyond so now they'll kick it from a 25 rather than the 30 we talk about the role and Tyler molar and Thaddeus Gibson from of these question red shirt crew question for the Buckeyes Brian Williams from the 10 and again racing down the field is enrolled once again they gained only about 6 yards after the penalty in terms of field position and it looks like accurate is going to change quarterbacks we talked about during last spring Chris Jack will main along with Carlton Jackson were duking it out to become a starter at quarterback and Jack will Maine barely won the job both and back were injured and it was the final game in a spring where Jack will main one that job but now we get a look at the sophomore out of Pompano Beach Florida Carlton Jackson a southpaw and his first pass it's incomplete but a short gain of three to Brian Williams out of the backfield nice job by Kirk Coleman number four forcing the play but going back to Carlton Jackson playing quarterback this is what they script into their game plan yes you pointed out Tom that quarterback a competition was so close Jackyl main won the job but kind of almost as a consolation Jackson will play one series in the second quarter at least before Jaffa Ming comes back in and to Kennedy and that did not fool anybody on Ohio State Ross Holman sophomore out of Coldwater Ohio at six tackles in the opening week wind takes Kennedy to the ground terrific play by home in number 51 nice job staying in the hole keeping his feet not being fooled and wrapping him up but you know it's going to be a little frustrated Dennis Kennedy he originally committed to Ohio State thought he would be a Buckeye instead ended up in Akron you know he wants to play well here today it was all over a clerical error transcript in the NCAA clearinghouse from the book I've had enough scholarship and here they come out to Jackson here is he who and it's reenact for his hips but a penalty flag has got on the field not a real surprise guess who's going to put the pressure on Carlton jack number 50 Vernon Goulston with some help from number 33 James Laurinaitis and eligible receiver number 83 was down field he was coming up on the line that penalty has declined walked out when they talked about covering someone up on the line that means the tight end is it probably the threepoint stance and his normal spot on the line and a receiver on his side needs to be a yard behind him off of him and that play the receivers probably on the line of scrimmage that's called covering him up thus making him an ineligible receiver but now is 618 to play until halftime the Buckeyes will get the football back as well this beast hands at his own 35 certainly one of the most valuable players in this game for Akron so far today has been their punter John stuck he has had an outstanding game and another booming punt great hang time well this he has to call for a fair catch 46yard bubai stack who's had a couple of 50plus so far today let's give him a rubdown and a half her Buffalo Wild Wings halftime report coming up shortly of course Dave and company will take a look around the Big Ten highlight stats from all the teams in the Big Ten Conference some games already underway and some coming up later including Notre Dame at Penn State add that you know that game is huge especially for Penn State because they got beat 41 to 17 last year in South Bend you know they want to hit the today to be a payback day on the ground of Brandon saying he is across the 35 bringing wouldbe tacklers along with him a gain of six for Brendan Sain nice job by the freshman running with his eyes as they say watch how he reads number 63 person coming around sees the block and cuts inside of it and then he lowers his shoulder in his head and gains additional yardage one of the toughest things to learn as a running back is pace of the game and being able to read block and see holes Brandon things and all of that on that play saying again and looking for a hole and take what he can get and a late flag comes in from the referee long behind the line of scrimmage and that will be holding against Ohio State you don't see that flag very often coming from the referee behind the play well I would say that it had to be glaring for Steve Heymann to reach and pull it out and throw it during the run holding offense number 88 tenyard penalty from the previous spot remains second down let's Rory Nichol the tight end right there with the takedown by Charles and layman's terms what is going on with the Ohio State offense here today after a pretty impressive debut last week I think that they're having the same struggle they had a good jump down state being able to really move people up front and finding guys to block the 335 is really confusing they're blocking angles right now the second down in Beckman is low and loses his footing on this quarter fall all the way back to the 17 yard line brandnew field turf they replaced the graft after last year and it usually takes about a full season to get this field to settle them perfectly it's going to be slick when the rain hits it and that's exactly what happened Todd Beckman plant feet but right out from underneath him never had a chance to make a play downfield now a third in a long long way well you're not lying we're going to call it third and twenty oh hi Oh state needs to get all the way out to the 39 yard line the Buckeyes have converted just two of six flurried down attempts Bob Jim Fleming the D coordinator I'm going to play zone here rush my four dropped in his own I want the football back and on third down they're going to keep it on the ground opinion across the 20s and a 42 so hearing boos for the first time today at the Horseshoe in Columbus they are not happy with what they're seeing out of this Ohio State offense behind firstyear starting quarterback Todd Beckman we had a nice conversation with Jim Bollman who's the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach and he really kind of downplayed the troubles they had last week in the run game he said we're going to be fine I think they need to get after these guys a little bit these big fellas up front have to show what why their offensive lineman at Ohio State Pro Paso just hammers one sending Andre Jones back to the 19 okay a flag comes Jamie brings it out to the 32:58 yard punt by Trapasso 14 yard return but we wait on the penalty flags on kick plays usually not good for the receiving team are they it has gone one the easy rules of thumb when watch the football illegal block in the back receiving team number 46 tenyard penalty from the spot of the foul first down I mean Kabir the guilty party well fielded by Jones makes a nice move initially to avoid the first guy before he's taken down the penalty happened behind the play wrist beer backup linebacker and Jack LaLanne comes back in at quarterback fighting I've got three and out if it needs to force a turnover coming up to make the play den linger they like him Tom don't say for Larimore I beg your part but but you said but you know they say they like Larimore and they like den linger in there they like both club big motor guys Larimore high school wrestling champ they like his low bass in the way play to the hand it is so young all over the field on defense is Ohio State team it is just astounding how much youth there is out there waiting for you to jump dip get it on and a quick throw caught in the open field now to the 22 yard line by Poindexter a backup tight end though third down upcoming for the zips we remind you they are the Big Ten's greatest games and you can catch them every week reliving the moments that define the conference's great rich tradition the Big Ten's greatest games Tuesday nights at 6 p.m. Eastern five simple on the Big Ten Network I'm out called by the Ohio State defense third and long upcoming they're hoping for a stop and hoping to get the football back one more time Jim Haycock their defensive coordinator and I think that's a nice call by Jim Tressel conserve some more time for your offense you have a lot of confidence in this defense you talk about young they are but the great thing about this team is while they're young and making every mistake they make it full speed in terms of defense they're not afraid to go out and smack giving a run plays down and this is where this is how Akron scored too early Breann Stokes the linebacker tackles crispy knee wells near the goal line and after replay if they overturn the call on the field of gave after the two points only seven on third down exactly to do and got them a good protection across committed gotta go and incomplete and very upset with himself for not making the interception is Anderson Russell lose back healthy again up to starting the year as they're starting free safety last season got hurt against Iowa and missed the rest of the year zone blitz they dropped Doug Washington number 84 out of the line to drop back and two weeks in a row now Anderson ruffle has a clean interception in his hand and it slips through but the coverage was excellent so now Ohio State with only one timeout remaining will get the football and they had dropped two now hard line along with risky nor waiting on his punt they want better field coverage time because it's decks directional punting front line of course on the barbecue grammar for the football and look like Akron recovered it as it was not go to the hands of Brian Hartline back in punt coverage for the first time today and it is Akron football the strip by Omari Dixon the special teams captain and boy eightieth tear on there was like Doug Williams the linebacker comes up with the ball after the strip by Dixon Dixon was a special teams player of the year last year was voted captain of the special teams this year and he's been involved in two of the biggest slave stealing the ball on the two yard line earlier today and now this one turnover for Ohio State two on interceptions and now the fumbled punt return by Brian Hartline and it's the Zips who have the ball with 225 to play in two timeouts remaining and that turnover stat we just saw Tom that's the type of stat of which upsets are made and you get it when you get a big advantage in the turnover category let's take a look at this formation they're having yeah they brought him back inside because I'm worried about the blocking in the protection nowadays testing zoom out again Suffolk pass mated and it is Kennedy boom he is intended target and great coverage beautifully read that time by Donald Washington you know Kennedy was the only quarterback coming back the only player coming back from last year to this year that it actually thrown a pass in a game and he was two for two for big yardage and what they tried to do was run him laterally swing the ball out which they did they used their life their tight end Chris kasparek is the personal protector for him and they were hoping to get something deep in Ohio State diagnosed it quite well through 19 to play Jack Coleman the screen to Kennedy and Marcus Freeman wrapped him up ball came loose where they said it was down so no fumble the block continues to run under two minutes now from the horseshoe and Columbus Ohio Stadium where much like last week when we were in our in our bird a hundred and nine thousand they're a hundred and five thousand here and leading up to halftime the faithful are in disbelief this is it the pad reference but this Ohio State defense Tom I think it's terrific when they start adding the turnover take the way component to this defense ties of the speed dynamite Verdana twirl down is Jack LaLanne by the true freshman Cameron Hayward the Georgia 5a class Defensive Player of the Year he is a son of Craig Ironhead Hayward and the stepson of Corey Blackwell of course who played in Wisconsin pretty good football families guys go in there already good lineage and this is a guy that when you ask people questions I tell me about this freshman hey where their eyes just light up you know boy he's not there yet but he's going to be he is going to be a player and we just saw evidence of that on that play how about that quick first step on the rush Wow they've got a pile of young hungry talented defensive linemen here you know they had to punt returners back on the laps when to cover the field because it's tech selectional punting now they've gone back to this one guy back there let's get set and pick it away again we're coming out to the plant that's able to give the lid will pick you from the penalty out of course the 32 the 33 yard line one timeout remains for Ohio State and 24 seconds remain until halftime let's see if Ohio they decide to do something here maybe run some type of a draw or screen hoping to get nice yardage and maybe try and do something before the half if they don't it might just say alright that's it let's take it and go in and regroup tight end set which would lead you believe they're going to stay on the ground and go to halftime and that is Chris way when he's out to the 40 and not enough there to go go hurry up and drive try and do something else they'll going into half talk about it start over after putting up 38 points against Youngstown State last week despite a slow day by Chris well the Buckeyes managed just three points in the opening half today which is good enough for a onepoint lead at halftime coming up the Buffalo Wild Wings halftime report in fact right now let's send it to Davidson and company in Chicago welcome in this the Buffalo Wild Wings halftime report great to have you with us Dave Reb sitting alongside Jerry DiNardo and Howard Griffith last time Ohio State lost a game to a team from the state of Ohio was 1921 when the Overland yeoman beat them is in yo man what's going on in Columbus today it has not been good this part went according to the script of donning of the eye but the rest of it has been decidedly in the favor of the zips 1st quarter in a scoreless game Feeny wells dropped in the end zone Brian Stokes hitting him there initially ruled down just beyond the goal line but the replay that he'd called his safety so it's two nothing zips Todd Beckman has really struggled as one tipped up here threw it way short the Rubisco there it's picked off his second interception of the first half at Ohio State on top by the narrowest of margins 32 to just over a hundred yards of total offense in the first half for the Bucks and Carey I'll start with you what's going on with Ohio State here well the good news is they're playing good defense they've held back one to two points the running game obviously is nonexistent I mean I thought Benny Wells is going to come out and have a big day today and the complicated problems Todd Beckman's have an awful day he's thrown two interceptions I would suspect we'll see Rob showing off sometimes second half maybe maybe early you may have an opportunity to see it but one of the reasons the running game is struggling if the line of scrimmage is being moved back their offensive line is not controlling that line of scrimmage the defensive line is getting a lot of penetration which is causing the running backs to bump try to bounce the ball outside outside of the tackles when they are downhill team that creates problems one of the reasons that you'll probably see more of Brandon sheen alive and pretty surprising especially when you consider how overpowering this Ohio State offensive line kind of appears to be on paper and we saw those guys in person when we were in Columbus a few weeks ago I mean these just a big guys here you know you talk about Barton and Boone and rearing and yet Youngstown State and now Akron they've been unable to control the line of scrimmage going right and you know how it mentioned it earlier it looks like Akron has pad level there underneath these big offensive linemen and on the safety it was clearly Akron's defensive line pushing the offensive line of Ohio State into the end zone causing the safety but I'm totally surprised that that Ohio State can't get a little bit more leverage on the defensive line of Akron well absolutely you talked about how big these guys are you talking about getting manonman and moving the line of scrimmage moving the feet giving you running backs an opportunity to show the ability that they have when they're having to bounce plays to the outside and are not able to make that first read and have a clean read it's going to be tough for anybody to run the football you know the other things here I mean I know the services are saying for both teams Ohio st. Africa but this is a new artificial service it's field turf it has the rubber grains and it appears a little bit slick but for both sides but it doesn't look like anyone's getting really good footing you certainly have seen the conditions as a factor in this game early on will see whether Ohio State is able to recover here in the second half meantime another team from Ohio faring pretty well Bowling Green coming off that win at Minnesota last week have a Tyler she in here a six yard scramble for the touchdown Bowling Green on top of Michigan State 14 to 7 but back come the Spartans Brian Hoyer to Kellan Davis back at the end zone Ellen Davis doing a good job as tight in and also playing a little defensive it's a close game it is 1414 Michigan State and Bowling Green Bowling Green 4 and 4 against the big 10 since 2001 let's check out Minnesota to see Bowling Green beat last week taking on Miami of Ohio and plowing into the end zone there you see Adam Weber with the touchdown for Minnesota but Gophers strike again then make it 13 to 7 so the touchdown pass for Weber after the touchdown run it is the Gophers on top and this one 14 to 3 over Miami and Nevada's just kicked a field goal they lead northwestern 17 to 7 wildcats having all kinds of problems moving the football yeah no question Tyrell Sutton was heard early I don't want to come back in the game but even when he was in there they weren't really giving him the ball I mean now that I've watched North West be to four fours last week the first two quarters are this wee they obviously have change and transition spread run to the spread pass 30 1 2 3 Purdue having no problems with Eastern Illinois I won't have a one doublea over 1a upset there speaking of upset victims we'll get you ready for Michigan's game later this afternoon against Oregon that's coming up in just a moment plus the rest of the night action on the Buffalo Wild Wings halftime report welcome back to Ohio Stadium and Columbus we're at halftime where the Akron Zips trail the Ohio State Buckeyes a 12th ranked team in the nation by a 32 score coming off the field a short while ago Jim Tressel joined our charissa Thompson coach clearly not the first half that you wanted turnovers penalties may be confusion on the 335 big defense biggest adjustment you have to make to turn this thing around and took a nap you got to do the thing that takes the win first you have to take care of the football you can't turn it over three times and beat a good team they did a nice job on a couple special teams plays drop the ball down in there and got us in tough field position we just got to settle down and get a lot more consistency on offense and keep applying pressure with our defense absolutely things because closing second half human first guy should be an allamerican Marisa Thank You coach Tressel thank you the Buckeyes make their way out of the tunnel when we come back the second half from Columbus on the Big Ten Network Big Ten football is here it's the home opener for Albert young and the Iowa Hawkeyes as they clash with the why for kenick station in prime time tonight in high death only on the Big Ten Network the can't keep up with all the Saturday action then catch up with big ten extra points every scoring play from every Big Ten game all in one show big Jan extra points Monday nights only on the Big Ten Network I have a big time football it's competitive each and every week our identity president there was no game that we went in through what we didn't expect to win this is our year you know we we've got to take the next step if you can't measure up come on physicality point of view you're going to struggle in the big game you don't want the pressure you don't go to this we're anxious to pick up where we left off exempt football native place physically attacked in place mark coaches QA only on the Big Ten Network the attendant work football is brought to you by yo guard VT triple the yield protection system by Cooper Tires don't give up a thing and by the all new Ranger RZR see it up close at your local Polaris Ranger dealer now certainly concern faces of the Buckeye faithful just a 32 lead at halftime Thom Brenneman alongside Charles Davis great to have you with us on the Big Ten Network on this Saturday afternoon Charles we go inside some of the numbers the Polaris halftime statistics and anything really jump out at you obviously not a lot of offensive both teams must feel real good about their defenses the own going stat that matters to me right now besides the score it's three turnovers by Ohio State to zero by Akron that's a stat that matters now we talked about how upsets get fashioned if you turn the ball over and over and over and give the underdog an opportunity that's how it happens Ohio State obviously has to correct that that's the only stat that really jumps at me well obviously as far as the rushing numbers are concerned those aren't bad for a half a for Ohio State but it just never felt like Charles they ever got anything at all going you say well no kiddin dumdum it 33.8 scored but I mean they never even it never felt like they even sustained any kind of a lengthy drive in the opening and there was no flow consistency with the word coach Tressel used at the house in his interview with charissa when charissa Thompson talked to him he said his consistency on offense that they need in the second half and that's where they had the trouble most of that yardage a couple of good runs other than that bottled up Charles let's go back and revisit your Suzuki keys to the game why said Rover and the Bandit the rover position abandoned position two hybrid strong safety outside linebacker often can wreak havoc and caused problems the rover John Mackay a couple of big hits and an interception for accurate Beck's and beans Todd Beckman's passing be me well the running back he got on track for one big run but the rest of the half he struggled and Todd Beckman threw two interceptions in the first half that has to change for the Buckeye wells 11 carries 47 yards for Ohio State not a good opening half for Beckman in his second collegiate start trying to replace the Heisman Trophy winner Joyce Smith planted solitary outside and lost his footing first down Akron from the 18 let's check in once again with charissa Thompson coach your defense is doing a nice job of stopping Ohio State you got elect your position coming into the second half here but offensively if you have only put two up on the board what do you got to do to change that well I think one you're playing a great defense is going to be tough we're going to have to if we have to make a big play here there we got to continue to run the clock you know to be in the game of the fourth quarter and have a chance to win and that's our goal and defensively they put us in position to do that so we got to get a return we've got to get something going a big pass play get a run but we continue with our plan see where we end up he was a first down 12 was it Carter was it a short hop it is a reception made by Brandon Williams on first half and that'll be a gain of five for the zip says the second half is now underway in Columbus I would not be surprised to see the offensive coordinator Joe Morehead continue to try and throw those types of passes with Chris jack oh man you know why get out to the corner get on the edges make them oneonone cap those on the wet field advantage goes to the offense there comes for the All American from PAML Minnesota with a big sack coming right at you on a nice stunt brought home in number 51 went one way attracted the blockers and James Laurinaitis came unblocked and gets a huge sack burger Golson rock Jack woman well the offense might not be much so far but this defense has been dynamite burning Goulston number 50 right out of the stamp he just goes right around number 75 Corey woods a young redshirt freshman he does not have nearly enough quickness to contain Vernon Goulston on the speed rush from the outside couple of key injuries we're told at halftime for the Zips the Amari Dixon it was so special on special teams in the opening half had to leave the game with some kind of an injury so 2 for Alex Allen who got a couple of carries out of their back feet so an early timeout spent by Ohio State a strong defensive start for the Buckeyes here in the second half three and out for Akron including back to that set and now that got in his own end zone hammer Florida sidelines fielded by row 15 at the 47 and about a four yard return but the Buckeyes will start the second half with great field position at the Akron 48 yard line and it's a good job of coaching by Ohio State because after and came out with that running rugby kick trying to keep the ball away from one of the safeties back deep but Ohio State had double safety these Malcolm Jenkins and Brian Rowe Biscay to make sure they had field coverage if he's not there Tom if it's one safety that ball hits and continues to roll and helps change field position in Akron's favor instead Ohio State gets the advantage of good field position Chris Wells alone set back behind the quarterback Todd Beckman and a short drop a quick throw and hard line blitz got a bound to the 39 yard line a gain of nine covered by Corning easy throw for Todd Beckman it appears but this is a long throw to the sideline so you have to have good pace on it and make sure that the receiver isn't covered nice job of reading by Todd Beckman and delivering it to Brian Hartline 7 of 13 in the opening half for Beckman for just a total of 44 yards to get to where he flipped off the left side and sins his way to the 35 a first down for Ohio State nice job on the left side of the Ohio State offensive line coming at you look to the left that's number 71 Steve raring 64 Jim chordal 86 is Jake Ballard too tight in it chopped up enough of a hole to get Chris Wells the first down back Linda's time out of the shotgun they're coming after and he read it beautifully it flies hard line inside the 30 a game at 7 the nice pattern there Tom because what you end up with is two options so you've got the ball in there to hard line but behind him if they start to jumping inside taking away that route you're swinging the back out of the backfield that's the second option for Todd Beckman to throw to again Beckman out of the shotgun on a second down and three they give it to Wells and no room they're late Robinson the nose tackle met him at the line of scrimmage third down upcoming for Ohio State Robinson is a big transfer out of Rutgers and he talked with people they immediately say he's got the kind of body that can take him a long way if he just puts it all together little more consistency needed he actually got to start today had been listed as a second team er but he played well against arming 65 315 Burke that's a lot man it's a lot of man and Drive see the numbers on Beckmann after a couple hits here to start the second half yet another sanctum Bakker the freshman not at Toledo Ohio we had two receptions in his first game ever at Ohio State last week including a touchdown game sands and bucket they really liked that young man who got moxie but watch these guys here up front this is a good job while people have been aligning them in the run game they handled the pressure that Akron brought because Jim Fleming different coordinate White's to bring pressure that time they handled it well enough for a first down but they're just blows it away yeah that's why the better ballsy throw in the daytime you know why he recognized nothing was there let's not force it let's not try and make something happen that we can't come back second and ten let someone either have a souvenir or someone a good touch of the dirt narrowly does it there's not going to be loading to those guys in a white shirt on defense certainly part of the growing pains I mean it's one thing to be around here for four years and get reps in practice it's an entirely different ballgame on the field against an opponent and it coming out their pet penny steps up and again finds hard line for a very short game so another third down presents itself for the Ohio State offense had to gain aboard once again the Ohio State often divided handled the pressure they ended up bringing five guys coming at Todd's Beckman after showing a threeman front now I'm anxious to see if Jim Tressel and Jim Bollman kind of go to the counter to that they pit Hart line inside a few times that seam route do you go to the counter show him inside and swing it outside to someone else but Polly receiver set for the Buckeyes that's a tighter nipper in motion again they're coming off the PEC went undetected it got it down great coverage by Ritchie corner little bit he tried to beat him but corner has been with him all day so the Ohio State drive stalls at the 15 nice coverage Reggie corners played a heck of a game out there today hasn't he I mean he's already got an interception couple passes broken up one of them resulted another interception by John Mackey the rover backs it had a hard time making plays when number 20 has been in the area 33 yard field goal try by Ryan Pretorius tuition and this one right down the middle again to Ohio State after a three and out stop on defense at great field position but only able to turn it into three their lead is poor the Ohio State offensive line getting an earful over there on the sidelines take a look at our Holiday Inn Express Ohio State scoring drive nine plays 35 yards capped off by a Pretorius 33 yard field goal six to Ohio State in front and we are in the third quarter in Columbus victorious a live drive kick that is Brian Williams who left it back through the end zone and the zips will get it at the 20 and of course last week we saw the stunning upset in Ann Arbor Appalachian State over Michigan or say have the end of that game on the jumbotron here in Columbus after their game in living the victory over Youngstown State we understand some 20,000 fans we're still hanging around we heard the roar in Ann Arbor over there Jack LaLanne got in Washington coming up to wrap up receiver no gain on the play the very Arthur made the reception but nowhere to go that's a beautiful play out on the corner by Donald Washington yo I always talk about oneonone open field tackling is a very difficult skill and in the first half Ohio State missed on a few of those not that time by Donald Washington 32 plays 39 yards of offense today for the Akron Zips grind out of that total to Kennedy he shakes one tackler but can't escape Austin's pitler fiddler on a big game in his Ohio State view last week coming up with seven tackles in a sack they've ran that play earlier Tom but remember that was the double pass they throw with Dennis Kennedy on this play they're just winging it out to hoping to get a wall of blockers for Larry grant forced to play before he was wrapped up by Schmitt look Afrin has to push the ball down field more the quiet move back to Ohio state defenders they are all snug handling fevers right now they don't respect their feces there are some deaf women now in the world and a freshman Thaddeus gets him not hang on to that 1/3 dropped interception for Ohio State in two weeks now by Anderson Russell that went that Gibson is not going to get any better than hitting you between the 3 and the 7 and open field but a great job in coverage gets right into the proper zone gets underneath the receiver and all he's got to do is catch it and there's screaming his name in Ohio Stadium well again this Ohio State defense Korean out trying to get the offense great field position yet again and again Ohio State you talk about it the last punt they bring in too deep to guard against the ankle punt from John step in his time he just puts a leg on it Malcolm Jenkins is tackled soon as he caught it at the 38 yard line John Mackey on the tackle after a 43yard punt from step we showed you earlier the dotting of the oh I I and script Ohio from the Ohio State marching band earlier Liberty Mutual Alumni spotlight turns back the clock the last season when Ohio State alum Jack Nicholas got it leo normal normally that goes to a celebrity I mean I was revved up and the first pitch game in the passing game today and finally a warm like Jack Nicklaus received when he dotted the eye when he came back the crowd has their poncho dropped because there's some sunshine again and they're able to get out of their seat Beckman rolls out it's row 15 and that looks like Widow house they came to the fans came to see today great job catching him beepers between the corner in the face good 39 no generals able to shake a couple of tacklers and he's inside the 20 down to the 19 a gain of four for Chris Wells 13 carries just 50 yards today for the man nicknamed beanie you wonder about the ankle just a little bit Tom because I know he's supposed to be healthy but he heard it in the sprint heard the same one again in the fall sometimes it takes a while before your mind really tells you that it's totally right you run the same abandon that you normally do after that carrying out 14 to Russia's 454 yards they're going to give it to him again get a seat boys cool first time needed to get just inside the 13 and it looked like he got there and that's more like it that run was more of an angry run an explosion run watch it coming right out yet being led by Beyonce Johnson there's number 75 Alex booth and the pile moved backwards that's what you want to see how they finish a run and Chris Wells did that it was good enough for a first down well the third straight I know I was out of bounds inside the three at the two yard line he stiffarmed D'Avanzo tape and a great job reading his offensive line because the play was a but designed to go inside as both go there he bounces it out there because of what he read from his blockers good job running with his eyes with vision first well I say come right back Tom and tell your offensive line this job does not finish until a running back carries it into the end zone come right back with it develop a Johnson in front them well to the iformation Miss wells and the play blown dead I think they ran out of time or was here early movement offense number 88 that's a fiveyard penalty remain at the circuit every time today that Rory nickel has been involved in the either kill start or shift and you know that's that that changes your whole mindset because right there you've got momentum and you're going to go pound a ttle now you've got to come back me with a different play call thing there's your jump because they were coming right back with well pounding up now they're going shotgun and spreading out a little bit will this be isolated in the bottom of your picture but they're looking for him though dangerous throw there by Beckman I mean great coverage on Brian Hartline by the free safety Andre Jones how many times have we seen them run that pattern the TAFTA a good handful right now you're also run out of space to run it because the fields condense which means the defensive backs aren't retreating the same as they do out in the field now they're just going to get into a spot and stay there makes it harder to run that underneath route if you have it push them back second and goal Brande insane maybe a couple we welcome those of you watching the Eastern Illinois and Purdue games obviously bad weather they're stopping playing been a rainy day in Columbus and just a few moments ago the sunshine breaks through Ohio State is that held in check to just six points on offense their defense has stymied Akron a safety the only scoring for the Zips third and goal for Ohio State first time today we've seen Seine and wells in the same backfield the strong safety or over back John Mackey number nineteen forty Beckman to get rid of it quickly but he doesn't with enough pace on it they seems able to handle it and get into the end zone one hundred and twenty seven straight games with a touchdown for the Buckeyes point after by Pretorius good so for the first time today Ohio State on offense with a touchdown and a 132 with six down to play in the third quarter Brandon Sain his second career touchdown the true freshman out of piccolo on the reception from Todd Beckman our Holiday Inn Express scoring drive 62 yards seven plays and the offensive line very impressive for the first time today as you pointed out Charles Davis she I think for the first time in two ball games and they did a great job on that drive if there had not been a penalty I think able to go on hit and pounded it in and that's how Akron scored their points in the ball game a safety against Chris well by Breann Stokes that was in the very first quarter second Drive of the game impact for Ohio State and hustling down on the kickoff coverage good special teams coverage indeed today for Ohio State Aaron Gant the first man there you're exactly right timing we're Akron is starting with the football after kickoff which was very impressive row house they used to be one to keep one side of 20 but with the new kickoff return rule right on the 21 is terrific it's amazing how rumors get diapers enrolled by Beckman on that plate of thing you know all we hear about Ohio State going into the season they're very worried about their special teams first name coach Tressel says just yesterday I really like our special teams I think they're playing well and afters made a change at quarterback Tom of Carlton Jackson back in there we saw him for one series 8 3 and out series in the opening half JD book like Jay King year that Jaclyn man Chris jackal men had won the job and would not be on a short leash but he would play Carlton Jackson a series in the second quarter I think the reason he's changed up now is the pressure from Ohio State has been so intense they want a quarterback who can move a little bit better and Carlton Jackson's better equipped to handle play clock down to eight and I've out of five they just you get it off and here they come and Jenkins saw that one coming on the way Stephon Buchla we intended target on the third quarter Ohio State is good they've been doing it all day on defense they have and is really really key in the lock and start the second half and that got the offense started are some greens on jim bakker with a catch culminating in a field goal and then the house his first touchdown in the Gamecock Beckman to Grandma's game Fleur down and they're coming out there the quarterback here traffic rolled away and again Ross Holman applying the pressure so that's three series bring it out in a second half for the Zips two things come to mind for me Carlton Jackson I think was put in because he has better feet than Chris Jack were made but if he stays in the pocket that gets negated I think that you're going to use Carlton Jackson for movement against the pressure of Ohio State you have to move him within the pocket and also get him to the corners try and get him away from some of that pressure from Ohio State we'll Biscay and Malcolm chicken stand at their own 35yard line down set with the pill down man it just got picked a football today second quarter days after the quarter pot and that's working crossing me great coverage great coverage Jaleel Carter number two a true freshman 50yard booth what a day for lau akron punter well 30 minutes of highlights analysis and features dedicated to the world of big ten women's athletics the Big ten Women's Show Monday night 7:30 Eastern on the Big Ten Network they were highlighting me Ohio State women's volleyball team on the big Jumbotron as we have a change at quarterback now for Ohio State Robbie showing up the sophomore out of Cincinnati Ohio and then handed off the Maury wills a flag down on the play and generally that's in the area of holding against the offense and that's exactly what it is so Robbie showing off who grew up in Mason Ohio which is a suburb just north of Cincinnati and played at st. Xavier High School one of the powerhouse programs in the country and if you read mine he was saying holding Ohio State could be the takedown right there could be one back not sure which one they actually called but if I might have been curtain Bart number 74 might have been the guy they were looking at the big allamerican candidate a tackle we're now showing off on a shotgun he's a big kid with a rifle of an arm waiting a prostyle offense at st. Xavier and his first role someplace a hard line not much of a game now of course Kirk Herbstreit the now analyst over on ESPN at a former Ohio State captain and quarterback he put together that herb Stream classic where they've hit you know state champion from other states around the country and they come in to play some of the powerhouse teams in Ohio independence out of North Carolina came in a hundred and nine game winning streak last weekend into Cincinnati to take on showing off Salva modern and sane X ran them out of town with a 30 point whooping the football play wall obviously now showing off rolls to his head and he'll kick it in this way there is out of the 27 not a bad pickup for showing off a gain of 8 he ran the ball well last week three carry 27 yards he's a big guy at six sixes he described but he has enough pocket presence to realize when it's time to pull it down and move it and he just gets it upfield and gets what he can donal been moved there how about that bring up a third and about seven or eight we call it eight and throw it off on a shotgun and they're coming after him he's fired up glow and then what a catch by Roy 50 the ball was thrown by showing off before risky ever turned around great observation I was thinking the exact same thing you hear coaches talk all the time about being able to have the confidence to throw it on before the guy makes the break because you know he's going to be there that's exactly what showing off did and a terrific catch by row Biscay because the coverage by D'Avanzo tape was actually pretty good but Robbie showing off get some a first down after first in 20 following a holding penalty on his first play under center now they give it to Maurice he's a to the 48yard line I know they're fairly early in this drive but so far this could not have worked out better for Jim Tressel's getting Robbie showing off in the game you know why he took Todd Beckman out after a touchdown pass a positive the end zone showing off comes in and picked up a first down on first and 20 so this works out well also so mentally everything's working real well for Jim Tressel in maneuvering his players well for cent years gone by priscila started the season in a quoteunquote two quarterback sort of scenario and generally it's been the second spring guide it's come on go ahead with a job my boy Smith behind Justin's work four weeks ago show it off this broke it away interesting you bring up Justin's wit but they've got saw him in the elevator earlier today and I asked him how he do is adjusted how are things going he said boy it is hard not being out there right now trying to adjust to that civilian life as we call great block by Maurice Wells right there on the onrushing defender number 94 Sean lemon goes down low and takes out his legs lemon fly through the air now another third down for the Buckeyes will call it third and five Maurice wells in the backfield and Sean Hall under center looking over the scene when he's going to throw fires and it's incomplete and if there is one knock I guess if you will uh Knopf and he's still so young and we remember he was a redshirt freshman last year who only through one pass the entire season is some say he grips the ball too tightly I mean he really wanted to win that quarterback job he's an extremely intense competitive kid and maybe sometimes a little too fired up and you understand that term being a baseball guy you hear that all the time when a guy struggling what do they say he's gripping great holding on too tight sometimes you got to have a little relaxation that you can let your talent flow for Paso running is Jones lets it bounce and it will be glad at the 8yard line 43 yard punt by 8k professor we remind you our copyrighted telecast is presented by authority of the Big Ten Conference and may not be reproduced or retransmitted in any form and the accounts of descriptions of this game may not be disseminated without the express written consent of the Big Ten Conference Charles Davis I'm Thom Brenneman along with Carissa Thompson we're in Columbus Ohio the Akron offense for the Ohio State and now 44 years after a gain of two and they're in such a tough spot they don't want to make a key turn over here and give Ohio State something easy and totally take them out of it right now they're only down 11 we're not even to the fourth quarter yet if you make us turn if you have a turnover here and give Ohio State an easy touchdown now the momentum really swings against you so I know that JD Brookhart the head coach and Joe Morehead is off at the play caller have that in mind as they go through this sequence twelves and Jackson in it quarterback on now backtoback offensive series I try and swing him out of backfield and let him approach with his legs but they're coming out there again and he throws to the far side havoc and catches late and they won an impressive day it has been for Donald Washington we heard so much about him last year when they were practicing leading up to the national championship game in Phoenix and we're seeing exactly why he played nickel all of last year now he's fulltime duty and he's really been impressive on the corner but how about the pursuit from inside out to finish off the quest we're ganna clean that's um looking over to the sideline for the foil we're clozapine he better hurry before it ever got started and that will be a procedure penalty I believe against Akron prior to the snap false start offense number 75 induce it remain well they're in the end of the horseshoe that was crowd induced and what happened was because because Carlton Jackson see right there that's where he raised up beforehand we called judges palm all to check you got go up and down the line guys turning trying to get it to make it very unsettling for the offensive line without again you go from third and three to third and eight Jackson and inside handoff and Ohio State saw it coming Dennis Kennedy I'm fooled by Laurinaitis along with Doug Worthington Worthington actually the first man there so again three and out that is four straight series to start the second half and Akron of the game eleven forty yards or third and three they're really trying to get the first down the play called it comes in on third and three it's different than that third need that third Nate was if hey let's not turn it over run it away third is the rate I might attack a little bit and because we think we've got a chance of picking that up this guy is a joke yet talk about worn out yes the IceCube all the way back guys Akron after this game so that is the end of the third quarter from Ohio Stadium in Columbus 105,000 watching Buckeyes take a 132 to lead and we'll return to Ohio Stadium right after these messages and a word from your local station we begin the fourth quarter you take a look at that the scoring numbers today Ohio State with just a onepoint lead at halftime they've scored 10 here in the second half and we now begin the fourth quarter stuck punts from his own 5 car line will let it bounce and it's downed at the Ohio State 48 let's see who comes back out at quarterback first rod Beck when you started the game on the last offensive series we saw Robbie showing Hall the sophomore out of Cincinnati and it looks like showing off we'll stay on it quarterback look at the numbers this Ohio State defense has just been unbelief 63 total yards for the game four in the second half for Akron that's impressive three proved freshman wide receivers in a game for Ohio State Washington Samson Bakr and Devon Torrance but they're going to hand it off and maybe a gain of one another quiet day today for Chris Wells 17 carries 72 yards Jim Tressel talked about being able to get the running back to the line of scrimmage now you said Earl Bruce always a guy he fires feet to the line of scrimmage meaning you've got to get a surge up front so the running back from deep deep position gets to the line of scrimmage Danny makes his move in his cut you can't make it before that you're in trouble going home close to the freshmen pass he loses the ball and a scramble toward a couple of guys basically will in trying to recover the football one from each side the ball stripped away by Parris McNeil the fifth year senior the zip say they have it another they know another turnover for Ohio State that happens a lot with young freshmen on how they're holding the football especially when you get into the middle where the traffic is again the route where they throw it inside here's the completion and if he goes balls popped out as it goes by by McNeal and then underneath the pile the Akron Zips come up with it four turnovers as Charles mentioned now for Ohio State two interceptions by Beckman two fumbles and again Carlton Jackson stays on a quarterback first even remotely decent field position to the second half for the six and Jackson on the keeper where he gets NIC up to the 45 and let's send it back to Dave Robson in Chicago for an update Bowling Green and Michigan State check out this catch by Devin Thomas Brian Hoyer putting it up there Thomas bringing it down sets up at Ju Cole Frick TD 2114 Spartans Dave thank you back here on a second down Terry Kennedy is dragged to the line of scrimmage Brian Ross Holman and James Laurinaitis to set up another third and long for Akron and I really think that they've got to get Carlton Jackson out of the pocket he says Ohio State he the speed and pursuit look at James Laurinaitis coming right after it and stuffing the flavor can help from the defensive line but I can in the pocket call to Jackson's almost a sitting duck 13:04 that Jackson rushed out of the pocket cuts it to the inside but denied first down yardage cameron hayward tripped him up do you think about going here if you're Akron was 12:40 to play I would think about it in this situation but I wouldn't do it I would punt the ball and play field position here because if you get the ball up middle of the field with Ohio State's office even though they haven't been super impressive today I think I like my odds better if I can kill the ball inside between yardline I believe Drive and retake that shot at it deck is punting for the 13th time to this and there's nearly a full quarter of what ball to be played you know the one word he's going to take the end of the game trainer hey he said he's been up to the task oh yes he has angled toward the sideline a fair catch made by Roe Biscay at the 7 pin so we'll take a break 12 minutes to play Columbus the 12th right bug on is in front of the Akron Zips 13 to 2 Big Ten Network football is brought to you by US Bank home of the fivestar service guaranteed by yield guard BG triple the yield protection system and by Buffalo Wild Wings you happen to be here Ohio Stadium on the campus of the Ohio State University the Buckeyes with 12 minutes to go for the 13 to 2 lead and their quarterback is Todd Beckman the starting game boy Robbie showing off for a couple of series back when today is it on 13 and 42 two interceptions 110 yards in a touchdown and this is Chris well while we have a moment let's send it back to Chicago and get an update again from date Russian Tom one update um going between Northwestern and Nevada Nevada the big halftime lead northwestern coming back Brandon Roberson in for Tyrell Sutton who's banged up 76 yard run sets up a Robertson TD it's 20 for 20 all right Dave we'll check back in again with you shortly and again to the 45 yard line so here's the game has gone on numbers beginning to get a little more Chris Wells like he ran right over John Mackey on that 25 yard run best run of the day not because of yardage but how he's finishing it watch this John Mackey the leading tackler for Akron it very tough guy and watch Chris Wells it's a great block up front and they'd be able to bounce it outside he even got a nice block on the corner from Dane sands and baakir but he finished off the run well running over John Mackey well for Chris Wells his first career 100yard rushing game hi such a team so in all the talk the USA Today high school player of the year coming out of Akron today the first 100yard rushing day for Prince Wells again a 41 backtoback physical run watched his stiff arm in the open field on D'Avanzo Tate and he tried the second one here he's working it on ready corner before he's hauled down from the back this will have a big touchdown run against me Michigan last year this is more eat well and that all by Doug Williams did they say the ball was down yes but it's not a fumble know one of the differences I've seen and Chris Wells in the second half I know he liked to be called beanie I'm still trying to get to that is that in picking up his feet initially in his run remember how the game started slipped and fell the first couple time to carry the football now I see the feet moving and turning quicker and chopping through there and that stadium started bouncing they still standing on the Ohio State sideline after that 31 yards gallop a minute ago more than swells and again just know whether one with this when you think Ohio State's running game is going to get it rolling runs of 25 and 41 by Chris Wells backtoback fair carries by Maurice Wells and a total of one yard and a great job by the Akron defensive front because number 95 neat Robinson just held the point of attack so well there is no place to build that allowed the defensive end to crash down but like number 54 Doug Williams the outside linebacker crashed down and made the play here tried ends in a game for Ohio State a third down and nine play fake going up to the end zone touchdown whiskey Tom they caught Akron actually slanting opposite the roll watch the defense moving this way and then of course Beckman comes back this way see that they caught him moving in that direction it worked out perfectly he's wide open to throw the ball and river a bit he's wide open to catch it the toilets the point after is good so Ohio State held to three points in the first half on offense as home 217 on the board through less than a quarter and a half here in the second stanza the skies clearing it is a sticky Saturday summer like here in Columbus and a Holiday Inn Express Ohio State scoring crop by far their most impressive of the day big ones by Chris Wells almost a sigh of relief because of the runs by Wells I think the coaching staff obviously loved it I think the crowd even more so getting to see the Ohio State running game getting back into high gear Brian Williams will have it bounce into the endzone and let's send it downstairs once again victim charissa Thompson we've seen all types of weather here do they have a way you got Ohio State has also seen two different quarterbacks Robichaux and hopped and that Todd Beckman and they share the same position but that's about the only thing they have in common except for their size you see teammates describe Robbie as the loud outgoing one well Todd is the quiet leader or as his mom Denise described him as a man of not many words and although they're different in personality too still effective on the playing field no matter how you look at it hit charissa you know as funny he talked about Beckman being the quiet one can't really set the same note home to his mother from summer training camp every year kindest regards and faked it hi mom doing fine granted where is he Kennedy is coming up to lay on a lick as a senior out of Georgia Larry Graham play nice game today I mean when you think about this game you look back the defense for Ohio State will deservedly get a lot of kudos and Larry grant will be one of those guys number six the linebacker last year coming out of a junior college took a year to really adjust with a backup this year they've really Unleashed him from the outside linebacker position first junior college player under Jim Tressel came from City College of San Francisco Rico Player of the Year Jackson a sorrel caught out of the 24 yard line by murse Poindexter for a gallon of chemical Windex is a player they really liked a lot and they wanted to utilize their tight end a bit more coming into today's ballgame but just haven't had much of an opportunity to actually throw it because of the pressure from Ohio State we're down and step over comments going to get after it let's get this Jim hey Top Gun guy again daddy Egyptian coming after him they pick up the block and they throw down a sideline and great coverage and it is incomplete and again the name we continue to call all day long the sophomore out of Indianapolis Donald Washington with Donald Washington offers on the corner of the nice job because he read the eyes of Jovanka Barry Arthur and at the last second when he realized the ball was coming down he got to the swiped at it which takes away concentration for the receiver but coming into the year you're thinking well Malcolm Jenkins is the lockdown guy for Ohio State who fills the older role Donald Don Washington with an emphatic I do today fun number fourteen now for John step and again from deep in his own territory at the pin and the leg might beginning to tire first bent if he's have to do it down this just shy of midfield at the 49 but stick has had a dynamite day he had let's take a look at today's Cargill passing combo Ohio State leading 22 to a seven 52 to play the combined totals of Brian Hartline and Brian wrote Biscay not bad at all 12.5 yards per catch between the two of them and Todd Beckman's numbers have really picked up here in the second half Brandon Zane is hammered by Parris McNeil we have not seen Chris Wells since that last Drive where he carried four times for 72 yards he had at 41 yard run and then came over to catch his breath on the sideline and stayed there threw the touchdown pass to roe Biscay and now it's Ain who will be replaced by well no same will staying along with will they've shown a little bit more of a 2 tailback look in past situations here in this ball game after the loss of four Beckman a fluid flows out of the pocket bill honesty and that is actually showing off now in a game at quarterback for Robbie showing off dumps it off the scene and third down up coming after a gain of four we keep talking about how big and strong Robbie showing Hoff is at six six to 44 but he showed me a nice ability to move out of the pocket and still complete plays one time he ran up the gut and ran for about eight yards this time he moved around and completed a pass and made it now third and 11 I'll show it off just a just a dynamite athlete basketball player baseball player he did it all and now to throw on third and long great protection going off moving around as a football is it in another Ohio State turnover if it is it would be the fifth of the game Doug Williams strip the ball and yes it looks like the zips have recovered Paris McNeal again on the action so Williams a strip McNeal covers it up first down Akron inside Ohio State Territory once again a ball carrier for Ohio State not taking care of the ball we always hear about ball security and right there Williams drug wins number 54 strips at McNeill covers it coverings up a little irony here Tom John Heisman was the head coach and actually quarterback the last Akron team to beat Ohio State back in 1894 well we know Iseman as a famous coach nobody's to say the first day of football practice every year better for you to have died as a small child in the form of my father right now house days wondering about holding on to the football the laid hand off to Brian Williams now the background is buck Cal hi one of the great football programs in the state of Ohio remember the collar the College of that acronym got you buck del before it became University of Akron Akron with two first downs first down the entire game against his Ohio State al Jackson times on to the ball remember the backups beginning to get into the game Brian roll on the tackle there looks like Chris Wells might get the rest of the day off his first career 100yard rushing game and 72 of those came on that last Drive but Chrissa it will not be for mr. wells Charles Davis his final one no no no no that should be the start of many to come and after this play I'll tell you about a guy who started to streak a week from today in his career there in doing over the middle and close to a 1st and looks like they got it Joe Barry Arthur to the 39 it is a first down the third of the game for the zip that's a great job by to bury Arthur helping out his quarterback and finding an open spot but a week from today Tom a weak hint Archie Griffin of Ohio State began his NCAA record string of 31 straight 100 yards game I tell you went back to Matt I'm three that's how you get it done Jackson did he get rid of it before he hit the ground it's an incomplete fast I just think they've got to move him out of the pocket initially ie he had he looked like you got nice feet talking about Carlton Jackson number seven but everything's in the pocket and Ohio State kinda knows where to find him on every play you know every time you rush it so you know five to seven yards behind Center go get him move him around the pocket roll him out a little bit for Jackson will flare pathetic and hit me by kumari Oh O'Neill starter last year guys first turnover of the day for the Akron Zips jamario Neal with that starting strong safety job back and the first turnover forced by the Ohio State defense in four ballgames worth great job with the tackle and the strip by jamario O'Neill Wow he made the hit just pulled the ball right out of his hands back in Columbus for 35 to play on Ohio State let it three two and a half times 17 unanswered points put on the rally caps in fact 20 total unanswered points I fell behind on this eight to nothing after a safety in the opening quarter Robby's showing off back on the center and this is Brandon Terry and he plunges ahead to the 45 we'll pick up a twohour Cooper Tires big stop of the game or play brought to you by Cooper Tires y night brought a sack on the opening drive here in the second half we'll get some help from Ross Holman who attracted the attention of the blockers and he came through unblocked and he's tough enough when you are blocking it when you leave him unblocked you've got no chance hey this Akron defense is going to give some teams and problems in the midamerican conference Eastern Division we told you Ohio University the defending champion and the favorite going into this year showing high school link light stops on a dime and he'll tie the head out to the 48 yard line so slow it down upcoming for the Ohio State offensive block rolling now under 3:40 and I've noticed Robbie showing off learned a lesson on that play member had last time you get the ball stripped GCI tucked it away that time when he decided he's going to tuck it down and run ball held tightly to the side of his body quite sure that Joe Daniels is what about to choke out new words for him when it came off and he remembered them I'm sure it's pretty vivid start to say he better you'll make them take place right I don't think so not a good idea pulling third on them six and show it off the throw fires complete to the tight end Brandon Smith the junior from Euclid Ohio and that's good enough for an Ohio State first down a gain of nine over on the safety to make a tuneup at Ohio State finally guys first touchdown coming in the third quarter on a pass to Brandon stick and that back button found Brian Rowe Biscay in the end zone for a touchdown in his fourth quarter and a 22 to lead under 242 go now in Columbus Landon's same the 41 so all in all Charles obviously a very sluggish first half offensively better in the second half certainly not great right let Jim Tressel told us you know this is a work in progress and certainly Jim Bollman offensive coordinator reiterated that over and over and over again your thoughts at least you know looking ahead now and down the road for Ohio State offensively yeah I agree with that assessment and I'll get back to it after we run this flush if you obtain running it inside but I agree with the assessment because people have to remember who was lost last year you're losing Doug dadish in the middle who was a terrific player offensive lineman he losing a couple guys on the guards right PJ Downing's not there anymore an offensive line has a choreography and they have to develop a camaraderie to know where everyone is on every movement that a lot of positions don't you know your wide receivers are kind of stroll while you're running back to snow lower you up at the blindages unit they take some time to develop that cohesion this team will continue to get better and better people run it done right now it's the impatience of our society but I've been five six games down the road they're really going to wipe this clean that's right by Washington the crew freshman we're being told for those of you waiting on the resumption of a game at Purdue but was stopped by lightning in the area and West Lafayette that they're getting warmed up back on the field to start that game and we will send those of you waiting when the time comes we'll send you to the studio and Dave rest in a company first and then send you on to West Lafayette so our colleagues there Ron foulon and Butler biotech they got off you know they got off the headsets and hurry with lightning with it oh yeah they're smart guys when it stage they'll be back and they'll bring you to call the rest of this game but you know people you got here a lot of yourself at Ohio State schedule this year tom is which I got it I always get a chuckle out of all the play no one there doing this of doing that it could not have come at a better time with the loss of the Ohio State absorbs to get these guys in and get these youngsters an opportunity to play against some opponents that they probably should handle and oh by the way the Washington game now looks like a bigger game after what we saw from them in week one is in Syracuse Santonio Henton the redshirt freshman quarterback comes in has and he has the first down and more to the 47 yard line you know there are teams who can beat up about scheduling and then there are teams you can beat up about scheduling right the last time I checked the last two years Ohio State had a home at home of Texas and starting next year they have a home at home against USC and in future I bet he's going right I mean you know I've heard Oklahoma's name bandied about Washington when this game was scheduled think about it yeah watch it with a perennial top 10 top 15 P so you can't talk to me about Ohio State and their scheduler they always play people Maurice wills to the 25yard line that could will be our final play actually time enough for one more play at Ohio State I don't know I don't think they'll desire it I think this is it if I take the headset off she can and they will go and work on the game plan and get ready now for the Washington Huskies that's a long trip out there to Seattle and a tough place to play and a very impressive opening win for the Huskies at Syracuse they make it Boise State to them and that's one of the games that you keep an eye on in there is when it's when we thought preseason you thought well there's Boise State now if you're Boise State that's a game you got to be careful with or Jim Plus home free improving now 264 and 14 as head coach here at Ohio State a 22 to victory over the Akron Zips for the Buckeyes ranked 12th in the country coming into this one we'll see where they stand when the polls
