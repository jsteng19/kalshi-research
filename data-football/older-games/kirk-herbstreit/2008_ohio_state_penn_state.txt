THIS IS WHAT HE DOES HERE. HE UNDERTHROWS THE BALL. HE PUTS IT HIGH ENOUGH WHERE HE PUTS IT HIGH ENOUGH WHERE ROBISKIE CAN ADJUST TO THE ROBISKIE CAN ADJUST TO THE FOOTBALL AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE APLAY. SCIRROTTO GETS LOST. HE DOESN'T EVEN SEE THE BALL. THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT TERRELLE PRYOR AS A YOUNG TERRELLE PRYOR AS A YOUNG FRESHMAN HAS. HE'S GOT VETERAN RECEIVERS IN HE'S GOT VETERAN RECEIVERS IN ROBISKIE ON ONE SIDE AND ROBISKIE ON ONE SIDE AND HARTLINE ON THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; Brent: SO THEY'RE GOING TO &gt;&gt; Brent: SO THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHOT AT IT WITH 18.

PENN STATE, SIXTH ING THE STATE PENN STATE, SIXTH ING THE STATE IN DEFENSE. THE REASON WHY, THEY STUFF THE THE REASON WHY, THEY STUFF THE RUN. OHIO STATE HAS 16 YARDS RUSHING. PENN STATE, 53. THAT'S WHY THE GAME IS 33. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE HOW THE OFFENSES &gt;&gt; IMAGINE HOW THE OFFENSES WOULD STRUGGLE IF THEY CALLED WOULD STRUGGLE IF THEY CALLED HOLDING IN THE CONFERENCE. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GRAB A JERSEY. WE HAVE SEEN IT FROM BOTH SIDES. CAUTIOUS FIRST HALF.

IT STARTED WITH PENN STATE AND IT STARTED WITH PENN STATE AND WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO BECAUSE OF THE SPEED THEY HAVE BECAUSE OF THE SPEED THEY HAVE UP FRONT. BOWMAN HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE BOWMAN HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE FIELD, NEGATING OHIO STATE, ANY FIELD, NEGATING OHIO STATE, ANY ABILITY TO GET IN THE OPEN FIELD TO MAKE ANY KIND OF PLAY WHERE TO MAKE ANY KIND OF PLAY WHERE THEY FEEL THEY CAN GET THE BALL THEY FEEL THEY CAN GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD. THAT WILL BE A KEY FOR OHIO THAT WILL BE A KEY FOR OHIO STATE IN THE SECOND HALF. FOR OHIO STATE, IT WAS THE FOR OHIO STATE, IT WAS THE BLITZ. THEY CAME AFTER DARYLL CLARK. HIT BY HEYWARD, AND EVENTUALLY HIT BY HEYWARD, AND EVENTUALLY SET UP A FIELD GOAL BY PENN SET UP A FIELD GOAL BY PENN STATE. AARON PETTREY WITH THE BALL ON AARON PETTREY WITH THE BALL ON THE TEE. THE BUCKEYES WON THE FLIP, TOOK THE BUCKEYES WON THE FLIP, TOOK THE BALL.
