============================================================

take a look at this we're 28 minutes away from kickoff in Death Valley and the big winner obviously right now is the Irish or the Tigers it's Mother Nature they're going to play in that in 2654 and Counting on ABC and in Baton Rouge coming up the top of the hour from that death valley to this one Shawn Watson and Clemson first meeting with Notre Dame's since the 70s well before that young man or anybody on the field was born 26 minutes away on ABC and tonight on ESPN goal line is coming down pouring the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC something rare and special in Clemson tonight they've waited forever for this event but a Fighting Irish to return the faithful undeterred their spirits undampening and flooding downstate a heavier deluge is due here later to playoff contenders must step forward and prove it right now Notre Dame versus Clemson Death Valley is alive and electric the moment is here a clash of two teams who haven't faced one another for nearly 40 years leave it all on the field no no tonight I'm so excited Thank You Heather in Death Valley and the implications are take this football team spirit we can Irish are still struggling to find their identity and tonight place their faith in the Angela freshmen facing at Clemson Tiger squad playing with lights out when the lights are on well autonomy God's rightness in you but you got to make a decision to bid right number 12 our champion will be with their rankings and fried on the tonight he's bound hello and welcome to a special Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo and this presentation of the SEC on ESPN a heavily anticipated collision of two hot 12 teams the M defeated 63 Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and Excel Frank Winston Tigers and walk a freestyler Kirk Herbstreit Heather Cox will join us it is hard to overstate Kirk the energy the anticipation for this game Joe Montana was the hero the only other time Notre Dame came here it's been that long there are so many elements tonight including the LMS the rain started to come down it's going to get much worse in a while here and you know it's something to keep an eye on obviously we're hearing maybe the second half it could get really nasty for now it's raining as you can see that front is moving this way but at the same time for instinct it's about your footing it's about taking care of the football especially with this kind of atmosphere who's going to make a mistake early is the weather going to contribute to that too late six both quarterbacks say they can handle the whether you got the two DeSean you know about Watson but John Kasich are teaming with Malik failure went down in Virginia he was the hero he's had two home wins but this is a little different isn't it yeah and I really think Notre Dame is a group spending from the most resilient teams in college football in his first month and a lot of that has to do with the way that Jean Kaiser stepped up in that game and Charlotte's brother friendly when he came in brilliant never taken a meaningful snapping Brian Kelly told us himself he didn't know how he would respond he converts on a fourth down on a scramble and then this pastor will forward for the touchdown they're able to get out of there with a win going to be different tonight I think he needs to rely on CJ Prosise one of the most gifted running backs the starts in season so far in college football take some of the pressure off him I think Brian Kelly goes for that high percentage throws just to kind of settle a minute but make no mistake at some point they're going down field because that's who they have become as an offense with him a quarterback approach size six hundred yards and four games no Irish back has ever had war name the first one but it's tough to run on Clemson now what about this young watch that it's been a quiet start existing fleet for him you know a couple of very easy games and then a road win young quarterbacks that I've washed in a really long time and it's because he just sees the field he played in the same office and he was in high school so I think his learning curve was very quick and it allowed him to come into this season last year instead away now he had an injury and I think the big thing is Allen he brings all three things are looking for in any quarterback running any system and that started with an awareness would you go to tempo off is it lookout call me oh it's nice to have a quarterback see the field mainly wit decisions to be able to get the ball out quickly the second thing after awareness is decisionmaking any quarterback even be able to make good decisions obviously DeSean that the real Prince event at the to find the open man and the last thing is the accuracy I had this sch√∂nox yet the way he did last year but I know he's anxious to have an opportunity tonight against Notre Dame defense I really would feel first thing when you look at this game on a minute from the exo standpoint I think it could be hard for them to run their tailback Wayne governments in this game because Notre Dame is so gifted in the front seven I think you may need to Shaw watson bloodless befall a little bit more and then try to find matchups on the perimeter to hit blank and try to make some big plays in a they get some gifted skill players on the eggs don't they the Irish Sea hooks for the most part has been really stout except for the occasional laughs and letdown they'll be on guard tonight for this tonight exactly what you want to do is you want to show an up window dressing different formation run the football and exit the John Watson had an ACL surgery in December they've been protecting him tonight I think they'll turn him loose you mix in some of that and then you take your shots downfield individual limbs in very tough at home Irish not a great road scene but it's a tossup game virtual tossup tonight here in Death Valley the real Death Valley's once again the center of the collegefootball universe they're gonna have to give everything that you have it seems given a dogfight Notre Dame will be a seagull it should be vying for that this playoff spot this game screams playoff implications I couldn't give Jesus bigoted and that's the truth whispers a tough ticket arching yearning get the done it and they continue to move forward leave it all on the field have no life if you the Nissan pregame rush with John Saunders Mack Brown and Mark May is next after this message and a word from our ABC stations alright Keyser and Watson we will see a halftime right now let's return to Chris Fowler John thank you the Clemson Tigers Kirk have waited 16 days since their last game a twin and Louisville and it's almost game time John Watson licensed candidate research when a break loose tonight yeah no doubt about it football team I love their approach that was very telling this is almost like a preseason we had 16 days it was almost like we went back kind of self evaluated where are we strong where do we need to improve and they use that time there's two weeks to get ready to go and now they're just ready to explode onto this field and play baboh has said treat it like any other game it does not feel like any other game now Notre Dame and Clemson as the tiger is a waste their traumatic entrance now we'll look inside welcome to the dr. pepper championship drive game of the week Tiger Stadium awaits in the Clemson Tigers make a very short but intense bus ride from a locker room on the west side around to the East not Clemson and Howard's rock some player is very quiet some rowdy and that rock from Death Valley California brought here almost a half century ago and place to the top of the hill most electric rituals in sport I think this is one of the more anticipated entries in the country fans just wait for this all week the Tigers will come running down that hill and we'll hear Tiger Rag they will carefully descend the hill and a sloppy evening nobody mystic grande your entrance than the Tigers in Death Valley without your costume under this desk where the web fields are youthful thinkers some guys taking their time and others building they can't help the emotion coming down that hill I can the Tigers in fuel use this energy the Irish have not been a great road team when we talked about Virginia they have two streak of five straight losses on the road so there's something for this Notre Dame team to prove and yet at the same time it's interesting Brian Kelly this week using the Florida State game in kalahasthi last year in a game that they competed and they had a chance to win it came down to that one play and he felt just that experience in a tough environment in a similar a Fifi matchup he felt that that was enough to be able to tell his team hey we could win and these kind of games not to mention the LSU game in their bowl game away from their home stadium liked about the food to Shawn's born four months apart eyes are there and Watson her buddies from their high school days of the elite 11 quarterback damn more on that as it unfolds the intrepid and always prepared Heather Cox is on the sidelines with Brian Kelly hello Chris thanks so much coach we talked about the difficulty preparing for this environment especially with an inexperienced quarterback what have you seen today leading up to this moment that gives you confidence in Deshawn Kaiser what was very loud up to this moment so we'll see what happens but it was a pretty boys Kenny's a mature kid he knows what but he's going to have to go in there and command the offense because it's not going to get any quieter out here so his point will help all is the displays wall and keep it quiet but you know he knows what he's in for and coach Kelly we knew this weather was coming you guys practice with footballs all these but how does this weather affect the way that you call this game well I mean obviously the field conditions are pretty good right now so we'll run our offense we may have to go underneath Center a little bit more be careful you got to take care of the football in these conditions coach thank you so much for your time and guys certainly with this inclement weather comes some changes down here on the field both teams will go to half inch long spikes the maximum allowed by the NCAA also both teams are using a 36 game goals they expect into three times more than they typically use the 12 on a dry day now the officials will try to change out the ball after every play that will of course get wet and have an impact a few fingertip pressures to have success that most weenies took his team Heather indoors to practice that they did water down the football skirt to give a simulation of these conditions if you can in practice yeah and it just by dumping a dry ball into a bucket over a course of an hour hour and a half practice is not it's a good it's a good attempt by both these teams but it's not going to prepare you for what you're going to see tonight on this natural surface Irish won the toss to first comes them to get the football and Tyler nurses we've doubles as the footer you'll kick it off to begin this North versus South last near offensive short kick can define the receiver our Tabas Scott from the five has a brief and breaks out across the 35 the John Watson the treaty's and ACC Player of the Year goes to work right now it's important for both these quarterbacks to settle in and that's the play callers on both sides know that with the weather like this the emotion deshaun Watson typically stays very calm that's the trademark aren't on him even though he's very young and only a sophomore but I look for they've also to take some chances on this first possession if they get the opportunities we talked in the open forest Notre Dame's giving up some big plays and Clemson wants to try to take advantage of that despite the weather of his first play empty backfield and five receivers for Watson he takes off up the middle Watson breaking three o'clock in field clashing to speed down the sidelines and driven out good Karl Koecher brings that week we talked about him in the open about running the football it could be a tough night to run the ball and look into numbers there's no linebackers by having the five receivers out wide unless nobody in the middle the middle linebacker Joe Smith brought a blitz from the right but they got to the left and ended up showing what he can do his knee is healthy they told us they were going to turn him loose and on the very first play a huge game for deshaun Watson 38 yards now it's gone the hard running steady tailback we muscles down to the 20yard line Zalman is a sophomore for George you just doesn't quit on run no I say the footing and attraction in the trenches we've watched games you and I all afternoon and one of the things that came up was watching the linemen you think about the receivers and a quarterback in the ball but it's really the linemen and being able to get leverage and pushing a 300pound body and trying to get it to go where you want it to go the advantage you would think would be Notre Dame watch who's got it me and just throws it away at the last instant wine that has no starters back from last year Ryan Norton their Center was the only returning starter but he is an MCL sprain so there's a couple of veterans up there a couple of young guys but but no secondyear starters no and I think because of that they rely on tempo to be an equalizer this is a similar offense that you see when you watch all burn there's a similar offense that you see when you watch Ole Miss they rely on the tempo in some of the trickery to be able to be kind of offset the athleticism and his speed and size of a defense the guy who watches Sheldon day on the defensive line number 91 Scott's in the backfield on 3rd and 5 on a flip assuming the flat but he had to spin around picks the man this gets the first down and dive to the 12 yard line kind of an example right there what they asked from their offensive linemen on a stream pass out there they're just trying to get in the way there wasn't anybody who came up with a big block but they shielded the Notre Dame defense from it what a video Scott gets the first and almond takes the handoff on first down gets the edge and dive down near the 4 yard line limbs been executing well on this first possession in rain no doubt about it and some good blocked up to the top area that they feel they have got to dominate forget about the trenches out of the perimeter time pique the receiver and leg at the tide in we're flexed out to the top of your straight and go pick up nice block and he to run second down Watson had trouble collecting this snap was an awkward hand off to Gulman he loses a yard as number 91 olden day the allamerican and he's going to be in the backfield the entire Dame and Clemson realizes that that very fortunate to somehow secure this football and get it into the hands of Gulman well that was a great job there by Watson to be able to get his hands on the football lipread football and getting into the hands with Sheldon day got penetration through third down after the loss they need four Watson rolls out flips it into flats gets big storm like a dive for a touchdown the way you get a crowd into this football game nice job then we talked about the recognizing things awareness he saw the Blitz they got one on one opportunity the linebackers could not get out in time to be able to make the play to safety I beg your pardon shumake could not get out in time he was kind of rubbed her screen he couldn't get out a mantoman coverage and Leggett is all alone the 64 yard drive with Greg dougela fresh berry picker makes it 7 nothing an Irish the infested have been very fast starting Kurt that had four straight three and out give up a touchdown here watch the Blitz coming from here here's the man who's going to get caught up in traffic Elijah Shumate watch him try to slide it over there one of the receivers got in his leg load him down just enough to free up leg it into the flat and Watkins bound in for the touchdown Tigers divert a couple third downs in their first possession watson to Liggett for a short touchdown pass now to John Kaiser young Notre Dame quarterback will get his first possession already down a touch and lake if the kicker from last year comes off suspension his first action not booted away near Carlisle dangerous receiver takes it at the 5 to find his face tiptoes out to the 25yard line but the John Kaiser a sophomore appearing in three Sport athlete at Lido central campus yes 6:00 or 2:30 I think as Brian Kelly watches his every game he learns more and more about what he can do and what he plays maybe not quite comfortable with it but I think Brian Kelly over the years has worked with different types of quarterback experience brought back the way Kaiser is athletic and he's adjusted his scheme to her Kaiser is more of a drop back quarterback for the distributor he had one career path before that Virginia game you'll be DJ Prosise who bounces off preface I cannot get away from Travis place let's take a look at tonight's chickfila impact players for Notre Dame on offense we've talked all all night here so far about CJ Prosise and what a great start is he is off he needs to be able to get on track to take some of the pressure off will fuller the big playmaker on the outside number seven BJ quids in performance and middle linebackers got to be a leader in the Kenzie Alexander number two prototypes again no order on as the Tigers warm in the middle it'll be third and long they just come right into the interior right in this area right here and they're coming from the outside as well they're just closed in there they realize that they need to zero in right now on this running game it's wet you're on the roll pumps and just went up 7nothing you're trying to ease yourself in a Brit visible concern his defense Lucy's first two players number one defense last year in third down East 15 here not find anybody keeps the play alive those elusiveness will be dropped ten yards short of the markers this is what kaiser is going to get tonight currents from Brent Venables if they get into third and long he shows five is if he's going to pressure with five and it's a sample of all who were those five drops and next thing you know he's only rushing three three i'm glenda guys he has eight guys in coverage Kaiser had nowhere to go into football and had to just eat it to try to pick up what he could I learn news some the hunter for the average up to a terrific start averaging 47 yards the kick this is not a good one now off the side of his foot and you'll spot football fast in Notre Dame territory they're still marching down that sideline to the 45 so Newsome within rocksolid 52 yards of hunt last week thanks 1 for 15 thumbs and back and business up a touch Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by United Airlines the world's most flyer friendly airline United fly the friendly skies Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking done and needs our premier partner of the Heisman Trophy can we welcome a regular guest the national championship trophy presented by dr. pepper awarded on January 11th acclaimed a of course the semifinals New Year's Eve in Dallas and in Miami the Irish the offense that only allowed six points in the first quarter this season a touchdown by UMass on the final play of the quarter are used to getting off the field quickly now they're under some pressure here Kirk Hudson takes over after the shank at the 40 well Clemson deserves a lot of credit for the way they started the game with that opening drive but Notre Dame has got it settle and they need somebody to make a big play here to kind of get the momentum swaying the other way no domina stopped immediately a stale on mess of freaky allworld linebacker jumped in the hole we're talking about somebody's got to make a play you would think Jaylon Smith number nine Sheldon day 91 91 and then yet Joe Schmidt the leader kind of the glue of the defense 30a those are their playmakers up front Prince forced a couple of fumbles against Georgia Tech that looms very big in that Irish home field when on 2nd and 10 playaction watch the fires downfield gets me hunter Renfro the shorthanded possession receiver beak tamari Russell well the thing that stood out to me in these conditions if he gets outside their flips in it but how about the hands of Renfro you can get conditioned high points the ball and makes the catch in front of Russell 24 yards puts the Tigers right back in the red zone and Watson initial traffic inside tries to bounce it and does die of forward for positive yardage villains grabbed him but you ain't when you see him do that again we talked about his awareness and understanding of the offense they'll give him like almost any offense in college football today they give him alerts they'll give him a run in a pass on the same play and if you just have four down linemen and one linebacker in that box area he's going to more than likely pull it down himself and run the football that's where the quarterback run game which hasn't been a big part of Clemson attack these first three games tonight it will be on display to give them the numbers advantage but maybe they might take the tempo down a bit with wet football not so far Watson plant fight spraying locks in a onetwo punch from the Tigers and the Irish on the ropes early now the John Watson is razorsharp distributing the ball and Clemson quickly up a couple of touchdowns I think this is the deshaun Watson a Clemson fan saw a lot last year of and he hasn't quite played that way and especially in their late game couple Thursday to go against Louisville but here's just recognition soft coverage Bailey gets after a low snap ball right on the money that you've got against protects himself keep his feet to be able to get into the end zone but it's the timing and awareness powered by Watson it was superior Tigers that run 11 plays and have 14 points though Clinton storing in its first suit possessions sandwiched around a three and out for the Irish it's 14 nothing quickly here like up to CJ Sanders at the free use free Xander finally wrestled out at mid fields a good field position for the Irish but when Kelly in his young quarterback down two touchdowns what now well first he's thankful that he got a huge return here bystanders who took one to the house last week against UMass that has tremendous speed for a true freshman and has a great feel to how to make plays in the open space look like potentially based bands but a good no call in your right now ain't going to settle down and and I think the big thing is in this situation usually like to turn to your guy who's my goto guy you're going to guy is CJ Prosise in will fuller you've got to be able to get them growing hair get a first down and times it's south completing and just be able to get settle into your game plan first down temper Kaiser delivers nearside the catch is made by a mere Carlile he's wrestled out about the Cassidy hover for an update the studio dr. pepper championship drive update number three ole missus serious trouble little Greer with a sport TV pass off the half this one San Antonio Callaway still Florida's been dealing with the flu all week but it's Ole Miss fans probably feeling sick right now rebels down 25 nothing on ESPN Wow month is alive and so is Death Valley Prosise this no running room so far Shaq Lawson junior next great defensive lineman a Clemson on the tackle and a guy to keep an eye on tonight he'll be matched up a lot with the allamerican Ronnie Stanley the left tackle from Notre Dame but again early in this game that Clinton defensive line allnew starters this year getting after that Notre Dame offensive loan I receive six on third Kizer wellprotected delivers a strike in Chris Brown next to first down catch inside the 40 round the senior for here in South Carolina two things have stood out to me number one the offensive line picks up pretty exotic look is some pressure but they pick it up they give him time the other thing is he felt that pressure but he didn't allow it to affect his vision he settled in showed some composure distribute that football for a first down on the defensive end downfield to make the tackle there kaiser rep still down at the backfield by mr. Lawson who could rush the passer he can create mayhem nice strong against the Rani's that sort of a doitall defensive lineman in Kaiser on his own read here get confused he's actually reading sack Lawson right here he kind of gives him a little bit of it and then comes out if he comes down on the back that he's going to want to give it or pull it out at this time he comes out initially and it jumped out of the quarterback and he confused his Kaiser amber green through it's too high was off the hands of Torii Hunter jr. he's lucky that was just an incompletion on its third and 13 very fortunate there was a lot of traffic in there anyway even even if he was able to put this ball on the money there was really nowhere to go that did the Tigers defense right now for us is just swarming they have their ears pinned and they are coming after the line of scrimmage it's coming after this quarterback this is a lot to handle in your fur coat start Tigers show some pressure kaiser rolls away from it and delivers incomplete as a flag down it was Ali they Jones the talented freshman tight end from Vegas the intended receiver and Johnson G dark Johnson was in coverage what Johnson's got to be thinking keep it number 18 spot file automatic first down you know he just makes a mental mistake here and he's frustrated but he definitely got early to the receiver and he's been there way way too early and that state experience he's going to try to get his body and around the intended targets there Jones and try to use his hand and swat at it from over top of him he's the guy that made depicts this feel that threepoint win at Louisville but the penalty moves the ball inside the 34 or site this is a guy that's averaging 100 to 50 Notre Dame's had five straight games of 200 plus yards rushing and they're just trying to get get out of the red here but again the problem you have again is they're going to make sure to Brent Venables the defensive coordinator for fun so it's pretty easy what his plan is they put eight men at the line of scrimmage right now against just seven blockers so they have an extra man and they're basically telling Brian Kelly your quarterback that your receivers are going to have to beat us until they do we're going to continue to staff the line of scrimmage either on the moon takes his birth downfield shot and frozen over the head of Chris Brown I think I think Clemson feels very very good about the matchups on the perimeter and we've got some great matchups Tanglers Tankersley who has tested there he's been tested all year against chris brown but the real matchup is will fuller number seven against Mackenzie Alexander we're talking about two guys that have bright bright futures and Alexander is following him at this point all over the field whether he's going to left or the right to the field is to the pounds right now there's the bottom of the screen on third down there's a brash shutdown corner teams rarely test him see how that matchup unfolds tonight Tiger shows the pressure up the middle Irish pick it up and Kaiser delivers incomplete delivered a hard shot that Brown couldn't gather on a wet night it's going to be tough on his receivers it sure is and I couldn't tell it been blown where who is rushing number 10 got a hand on this football right there no I did not balls coming in just bad and it was a tougher on Carlisle to be able to secure that would have been a first down if he came up with it he goes to pick cherry when he from 9495 in high school in terms of exchange of benefit Justin youn is a true freshman kicker from Nashville is four for six of the young season is from 46 yards he shows why he's one of the top kickers in the country good Nashville product blooms it through Irish on the board still down 11 what's next next is more questions in it it's vagrant understand and take the chance forgive everyone that says master things that can't be done and makes the home that runs on Sun next artist is that urban seed and makes our water top the creek next heals the heart and they painted smart and these detect change what comes next next ones plans with and refuses the fact what's next is false is strong and it is old we already what comes next the Irish Gomorrah the field goal this is just a June on a wet track any of the winter again into the wind tough conditions freshmen teams down 14 on the road you need points thrills it is the ritual to the Scott daily number 61 the long snapper and the holder half f your every made tick Hyun warns the parents of Korean distant in Ohio then move down to Nashville and not only Chris has it points but it kind of slows things down a little bit for Notre Dame pleased to get points on the board is this Scott a yard deep they faked the handoff and Scott has a little room chased down from behind at the 29 yard line by Nick Coleman this week on ESPN Monday Night Football to the Pacific Northwest Russell Wilson and the Seahawks Matthew Stafford get a little sore but I'll get went down hard on that Alabama today the Detroit Lions desperate for their first win it got mortars behind them and just Chuck Georgia struggles well I think we had a new rule in the SEC Alabama is no longer allowed to be an underdog they they seem to take that to first lady quick the streak was 72 in a row right so make it another 70 doing Doutzen this is Watson on the keeper and he's knocked down the far side there by Elijah Shumate the senior safety he's off to just a great start and and you know we asked him in our meeting about beneath he had a pl it played through it in the South Carolina game had surgery December 12 kids today whether it's college or the NFL you still come back eight nine ten months he's right around that 10 month mark and tonight's first time he's really turning it loose since then Gulman short game now Washington didn't play in the whole game the win over Oklahoma didn't do a whole lot of spring ball was able to throw in the summer Kirk but he used all that time the study tape like an ant boy and improve his knowledge he's really a student in the game it's just a passion it is mentioned a high school background and running a very similar is offensive high school coach came and visited Chad Morris took it back to high school and he ran it same terminology so when he came in as a freshman he really had an understanding of what they were trying to do but he continued to take it to the next level with film study and understanding of coverage the third third and median for the Tigers and that one has just tossed away Scott not quite on the same page as the quarterback zone Tigers forced to punt for the first time and the I was getting to put down again they come up with a field goal they get a stop it's a different energy right now for now in this stadium and now it becomes a little bit more of a level playing field and now you try to go out and you get back to your game plan and you go out try to execute Junior putters in the East all the wonderful trying to keep it away from CJ Sanders already has had the big return you mentioned what a dangerous weapon he can be Sanders the freshman from California he makes the fair fetch is he back pedals calexis just inside the 20 yard line 47 yards on the punt now the Irish back to work my Stanford is the offensive coordinator working actually the quarterback coach he's got the OC title Brian Kelly so Colin applause yeah yeah but enough incoming assistant coach and of course he was at Stanford his passing game coordinator out with David Shaw went over the Boise State last couple years he ran the offense at Boise and Frank Kelly recognized his qualities with the coach and a great recruiter brought him over here is really really helped Iser with being thrown into action with development so first an attempts Kaiser over the middle gets made and Corey Robinson receiver who just has been dealing with a knee problem it has finally full go this week it love to see the patients and I love the call by Brian Kelly here's the eyes you know you don't want to stare down at Telegraph to throw but he has shows patience here for him to get into that throwing window to give himself a chance he had to clear bindle where the linebacker once he did he shows you the socket for the football when he has time to draw eyes rkz the players that Valley get louder come on are in motion gross ice they are all over number 22 nights this might be one of those nights where you see Brian Kelly he's learning he's talking to Mike Sanford he's watching everything and getting feedback might be one of those nights because of the way Clemson is choosing to defend them where you're going to have to throw on first and ten more to set up then going to go back to pro size right now on first and ten they're facing an eight nine man front they're anticipating run role the way they did on the previous plan to then set Prosise up later this period at five times negative five yards and the Tigers shown pressure up here Kaiser has to dodge does get away and has plenty of room Kaiser down to the 40 yard line finally the tackle is made with JJ Goodson wisdom highrisk highreward when you're aggressive he can Rican actually run this right here with Prosise see the linemen downfield and throw it out here he couldn't do either so what does he do he runs in himself that was a play to either hand at the pro side throw it out or these run past options he couldn't do either so the idea is hey there's a hole there Prosise can't take it I'll take it myself there's nobody left in the middle Jay green fight off the Jukes by the quarterback was able to make a tackle or Kaiser met him get runnin Lake funk at five and then go spend a timeout because they end up scoring on this Drive that that's play that he just made that is a great example of his composure for a young guy that's never been in this setting instead of just giving up on the play or just kind of taking a knee or just digging in for a yard or two he's trying to try to pick up big yards there that was nice this is the first visit of the Irish years of 1977 this is a team loaded with NFL talent the Tigers had the lead late they're too hard but the fact that they left this game get away Vegas bergens admitted big catches in Montana and a couple of very short touchdown run in the fourth quarter as the Irish came from behind I was Dan Divine's eventual national championship team to beat the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl unbelievable to think that the white Clark is on the other son idea so I Clark son Eclipse Mencia but of course everybody almost so they're together later in time you don't see four or five years later we're best friends we're going to fight in the back of the info no catch Joe got in that day but of course they looked up famously and first down again Munson showing pressure geyser keeps it this time they're all over the court of equity stop them for no gain there it is first and ten you're not only facing guys in the bosphorus those linebackers Boulware and Goodson there um shooting gas I mean they're making it tough on the offensive line and even on his own read there's just nowhere to go and a really good job by lost in there collapsing down on the play they're going to run losses the local guy lost 10 pounds slimming down a little bit this year to get even quicker but he's still very very strong against Toronto Stephens the bottom of the defensive line they're standing up Road sight stopped again in the backfield he's got nowhere to run there's your guy full we're joined by his the safety green let's watch this it's breezy to here at the top and look what he's facing he's going to get his safety come down you got linebackers coming down your defensive end standing on the end try to be an offensive lineman and deal with all that and they're just attacking downhill not respecting anything down field and Notre Dame's got to be able to capitalize on that kind of approach from Clemson on the early down they haven't yet trying to target rule 4 is being guarded by McKinsey Alexander final minute of the quarter I repeat 11 on this third down our roles and throws behind the receiver and if incomplete why should the tight end and Ryan Carter hammered him not a very precise throw for down thrown behind him wisher has to adjust back to try to make a play on it could have been able to catch it but still would have been well short of the first down and at the same time he might have given Brian Kelly something to think about the possibility of maybe going for it but wisher cannot hold on to that football not quite in field goal range for you and so Newsome is on the punt trying to improve in his first ever this drops the point it's a tie and short and the Irish coverage team will got it at the 3 all of ESPN's College Football actions take on the go the watched ESPN app streams every game live download the

stay plugged into your game Ellie is usually pretty calm with cars or you see would be anything but Commodus quarterback to the pounds but there's some confusion Watson would be watering a hand that all Stallman wouldn't free to take the ball but they still get six yards you know that there was confusion but he didn't give up on the play he takes a turn to the right Galman goes to the left and he says yeah not going to get the ball in there I'm just going to follow him ends up picking up five yards there's no white confusion with a wet football down there outside your 10 yard line adjust your own goal nurse on the lead in the final seconds of the first quarter the Clemson sport quickly led 14 nothing the Irish tack on a field goal back after this message and a word from your local ABC station down to the second quarter on Saturday met football and ABC presented by Wells Fargo Tigers which around backed up at the 10yard line wins if they're back now you know working in middle and this is why Garmin is loved by the offensive line they just doesn't quit Heather Cox as the weapons gender gives an update in the winter and what I can tell you is the rain has remained steady there's expected to rain a good two to three inches throughout this game and get worse in the second half but Chris what has changed is the wind has certainly picked up a disgusting about 10 to 15 miles an hour and it's expected to gusts up to 25 miles an hour at times that could definitely play a role as to the field it's in beautiful condition a million multimillion dollar drainage system installed a few years ago before their last or busy since their last lane game and it's holding up great he's got about nine yards it's a baby they haven't had a rainy game here since 2009 it really it's one way to test that filled out that multimillion dollar system that they have to try to keep this field dry at least give them some traction a chance to be able to make some plays up the Octavia Scott has some live legs tonight so this Clemson offense crystal formation wants and gives it to Gulman is another first down run he's wrestled down hard there by banks rec field but he moved the chains again I've been really impressed with how Jeff Scott and Tony Elliott the two offensive coordinators have decided to come into this game running the football because if you look at the two sides Notre Dame's defensive line and their two linebackers Schmidt and Smith and you look at the offensive line you see a big advantage for Notre Dame but here in this first half way they have been able to control a neutralized Sheldon day and found that finding some room to run I'm looking for him to run now he'll backpedal and just lob it outofbounds and shed Morris who has given a lot of credit justifiably for running this offense to calm pressing me to become the head coach Scott and Tony Eliot former funds and playmakers now sharing the play calling duties risk on SOLAS that Elliot is go to the overall play caller does a lot of the 1 calls and right and Scott does the pass plays it's an interesting arrangement it is and I always get concerned when you here goes coordinator because you really want to know who's calling the shot who's the guy that is trying to take control is not position filled issue Chad Morris empty backfield and it was this designed run all the way but thinks he'll didn't de wouldn't let the quarterback get away third long and they also bringing a lot of linebacker pressure that's one of the things that they came in feeling that they had to do and it's kind of a staple Brian Van Gorder is trying to turn Joe Schmidt loose ooh this time they bring him up from the top and also to let Jaylon Smith kind of clean it up one thing I'm seeing is Jaylon Smith is starting to spy Shawn Washington the Shawn Washington came to this team not running a lot this game he has been running so they put their best athlete number 9 on it exactly if there's one guy who can spot him it is number nine and it back off inside breaking free Brook that's a nice run a little use playmaker for the Tigers but on third and long they get close to the marker it's going to be fourth down now so CFO dab was in a gambling mood up 11 that's a good job of picking up some positive yards there Joe Smith was picked up by a nice block and go max Redfield who's been playing with a broken thumb he broke his thumb against Texas he's got a cast for three weeks they've held him out some because you haven't been able to make a lot of tackles with that cast he came up this kind of wimp on Brooks they were lucky that it end up being a first down stop him about a yard short I'm saying he's dialed in to punt it's a good one with the women his back will bounce and roll dead asked about the 10yard line I thought it was touched at the 10 they're going to spot it at the 5 so poor field position on a rainy night for Kaiser it's been you have to be thankful for net one of the few back country we've got off to a better start than CJ Prosise for Notre Dame but he has gained negative five when six carries yes one of his six carries actually gained yardage he's got it again and this is that that's the run of the night so for Notre Dame and the reason is we talked about first and ten what constant defense has done tonight is there they're crowding the line of scrimmage and they're shooting gaps with linebackers and safeties and they're winning that battle they're willing to take chances against a young quarterback because they assume the pro side is going to get the ball on early down there leaving their defensive back to isolated 101 I think the guy we have not called it yet I'm sure Notre Dame fans at home are saying where is will fuller whether it's a quick screen or something number seven got to get his hands on the ball guys are nowhere to go on second and five Travis 20 came around the edge damn fuller with 22 Texas coming in an injury for that excuse the defense its Austin client a true freshman backup defensive end being helps to the frames table we can talk all we want about what's wrong with Notre Dame's office why aren't they giving precise per but again it's the scheme and it's right now it's the way they've crowded it and taken advantage of everybody better both bring some heat right now and I don't think you will you're right I only rushed for Kaiser has some time and completes it on the far side there Torii Hunter junior bins across the 30 so that time with plenty of time because it makes a good throw well he motions him over and he has soft coverage on third down that's one of the few times we've seen soft coverage and it's a mismatch with bull we're trying to stay with Hunter he locks in he finds him and again when he has time to throw and he sets his feet he's going to put the ball on the money see if they go play action here didn't call her a chance 15 got 15 yard instead they hinted to Prosise this son does get her on the edge a Harvard knocked by bull we're on the running back big hits lotta it like number 10 no I do I just don't want I can't think about what they lost last year and look how he stills to be he's coming around he's got tremendous Phoenix throws his left shoulder right in to the headgear there the shoulder of CJ Prosise dislocated he hits the neck shoulders head evil honest tutors from hard hitting that Vulcan he really emerged stepping in there to defend missing Stefan Anthony at linebacker and Vic Beasley and Grady Jared up they lost seven of their top ten defensive linemen this is a completely new defense with the exception of just a handful of guys at a hurry the Kaiser not spot the play clock here comes the flag killing play again didn't get the timeout good a hamburger come forward about oh sure and again Brian Kelly understood coming in with that's part of it that's why he's trying to do the best he can of getting to play in as fast as he can to give him some time to work with because he has options once he gets the call he has to look at the defense he has to make calls so he needs time to be able to be able to make those decisions once again the Irish behind the chains here Duncan in 12 take right back car Micra McGlinchey jr tackle from philadelphia once the spinners head he puts it down and back up these tackles have not dealt with this kind of crowd Stanley on the left is that a veteran he's been kind of epidermis Lynch he had never been in this kind of atmosphere he's out he in there they're working with fire accounts and it's more of a rhythmic saying not to mention he's worried about that defensive end lined up across from him hurry again Gert threw in the play clock does he see it and as another fly a third great penalty for the tiger costumes go backwards yokas Brian welcome to sideline you know at some point you have a delay a game then you have a lineman groove and then you have another delay a game and you might want to just jump in and call a timeout to help him out and kind of say let's go the throat is so is so we're going going backward second and 22 confusion on the funds and defense they're not really set at the snap it's a screen in the middle here Prosise runs into heavy traffic again Carlos Watkins stopped him it'll be third and very long and deal with three straight penalties legs after getting back down going in the wrong direction and your Clemson you got a young quarterback get they can draw or a screen or something simple and it didn't flow anybody they were ready for it the plan let's go run it run it run third and 17 a rush for Kaiser has protection delivers a throw off the hands of fuller so the top receiver went up but could not collect the wet ball at midfield first time they've even looked his way with a clear House of middle linebacker and it opens up perfectly he needed a lot of time for that play to open up but lower the middle linebacker has cleared out huge opening in the middle of that defense that their best receiver fuller just cannot hold on to that football he's the guy that made that touchdown catch with 12 seconds to go that Eve from Kaiser when they were in the wrong protection he just threw it up anyway but that was a costly drop now a fumble on the punt got was backpedaling it bounced off his chest looks like the Tigers retained possession or so they dodged trouble rooks on the recovery there that could have been a momentum changing climate Clemson keeps it Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Michelin a better way forward and Buick proud partner of the NCAA 143 Clemson are Hector pepper tip which they've grabbed game of the week ever go camping in the rain now a lot of it you never have done never I never have across from a stadium I don't know hopefully you have the app do you have the app you're good but a lot to see for Clemson fans so far you go back to work here in the first down throw Watson again hi it's just uh fun receiver that's a nice soft throw really should have been caught there by me on Cain is a very hyped true freshman receive yeah and you're not going to find a quarterback that throws a more catchable ball then deshaun Watson he puts that ball right there Cain's a true freshman by the way came they feel with Mike Williams out for the year they fielded Deon Cain at six to 200 pounds of the true freshman needs to emerge to become one of their vertical threats downfield number eight that at Tampa Watson there was a little Buchanan spin picks up about three it'll be third down it came into this football game we talked about not burning it loose with his legs not needing to in their first couple games it's doing it a little bit the Thursday night that they play Louisville but tonight it's been a very different look and we kind of anticipated that he already has thick carries on the night for 50 yards yeah Irish no pressure up the middle Mitch chases down the quarterback who flips a screen and heavy traffic Gulman was there but so were a bunch of Irish defenders as day was involved quickly well Gulman is going to try to work here to get out but here comes the Blitz and nobody picks him up they just shoot him right through the a gap he's trying to get the ball out there and obviously when you blitz the linebackers that's who would have gone over be right again that seemed best that's right so if he would have dumped that out there if he had just enough time that Gulman would have been able to get out there clean there's nobody left a risky defense they brought the pressure to works out joseline opposed he loves to play in the rain never get a chance to in Orange County in California this is this kind of night courses being completion in the front we'll just let it roll dead back inside the 15 the midway second quarter times and still protect him at 11 point lead 52 yards of the punt he's into a good start Allen part of that same elite 11 quarterback passes both of these quarterbacks here tonight Kaiser this protection delivers again high and off that hands of the receiver there that was Chris Brown a number of drops for Notre Dame tonight Heather excuse me that's better that's but a pretty epic fella what does he have for us here and now it's time for tonight's Aflac trivia question Notre Dame has had seven Heisman Trophy winners in their history Clemson none which to Clemson players have the highest Heisman Trophy finish two guys to finish sick it was a completion the Torii Hunter junior will ponder that as the Irish to move its change here you get out of danger three receivers working from the left to the right who picked the right one in the middle that was able to get a little bit of separation put the ball right where it needed to be then get post that's going help flags come flying is Kevin Dodd the other book in opposite Lawson invades the back to this is the defense that was number one of the country tackles for boy what's your offense number 56 not that late decline perfect that group was manhandling Texas in Georgia Tech it's a totally different story for the oline oh yeah I mean it not only is it a different story as far as being on the road you don't have Malik Dyer who's a dual threat guy you got a young quarterback on the road and right now this defense is assuming run on first and ten it makes it tough on him up front they lose seven on first N&amp;R Kaiser delivers a strike and it catches made finally they involve will fuller for the first time a tackle for T so makes it third and manageable by far the cleanest uniform on the field until that play right there it finally gets involved he missed one on the last series how about Kaiser hanging in the pocket just long enough to get that football out he was a little bit late on the throne and he finally finds fuller to get a chance here indeed sponsor down Pass complete of this season against the corner McKenzie Alexander flags again Thunder was crowding the line I was 58 McGlinchey is second time they are really struggling up front you got to remember if you're at home watching this you've been working all week on a silent count and all of a sudden you can't hear you're worried about this guy going around you knows that he does this and you start to flinch and you get called for it it's because of the atmosphere gives it crowd it is Fitz there's a difference between third and three burn eight Roger gets the right here's another flag you're going to get a hold in the backfield in the quarterback escape he does get first down yardage but this is going to come back Clemson's guys are are whipping him up front the Irish getting rattled and that was a great matchup because Ronnie Stanley against Jack Lawson and Jack Lawson Lowell the battle offenses loss has been a beast tonight he's got three and a half tackles for loss already Chris watch Jack Lawson at the top of his spin move been moved right there two offensive linemen they both had to hold a great back whole debate for look at that Stanley you're talking about frying families may be the best left tackle in college football Jack Watson where the spin move goes right by him threw the flag but he was hot check one of his back her down in Long again info site and not escape wrestled down again by the six five safety Jeon Kurt so it's fourth down rush three drop a great thing about that is even if they runs you have eyes on the football they rally to the ball and Brian Kelly there is just saying you know what we're going to punt the football play field position with Dorothea T to go see if the defense can get it back and see if we can get one more chance with better field position you have to have a conversation with those big linemen over there Kelly did it before when last and they came off the field this may be even more intense there's a punch bounced around down there looked like it touched somebody they didn't they didn't pick it up that way and the Irish are going to down the ball at the 8 yard line he wants it off it touched his gunner Farley who was down to safety or if it may hit the Clemson player who was blocking him I think that's not your opponent I didn't some but I thought Farley kicked it the safety Matthias Farley gavel wants an explanation 41 to see if he kicks it Sam is spotted yeah they're going to spot the ball back at the 27 mark fields never even came close to the football so clubs did before Oh six and a half goes back on offense Brian Kelly wanted an explanation pretty simple biased Farley the Nickelback who is down there covering the punty hit his leg and so the ball was spotted at the 29 Tigers trying to add to a lead before the break when Goldman the running back has not really gotten loose tonight is run at seven times for 23 yards they give it to him for an eighth time in the heavy traffic juries Hillary one of the talented freshman defensive lineman for the Irish on the tackle I think Notre Dame's defense is kind of settled into the game this game started so fast with Watson making plays and it was running he was throwing and before you know I got their first two possessions 14 points on the board and since then you can see that Notre Dame has settled in made some adjustments they're creating their own pressure for this Clemson offense Alliance similar to what their lines dealing with yep sweet motion Scott Jukes is way to the 35 it'll be third and four electric gone with the ball in his hands Chris Brian Van Gorder the defensive coordinator from Notre Dame now in his second year one of the great minds in college he's been up the NFL he's come back to work with Notre Dame and I he's got a great looks on a sideline but second year at his system I think it's allowed his defense to understand him and they allowed him to play much faster this year in his second year see if endured his defense can't watch him off the field a third down crow was dangerous into traffic Redfield was closing in Watson knockdown by day after the throw and it's 4valent I think he got away with one there Redfield is actually reading that the receivers his eyes were on the receiver and not on the quarterback and if his eyes were on the quarterback he would have been able to see that he had a chance to make the interception there's Sheldon day finally making an impact that have to get the sack but get into the face of Watson you can see the eyes of Redfield 10 he didn't even realize the ball was thrown in his direction if he would have he had a shot at an interception been gorgeous defense another positive series another punt from T's doll and a fair catch blue juggled but recovered by CJ Sanders there we've been so busy up here I don't know if he's even fun but you like watch didn't see it there what do you got again and now it's time to answer to the question we told you Notre Dame has had seven Heisman Trophy winners Clemson done two guys finished six is the highest who were they the answer 1978 Steve fuller 2009 CJ Spiller PJ Philip but six is the highest ever for instance maybe define Watson Sydney before he done it towards the quarterback in that game with the Montana one with is a heroics here in 77 for the Irish 246 to work with a couple of timeout Conger lots of time now backpedals throws it across the middle of completion in a hard hit after an eightyard gain jian curse delivered this junk there in carlisle cannot get over this present that de Kaiser has and got an offensive lineman it was down which T is up now watch guys are here I mean it's incredible it is we waiting and waiting and waiting it it defies enough time here to be able to eventually find his man he got some open receivers he's just having a hard time locating him he's been fortunate his offensive line he's been able to hold up there Quentin Nelson guard the sophomore was the offensive lineman down boy the last thing voter Dame fans want to see is another starter they've had what six of them gathered on injury so they'll examine that but boy Notre Dame came in here to a hostile environment an inexperienced quarterback in this situation the Shawn Watson Kirk was just razorsharp the first two drives found themselves in a 14 nothing hole who though oh look out now what is Kelly going to do to get back in the game they got the three but it's been the Irish defense it's impress me so without a doubt I think both defenses a combination maybe the conditions and not necessarily especially in Notre Dame's or Clemson's defense not necessarily fearing the pass game so it's allowed them to be ultra aggressive and they're going to be they're going to stay that way until Kaiser's eventually makes them pay for that but you're right Notre Dame had a chance there for a secondary down 14 the crowds in the game and it's looking a little scary they got the field goal kind of settled down from that point on Brian Bane corners bunches definitely kept him in this game but eyes are going to have to make some plays along with Prosise on a windy night with a wet field field positions been important and the Irish have had terrible field position for possession so they had to be a little bit careful they'll get the ball to begin the second half and and we'll see if CJ Prosise he can finally get loose it'd be hard to imagine Notre Dame coming out here with a win if he doesn't do something well as I said for him to be able to start to become effective they're going to have to get the passing game open going open running late around the end is hunter who takes a hit but he makes the first down two minutes to go and at the same time you know Brian Kelly the one thing about him and even said to us this week we've got to be patient we've got to be patient on the road with our play calling it's a four quarter game it's a 60minute game we're going to stick to our game plan guys are trying to get it to pull apart McKenzie Alexander is all over him and gives him a wag of the finger that's part of his game and unnecessary something everybody loves about it no no but it kind of fires him often he also likes to try to get to the head of the guy he's going up against he's going up against Poole opposed this was a matchup he's kept fuller quiet tonight so far once intercepted across the middle of Boulware had his hands on it as Heiser didn't spy on me well Boulware has had some chances and I think he's learning as the game goes on watch the eyes at the quarterback he does a good job of looking off and then then once he located tied in with sure who he wants to go to I don't think he ever saw the bull we're just waiting there and kind of waiting for that throw he was fortunate he got away with one there this is what Kelly was fearing another third and long against the Tiger defense Boulware shows pressure up the middle they pick him up Kaiser another high throw over the head of fuller a flag is coming down Chris I think Boulware was in the neutral zone I think he may have had a free play there all five defense fiveyard penalty third down but once the Irish offensive line didn't flinch and then will give a a third and more manageable look now gyrus have struggled on third down at Virginia on the roto 410 there were four for 11 against Georgia Tech even though they were productive it hasn't been a great third down offense so far this year we need five the polar up here at the top Tigers again showing pressure they bring a bunch of it Pfizer has time but couple receivers in the pattern now if quiet comes down in the secondary it's going to be against the Tigers even simple Lebanon that's a great call Amir Carlisle was actually about to break free from Travis blanks and he got fooled in like most defenders when they get fooled they just kind of put their arm out and try to grab on and he did he locked on to a mere Carlile great fall right there by the officials in the right call but one thing I'm starting to see is Clemson secondary moving after the snap and fooling Kaiser he had a wide open will fuller that time because the killer Mackenzie Alexander bailed and he had a curl route for a first down and he never even looked that way because he lined up the way he is right now in breath and it bailed like he is down the first down throw far side way over the head of fuller that's exactly this time I don't know if somebody fit the message in Mackenzie Alexander's showing press and it is the ball is snapped he's bailing which means we have the underneath route if we want him he missed the last one on third down that time he came back to me just missed the throw it's the thoughts of John Saunders mark van Mac Brown on this game all the happenings in the busy Saturdays at BMW halftime report is coming up minutes 29 till the break Munson had the Irish at third and ten to pregnancies gave them them first down down me and to Tiger territory Alexander does that he can up here that's the great matchup of the bail Ganzer as the ball goes downfield for Robinson who makes out close to making the catch in his hand he was running against Tankersley in the Admirals son as the nursing and he could not collect it it would have been a great catch but Chris remember I talked about this and also watch this down the middle of the field this is part of being young and being a quarterback they bring the Blitz and look right here how break free and look at this open man right there these are things he already had locked in on Robinson Robinson had a chance but he had to wide open receivers he never saw it's a great point he went to the third easiest guy right and then route third and ten across the middle at hauteur making a catch but hit hard by blanks short of a first down so fourth down ball spotted with the 40 for the Brian Kelly mark that just kind of worked a little bit of clock here getting under a minute you talked about they defer so they get the ball to start the second half trying to gamble here yeah I think what depending on account he's going to take the cloth all the way down here and then probably make this time out make a decision in case he misses it if he ends up going for it he didn't want to give to Shawn Watson much time to work with guys are nine of nineteen receivers haven't exactly helped them out it had a few clutch drops ESPN after the duck and the Buffs in boulders would Center on the cover with a complete postgame wrapup or some I saw this morning to think the city buffaloes are not a very big underdog the Oregon have a chance for a milestone linmark win that would be big it would be a big hit Capital One ranking is here in the Ohio State with a handle I don't forget the a very twice d Indiana team a lot of heart sevenpoint win UCLA now down 22 spin it is literally under this potential offset there there Ohio State fortunate to get out of there with a win but makes it sweat he started he knocked over you suction didn't figure there's a five Kirk was we got to be where we climb with that sexy shirt in a recent trend it would continue so the punt team out for the Irish women take a time out wouldn't figure they try to do too much no but good you want it down there you can see the intensity down there with Dabo Swinney just good to be just to be safe go punch safe and be aware that potential that that might happen Davos got a pretty good you know record he but Sweeney against Thompson opponents when he's the lower ranked guy five and two one for know the games have been home or neutral he pointed out to us the other day no player on this roster has ever lost a game to a team that finished a season ranked outside the top ten but that seven losses the last three years but but none of those old what info clemsoning losses that we talked about the old days when they lose to a team they should handle easily and lose to do four in favor of a flat three year thirty five and seven wins over LSU Auburn Georgia Ohio State Oklahoma the Newsome to punt into a wind it drops the point it's a short kick but a nice roll and so inside of 30 seconds comes them will have the ball at the 3 yard line well tomorrow and until insiders get your day started followed by the initial Sunday countdown guys 10:00 a.m. to the insiders 11 o'clock or camp Sunday at ESPN getting streaming live

Dalton was excited watching trevone Boykin and TCU rock the hammer on the horns they were 7:30 nothing's you see what the end of the first never thought I'd ever see PC you or anybody up on Tech the 32 nothing in the first quarter boom safety knows Watson takes to be a boy is a fast start for the Tigers but the first possession of the end zone got a three and out and were quickly a 14 nothing the Irish defense rose up and clubs an only out game Notre Dame by a total of 15 yards in the first half Irish would get the ball to begin the second half the end of 30 minutes in Death Valley that BMW halftime report including Heather's interview with Davo Sweeney coming up right after these messages welcome to the BMW halftime report both Clemson and deshaun Watson got up to a very quick start 14 to 3 before Notre Dame settled down but Dabo Swinney still is on top he's with our Heather Cox coach you came in saying that you really wanted to force DeSean Kaiser and make you some bad read some uncomfortable situations how have you been able to do that so far well we haven't done a great job on her down and when we have done a good job with getting penalties so we got to clean that up I mean we've let them we found a had them in jail a couple times and we and we bailed them out with some stupid penalties so we got to fix that ok offensively love to start with we had you know we had a couple of field position issues where we were able to flip it back so hey we just got to settle in come on play great second half but you know they're we know they're a great team and it's going to be a great half so we just got to get here and get a few things cleaned up coach thanks for your time of course he was their quarterback that took them to a national championship game don't forget if the game you want to see is not available where you are you can get it on watch ESPN download the app we're going to watch ESPN accom and you can see just about every game of deshaun Watson at a pretty good first half couple tough sound sauces and Clemson has a 14 to 3 lead second half is coming up after this message and a word from our ABC stations welcome back to the dr. pepper championship tribe game of the week yo Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo and this presentation of the SEC on ESPN Clemson trying to give the ACC a muchneeded signature win they lead the Irish 14 free at halftime party mood here DJ Shaw if they have a wife you keeping it going here is it a start to the party for Clemson does quick 14 points the lead but the Irish methodically kind of getting back in at Kirk this is an offense for Notre Dame that's but hitting a lot of home runs in the first four games let it shunk plays seven touchdowns of 50plus but only one really explosive play tonight it was a scramble by Kaiser what can they do to create more of those plays well they came into this game and their bread and butters CJ Prosise and their running game and on the early downs we talked a lot in the first half Clemson is anticipating run on 1st and 10 and I I think that's where the chunk plays could comment a second half for Brian Kelly he's going to they're going to end up running the ball they're going to want to run the ball because that's who they are with Kaiser a quarterback but I think first and 10 you got to take a few shots again system and coverage and count on will fuller and the other receivers getting separation against that oneonone coverage and make it a place Robinson had a chance to make a play couldn't collect the ball at the goal line fuller had a big drop on the third down play at midfield isn't did that help the quarterback out tough conditions for receivers with a wet football Clemson's receivers have had few problems relatively speaking specially early see if sanders collects it on the hop and the freshmen follow some blockers breaks it back eluded the ball and Clemson says they've got it at the 30 the kicker Lake who comes off a suspension came flying down there may have knocked the ball loose I think he did I think he knocked it Wow welcome back to the Clemson Tigers again at a tough start to the season you don't expect this from a kicker I mean this is incredible but a technique he put his helmet right on the football and the big that is unbelievable play by the kicker in DJ Greenlee ends up coming up with DJ Fuller may have been involved in the recovery as well so Notre Dame's immediately has to go on defense turf and try to prevent it from this lead from growing but if you're a Clemson after a big turnover like that you're in attack mode talking to the freshman Scott on the pop path and the couple of walkers out front nice first down game before Smith got him really reminds me of how the game started a Clemson got the opening kickoff they had a nice return and a big run to start the game by Watson and they got the Notre Dame defense on his heels and they became the aggressor early in the game and now they get a turnover here to start the second half and right away they're there in aggressive mode Scott into the backfield as the emotions Ballman out and the throw is incomplete it was low and trying to come back to the ball there was jermonta hopper third and 2 now a double screen set up to the left and the right Notre Dame took away our Tavia Scott and also did a really good job of taking away the receiver to the right nice defense anticipating and expecting that after the first turnover of the game and then needs to the Irish this would be a normal enormous for the Notre Dame defense to get a stop after the fumble the quarterback run was a real weapon for Clemson Scott in motion Watson does keep it it heads to the end zone 21 years Kirk is your right the second half begins much like the birthdays and they kind of went away from it which was surprising with the early part of the first half we saw a lot of runs from deshaun Watson and here on a crucial third down and starts his second half and get exactly the look that they want again this guy he doesn't run the ball the way Tajh Boyd used to with the physicality but he hits the crease that he's got to speed to take it to the end zone so Watson has grown pursue and now run for one he's got 72 yards on the ground it's all because of this fumble great job by the Kenter causing it glimpse it jumps on top of it a couple plays later big third down to John Watson calls his own number gets the look that he needs the blocks and into the end zone the Watson touchdown run bills the Kushans Tigers biggest to the night 18 like if the kicker they're going to keep CJ Sanders on the return game you looking no return this time with the 16 days between games they had a lot of things to work on they fired a couple of guys at the kick coverage team and they produced a turnover take a look at our Pacific Life game summary and talk about the fast start that John Watson awareness accuracy decisionmaking and also tonight his legs great block downfield got the look that they wanted they motioned the man over opened up perfectly how about this punch of defense we're about the same again making it very very tough on but he is running the football just nowhere to go nothing but orange jersey the average that they would get the ball curve down 14 3 and now a fumble the ball is loose scooped up by curse a second turnover and comes in a chance that a ball is open as the Irish selfdestruct then Boulware knocked the ball loose first recovered it terrible night for frozen well it's been one of those nights for this Notre Dame all offense he finally gets a little bit of room to work with the contact from Boulware the club that comes through the ball is down they had a little bit of room and there's the safety curse jumping on top of the football just say there get the ball you think down 11 start the second half with the fumble kickoff they get it back down 18 and now in the first play pop it up well it this is huge right here to see what happens is look at all the big Jews in the stakes things would have not gone their way but this is big and I think dabbu Sweeney it is offensive coordinators they sensed an opportunity here let's see if Notre Dame's defense can step up yeah hoping it's a screen in traffic the catch is made by talented true freshman rayray McLeod with a short game the Jaylon Smith nice job there again he's in the middle of that defense along with Joe Schmidt when you're on the ropes like this you're on the road I mean that's where you're typically going to hope that a guy like Schmidt or Smith or Sheldon day can make a play to help this defense Watson gives it off the Gulman at the short game Smith and Smith Duke buddies who are they say in the same page you almost have a telepathic communication they're also golfing buddies but you're exactly right somebody right now has to try to turn momentum if this thing gets to 28 3 and a wet yeah and you got big big problems absolutely right that's why I'm saying this possession right here is crucial for actually for both teams Thunder Day wants to keep themselves in it and Clinton's looking for a knockout punch soft coverage at the top you'll recognize that it's actually changing the protection right now moving to tighten legging over but he's got soft coverage if he wanted to peak at the top 3rd and 9 looks back to the left lobs it down the field Scott could not come up with it and a chance to make up all is the beautiful fur laid out there by what yeah so instead of going to up to the top of the soft coverage he decided to go to one of his goto guys Scott the ball is absolutely perfectly thrown on the outside shoulder you see the separation Scott did what he needed to do with the line of scrimmage to pull away from Luke the ball is thrown to the outside shoulder where he can go away from the defender he just what not wasn't able to hold on to the football you can't you see the rain coming down you receivers hate to have excuses we've seen some great catches despite these conditions as a receiver you've really got to lock in and focus when you have those kind of opportunities sweeney upset he sent Gregg Hyuga line for what would be a 52yard field goal the wind it is it is back so even though that's five yards longer than his previous best this year they didn't see the play clock running down and had to spin a timeout and you don't see Dabo get that fired up you might be thinking about dance in the locker room later too right now he is fired up oh boy yeah we ample out the with the Ray Ray of the well keypad to whip the Nenets they'll be dancing the vases they closed this went out you can you can guarantee that oh we may pull the Navy out here on the field talking to Heather they win this game now fiftytwo yarder again you've got a tailwind here this is tough conditions death line is the holder and if the fake aren't the punch Google just takes the direct snap and pushes it down there goes pretty good touch quarterbacks got good touch that is the kicker smart decision put a big stop by Notre Dame defense after that turnover Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Chevrolet fun new roads Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking done and chickfila we didn't invent the ticket just fix it in Sandwich dr. pepper championship drive game of the week is 21 free Sofia the Irish jerk get a date see events turnovers on consecutive plays here 95 yards away the rain is pouring wind in your face now and you're going to face the defense that's going to tennis ears and shoot the safeties and linebackers in line of scrimmage both sides fixed his way for one of the better runs of the night against 10 yards in the first down well that was a great job by the right side of that offense the line of opening up some room finally for CJ Prosise they got a great push and just open that up elmer the right card McGlinchey right tackle with ours is a guy cookie new at 91 yards against actually he's it's correct from anywhere on the field that they can get him a little crease like that Arda turned three yards Heather well guys amazing Brian Kelly out of the locker room nothing he thought about nothing but the running game and then BOOM backtoback turnovers how can he find success he talks about the oline needing to block better he talked about finding the partner and taking advantage of it when it's there and he talks about finding at those gas and guys as you can tell this is definitely the toughest artists reign of the night to fight and look with precise and has your power you know over the head of fuller was closely covered by McKenzie he's winning that oneonone battle so far yeah Heather touched on something there at the end of her report about the weather and just from up here you can tell it's like sheets now coming down brain with that wind right now they're they're facing that win that's down there a lot of things going against them in another third and alone the pressure to the left or disguising it a showed up in the Montana right Boulware lined up with the middle linebacker good stand off to the left outside of the temple yep here they come they pick it up well lift in the flat post size makes the catch and get free Steve's a proud size brought down across the 40 it was a savings tackle by Alexander that might have gone a lot farther to watch goods and they both are showing it home where it comes he disguises and then comes out to try to pick up both sides coming out and because he hesitated just actually he tried to stay with him just a great move by precise to get separation and then a great touch throw by the John Kaiser who had some running but picks up 23 as a receiver there vizor looks right didn't have anybody to track down behind the line of scrimmage by Carlos Watkins looked like a little bit of confusion by this Notre Dame offensive line and also great cutting this right here he shoots the gap nobody picked him up by the time Kaiser even concerned of the law he's already the backfield watch this great acceleration but a big for a little easier there's a mistake up front a little mental breakdown there by the Irish offensive line just Adams is a freshman in the game takes the handoff kind of a frustrated reaction from Kaiser after the put that he want to pull the ball yeah it's a zone read where the quarterback you got it you got to give a freshman running back and the quarterback was trying to make a read and when you make that read the running back in the quarterback have to be on the same page they have to read the same thing so it's not like you're just handing at all and carrying out a fake you don't know who's going to get the ball to you're at that next point depending on what the defender does Adams is a talented young freshman prospect with his first theory of the night sets up a third and 12 Kizer stepped up nowhere to go dragged down again Edd's I'm initially but no one to throw to they rush three in Krabi again he has people and it's one of those things that when you have an offensive line it's going to give you that kind of time you've got to be able to locate it whose eyes are on one or two guys it's hard at his age with a lack of experience to find a third guy but rushing three and that time Kevin God is able to get there and apply the pressure see Kelly asking him what did you see Scot just gets away from it the ball will roll out of bounds then we'll start inside there ten eleventh year we're all safe sponsoring the good hands field goal Nets I'll save making contributions to general scholarship funds for each field goal an extra point kick allstate has contributed millions already in scholarship funds 53yard punt use some fins the Tigers back deep down well that's again if you're looking at the big picture twenty one two three at the very least Notre Dame was pinned back inside their own ten to start their last drive they pick up a few first downs they get a good fun now their defense again now they've got to get some they got to get a stop and try to get the ball back to their offense a good field position hard running by Wayne Gulman pretty good gain on first down Shawn Watson a game where he's been involved in the run game which we anticipated a couple touchdown passes 72 yards rushing returned over 10 yards of carry when he does keep the ball and of course the last touchdown they had was him keeping it getting into the end zone second down moment again the Irish James tackled him shift short of the marker so it'll be third down on need a couple Domon hasn't had a lot of room averaging 3.4 on his 11 carries here the heavy rain now pumping at our microphones on the people the long one and third down figures to be a quarterback run Las been able to just wrinkle for enough room to move to team I think you and I and Joe Schmidt and everybody else when they saw Galvan motion out of the backfield Joe Schmidt pointed to Jaylon Smith to be ready Joe Schmidt took on the block and he was hoping the Jaylon Smith might be able to make the play to keep him short of the first down so even when you know it's coming sometimes you're not able to stop him member dr. Gulman on the edge where you could hear the pads pop it was 9 versus 9 as Smith brought him down quickly that's fun to watch that gives you a feel right here to be out in the field some speed right there coming riding with bad intent as you said we didn't take a lot of that last week no from though you're getting stoned anything you pointed on the need for this Irish defense to try to make a plate turn things their way Watchmen rolling he's brought down a hammer really hard outside the pocket there that's what makes Clemson fans really nervous his Hillary arrived and that helped and again you're talking about a guy that had ACL surgery just ten months ago so not you know he's put some weight on last year as a true freshman he was he was quite he 195 pounds now he's up to 210 pounds and you could just tell and we haven't seen him since last year where you see him on film it's one thing you came in person he's gotten thicker but still you host your breath with a guy who had a knee feel ten months ago rolls out on 3rd on fires near side tip I catch no ruling yet they're talking about yes on a test render Pro came up with it Irish you're arguing he was juggling the ball Clemson trying to play very fast if they can see the potential replay review on a times a no they don't make the appeared on stopping the action in which they do Joe Ryder early on the replay official they passed that play is under further review right next to us a firstyear watch Renfro Chris this was like backyard football planning to slop in the rain off of two players and it's going to come down to whether or not that he had possession when the left foot was down I don't think so I don't let's take another this would be a good angle because initially you can't see that you can't see that not only that Kristine initially touched the ball he possessed the ball and then it looks like he let go of it this is a very very much the ball yeah the ball left his hand so I think by the time it left his hand he ended up losing possession of the wanting this angle here right and I think he's got possession after he's already out of bounds see people think it's not it's not about that because I'm telling you he loses the ball and now his feet are in the air I don't think that's the completion it's a huge potential over term it would be fourth and seven ok watch it the ball in a way watch the ball it's in the air and then he's and his feet go into the air you right so he was right there in an opportunity to make the plane that would have moved the chains it's nothing like calling a game here at Clemson of the fans are about six feet away turning to you and I saying is it good or not if you signal incomplete they don't like you very much shave them aside like I don't think it's good they're like come on like like we see them down here on there all right everybody welcome her friendly way to the city you guys are on there we go you should be looking right over here that those are the guys making the decision just stop that directly I think yes I do considering completion as the reload Ellen over incomplete guys was Joyrider nodding his head leave us we'll just the guys next to us we're not sharing in the press box no renfro very sure handed receiver meant it but it's off catching the rain earlier spring our rules expert Dave to tie in what the what is your opinion of what you've seen well Kirk and Chris it's very close but I have to agree kinda with you that left foot is on the line it can be juggling it all go into the air Dave right right they're out here there see it right there and he to me does not have possession in bounds if you would have held on to it on that first possession when he first caught the ball I think he might in the debate would have been about to be about the left foot delay oh but he but the ball went back up into the air and then he secured the ball and by then his feet were in the air knew it was an incomplete I have to agree with you Kirk that's what's to me after further review the ruling on the field player did not maintain possession therefore is incomplete not popular here but we think correct so it is fourth down on a punch coming up instead of first down that was a great effort though it was a great effort one of the reaction of renfro's he makes their faces they're like why how can you believe he made we're so caught up it was the inbounder out of bounds it's nice to be able to step back and say that was pretty cool to see him somehow in these conditions we'll see a guy that balls thrown right to them prophet he's a somehow able to focus and concentrate come up with that football Sanders who lost the football to begin this half desperate to try to make a play redeem himself it's back deep he's still punched it high and it's going to bounce and spin backwards so no chance for a return Irish with six minutes to go in the third and 18 Thank You Cassidy here in wet wild close to these folks are ready for even more ran and then even warm rain headed this way goes out on first and Kaiser at the sidestep the rush and delivers to a wide open man drop again this time it was Torii Hunter junior a rough night for the Irish receivers in the rain and he Kirk where we are where this this big orange tiger paw has and there's a lot of orange and yellow stuff headed up from the coast Charlestown has been badly flooded the last 24 hours it's figure see a little uglier here and looking at the score knowing that that's on its way 21 to 3 Notre Dame better get some points on the board in a hurry Adams takes the handoff and is hit immediately in the backfield a flag comes down Kevin Dodd is joining Jack Lawson both defensive end the 780th wrong night a Notre Dame player ran onto the field in on you later substitution against the offense fiveyard penalty second down now the confusion in a tough environment continues for Kelly's offense will fuller ran onto the field I don't be curious to know what Brian Kelly is cured what he's upset about I mean the ball was just about to be snapped McKenzie Alexander the corner for the Tigers was slow to get up he's now trotting off he's the guy that's been shadowing fuller all night pullers off the field he'll go off the field he's out there at the top and he goes off and then the play goes on and then at the last second watching the merge back here he starts to come back on the field and then they spent the ball so third down and long again in each pen eyes are rolling he's got room to run takes the hit in his stop short at the 45 yard line it'll be forced into Christian Wilkins chased him down interesting I wanted freshmen on the scene interesting decision right here and that time Kaiser just turned his shoulders and just knew he was going to take off and run with the football but Clemson gets to stop Notre Dame is going to have to punt the football early to gamble in your engineer new yard yeah I mean you're still in the third quarter you still feel like you trust your defense to get the ball back there is no return man for the Tigers Newsome just boots it away and bounces around and will drop in the 16 yard line in the reminder Monday night on ESPN Seahawks and the Lions interesting when desperation comes into play in the NFL early in a season that is the situation for datoria but a fairy tough spot having to go to Seattle he's 15 Eastern on ESPN and the watch ESPN Prosise wasn't in there at the end of that last drive trying to stay loose on the exercise bike kinda limped off the field curcuit he's been held 232 yards but his 13 carries two and a half per carry does have two receptions for 28 yards it's kind of been their answer to try to get him loose Domon trying to get loose and he lowers his shoulder except seven well I've been impressed by Clemson running between the tackles there's Alexander who's going to go in and get looked at in the locker room that's a big loss because he has been matched up against Notre Dame's best receiver but I've been impressed with their I get a ton of yards but 132 on the ground and Galvin's been able to contribute to that loan with Watson it again takes the big shot at the end of the run but you know Dallman maybe not the most naturally gifted running back but he really makes up for with effort and toughness we could show that Sheldon hey that defensive tackle who's an allamerican candidate that time he's been getting worked over we have not called his name much at all tonight in that time Joe Goren and Tyrone Crowder just took him out completely out and opened up a nice running Lane bishop near sun Gulman spit back and gets in the open field and moves the chains again to the 42 so now the tiger running game begin to get revved up and I'm sure Jeff Scott in Tony Elliott the Coco coordinators are looking down at this and thinking they're probably kind of looking at themselves we're talking themselves saying hey how about this I mean we thought we might have to run more with deshaun Watson but right now we're starting to really control that line of scrimmage defeat Dolman again gets the edge we brought a beard which offensive line Kirk would have success against the the opposite D line it's been Clemson so far it really has and if you watch the first three games for both teams he would never have anticipated you would have thought you know the scheme and the tempo could be an equalizer helped Clemson but that offensive line deserves a ton of credit for the way they have played in his slop against they talented front floor it moved 34 yards in the drive all of them by Gulman and fill that keeper by Watson so it'll be third down and short by midfield Notre Dame has played this year they have played well and then they would have they'd give up a big play you know more often than not through the air but they have played well they've shown you what they're capable of doing especially up in the front the front six I say six because you know that most of their outside linebackers walked out because of the spread look that they see so Watson checks the play card in 33 Zac Brooks was in the game Washington just takes off breaks the tackle move the chains again Davos Queen eat elders say it gloves are off we had the knees healthy the song feels good this is a tough opponent we're going to have to run them tonight and the timing on that quarterback counterplay was exceptional Tyrone Crowder the right guard pulled it through Zach Brooks the the running back had a nice block that opened up perfectly Brooks that comes in motion they give it to him and he fumbles it still booting it around excuse me that's rayray McCloud 34 and it's an incomplete pass because it was a pop pass the freshman couldn't didn't grab the handle there that's the good thing about digestible plate exactly it happens really fast and it's just a little little pop pass but you know right away you just assume you think it's a fumble and one thing they might look at is it did he have possession of the ball did he take a did take enough steps to have possession you could see his eyes kind of turn it up feel young guy was looking where he was going and didn't secure the ball Watson spun around and hit for a loss so the Irish defense gets in there Cole Luke on his corner got there quickly and third and long now yeah that time that they're trying to just do anything to try to change the flow of this offense they brought the corner from the bottom on the Blitz there as you said Luke and that you right now you're on the ropes you got to try to pull out all the stops and Brian Van Gorder is known as an aggressive defensive coach and you know by the way Brian Kelly what's that see yeah you got none of the green leprechaun legends dead do you not like he's gonna go in here what you want but he's in rehab watson a downfield shot in a flag comes in under Renfro was tackled by Safari Russell the Renfrew who almost made that circus sketch off the carom pass interference defense number six 15 yards that's the guy you expect to go dude but he be run home so he gets around him and chose to pretty good quickness he gets outside Russell's known as the top cover corner for Notre Dame he's in pretty good position actually but right at the end as run froze going for the football that's where Russell ends up happy to get it hold on looks like under his belt maybe the penalty moves the ball to the 33 and a half approaching the final minute of the third quarter Renko 510 175 pounds former walkon I just got a scholarship big pretty good it big moment for him py now pop it down deep he juggled it Luke was defending and it picked off hey I got to say something you're down 21 to 3 right that's a score yeah it's 21 to 3 and and you just make it playing he's still talking to the crowd I mean you made a great play you're trying to get the ball back to your to your offense and you're worried about looking up to the crowd and giving them the sign I just don't understand that we see that all over college football and NFL football makes no sense to me you're losing twenty one two three so anyway besides that he's in position he act the ball was just thrown up is one of those plays you hope your receiver is going to go and you just throw it to a spot and enjoy to a spot and Luke actually did a nice job of anticipating and got in position to be able to go up and make the play but he seems to be happy they got the interception and I hope the office goes down in four papers in good position Luke has both of the picks the Irish have made this season first ice knocked down after nine yards southern well it looks like that bike did CJ Prosise some good he's been stretching out that last quad and staying on that bike to try to keep it warm he's definitely got a pole there but obviously we'll continue to play also his quarterback deshone Kizer cramping in both cast continues to stretch those at this one up to both of his receivers and say we've got this loose in here before referencing the virginia comes early on England thank you both ice on this pin free does spins again and gets the first down of the 40 they were not down 18 different you know the big difference yeah and they weren't playing this defense but you can understand what Heather's saying about hey we've been here before the only difference I was fish you got a guy down looks like the safety you know it's green it you're down three possessions and I at this point I'm not feeling any urgency like you know I'm saying with Kaiser right you know you're only going to get the football back so many times and you're going to need to start to you don't have to go hurry up but you need to kind of get out of the huddle and have a little bit of urgency to you because it's not just about scoring on this possession you need another stop and then another score and then another stop and another score they have not been able to create the chunk plays the kind they were able to create in the first four games NFL insiders and Sunday NFL countdown making your day at 10:00 a.m. Eastern and countdown comes on at 11:00 and streams live on the watch ESPN appellants tomorrow over on ESPN Green has helped up and that didn't look anything serious and painful for sure momentarily but if this helps off just got it in a vulnerable position there he's been active for nine seven tackles for Venables defense which is so far done a tremendous job still can't believe this this was the best defense in college football last year if you look at the numbers and they lost virtually everybody off of that defense and this defense first four weeks the season playing the way they are take a lot about Brent Venables and his team in his relationship with these players absolutely number one the yards per game cast efficiency tackles for loss and third down and they are looking like that I'm missing a feat in 2015 back after this message of the word for your local ABC station beginning of the final quarter this presentation of the SEC on ESPN comes the one of six eight PC opponents the Irish are playing this year the rain is not dampen the spirit is still a rowdy party from Death Valley along Hilda climbs the Irish Kaiser as time now decides to take off and slides down s 245 it's a good first and game would you'd like to see him Kerr gosh and again how do you how to create a well the prolly the problems print Venables smart guys got to safety deter chief taking away anything thrown down field unless you can throw it over the middle of the field or you can try to hit a slick screen the preventable zit knows they need to hit some chunk plays he wants to make them have to drive the field for everything that they have pinnacles in his fourth year his defense has improved its brief allowed every year well Kaiser gives the fake and loops it down wide open his Prosise on the sideline stays in bounds and scores so there's that chunk play for the Irish they are still alive 56 yards and they snuck him out of the backfield in the defensive backs from Clemson just completely lost him they were they had their eyes in the backfield they didn't feel him sliding out of the backfield at all I think they were so concerned about will fuller and the other receivers that he just got lost and Travis blanks number 11 tried to catch up with him but just he got behind him see if he did stay inbounds he really online or touchdown that play is under for the review did not see him touch the side I was very close right after he made the catch oh this would be a great look you know I think you stayed in I don't know I don't take the heel I don't think the heel went down if the hill would have gone down he would have been out of bounds but if he looks like it's up they will ask your opinion what your lighter is going to decide here that's the first time I just don't think I just don't think that's enough because the heel doesn't go down Kirk as you've seen that is not enough to reverse this play this should be a touchdown so close sighs Kirk has been held 250 yards and his 15 carries as a runner now has three catches for 84 and that's touchdown pending the review here after further review there really is confirmed touchdown the eighth touchdown this year for the Irish of more than 50 yard that's more than they've had in any season going back to Oh to think about that yeah but in brightly they design it's done yeah it's not by an accident remember that there's 21 to 3 we're talking at the break you need to touch down an extra point or a touchdown twopoint conversion and then a field goal to try to tie this up is we wonder he wondered if they scored where they go for two right away or wait they have to go for two on one of them he's elected to go for two now that way if they missed it he knows he just needs to touch them oh I'm out oh boy Notre Dame so they have to spend a timeout that that is not what you want to do when you're trying to climb out of a hole here rushing let's go back to the touchdown here and Prosise is right here and you're going to see one receiver go here another receiver go here and that's what really occupies the defense you also have a safety right here Greene who's tied up I think he might have been the one that had to be responsible for prosigns but look at the eyes in the backfield right here nobody really keep hitting eye on pro side sneaking down the sideline and by the time they react we've got the speed after making the catch to be able to get into the end zone they just spent being simply lost him too much focus on the receivers see what Kelly cooks up after that nice little play he took the house smart Venables is Kelly Kenneth Rick two men time yeah exactly but on that twopoint conversion he wastes the timeout looks like it players out there I think he was waiting on Corey Robinson to be out there both sites to the right in the quarterback and Robinson goes in motion either looks that way throws into the tall guy who can't get it Robinson is six foot five went off his hands again and he put it exactly where the big man could go off and climb the ladder and make the catch he just wasn't able to hold on to it Irish score in the big play but not a real good sequence for Corey Robinson Rikki Poynter night he wasn't on the field yet it's been a timeout and then a very catchable pass yeah that's big to be able to get this game within ten points and I think Brian Kelly not only upset about the drop and it has more to do with having to burn a timeout on a twopoint conversion in a game when you're trying to play catchup you need you need all three of those timeouts do some boots it fuller and green are back this is Scott taking it across the 30yard line he's our Pacific Life game summary Kirk with his quarterbacks yeah definitely you got to look at what the Shawn Washington has done and the numbers aren't going to blow you away but I think he's just made the plays that he needed to make a crucial moment and the three touchdowns and for Kaiser a young guy who is literally learning with every single rep that he faced against a very aggressive Clemson defense but give him credit for hanging in there the guy is battling tonight against the defense as I said is kind of had the notre dame's offenses number for most of the ninth and watch them back out there off his fourth interception of the season throws in near side he catches made by Ray Ray McLeod and the freshman out across the 40 near the marker Ray Ray McLeod is going to become the next great one you would think a true freshman out of the Tampa area he along with Octavia Scott think about Octavius Scott Clearwater Ray Ray McLeod is Tampa James peon came from Tampa and who opened the door Sammy watching from Fort Myers it's Reich Gulman cuts back inside break the tackle in the midfield and finally chase down inside the 25yard line max Redfield saved the touchdown but Goldman gets loose for his biggest run of the night giving a big play that theme kind of continues importing great effort here by GAO management point tamari Russell's got to be able to make that play he was right there and just kind of got his hands on it but didn't secure the tackle all the southern Kirk at that 33 yard run Gulman is closing in 100 yards got it again and not get the edge is running down there by Shumate for a loss defense you know it's been on the field a lot it's been tested and it's really surprised me to be honest with you to see this defense give up some plays in the trenches I mean they have coming in I think they had a great deal of confidence and how they matched up but there have been times where we've seen even in the second half with that offensive line is kind of asserted themselves and they're not in a hurry at all as they work that clock CJ fuller he's the freshman back in the game now you got three running backs go by CJ in this game Davidson fuller and of course precise and it plays for CJ spiller maybe one of the great Clemson players ever dad was thinking of CJ Spiller if he's that good we got to find a few more schemee every guy named CJ he's running back third and ten now bankers have been a little bit more efficient tonight on the third down five for 11 once you staff trying to get their attention here they sure are they Quonset five and now they'll spend a time out coaching staff spotted something on the other side Kirk had wanted Watson to notice it yeah they're actually trying to get there's certain coverage that they saw that they wanted him to go to that play and he was just a little bit confused so he called the timeout Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Pacific Life for life insurance annuities and investments choose Pacific Life the power to help you succeed or we go further so you can and gigolo experts around every corner to help you lead worried behind the folks having fun with the reindeer pumps and of course many folks in this state and other states in the Atlantic seaboard are seriously affected by the flooding the rain really doesn't have a lot to do with hurricane Joaquin it's just a combination of rivers running high and tide coming in this is Watson now is safe play in the rain he keeps it in tonight's game is just going to say you're up by 12 and it's not just about converting and getting a first down it's about trying to give yourself a chance that a field goal to go up by 15 points you go up by 15 points and now Notre Dame it's a two possession game they've got to again score the touchdown get a twopoint conversion and then score another touchdown so it makes a lot of sense with that boost when he did they're just running around the left side clearly this kicker likes it from the left hash you see if he can convert to give it in the fifteen point lead 35 yarder for the walk on break google who is four of five this season first attempt they got a hurry unless they want to spend the time out it's good a Michael Mac five yards though they did notice it on the sidelines a full sprint force we need in there to spend the timeout feels a lot better about the field Gold at this range is five yards basket ok wheels but it's going back to the playing day had it had he turned the Jets on there I think the crowd man hello if you enjoy the exercise on a rainy night that but judging from the expression Frank belly sausage o'clock expired before he got that time you down into the new Sunday night Strom on ABC Quantico critics are calling it instantly addictive begins the ten o'clock tomorrow night 9:00 in central on ABC the hukill will kick into the wind it really shouldn't be a big factor on a field goal in this range to be just about a 35 yarder from the build vent lead back up to 15 Seth Ryan is the holder in a wet night there's a good job to get it down and Hugo knocks it through so 1056 to play and the Tigers are back up 5:15 3 they rizona state yes thank you that Bruins team Kirk was so impressive in a hammering errors on the road last week but we knew was going to be tough in the pac12 to go through unscathed and they dropped the first time looking around in these first four or five weeks Luke and I were just talking there it's a break about think he said it was Oh seven it's going to be one of those years even with the loss you're not out of it no teams are going to lose heed the shortened hick very sure kick into the wind field it the Irish are going to have decent field position that is a 36 yard line as Doug Randolph big defensive lineman get his hands on the football well we knew that it was going to be a situation which quarterback which receivers could handle the wet conditions fuller were the draft it would have been a first sentiment field Robert but it would be touchdown and again it would be twopoint conversion he's been cleanses receivers they haven't been perfect with him analytical for sure handed and now with 1052 remaining in his football game it's not just about trying to put points on the board you know here is 15 points so you need to be able to execute put a quick points on the board and then you got to get the defense back out and try to get a stop if you're Notre Dame Princeton obviously trying to get it three now Kizer there's good protection steps green and it's nice to take off in the big fella loses the ball bouncing around the Irish have recovered it was Prosise right there a very fortunate half as Wilkins forced the quarterbacks fumble heathered Chris you guys are talking about conditions while Clemson defensive end Shaq Lawson just switched out shoes as you see the stumble going on guys he actually went from a molded cleat to a halfinch screwin doing everything in his power to get better footing better leverage on this very sloppy night thank you as reported earlier that lost and left to have a leak one of the three guys er has time books it off again and it's a wide open Creek Brown and the average should be getting to find some space in a secondary Brown runs through a couple tackles and finally out of bounds blanks forced him out but they're inside the 15 you're going to see a crisscross here from Notre Dame wide receivers in bull where 10 is going to get caught up in some traffic and there's Brown clearing underneath good job again you need time for these plays to develop but how about Chris Brown after the catch getting some blocks downfield by fuller and picks up huge jars again 33 eventually what Notre Dame needed trying to strike quickly here both sides came out of the backfield tiser looked that way now dance is free it's inside the ten cuts back inside the five it'll be second and a yard Irish knocking on the door again now you're starting to sense emergency from Kaiser you ever seen a guy that hasn't played a lot of football at this level in this kind of atmosphere have such composure in the pocket there's blank flanks has been kind of locked just been hobbled here in the second half of course he's had two ACL surgeries on the same knee over the last few years he works so hard to get back he's a very respected smart member of disciplines in defense he takes off the road watch him here Carlile get involved three right there that's the guy who right now blank he's down but he may hit a mastery win hand yeah and he's already kind of been like he's been struggling leaves chasing earlier on a touchdown by Prosise it looked like he was really laboring it'll really rotate a lot of guys in on this bunch of defense they asked their starters to play a lot of sound are they wearing down Oh site sits over on second and one keeper Kizer touchdown and the Irish are coming back he just said not only you need this for but you need to score in a hurry how about a minute 49 to put a touchdown up on the board and instead of going for two now they're going to go for seven or try to get it in and try to go for the extra point two for seven points now and wait to get the two pointer if they're if they get the football back this was cut up to an eight point margin if they can convert here but you're right for plays 64 yards a minute 49 they needed rounds catch with the big play in the drive and Kaiser a strong runner remember he's been the comeback kid against Virginia on the road and he said the guys you've been here before he keep these guys in it was just really impressed with what he's done not a great night but he's hung tough but he's given his team a chance to come back at his game Irish are down 21 3 and ever in the quarter but times are let him do a couple touchdown drives yeah and again I you know his numbers aren't going to blow you away when you pick up the box score tomorrow but what's going to impress you if you watch this game is how he's just trying to hung tough they've not been able to run the football they put him in some tough positions I just can't get over how he sits in the pocket how much time he has and how he didn't panic Scott the yard deep the Irish coverage team had him corral but our table staff breaks right now based at abound by the kicker that's a 45 yard line the slippery receiver also a dangerous returner in Clemson as nice field position as they protect now an eightpoint lead in the final nine minutes pear martini does a good job of getting down there he just can't come up with it the attack when I think a lot of the Notre Dame kickoff coverage team thought he was already down he picks up about another 25 or 30 yards and throws in a little skip farm at the end there Newsome is the punter and the kick of good job to get Scott Anna bound so now it's Watson at the 44 and all of a sudden it's a tight game and Gulman hammered hard spins forward and if you're the play callers Jeff Scott Tony Elliott what do you do now with your lead down eight all of a sudden I think you go right to number four and you put the ball into his hands and you say all right earlier in this game when we've had some success tip with him throwing the football and also the quarterback run game and I just think you this guy is like to take the Clemson coaches field he's one of the most talented quarterbacks in the country you definitely want him to be able to want to be able to make the decision but he's also working clock along with trying to pick up first downs yeah for once Clemson not playing an eye for speed really working the play clock down to seven Yaman second carry but nothing there against the Irish front was big Irish Isaac Rosedale and it's third and long one thing I think you have to be careful with still eight minutes to go is getting a little bit out of character you know you start to change your tempo and you start to change the mentality of this all the offense is used to cranking they're used to having that kind of gogogo mentality and with eight minutes to go I don't know is it's a little bit you're still time I don't think you need to really work the game clock that much comes in motion watching the hand slips the short catch maybe they've hit immediately utilizes Shumate knockdown leg it's a tight end in Clemson going to have to give up the football now yeah Shumate made a great read and it looks like it looks like Watson felt that leg was going to slip out and nobody's going to pick them up you can see at the top of the screen the entire time Elijah Shumate has been seeing that counter boot one too many times they scored a touchdown on this play earlier this time Shumate is right there as soon as he makes that catch he's fairly down before the fumble came out these dogs upon it and will fuller Irish top playmaker has been held largely in check tonight chance to make the play as a returner pull earth is less than bounce seems like that's been the instruction to the returners don't even try to feel get out of there look at the ground get out of the way the allstate Saturday Night Football plug provided shelter porridge a must in all the games the All State gets good sweep sticks the chance to 100,000 bucks put the VIP trip to the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game as well as prizes so this Notre Dame team Kurt's with the awful weather down 213 entering the final quarter has found a way to make a couple of chunk plays and they've got a chance now a potential gametying drive we knew they needed to have those tough plays and it's been the passing game opened up something for them and now now Brian Kelly could just execute his office with 641 to go here they still want to have some urgency to him Kaiser has played out of the backfield did you see the throws affect BJ goes in the linebacker makes a huge interception in our top decision from the young quarterback and when he goes back and looked at that he just never even saw CJ Prosise who from up here it's easy to see but in reality he's a check down Prosise will slide out over here and he's wide open but he ends up just forcing this football and I don't think he gave Woodson much of a chance of Center Goodson did he think that he thought he could make this play and he can show some pretty good closing speed but he'll go back and look at that and instead of forcing it he just wants to check that down to his running back CJ Prosise Justin one of those big strong linebackers he benches for 80 the tough customer against the run makes a big interception and now clemson gets the ball back and again just anted to Goleman's right ahead you know how clemson defensively most this game has been kind of pin in their ears and shooting gaps against Notre Dame when they've tried to run the ball right now Notre Dame and Brian Van Gorder they have got to take some chances against his running game our tables got the event Gorda they limped off a few plays ago but he's back in the game now he's at the bottom of the formation if they have wants to throw the ball here on second and 11 inside of six minutes gives it get two crates Watson makes the hips slam down two yards short of the marker it'll be third and two you know because they've been able to get Wayne Gelman going I now when he carries out a fake he had two or three defenders chasing him down this is when you really have something going there's two guys completely gone in fact he got tackled he got hammered and it opens up some room therefore for deshaun Watson to run the football the Shawn took a hard hit himself at the end of that play Dolman to the right of the quarterback on third down now motions out Watson running all the way but running right into traffic dropped for a loss the Irish were all over that keeper that time he loses a yard and it's fourth down a slow developing play he's waiting for his left guard 78 to pull around Macklin watch how slow it develops he's waiting and waiting and waiting Rochelle does a nice job of just kind of fighting the point of attack there's just nowhere to go you can see they're able to keep contain a wall Oh as well just nowhere to go for Watson Schmidt and Smith the two linebackers converging on the tackle so forth and three this would be pretty difficult field goal it's into the wind there's a crosswind he made it earlier from 35 at this per hukill is from 45 to make it an 11 point game hello booth and it hooks you missed it so the interception doesn't put his points to the Irish still down in only eight that's a it's a tough kick in for a kicker there you know 45 yards the wind is kind of swirling it's wet it would have in effect maybe put the game away but unable to convert it and as you said they have the turnover there they had a big opportunity there to maybe put this game out of reach but Notre Dame catches a break they get the ball back the Kaiser lays board their last two possessions in a minute 52 in a minute 48 when they have scored empty backfield Kaiser pressure drop Carlos Watkins joined my Christian Wilkins the freshman you have Watkins in there but look at the entire defensive front for Shaq Lawson to the bottom there nine he's also involved the true freshman Wilkins they had an entire group they're closing in on nowhere for him to try to pick up the bun lost nine yards second and long Kaiser flips it short Brown has Running Room and Chris Brown's loose ripped off but in the Clemson territory well how about the speed of Chris Brown on these crossing routes he's catching the footballs the exact same route he ran earlier picked up a little bit of a rub and now he's just leaving people behind him there's no way Kevin dhadkan catched him in the open field but how about Tankersley the corner who's with him he also gets left some serious wheels there by Brown Prosise in this block on this empty set if bring pressure Kaiser picks it up again flips it short and hunter makes the catch 2:35 another first down he was receivers going downfield that underneath game in their passing game is open because you've got some linebackers that are shooting gaps hooks in that time in Boulware both came and if you're not going to get home you're going to leave a vacancy underneath good job of finding it and then just dump dumping it down for that first down thirtyeight years ago Joe Montana came in here and injured you know fourthquarter comeback against Clemson the Shawn Kaiser crying through the same thing Robinson's in motion for has the catch of the Internet's a block and he's loose warming to the secondary down to the eleven was the last time you watched Notre Dame football with this kind of speed on the perimeter with Chris Brown and will pull or both I mean you talk about yards after the catch I'd love to look at that number in the second half alone tonight for Notre Dame 23 yards is fuller finally makes an impact than the Irish now do want to have to play 12 yards of a potential gametying touchdown they need the twopoint conversion of course LOD to the end zone broken up over there that was Tankersley knocking the ball out of Browns hands he's a quarterback often picked on because Alexander is so good but he makes the play there yeah he wants to be able to get this football thrown a little bit further in the corner that's what the fans from the Notre Dame fans are upset about look at that grab it on a Jersey yeah I mean he's supposed to go up there make us play where he's grabbing a jersey and pulling him down by the way he had Nick Swisher underneath all along those underneath routes are open even down deep in Sunset territory he flatout missed that interference call either looks left dumps it short gets made and taking it stop losing the ball Clemson's got it Chris Brown hands the ball was headed for the end zone for a potential gametying touchdown and it was not free and local items had to pick earlier make the recovery Kirk yeah it looked like cursed got his hand on the football and not to lose for instant Goodson gets on top of it we just said the underneath routes are open watch how open they are it just clears out to Greg Reed brown bear crowds been dangerous after the catch it's not that hit it's right there the left hand of one curse gets in there there's the initial hit then the left hand jars the ball loose and then the middle linebacker Vijay Goodson jumps right on top of it it is the fourth Notre Dame turnover all of them in the second half so they've been able to make some big plays but selfdestruction for Notre Dame and that's athat's a tough one after getting back close to potentially touchdown on a 2.2 Dyess Hill two timeouts remaining for Notre Dame Yanis top Domon you get the ball back and you know Brian Kelly knows it's tough with a wet ball but his reaction I've been to the fumble it's been one of those nights with selfdestructing but this game is far from over Clemson's probably a first down away from being able to Isis but Brian Kelly electing not to use the timeout that they lost when they didn't had to use the twopoint conversion to the timeout loins ten men on the field he decides to let the clock run here then they're going to try to get stops on second and third down with the timeouts to try to get the football back around midfield and Watson worked in the Plake lon you snaps it at four gives it to Coleman it all hurt for you do you worry about a fumble almost every time as the Irish make the stop and then do spend that second timeout with 119 to go and third down coming up for Watson Monday night on ESPN the Seahawks and the Lions 8:15 Eastern Time on ESPN streaming live on the watch ESPN app their Clemson got it think they run the football to force Notre Dame to use that last timeout the Irish are thinking stop them use the last timeout force the punt get the ball midfield maybe your own 45 with about a minute to go still time to do what they need to do on third and six the very safe play as Watson keeps it but does not get much run wallow the linebacker stopped him and now they'll spend at final timeout with a minute 13 Mont coming up yeah into the wind by the way and Kelly's been thinking the same thing that you and I are talking about he decided to let that first down play go called it on second time called the timeout on second and third down they're going to get the ball with a minute to go without any timeouts and the way they've been throwing the football they've got to feel pretty confident that they can execute if they can take care of the football they came to come down to a twopoint conversion Sweeney and Scott and Elliott electing to Paul safe plays keep it on the ground a rainy night into the wind and then trust their defense to try to protect this lead but Kaiser has been making plays that they just make a too many mistakes no doubt he's thrown now for 284 yards on a night Mindi teased all in his endzone fuller is set up at the 45 he'll have a plan it takes it at the 41 puller down to the 32 yard line and Kaiser and company set up perfectly a minute 5 no timeouts but a lot sort of drive they have when they were down at Virginia give this Notre Dame defense a lot of credit for hanging in there and doing what they've needed to do to get the ball back to Notre Dame and now if you're Club saying you're Brett Venables don't you think you got to be thinking to yourselves you know was that underneath crossing route it's been wide open we've been blitzing some linebackers leaving get lost a little bit coverage it's not just a long throw down field it's the underneath route that they've got I think being concerned about a starting field position for the Irish snap that one lost the ball just came out of his hand okay members no timeouts he's got to have some urgency here they work on his he doesn't have a ton of experience it is other than the Virginia game but he's got it cranked this is where you really got to have some intensity inside of 50 seconds they want six yards there Kizer steps up lips it's short incomplete out of Browns hands that actually is the best thing that could happen to Notre Dame because they've been caught that football that he's tackled in bounds and they don't fix very many yards up and a clock just keeps going and going Quentin doing a good job right now they've got eight guys in coverage and they're trying to keep silver game in bounds they want that clock to just keep going your play is to go 16 yards and keep up alive I sure could not take a sack you've got to be aware that he's going to throw it away if you feel pressure it brings some pressure fires far side lighting play catch made Carlile's got our first town in a red zone how bout that they bring that pressure it's right in his face and he knows if he takes the sack the game could be over and he stands in there he gets to time and he throws it now they're going to fire it to kill the clock 25 seconds to go Kelly decisive and actually he's quarterback sack Lockett here's the catch gets his hands underneath gets the legs involved whatever it takes to hold on to that football but I couldn't believe the way he just sat in that pocket and waited for Carlisle to break free didn't panic one thing to make the throw that under saying not to panic when you have a Notre Dame game on the road against the ACC year ago along third down conversion who were there for Florida State Kizer flips it nearside bros i break the tackle get down to the two o'clock stops with the first down a missed tackle there by Clemson they had him inbounds and short of the first down that were not able to pull him down how about the strength era pro side well loves it wasn't even set they were trying to clock the ball but the chains really weren't even set up yet so a flag comes in Clemson has 12 defenders on the field that's a problem yeah that's that's not good you're kind of torn against there's a coordinate a crook you trying to get your short yardage package down there from the yard line right illegal substitution defense half the distance for the goal fill first when you do if you dare run the ball with no timeouts rebus how short I don't think you can I think you've got to trust the quarterback he's had to football in his hands who's make good decisions but if all else fails he also has a big fight he can go for that goal line I try to use his legs for a touchdown he plays tackled in bounds is serious trouble though game's over if you're tackled in bounds Kizer Luke sir for the endzone touchdown Torii Hunter junior with seven seconds to play the Irish you're a coupe we can bruise in a way from overtime Chris you mentioned last year's Florida State Notre Dame here how about this how about this right here perfectly executed to open it up exactly the same situation and same side of the field at this time will fuller give him credit he looks into the quarterback instead of looking at the defensive back perfectly executed by Notre Dame ironic a year later the exact same corner of end zone with a game on the line they still need three more yards to four so see guys are whoa runs in the traffic and comes up at yard score so we're watchin and the Clemson defense rises up so hold off a furious Notre Dame rally interesting call by Brian Kelly relying on the feet knee leg of Kaiser this is all about the defensive line of Clemson launched Dodd and watch Larkins work here and then you have the safeties and linebackers come in and help out but a great job up front I mean Kevin Dodd 98 would not look at an extension there against the tide in wisher he just throws him back into the into the quarterback Boulware is involved you saw blanks get in there and of course you saw Kelly's disappointment Watson's relief the other decision by Kelly to go for two early in the fourth quarter they got that first touchdown will be questioned now the way things eventually worked out no doubt about that and now you go to the last second here with seven seconds left yet an unsportsmanlike penalty here on on Clemson so Notre Dame is going to be kicking from midfield for this onside kick and if they slippery field it's wet if you kick this and you somehow recover it at least it gives you a chance to either a Hail Mary or really long field goal cassadee hovers will be along in this video the Ford wrap up show right after the game have reactions to this one early in this quarter limbs enroll 1:21 they thought we could be could think about heading home early on a rainy night the Irish made him play right down to the end but just like the game we referenced a year ago in Tallahassee it looks like a Notre Dame perfect season is going to come to an end with a close call on the road in the tough environment insanity team let's see how this onside kick goes this is the freshman kicker Justin youn they practice this all the time trying to get that perfect hop and it does not get the Kenny girl hop and it's fielded by the Tigers we're going to take a knee with a hardearned twopoint victory in Death Valley their 12th straight home win that is a very relieved head coach he's promotional right now the big win for his program think about this in the last three years this Clemson program is now 36 and seven with wins over LSU Auburn Georgia Ohio State Oklahoma and Notre Dame he has taken its program to a whole different level and so what you saw where the call there was not just relief but if he is so different proud of his program on what they built here yeah forget the staffs plumbs it is out game bigtime Notre Dame mistakes crucial for second half turnovers where they play with a ton of heart and resilience on the road Kaiser who helped lead that comeback coming up one yard short on that su point conversion Kerry that's really what you need to take away from this game it's a huge win for Clemson early in the year at home against a good Notre Dame football team but Notre Dame with ties here at quarterback on the road in these conditions down big looking like they didn't have any any chance at all made for turnovers throughout gained over 100 yards how in the world is that football team going to have a chance to come back and have a shot at a twopoint conversion to getting it into overtime but they didn't so give give them credit they can build on this you know the Tigers have some some folks ahead Georgia Tech is up next here in this field they got hammered by the jackets a year ago but Tech is struggling Clemson Kirk with the loss ahead of them in the rankings Florida top each team's a chance to really jump up in the rankings and becoming a big part of the conversation for that potential playoff thought the Irish were the tough schedule not necessarily out of it with the two point loss on the road we saw how emotional Dabo Swinney was a moment ago he's now with header Christine so much devil congratulation so what does this kind of a win before your program makes us for no and it keeps us on track what we're trying to do and you know have a great season hey hats off to Notre Dame you know we had them down they thought about us what great teams do well coach man I'm just so proud of our team you know that's what it's all about and I ain't always perfect but when I saw them tonight resistant we give you scholarships we give you you know stipends and meals and a place to live we give you nice uniforms I can't give you good and I can't give you a hard hit tonight it was big while she's bring your own good and they brought some dancers from the water and a yoga class the last place thank you good lord in my dad who was with me and play frickin lasers play don't worry about our screwup plays in play win this down and you know just happy they never quit again great effort by Notre Dame so let me just tell you three please stay Tiger nation guys so we're here today there will be a dance to check you to tomorrow his dad was in the hot remember when I thought he might pull the whip out out out down on the field there well he's going to admit he in her locker he knows it wasn't perfect they've got a lot of things to correct but it was a Brazilian defense that had been burned a bunch I mean Notre Dame was moving up and down the field making big plays and they come very close they do force the four turnovers in the second half they didn't limit Prosise on the ground they got in the backfield a bunch character boy they were really tested a yard away from overtime but it was the first time remember how you and I were just kind of marveling and what they had accomplished you know for losing their entire defense from a year ago and how good they've looked up to this point where they got got vulnerable the passing game Tiger ended up throwing for over 300 yards tonight and you know that aspect is what Brent Venables is probably going to work the hardest on to get his team ready to continue to try to improve to the HP NC strong performance just enough for Clemson you know what when notre dame visits clemson so we happened twice at the last four decades it's going to come down to the finish Joe Montana just got it done the last time the Irish rear and DeSean Kaiser came very close to a comeback that would have joined that long list of Notre Dame largest a yard short if it's up they can build onto I think this team you've know it's a loss yeah I think you're exactly right this is going to be a whacky year in college football you have to do is look at last weekend and especially today look at some of the scores it's going to be one of those years where the committee is going to have to really do their homework it's not going to be as clean as it was even though there's some controversy last year Notre Dame's not out of this thing I mean if they can regroup and learn from this they're going to be just fine and for Clemson as well I mean once of the football team that they've got a quarterback they've got a defense that they could be proud of but they've got enough that they can learn from today and continue to try to grow and just keep as he said we're for know they're going to hand us the trophy tonight we're for no no no they now have to play eight more games in eight weeks they had the long time off before this game but it's going to be a grind and no weeks off for the Clemson Tigers as a head into the ACC schedule Florida State does come here early November team that's had their number in recent years another look at the stop for the Tiger defense on the two pointer get Dodd he kind of sets the point on the edge doesn't let Kaiser get outside and in the rest of that defensive line and the linebackers are there to clean it up but really give Kevin got a lot of credit for holding the point on the outside that defensive line when they had to turn it up tonight they did for the most part we will never know what would happen had that conversion meant to it this thing would have headed to overtime because Oh today would have got a whole lot of momentum of you and do it well the party on a rainy night in Death Valley is just getting started here as Clemson holds on 24:22 over the Fighting Irish hope you enjoy tonight's game it was produced by Bill bunnell directed by Derek's mably for Kurt Herbstreit Heather Cox and our entire crew which worked beautifully in these tough conditions tonight I'm Chris Fowler the four wrapup shows coming up right now Cassidy
