its own this one's always big a matchup that always means so much to both schools to both states in a rivalry rich in emotion than mythology legends are made in this gamble on one side woody only Charles Woodson had an unbelievable game again without you're judged at Michigan by what you do against Ohio State Rex Kern and Archie Griffin Desmond Howard pulling the Heisman and once again as so

their rivalry is we welcome you to hear me it's college football presented by best part and thank you today the outline ken championship bid to the wrongful even after their own to start the Wolverines have climbed back to the top of the conference now deadlocked with by God above everybody I brought Musburger nice to have along with this Kirk Herbstreit pass change guy about the set of gameday you know let's talk about Jim trusts I was a very tough loss last week he's had good luck against Michigan Illinois though cost him a chance to go to the BCS it appears what about his approach to the Michigan game did it change this week wha I think people wonder emotionally can they bounce back after being two games away from potentially having a chance to avenge last year's game against Florida I think he's good in front of his team on Sunday and said he'll always behind us it's Michigan week Ohio State with Jim Tressel the success that he has had the reason is he has made this game unique he's made it special they have a clock that counts down for 12 months these players realize what's at stake regardless what happened for the BCS regardless what happened against Illinois good game it's about this game in respecting this game health is the big issue with Michigan quarterback Chad Henning running back my car well we saw min warmup spring and as you're watching up here as well it looks great Chad hitting throw the football on it keep the key today I think they could get by play without line but without chat hitting they're in trouble he's the key but the leadership from Michael Hart it will be on display he has fired off the bottom line is both these guys have waited entire year for this game Turk here comes one of the grand inferences in all of sport kickoff is coming up folks but we'll check in with John Saunders of the game and this message and a word from our ABC stations introducing ESPN on ABC and it is the big one between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Michigan Wolverines Italian as a kid in Canada even look forward to this game the Big Ten championship up for grabs for the 22nd time in the 104 times these two teams have met but the story swirling around an arbor this week's riding coach Lloyd Carr the talk is that this will be his last game at home yeah a lot of speculation along those lines and he struggled against Ohio State and trestle so this is last opportunity potentially to go get him he's got a group of seniors that are led by Hart any Manningham that want to get it done the problem is Hart's been banged up he's had a bad angle they need him healthy running the football and they need any healthy to throw the ball the entire day he can't just go out there as Kirk was talking about they need him to get the ball in Manningham Manning him to play in the big way you know what you know Lloyd Carr this game should not determine whether or not he leaves or not I mean the guy's a good football coach the players love him good luck to coach Carr and whatever he does in the future a lot of talk about coaches in this game but it's the players I mean it's the football players that comes down to the players have to show up for Ohio State this is a defense it was dominating where'd they go I mean so the players on both sides of the field have to got to show up today regardless of who the coaches are and play their game through seniors on Michigan have never beaten Ohio State imagine that now it's just the start of a very long day of college football here at 3:30 check local listings for the game in your area including that one where the Jayhawks will look to remain unbeaten look forward to Missouri next week and then in primetime Oklahoma still with a shot at the national championship as they take on the highflying Texas Tech and the Red Raiders now the Ohio State Buckeyes coming into Michigan's territory trying to knock off the Wolverines kickoff is coming up this telecast available on ABC HD presented by DLP HDTV well a very very special coin to us today Kathy Schembechler the widow of the late Bo Schembechler is out with our referee John O'Neil a special coin today Bo's like ice on one side Woody Hayes on the other let's go there neck look he's holding a commemorative coin that we're going to use for today on the image of one side is coach Tim Bechtler the other side is coach a okay whichever team shows up next game is won the talks and will choose okay last thing you want to talk you take the ball Michigan was goes can't defend okay Lou once you turn your back this way wait turn your back this way so there we have a the Buckeyes elect to take the football I guess the Kirk when you come off a game in which you've had only three snaps in the fourth quarter you want the football back you and I looked at each other like I usually take the ball I thought it was about Manning defer yeah you know yeah well let's take a look at our rivalry notebook presented by Donna Karen gherkin debt only gets a little double cheeseburger might talk to the big back unit right now hundred and fourth time folks goes back to 1897 in debt Buckeyes and Jim Tressel have had great success lately against Lloyd Carr and the Wolverines and we shall see what we got here via what's the favorite because of probably the injury problems there you see Jim Tressel who who vowed that he would correct the problems against Michigan when he moved into the head coaching job down in Columbus he certainly has done just that and you'll be calling the plays Lloyd Carr on the other side much speculation that this might be his last Ohio State Michigan game we'll talk about that is he after he was welcome today book says Michigan Ohio state border you know Excel Lake parties down into the 30 mil rain rolls just like real I was out there for the three game on the field it started to come down with a snow mixed with the rain Thank You febre that's the way it's cooked the bid for this one a lot of red sprinkled throughout the stands in both eyes of course profitable as anything and folks here from the day of the big house on the one hunt the 5yard line and for small and years out for the 33 yard line and Kurt here comes Todd Beckman now how is he now three picks last week as well he's been a great first year at the starting quarterback for Ohio State but he had his worst game of the entire year last week against Illinois two three interceptions I think it very important for Jim Tressel to try to get his quarterbacks on track early doesn't mean a couple easy throws underneath Todd Beckman favorite throw of going downfield so I would be surprised here this opening drive to see him try to go vertical to get the Michigan secondary here a wide receiver Feeny Wells running back they're going to give us in deriving lined up in the backfield he eludes the defenders at throwing for a loss in Michigan's build that one out will Johnson and our starting lineup presented by best by post you're going to three units special color to the state of allowed the bra change introduce the Buckeye off at quarterback object making his first start against Michigan Wolverines will be real relaxed because we won't be able to air it out so believe me call finally Brian we're busy on the offensive line we got curve bottom and right at that I'm going to be off a little open up all the whole actors finding Chris being wail here comes Chris speedy every time I see LeBron against heard the NBA dollars was that big eat a bit of Buckeye hoops well he's the Buckeye at heart you can see by the way he said that a lot of emotion behind his conviction for the the Ohio State Buckeyes in his man beanie what else he needs to have a big game today for the Buckeyes have a chance to win on the road nice to have sky can and Michigan State here to pick first time ever so beckylyn looking no takes it down goes to the first down marker we got it not with his arm but with his feet actually picked up that first down mister disguising pressure their trend is to bring a blitz on third down but they get pressure with four and Todd Beckman recognizing his seam there get into it right away and gave himself enough of an opportunity to pick up a very valuable first out here early in this game I was out to the book on 46 these will begin bidding picked up a couple of extra yards after contact as he crosses midfield that is a with a linebacker make sure it's not well let's bring in a star Braylon Edward you introduce the Wolverine defense for us a defensive tackle number 57 as Haley leave the thing with 15,000 issue number two outside linebacker with some nasty low high Oh lanky arms we like to call star on cradle and number 14 set down corner Morgan straining grandmother course but the Cleveland brought down a fine here Taylor don't believe the defensive lineman worked at those in which on further had announced then we at linebacker and first down second effort again powerful run cradle where he's hanging on to be knee that time but he muscled his way for the first out there got a strong run pretty well saying earlier sweep it a lot of his yards had come in the second half in football games and he really focused on trying to start back trying to pick up some yards it's the momentum fast he's been banged up he's had to fight to a lot of injuries throughout this year his ankle his gums been bothering him but if Ohio State's going to win had one of his best games of the year Ramin started to fall and he slipped a little bit shy of the 40yard line where it'll be second down here for the Buckeyes just the opening drop if he just turned on your set Michigan and Ohio State Buckeyes won the toss and they elected to take the ball of his lloyd cars Wolverines Michigan's trying to ease up towards the line of scrimmage trying to take the way Ohio State's ability to run the football so far Ohio State big plays six run a lot of times those just like to go behind the coverage it will start the Chito with the Millers banner right on the center and there's going to be a quick pass short of a first down and that is Jamar Adams making the tackle that time number 22 if there's an improvement folks with this Wolverine team over the middle of the season that atrocious start it's Adams and Brandon tingle bring the other safety the 22 and 31 after we picked it up did not have an outstanding game against Wisconsin but then did and both our senior both are on track to graduate and Jamar Adams is a young man from Charlotte North Carolina and a good one so here we go now third down and four we're calling timeout it looked like Beckman put his hands up over his head and O'Neal gave him the whistle let's see here yes he did he got the timeout I guess you could see the hands get up on top of the helmet and timeout that's not a pleasant memory for Jim trussell draba thought about man wouldn't last week and the fourth he'd like to head back with a timeout the Buckeyes converted their first third down here at third and four coming up for beckoning to the raindrops it started to fall here on an other design goes deep heart line and the defender runs into him it was underthrown not catchable i believe they're going to rule Hut line thought he was interfering with bred ethic coverage while hi Oh stay for the same look in the previous plane before the timeout when they move BT Wells out all the way to get an empty set and try to get oneonone matchup Morgan Trent lined up against Brian Hartline and I think you're right the balls look to be untouchable and that's why there was not a pass interference call there's also not face guarding big college football where you have that in the NFL as a de compasso back and standing back as Greg Matthews the wide receiver I say we'll see if you can pin it Matthews hoping it goes the endzone which it doesn't come out in the 2005 well the Buckeyes drove down the field forced to call a timeout when it looked like they had what they wanted on that play couldn't convert as they went down field to Hart line and now Chad Henne separated right shoulder we had it in Champaign Illinois on a Saturday night he has tried but he can only play for a handful of plays against Wisconsin life but the question folks is not whether he's been stuck we see the question is whether or not he can finish that will be the big issue with our children my part injured ankle was held on costly feedback hay goes down field deep on the first throw in a game and no yellow on that side it was looking for many Hammond dangers with any deep threat in the country Donald Washington right there Kirk I love this by Mike the board the office the coordinator all this talk about it Chad Henne going to play with his shoulder the first play out he gets a oneonone matchup not on Washington against Mario Manningham who's the highest receiver right now a college football and good coverage that time by Washington's drivers fried with Manningham they open wide and now pull back to the second play of the game that might be able to give him an extra bodyguard Osen lead for part I still play Laurinaitis jumps him on the back and he rides it out to about the 25yard line so let's take a look now Kurt at this Michigan lineup and what we've got here is it well Jenny and Hart being in there is so important especially Chad Henne in the way he has grown this year as a leader outside it's about Mario Manningham really the entire group of wide receivers but Manningham eventually we'll try to get vertical and he did on the first play against the Buckeyes secondary notes for upfront there's been some inconsistency on the right side because of injuries but of course Jake long the anchor and one of the best ever put on an amazing blue on the offensive line gets burned folks left tackle is hard to come by any in the gun going to get incomplete bobbled by Manningham as he was try to control it it is three and out and keep close tabs on Chad Henne but he's first two throws a bit erratic for quarterback to his goal for standing Acuras you know what mate the buckeyes really happy in that last play was the quarterback draw there was going to be Williams okay that'd be right about that different approach this week because of that you're right fair catch signal at the 32 by hein and so heartline Fields the Mets go punt it'll be the Buckeyes second series coming up with the first quarter notes for this presentation of college football brought you by this by this holiday will help you put together perfect gifts the Nissan Titan proud presenter of the 2007 Heisman Trophy to cast your vote go to the vote.com Verizon Wireless and MasterCard there are some things money can't buy for everything else there's MasterCard senior day is always special Jake long in my heart out there with their parent prior to the start of today's game and it's always emotional Jake said he even probably tear up when he came out on the field for the head he's back but not first down stepping it off to risky short of the first down had Lisa the right tackle Kirk Barton he's one of the leaders of this buck I think absolutely Brennan obviously Ohio State coming off of that disappointing loss last week there who national title most likely gone Curt Barton said that he went into the team meeting room after that game and wrote on the whiteboard forget the ranking forget the bowl game the only thing that matters is Michigan now he used much more colorful language than I'm allowing on the air but he said he got the idea from the high school coach he said you know you're a leader of a team and you got a mission last week into this week he's still got a lot of great books yeah exactly I'll pay that motoring defense on this year has been very but there Shawn Creighton he's their leader he's come on strong as a line bag he freelances a little bit I guess like all great height backwards Curt yeah he goes in and he is always around the football leads came in shackles of course growing up in math no hyo's same hometown Kirk Barton so he is very excited to have an opportunity to get around he'll be up near the line of scrimmage quite a bit today to try to slow down vini well with the third third down of the day that's okay small picks it up third down completion and the chains move could read here by Todd Beckman third and short simple read out to the flag tied in goes to the sidelines and Ballard small comes to the inside and mazing is he's got inside leverage their zone play and the one thing that running the receiver has to be careful of is as soon as you make that catch you know the crisper and the outside linebacker is lowering the boom in a hurry that time smoke did a good job of catching the ball and in protecting himself and the football so while a the fullback those are as an ace packed and they move bt well as down bobby'll screen as they empty the backfield muckman tictac tumble but recovered by the Buckeyes always lose when Alex boom no I this is the look that I think a lot of people expect to see from Ohio State three and world wide receiver looks coming compulsion flick there it goes right through hock Beckman's hands ohio state fortunate outlets bone jumped on top of that football rebel jarring it loose I can end 15 for the Bucks with a multiple wide receiver look at Ohio State Wolverine's rush or doctor's flipdown gyppojim shaker is definitely slippery on that term they're going to have to check the link to their cleats and go over there to check in with the trainer's you see what they wanted to wear the challenge you have is a quarterback or any of the skill players is you the weight of your body and how you deal with that when you're dealing with a slick field Beckman right now really the same like a lot of players trying to get an adjustment to put the rein in this and the snow is starting to come down force the end of the warmup he players right now are really getting a feel for the field as they're playing this football game it's affected Ohio State offensive glass defense tomorrow atoms of the safety of center field on this third and 23 now anyone joins him back there they they put blade into a key piece look and another foot back at the 25 this time it is they running back be Nero looks like a totally different look in different seasons from a week ago when they went to Madison the reason the rivalry game they planted whole they're flying to the football studying their tape and watching last week you think it's a different team you knew the emotions of this game would bring out the best in the made the blow so far down they all the Buckeyes out here do a position punt nasty blow this is returnable to give the Wolverines up to work with from the 30 yard line here comes number 13 out to the 35 yard line the coverage team got downfield did a good job on that one Marcus Freeman the linebacker down there with the tackle you're watching ESPN on ABC pockets scarlet and gray it's the basil here at Agra food of the thousandplus on hand underfoot saw these two battles there we are first on a tent out for the Wolverines enchantment undersell to open game he has his familiar three wives down below and using Manningham on first down now let's take you back because they lost Appalachian steak here and then Oregon blew them out suddenly the Wolverines were Owen too and then they regroup my cart guaranteeing the win against Notre Dame and that started them on the way back they went eight in a row and without much of a hundred Mike Hart goes for the first down prepares mic heart that's the attitude looking looking fetus meeting eyes on my corn that's what Michigan is missed this year we know he's the correct one of the greatest fact that's not the greatest actor ever played at the University of Michigan the alltime leading rusher but what I've always appreciated about him is his leadership in the huddle in the way his team feeds off of his energy in the look in his eyes near midfield now with the first down any fourth game against the Bucks never beaten nor his home beautiful ball fake rolls that in through and complete made it perfectly clear Brenda along with my card and Jake long they came back for this game hey skip decided to go to the NFL they wanted to come back for their senior year to beat Ohio State and when you wait an entire year to get to this game sometimes the emotions are flying it as a quarterback when that happens the ball can fail on you right now Chad Henne just excelled out and let the game come to him by the time we Brosius the lead fullback with nine yards for Malcolm Jenkins when I hit best day in the hacklin Mike Hart had perhaps the the quote of the week leading up to this game a badly wants to beat the Bucks irritating I'd rather lose to Appalachian State Dental high state sums it up right there if for a player it's going to go down as one of the best of all time to be Owen curry against Ohio State the dimmest is so far in his career you can understand why he wants this game so badly today always cat hynny Jake wall and the other fingers first time I saw the photos in which outreach job third down now one quick snap throw first and ten and it is Adrian Arrington we see the a different office which had hit me in there now not only the team's first ever woman came got woke up it filled this car look at number 20 pound he's really had to be restrained and they're back out there ready to go again here comes hard so they're playing an uptempo game now and they've got their veterans out there they're not sending in a lot of situation substitutions nobody's coming on the field Kenny and the Wolverines are going without a huddle now two things this does Brett is it creates tempo and it get the defense on their heels second down and four great protection using person but loaded the last time he was in Tibet Chris Maclaurin on that role that here he comes again without a hug sometimes when a quarterback and often can find a rhythm the middle huddle create that rhythm by day is up to the line a trivet quickly and as I said the defenses are back on their heels losing their aggressiveness been posting pinyin this is a funnylooking Drive led by hynny and heart I think we know why my cart said last week game again confronted he wants this game and you can see the parallax ability that he has and getting to that second level he has great pranked in his legs that he runs went through our castle they are not substituting employers they're stickin with the eleven that time court would be a little bit lost yardage back on the 15yard line Anderson Russell fine safety for the Buckeyes up to make that blow there he is number 21 Russell came in to close the door on the play then Marcus Freeman who he's not called his name a tag traded at Michigan all pencil on Brandon miner in at running back number four press coverage by the box he is back for the first time back of the 20yard line Golson Vernon Golson their best defensive lineman with the sack with Steve shilling the right tackle who's bounced back from right guard the right tackle gets a little bit of appeal to the quickness of burning goals that in fact he holds him until number 54 Ohio State uses his speed to the outside to come up with a big factor this Ohio State defense so the defensive coaches of Ohio State show their hand they kept Golson away from Jake long on that play of lined him up on the other side now they move him back he's on the right side defensive and now it will be Jake Long's turn ovaries were concerned about where Coulson would line up they did not have a read on it they thought it was about fifty fifty guineas from the gun complete to the tight end against Butler who was out wide that time and Marcus Freeman so the rally that looks so promising suddenly stalls in the face of that Buckeye D and let's credit Anderson Russell Vernon gulstan did coming up with the sack and that play didn't gain much and Lloyd Carr will go for an opening field goal just to get on the board here we can see apana the senior from Farmington Michigan we'll see what he could do 33 or 210 it's good this kid strikes mercy renumber at the brick house we are back Laurel will field this kickoff the end zone O'Neill is the lead name there number three and a terrific return of from out of the end zone to the 27 yard line Jim Tressel's Hannah come in series now to evaluate Michigan and how they're adjusting to his formations has had a lot of success early in games attack the last set in the opening drive they've gone right down the field and put points up on the board and Michigan has slowed it down here was still an adjustment he makes here Cavatina michka defense for chunk craig laflamme's very well and the Jamar Adams back at safety spot along with England the quarters have not been really tested I've never gotten worn as a freshman but his chimp Russell says but he's had 11 games now as a freshman he thought the part of your spring we can see in tightness that corner of x5 they're going to throw against it they're going to go for roll 50 there's interference time they managed through risky against Donovan Warren and they got pass interference 15 yards and a first down Michigan getting a run they walked up the safety Adams Ohio State saw it except to the water ferret slide number 6 and the deepest 15 yards to the previous five automatic first down hot victim saw the same thing Breathitt you just talking about opportunity to have your best wide receiver against a true freshman and even a warrants going to be a great player clearly grab the hole the jersey of revista van a good job of recognizing the coverage that he watched and checking the play at that time by Todd Beckman we've gone out to the 42 yard line perfection Phoebe oh by the yard and then he was driven back by Brandon Brandon the sophomore from Detroit and was not a woman read down on the way also is that him yes it is Brandon Graham was also is also shaken up we will take a break and then we'll come back with Michigan leaving Ohio State by a field goal we're walking back to Michigan Stadium second down coming up for Todd Beckman and I love in the start of their opening drive Kurt okay's offense having difficulty solving the Wolverine defense so far I think we're going to have to throw the football it has success to open up the line again 80 the first half of it is no sort of of midfield but you think that Beckman basically as they are about well first of all you're from Montana are you dressed in short this is no mere weather powered up here detective myself III do I think what I'm saying from Michigan is their safety for getting up into the line of scrimmage they wanted a gate beanie wolves ability to run and be physical I think Ohio State has to recognize that try to spread this Michigan defense out the way we've seen teams do and they're gonna have to throw the football they're talented Hooper and savings mostly the busy right here third down and four mission spec in the past Adelaide blitz fumble by the quarterback that's why they went after it Beckman dies back for the ball peckmon fill back on top of the football the third time we've seen the conditions on the field which includes Affleck football effect on Beckman this is kind of a virus to the Jim Tressel formula of a computer that he has about protecting the football on the road and not doing things that were yourself destructed Beckman really struggling right now so we've come to the end of the first quarter an ESPN college football presented by bets five I will return after this message and a word from our ABC stations after one quarter in Ann Arbor Michigan leads archrival Ohio State by a field goal and the Wolverines are about to get the ball back again to set the second boy with Trapasso punting Matthews back deep for the Wolverines as he's going to let this one bounce picks that up on the 12 yard line after the first Gunnar led by but he's shorter that's money in death you know so far Kirk the weather has affected the Buckeyes more than the wool frankly so what's going on in the Ohio State sidelines well Brent he really hit well on your monsters but the drizzle is coming down down here it really is affecting the Buckeyes I asked Benny Wells earlier I said what's it like out there and he said very slippery you saw Todd Beckman mishandle that last ball and he came over to the sidelines and got a glove for his throwing hand I don't know how often or how used to it he is using a glove but it looks like got from here on out he's going to go with a glove on his hands well Chad Henne has been playing with a Pyrrhic luckily if he hands it it was running back that time and soon for a loss of yard there you see Kenny has had his gloves on all again Kirk at least just made a great point how much experience is Todd Beckman have with it because we've seen Chad Henne in his career this is 46 career start I've seen Chad Henne deal with sad condition to go to clubs before I don't know about Todd Beckman you know there's another thing at play here I think everybody expected the Buckeyes to be given a lot of pressure on that separated children I don't remember much prefer the burning coal that's brighter and open on that one side the only time anybody laid a hand back short rocks now almost intercepted there's the ball that slipped on incur that you talked about in the first quarter Manny M the target and it took us at that that's affected whether it's the conditions or possibly the gothis is all blitz this surprises them because you have burning ghosts and dropping and it makes it very easy for Malcolm Jenkins to almost come up with an interception ghosting usually is pressuring he didn't expect to see burning ghosts in there God therefore the surprise he picked the ball high and again Malcolm Jenkins close to an interception Mike deboard said they've got more bullets as than any team they play they come from every angle and that fire blitz they call it time after time and it's hard to get a handle on it and will quick defensive elegy to me drops off like those things was there's anything out from the guy packed for the second time back on the 10yard line you would have thought that time that he would have fired it out of there he had an awful lot it is closing in on him here but instant rapport upfront for Ohio State next alarm blaring or 72 fighting through the Michigan offensive line and even a freshman Cameron Heyward coming to the inside but the left sides and springs to Michigan's offensive line that time allowing a sack with Dexter Larimore getting in now as there's a little market ever spoken by Laurinaitis Larimore gifted in 1333 and a half nesco look I should have her position fielded that Nick purify our line and he's across the 45 to the 34yard arm so we will take a break Buckeyes have an excellent opportunity when we come back they'll work with a short field here so the Buckeyes will start to drive at the Wolverines 44 yard line trailing it by a field goal three wide receivers with the wide beam Ewell's get the handoff picks up about the yard and we will send you to New York hi there Matt Winer here in New York and let's know what's happening around the country throughout the game in this Taco Bell update Illinois basking in the globe their win over the Buckeyes last week and they've gotten to work quickly against Northwestern Rashard Mendenhall and scored juice Williams has scored the Illini up with the sweet soup tomahawk on the lodges early leaving a campus state 700 very next year plays Kansas Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas with a second down and nine five eight five Declan rented glove on his left hand from head underneath to Jake Ballard keeps saying they're going to have to throw this football today against the Michigan defense to have any chance of having success toboggan their quarterback Claude Beckman up to this point has not been able to set away and he's uncomfortable with the conditions the ball can flick it's been on the ground and Brad doing it a quarterback who's been outstanding all year coming off his work performance last week we wonder where his mindset is and how quickly he can regain his composure and confidence to apply here's number six got that one mine matches in the Engelmann haven't picked up the first down the sophomore was able to a mile that was a big hit for Megan coming up I was surprised to see hard line in fact he's going to check out the game how's the pride to see him get up because great throw his time by Beckman but Engelbert lowers the pole on brian hartline right after he made the catch to the doctors quickly to check him out to see if he's going to be ok hold the headtohead shot there that part might cook biscuits matched against Warren brain has given him a little more of a cushion that he did earlier vikraanta looks the other way short of the first down marlyne pushed out of bounds and let's take a look at that Pacific Life game summary you made the point Dirk that the production per minute doesn't match for the Buckeyes what you and I were looking at the total yards look how many yards Ohio State has they've 38 yards and yet at the time of possession I think that's the first time I've ever seen a team that has 11 and a half minutes of possessing the football and 238 yards of total offense I wouldn't move the ball on this guy any of my game collection where he goes for the first and 10 for the bus I think this is what Jim Tressel going to try to do this the adjustment that he will make throughout this game after saving Michigan committed to stopping the run a couple throw and after you hit a couple of fastened downfield it slows the safeties down it slows the second there ain't even the linebackers down and then you can go back to your bread and butter of running beanie well if it's going to start withdrawing the football first and foremost with Todd vestments they slot but line off the veterans left morals outside him they got a little Biscay and then they run baby the risky 10 5 yard line first and goal coming up for Ohio State Michigan again bringing up list and a good job see Prairie come throughout both picks up a block right there on Chris Graham who was about to come down and make the playoff greenie well 70 water Aires coming around and threw the key premise corner on the pole Chris slam who has lined up to the outside with closing down on the line of scrimmage right for BT Wells the big plus dead time by rearing Sampson Bakker checks in beanie is out they're going to spread the field inside the 10 yard line they go for wide run a quarterback draw shades of John Elway yeah Beckman doesn't get it it was not like oh that's better like Craig planted all set up it's very unusual to think about Ohio State offense inside a five yard line and for wide receiver look and if he said but that's just trying to simply get the linebackers from the defensive legs away from that box area and they have enough confidence in Beckman to run the football and he picked up a player Daniel on that first down so be nice back on the field what barges into the end zone behind the left thigh deep wearing Alex Boone center gym core dull and meaty will with the Buckeyes ahead today for the first time Jim Tressel a nice job there with a play calling mixing run along with the path I think you've got Michigan defensa back on their heels lost a bit of their aggressiveness nice blockly bombs by Bailey Mabini wells but lowering the bull man time on a big safety Engelmann right at the goal line to get into the end zone tomorrow to hold it and Praetorius where they do he s the corner in the books or you may get 7th grade so Ohio State now lease it and it'll be Michigan sperm ever they're coming off an ugly throughout this presentation of college football brought you by this by this holiday will help you put together perfect gifts Pontiac the official performance machines of the NCAA a slack ask about it at work and Garmin give a Garmin GPS this holiday season our idols they spend a long time hitting themselves up been undressing don't they folks they have a few adult beverages will fall the way Aaron country has the ball on the tee to kick it off here oh yes this ain't even Halloween there was a minor back deep for the Wolverines trying to get field position with your toe you downed it'll come out on the 20yard line and let us check in on that liner in New York Matt what do you got cooking hi Brent thank you very much the Sports Center minutes powered by Vizio injured star Colt Brennan was limited to just two sets but Hawaii stayed unbeaten with Dan Kelly's 45yard field goal against Nevada late Brendan's expected to play against Boise State next week Oregon has lost its eyes intended a quarterback for the season turns out Dennis Dixon had 22 ACL two weeks ago against Arizona State three injured in on Thursday night the terrible loss prefers Pilate and a duck salad you can make you see on Oregon State goggle Jessica on the way to the Rose Bowl my part looks the first tackle and battles for one of your local years written down and young Cameron Heyward was the defensive and last series for Michigan not the greatest at it now that Ohio State answer to come back to take the lead Michigan of course goes back to the seniors and the leadership not only the passion wanting to win but now it's about execution in leadership quick snap the 24 yard line last couple series Ohio State upfront starting to take control the line of scrimmage against this Michigan offensive line we've seen them penetrate and get pressure on hit e we've also seen any last few plays being able to bring out that zone play and get the penetration to be able to slow down my heart before he built up momentum here's a third and six Aires is in motion any changes it up repeat the first comment the still bring us $1 good diving resection first and 10 Wolverines tenyard game you want to see why my card is locked by players watching it to toss in the Bliss coming check wah boom right on it backed by my cards in my card want to let him know about it and there's the arm strength of Chad hey from one hash all the way to the sideline to pick up the first down the Manningham what a clock that time by Mike Wow about you could see that part was talking about it with the tide in Carson Butler they came off the field take a break one more look at mighty mites fierce block one way to take care of safety good back at Michigan Stadium with Chris Berg Lisa Salters I'm Brent Musburger 73 Buckeyes lead the Wolverines and we've got eight and a half minutes left here in the first half first in Jen coming up for Chad Henne in the Michigan offense Mandy Dempster with a bottle you screen might want them it's a long money back again changing up if that defense in one part zone Galati to the left and nothing doing and there's a flying holiness the call it's not a Washington comes up to make the play for Ohio State so John away at each other holding number 85 on the offense 10yard penalty the previous repai first time one of the things Britt did Michigan wants to do is the zone play but Ohio state recognizes it they're going to slant their defense this way to try to string out the zone play that Mike Hart runs so well to the field Ohio there's the hole right there by Butler look how many white jerseys are running to the football to slow down my cart on that zone play that's been so effective the last couple years here for Michigan first entwine Washington and Malcolm Jenkins now they put Arrington the slot away from Jenkins and bring Manningham down on number two one I draw nothing doing but I were ready for number twenty had done Marcus Freeman is they're both the Aflac trivia questions I'm Kirk so here we go listen up good buddy here we go we've been good on these now let's do an arrow we're in Oh Joe Paterno's it is 58 season as head coach assistant Lloyd Carr is second is 28 season here Vic who is third in the Big Ten do you give that oh give me give me a little bit of time guys okay times up no I'm good helpful just avoided or drug buyers in completing the too far behind with Manning we get a first guess real quick good can throw it out there sure her parents at Iowa Iowa is mr. Hope Street first guest third down and 20 a lot of changes here in the last few years in the big tent the health energy indeed where's the third to function now after that one pharmacy looking drive which ended in a field goal the Ohio State defense is sort of taken charge of his Wolverine office getting pressure to the right side again and force the turret away Steve shillings got his hands full down there Goldman was applying pressure again what I'm saying Brent is the defensive pressure being established up and it's the defense that last week could change their lives and dad the animal but the pressure is there the confidence right now is soaring for the front court they're getting pressure without always having the blip and this the deepest was on in heels a week ago when they played Ruth Williams in that zone read attack of the Fighting Illini today they're hitting their ears back yeah dollar was and there were bills in that time and the forcing of everines to punt small has driven back inside his own 30 cut the meals down just short of the 40yard line of the Buckeyes so it 73 Ohio State in you're watching ESPN on ABC well I can't wait to see who the nine are ranked higher than mr. bicha the good guy ever watched in college football if a first down and ten there'd be again slashing right side flip that first man all right let's go to the Aflac want to anybody else to this guy we're hit break there we're going for the conference you like who else Joe tiller Hitler has holiday were there so you know you guess Kirk Ferentz that was my first kid yeah you're right on my not only that folks Joe tillers for it so we're going to get bonus points okay how did your job take it down stuffed with the lines range that time and now it will be third down coming up in 306 here today very large people over Cincinnati Reds shortstop and Michigan alive and it does do the course over there good morning and the plan bit rain continues to come down would expect a lie so look here we've got it I've enjoyed the mark congenita ii definitely first consent for the Buckeyes Abby Lee wells came into this football game determined to start the game fast Brent he's had so many of his yards in the second half this gives you an indication to his determination today lead electron that second effort right there just got him across the line to pick up the first down for Ohio State BT Wells running tough today for the Scarlet gray first out Peck was going to put it up incomplete how whether to throw the football anchor one thing we're seeing for sure at this point Beckman even though he had a pretty impressive Drive the last time Ohio State had the ball between the two quarterbacks and we've seen him both struggle he seems to be struggling the most with the grip of the football except Decker than one buck I've been known over the North Pacific equipment they were last go on to his baby tiger down indent I was making a gun and photography knee underneath waived off in complete this was brought on top of that John O'Neil again is our referee Brian Neil the Empire was right there the Ohio State Michigan game people taken are familiar with the rivalry game you saw jumping on the field I wanted to get after each other before the game this is one of the hardest hitting games you ever play and when you're involved in it but it's typically a hardhitting game but it's not nasty because you don't see a lot of the cheap shots involved when you see some of the rivalries a little tight shot at Sarah Palin he's will play down branch for the organization he's played pretty well for that was going to have to take off look what's doing he made the most out of that play there was pressure coming from Jamison so Tim Jamison number 90 applause of heat Jim Tressel after what not Beckman whispered a week ago with the poor decision we felt pressure from the Illini he for three passes that were intercepted pigeon truffle you'll take that scramble for a short game and it set up a fund weather like this curve we could have a block but before this day is over Greg Matthews this is the kind of day it's slipping and sliding snaps not good with you the pass was a very good partner ditches runoff Matthews with a fair catch signal comes up after 20 yard on well the race for the chase concludes tomorrow in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series for 400 at homesteadmiami ABC with a beer at 3:00 tomorrow down homestead where to be the coronation of Jimmie Johnson he has taken a stranglehold on the chase with four consecutive wins you beyond the polls of our own is buddy and teammate Jeff Gordon 86 epochs don't tell me different dad it's the last week this is Imogen 13 more weeks that start up again that could be crying or it isn't they did it the longest Asian girl well good luck with that have a safe trip down yeah we tuned in good we'll look forward to talk together there's my drivers don't impose any we want to pro football without you I'm a every week night there with you I'm still finding after the travel to weaken my part emotional self around great great initiative here we've been to Columbus obviously quite a bit the fans were Mariah and bushytailed say the least the students had coming up with some fun oneliners but nobody told you didn't know no not at all let's go second down and eight mrs. Hartmann back in motion is Manning him short of the first down and man he plays was in law in motion he decided to come back for this game everybody knew all week if you know my card you knew how important this game is the heavy he's been out there letting his emotions be known by Ohio State for more importantly in his own huddle before this game is settled my car much like ointment a year ago we'll be right in the middle of this trying to help her Wolverines believe they can win this game it's so important in this rivalry Wolverines wrong as to its excellent first down has the pepper this they've been stymied by this idea yeah and there was keep coming in again that time and that is Vernon Golson he's having an all big 10 kind of day right here they can't handle him hit speed off of the edge this entire year has been difficult for most offensive lineman to deal with but right now Steve Schilling is just struggling with the same rule over and over it's just a third down passing situation Ohio State bringing four it's a speed rush and at first step of Bern Golson who's getting in there by the way interesting it's always talked about Ohio players playing in Michigan bring Golson from Detroit Michigan flank Ohio State the Wolverines playing again and this one's a few over hotline is small head inside the pen and down Rokon mexico the junior putter from 23rd ohio nails a 68 yarder they will send into the orchid here's Matt Mike rental Eisen Wireless upstate from Manhattan Kansas Missouri enough position to move up in the BCS standing this is the freshman Jeremy Maclin who just said a new full division subdivision ncdouble a record for allpurpose yards by a freshman he scored twice in his first preconscious today and estate is just answered his $0.14 Tigers on top Tim Tebow's just that a record we'll say about that when we come here it's first time in 10 inside the 5yard line and mr. love bangs for a couple review give the end of the game will select a Charolais player of the game for beat Steven Chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution to each universities generals scholarship on the idea that fun incidentally on George Hill stats manjit so that was convert long for some time too one thing we know about this rivalry is field position is a big part of this game you know I have seen Russell come into this game of course weather conditions you know changes everything and really open it up couple years that you know you spread the field and put four guys who started throwing it but but you can't do it not with the conditions and whatnot with a quarterback who's still trying to get settled in but one thing I've seen is this football team talking about the University of Michigan they need something to spark them that part alone kind of got the crowd back into the game they need something from their defense to create a spark to give this crowd and give and some hope they can get back for the day also the usual 8 o'clock Wilson I get for the tight end attire where's the bull bag let's get over to what the way Mike Hart what I put my card on decided to step on those might be they have her here how in the 264 our goal set of courses involve a lot of folks he's out of Detroit in seven a fine day now second out coming up here for Tuchman looking from behind Beatty and going to pull back he could real conservative and that was well read by the Wolverines that dime Graham Chris Graham's a senior linebacker from Indianapolis number 37 doing a fine job and Becky's going over to talk to his coach about that series so coming up got a big play for the Buckeyes third and things for Ohio State eight over all the teams were waiting to be able to call to play Michigan may able to make an adjustment put their nickel package in against a passing formation from Ohio State when a girl or animal passing formation and holding is called by the Empire and we'll give the Wolverines excellent field position here late in the first half Jim quarrel with center locking up Oh obviously they're at Ferris Taylor bringing him down the watering decline the penalty and with two timeouts remaining should get the ball during least right around midfield with a couple timeouts and still over two minutes to go on that half a day for peso he junior will be back in the Buckeye endzone punting it out ajju can you stand close to me second hot nap till the bit field coming up an example of one halftime report John Wright James ducks Louie we'll have all the highlights including BCS number five Missouri taking on Kansas State 1410 the last score we got look at how the big 12 benefits from Oregon's lost at Arizona on Thursday night speaking of that loss but that was the tenth time that unranked team is peaking the top five team this season that is a record last week with Illinois just down a highway state that was number nine Arizona beating Oregon number ten at McMahon today what the year it has been an outpost intent for hey the Wolverines it's the cut to naming him had it slip away should have that Mario Manningham to go to man to this Michigan offense any this time steps into the TRO puts a lot of velocity behind it and I think Manningham peaked up just at the last second looking at the coverage in feeling Anderson Russell tried to make a cut maybe before he was ready because Mario Manningham makes that play every single time he's off to the left along with Matthews Harrington comes down toward the bottom of your screen Metzger deserves a Heckman a fifth to the field position right there though line holes sorted the first down as Matthews pushed out of bounds by dr. Washington one thing we've seen from Chad Henne I knew and I've talked about this on the air and off the air his gutsy performances against Illinois in the road to lead his team back to a victory he planting a few weeks back clearly in pain grimacing play after play leading them back to a victory nobody better you'd want right now quarterbacking this football team with Chad Henne what he had shown this year is for Athena leader bolston is backing off in the past coverage he lined up on the right side of the offensive line it seems standing up Rock bobbled and almost intercepted Manningham can't get the handle again and that is a huge drop two in a row for Mario Manningham and I know the balls thrown behind him a bit but the ball is catchable Mario Manningham make that play nine times out of ten the best thing you can do if you're Chad Henne right now after two blatant drops from your star receiver and put your arm around him and go talk to him and try to get his confidence up let's go with two minutes still remaining here in the first half arena now it only took about 40 seconds to change one eye into the endzone it'll come out of the 20yard line now the puck eyes still have two timeouts to work with there and 156 they're up in 73 just came home a turn on to set we've had pretty miserable weather throughout the first half Rangers continue its approach that don't you tell me what her style what a clock you muttering is what I heard that girl we creep don't you want you to that we in pants right Vaughn Cantore call you this down yeah yeah we're the last eight gets aggressive here like a few timeouts if they decide the first half clock and it's going to keep beaming on the clown as his 19th carry of the game here in the first half he's picked up 60 yards Beckman has been able to throw for only 35 yards Kenny is gone for only 44 yards Hart has run for 42 yo it's a very good chef the date on some of the individual low scoring game boys always so far coming down inside a minute and half suck it down looks like he thought the park for the first you said by beneath it looks like he's pretty content to take the 7/3 on into the Las Vegas the clock stops here with a ton for another tub run by beanie wells it's been kind of a story for Jim Tressel when they've had success they've had to rely on him because the clock stops he still has his tea timeouts see if he decided to take a chance to throw the football be unlike him with a minute to go in the clock moving you know what Robin it was the best thing he saw when he looked at the Ohio State take it it was up first miss play initial perfectly in a robe in play fake five Declan complete for another first in tenon that stops the clock and Rob its key is the receiver that I'm working against Donovan Warren very surprised to Ron English the defensive coordinator would decide to lead from risky oneonone with the freshman Warren out alone in the flat isolated oneonone without any help from behind because of that Warren had to get on the bed push an Ohio State grows underneath that cushion for the 870 second in credit and that was a terrific play by Jameson he came hard blew up the protection that time got him behind the quarterback we're just inside of 30 seconds left and the Buckeyes are going to decide what to do with the 36 well a sellout but a very wet sellout crowd here in Ann Arbor today and Ohio State leading Michigan seven three only nine seconds left in there Kirk what do you think that the best way to have about 25 yards away and Ronnie was trying to turn up the heat and Jim Tressel about 25 yards away from a field goal attempt with their kicker looks like they're going to keep going downhill there's only flag intercepted down that far star riders Engelmann and out of bounds and this may really backfire on the Buckeyes if that was a holding flag The Wolverine peddling guitar with 21 seconds the one thing they couldn't do is give the Wolverines an opportunity here I think you and I are both surprised and a lot of fans probably very surprised to see usually a conservative Jim Tressel with a seventothree lien taking a chance here to try to get down field with a quarterback who has not been able to get into rhythm give Michigan credit for getting the pressure again on Beckman in fact menya throws the football up and the safety and Engelmann comes over to make the play investing the pucks of got going here is the fact that the Wolverines have exhausted their timeouts alright comes your first and ten deep draught hitting incomplete going back toward Manningham and Malcolm Jenkins not somebody you want to be pickin on in any kind of a condition not come check is perhaps finest shutdown or I want to say that he certainly is one of the finest shutdown point I haven't seen them all this year but he's as good as we've seen Kurt but he's a junior has another year of eligibility he'll have to make a decision on his future after the season what makes him so valuable is he also played safety the Ohio State defense in their nickel package suckin down it now for any one fake come back blows it away incomplete Russell Sam no nobody over there let's have the flag there was nobody over there that's intentional grounding nobody over there and he's inside the any state writer had to popular was no question about that Larry grant comes back on the field and uh that's about as animated as your choice with an official I don't have to tell you you're not going to see much more than that Michigan still bring me to great point throughout a timeout that got at least get to the 23 for get out of bound to give them a kicker a chance I'm going to get it over there steps up they got to get down they've got to get down and get up and fight it out of bounds they finally get it stopped four seconds left and here comes the long field goal attempt is the pin an area that's been an acutely feel for Michigan especially early in the year is that the luncheon state they had maneuvered down and got it blind to being that I've been in the 48yard Europe we don't get it his long in the years 42 right on the money if it's long enough no good no good it comes up short Jim Tressel fired up he fired up because of his defense stepping up after that intersection by his quarterback exactly and he goes in with a seventh really let's go delicious office I said well close your defenses flames playing well today but I learn very well often seems to be strong you gotta do well I think both offenses are struggling a little bit how much do you think the weather is factors well I think it is a factor there's no question about that it's so wet rain as they say so what adjustments do you think you're going to make second we got to catch the ball a little bit better we got to protect a little bit better got to run a little bit better alright thanks good luck now yes indeed Owain coach live in 50 bucks out of the New York Stewart John Craig and the Flutie man mcevil don't want to have done before they are waving John Barry the next one avoid car does decide to retire I'm going to miss all the fabric on the sideline I think we will do the halftime wet rain is what Lloyd called it as a quarterback obviously you'd like to see Beckman wearing glove as you go to the glove because he he's having trouble handling the ball he's put on the ground three or four times and from the interception getting hit really can't let it fly it just looks like the little games to where you just not have a chance to get the ball there's been a lot of conservative nature in there but if you're not used to play with a glove Doug you know it's a different it's a different adjustment I thought I know the gloves are tacky if you're not going to like sheeting penedès wearing them and he's handling the ball just fine his arm doesn't look as strong as he usually has there yeah not quite as strong but he's handled well like a little kid again watching a Big Ten game Ohio State Michigan you know it's one of those games you know 7 to 3 you are a little key spread offenses I'm tell about a long run coming up on the capital on halftime report we'll take a look at scores and highlights other words important games for Missouri and from Georgia and Florida as well cold November rain who keeps getting to the voter poll in Michigan Big Apple has done three times late Wolverine just 77 totally are welcome back Chris battle T Corsa with Desmond Howard the largest cure today they played it produced it not my cards introduction I'm senior day a punt by Zoltan fresco this is oldschool big fence or an absolutism said he went to allow states within its football game up front up both sides of the ball now Bob Ohio State I get the I formation and BB Wells and the offensive line take over if I'm Michigan I better get my eightman front defense ready because the I'm is going to test their man who had run right now because neither quarterback or receivers or handlers whether very well so you're right about that watching shagging him course he's out there playing but he doesn't have the zip on the body we normally see from said so I think in the second half what they're going to try to do is to get some crossing route to the skill position players they can get the ball in their hands quick and then make a move make a play and get upfield for that Buckeyes defense is wide open in the middle but how I let me have to block better and he hasn't thrown that much in practice you have to wonder if but that they're not calling a lot of passes in first hand are they just like at a from an opera coming up after these messages and word from your ABC station you're watching ESPN's rivalry week presented by Remington we've walked me back the ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Best Buy Beckman warming up for Ohio State as the Buckeyes lead Michigan 73 and what has been a pretty miserable afternoon yah I can always tell when the weather's bad those guys wind up down the press box to get a free hot dog oh yeah your fight throw it down there but Brent we talked a lot the first half about both quarterbacks trying to settle and not only to the height of the game hold one win it but also the adjustment of the weather their best by playbook you're saying Bob Beckman who struggled at times difficult on the football and also Rebecca Chad Henning and the Walgreens attack officially late when they had field position where Mario Manningham his best receiver couldn't hold on to the football when they had an opportunity to put a touchdown maybe on the board and that was our best buy play Boca and as you could see it was pretty sloppy now Ohio State won the toss and took the football so what it means is that Michigan will get the first series here of the second half an entirely different kind of game in a great handle the kickoffs here for the Buckeyes and we begin the second hand fielded at the 2 yard line Harrison &amp; Harrison brings it out there's a penalty on it however a late flag see if that's an illegal block kind of like the way John O'Neil handles a ballgame Duchin kind of moves it along those what he's doing number 35 during the return ten yards from the spot of the foul first out let's go down below to Lisa well Brent as you know the rain continues to fall down here and I asked him trestle to halftime how much the weather was affecting the team and he said it really is the ball is really slippery and my kids in particular are really having a tough time specifically Todd Beckman he's having a tough time gripping the ball I also asked on Michigan Wolverine side I spoke to Eric who Campbell the wide receivers coach after Mario Manningham dropped his two passes late in the first half I said we got the weather he said no he different look the ball in but just to note many ham did get a pair of new driver let's see how those dry gloves work out here Lisa number 86 and one of the things that Michigan has to be able to establish Brent is their zone scheme they want to run the zone they want to stretch the Ohio State defense out especially now that Ohio State is putting a lot of people up towards the line of scrimmage you have to wonder if Kidd Chad Henne with the conditions can t settle down and can they give him time to throw to make Ohio State back up they set the screen and a linebacker Freeman comes right over the top Marcus Freeman the junior making a big play and it will be second down and 10 T read that one to do when you're in Ohio State defense or any defense getting ready to go up against Michigan you hear a lot about the zone play and you hear a lot about their vertical passing game in their screens Michigan runs spring plays as well if anybody the big 10 Freeman that time locked in on it and was able to make a play they got exactly what they wanted they had Golson over on the Jake long side now Golson coming back over the th Schilling side number 50 for the Buckeyes ternoon they do put a tight end over there they've release him hold and incomplete not a way to start the second half no no not at all in Michigan had a chance here to set the tone with this drive getting the ball in the second half and maybe creating some momentum but the Buckeyes Defense Forces the three and out well it's up to Soltan pesco unloaded a 68 yarder in the first half and stand it back to that Wolverine end zone small and hardline are back deep for the Bucs they could wind up with a short field here he grills another Beauty back to the 35yard line it comes small looking for an alley on the left side there's a penalty this could be coming back if he hit for the endzone that they push down and pull here from the officials folks the 65 yarder is coming back here midfield as he looks like Brian roll a linebacker who played a lot on special teams walking in the back of a Michigan player coming downfield to make a play so race malls 65yard are coming back during the return illegal block in the back there are 36 other return 10 10 yard curling for the first out that is the first penalty of this game against Ohio State who is right it is very very simple for the officials right there in the middle pretty simple to see that and in fact as soon as he did it flag comes right in there good call that time by just true he was in position to make the tackle yep so here we go back then the Buckeyes are coming out now from the 37 yard line that he died very well but at midfield points into the car six on the board guys next be two yarders say a callback a 65 yarder is now betting he goes 60 so for the touchdown from an English has to be furious about this one boy car went right down to is defective coordinator right after that play and you can see how angry the defensive coordinator is watch this showing you why he could become a great one someday this campaign broadcast on ABC HD presented by DLP HD TV and if you are watching a highdefinition use of beanie Welles career long run that's 62yard bolt for the remember last year in this game he had a chance to get into the open field stepping in for Antonio Pittman had a big run to spark the Ohio State offense Kirby's going to show you why English was so upset with his defense in just a moment pepper Johnson's son had a big role in that touchdown fielded at the 5yard line Harrison well short of the 20 yard line Bucs on fire right now a lot of energy on the other sideline the safety here this is surprising to see from a senior Jamar Adams who comes up it takes a very poor angle and once the blocks are made become to that poor angle and then Engelmann his partner in the back makes a poor tackle it opens it up but Brent you're right Deante Johnson oldschool throwback just a simple isolation play his block opened up the run and allowed BT well of the 240 pounds who shows what kind of CD as in the open field to break free form in Ian Hart there's a sense of urgency now it's 14 trade HNH have never beaten the buns Tynan down is about an eightyard gain and our Pacific Life game summary we'll take a look at the numbers that we've had there and of course 62 vini I was going to say it's changed quite a bit just in one play Michigan came out with their first series they took the ball obviously three and out and Ohio State's first play in the second half BT well this one 62 over Amy Delta less than 100 yards against this buck I did mention it is so different for the Ohio State defense to be looking at a more traditional offense than what they saw last winter with the Gators and then last week with Illinois the equalizer in college football is becoming that spread offense and you make everybody tackle in space what a difference that is I think we're going to see coaches dish off feeds and try to find the path lights and identification and the juice Williams not to just run the spread but to have a mobile quarterback who can throw the football it's just too tough to prepare for to close defenses down those that was doubleteamed throws our matthews the intended target bran done he's been high the entire day with most of the throws Mosman throws and you can see again grimacing we've kind of take for granted how much pain he's playing with me gotta wonder how much it's affecting his accuracy today told somebody to do a separated shoulder no matter what you take try and hold off the pain it starts to build up late the game and he has not a definite how it said it half time talking to Chris he's not throwing a ball with the velocity like he normally does small now back to the 21 yard line looking over to the left and to the 31 yard line meanwhile what about my part he came in with the injured ankle right ankle heavily tape he takes a flow puts his weight on it and gets crushed he might this presentation of college football brought to you by this by this holiday we'll help you put together perfect gifts Cadillac introducing the

Illini is possibly going to hazard in they will be right up there along with Ohio State as a team high estate playing to seniors today 1 on offense and 1 on defense assuming their underclassmen come back but runs hook this year 9 vinegar against the FCC in a bowl game and when a lot of players coming back your right will be a lot of momentum carried over in the next year third and five speaking of the Rose Bowl that's where the women are this baby appears headed become sane muscle is right for a first in debt I said appears obviously at Michigan comes back they will go to Pasadena there is a sequence which would still send Ohio State to the BCS Championship but it would be very very unlikely for all those teams ahead of them much more likely that Russell wins today he will go back to Pasadena and I don't believe Jim's been to the Rose Bowl was John Cooper when he took Ohio State out there and they beat Arizona State in fact in 1996 to quit a long long time Jim Tressel Pat a lot of success but a lot of times they've been a BTS at Lawrence collection many times to the Fiesta Bowl exactly become sane and top contenders and of course LSU has moved back to the top spot there's what's left in the big 12 is right there in the middle and then West Virginia well gets it on the three teams in the middle because the next two weeks you're going to have a mini playoff because they all play one another it crosses over Kansas Missouri next week and the winner will play Oklahoma so two of those teams will be gone they'll be one standing comes down and LSU the winner of the big 12 little semi regional and then West Virginia who plays the top Cincinnati team tonight down Nippert Stadium second down and eight insane will struggling breath Accra as soon as we say that and believe that Texas Tech will take care of Oklahoma tonight agency I mean that's the way the season has gone and don't forget that LSU they have old myths today they play Arkansas and then they're getting to play Tennessee or Georgia more than likely in the SEC title and a wait organ playing right now I don't know if anybody in America wants to play the Bulldog the only thing predictable about this year's college football season is its unpredictability so Jim Tressel is giving that Wolverine defense a steady diet of running boy somebody does in first pass in the second half now he's going to throw it out of bounds or down in the Wolverines can ill afford to give up any more poisonous we're kind of talking at the break before we came back from Michigan gave the ball back to Ohio State that drive was huge that Michigan stopping Ohio State there from scoring especially in such down the way the momentum of this game is going big stop the laboring thief just interval factly because we expect Chad Henne but maybe Ryan Mallett comes in Matthew's back deep again Hilton at the explode yardline short of the 20 yard line and pushed out of bounds any has got the helmet on and stepping back like he's got the offense around him so Big Tex was loosening up in a bullpen there he is he he was getting that right arm loose just in case but any we'll see if he can drive this and you know Kirk when you look at the the wide receivers Manningham four catches but he's dropped a couple tight in Butler wood three but everything's been Hilda one catch for five years chant he comes back without the glow on his throwing hand without the glove maybe that was affecting decrypt and maybe that's why the ball is fail let's take a look I mean with the underneath throw thing up about a 5 is your jaw gun goes to ten if Chad Henne can cut it out his last name is 40 16 of a starting quarterback in Michigan Michigan has a much better chance even with him struggling they going to the freshman mallet mallet has in a world of potential but he also had been a quarterback to his turn the football over Chad Henne have to stay on the field for Michigan just eaten up dentling her hot den leave early sophomore from Troy Ohio and the Wolverine offensive line has not kept the front claim or the right side of this offensive line has struggled mightily this time Alex Mitchell who's in it right guard burns the wrong way and makes it pretty easy for dent leader to get right in there for the loss on Mike Hart and Mike Hart continue continuing to get pounded here into the second half bird and a rush for Golson doubleteam holding is the call expected is now the linesman through that flag I thought for a moment it was the Empire but it wasn't yeah still against the offense little shift against the often that penalties decry fourth down did you see where that ball was thrown by Chad Henne again hi missing his intended receiver so even if it wasn't a flag Michigan just cannot find anything to kill to go to be able to take some of the pressure off of their running game Chad Henne I really have never seen him look this erratic back there throwing a football no question he's bothered by the separated shoulder let's go hanging it hi there catch by hotline at the 35 yard line and you can just imagine how he feels the frustration trailing 143 you're watching ESPN on ABC while we're away Lloyd Carr called the bullpen Big Tex put the helmet on Ryan Mallett and it seems likely that that injured shoulder of Hayes if you're going to go any further this thing what happened six and a half minutes here beanie well brick spray again to the 40yard line he's posted in a 200 yard day but was that a hammy he breached back with that right hand is that a hamstring and he definitely came up it's the big plug here this time the fullback who's in there is Tyler Whaley been the same call in isolation play the safeties continue to take poor angles poor tackling on the packed end and I don't know Fred at this point they're just starting to getting a little intimidated a beanie well if it's 240 pounds I'm coming yep 170 yards you could see when he came up big of the 23 yards foreign and so the freshman same back on the field don't remember about saying now you got speed time for the X Factor presented by city and we just saw that Mister excellent off he has had a game of his life as far as playing in his rivalry and what he needed to do and Mike Hart spent a quiet day for my heart he's been gutting it out himself much like Chad Henne trying to stay on the field for his team and now if mallet comes and they'll really need my part in that huddle to help the young freshman out you would think that the only chance Michigan head is for young Mallett to find Manningham Arrington and Matthews deeper they can't keep throwing screen and four yards best sayings down and it will be third down there's that dislocated shoulder we were there at Illinois the night and you have to wonder if after this game soon we won't be reading that they Marcus copic surgery that there's something in there that they'll have to take out because it certainly sent that type of champagne it has not been near 100% I think you only five passes in Madison a good performance by henning here today he tried to do it now it's the on the bus place saying nothing doing they're going to get it back Michigan linebackers expected to play I don't think they thought Beckman would throw the football and they attacked the Ohio State offensive line before the plane had a chance today was coming up in our atoms the safety coming up and also Chris Graham locked in there made a nice plate of pork Ohio State here to the fun hassle attempt of Barry Ryan Mallett on his first series Matthews is standing back on the Wolverine 10yard line this could be very tough starting point for a freshman quarterback this coming out on the 20yard line a little bit too much lake so a little breathing room for Big Tex crowd will react as soon as they see that now it's coming out read a quick data report about Ryan Mallett he had some experience obviously this year his throw the football he bit strong with that strong arm but he also has been a quarterback who's turned it over whatever he took allow him to play was worn off and Henny is headed back for the locker room they can't get off here comes my part and battling back toward the line of scrimmage Bridget there's heady going up into the infamous tunnel here at the big house the Ryan Mallett has the ability where he could throw a 70 yard touchdown pass on any given play he has that kind of physical ability and the and the ability to end it over her it's a true freshman he's emotional I've seen him all year this year times getting into altercations with the opponent needs to keep his cool now and detector to his first pass and he's got his dick arrington the second tension is to put it down a third and makeable kind of thing they've got to do is to get the ball down field if they're to have a chance trailing 14 3 we have an offensive struggling to get downfield bread creates a defensive mindset where you don't respect that aspect and you start to inch up and cheat to try to take away the under throw always but also the running game trying to get Mario Manningham downfield a fairly first plate nichkhun called with Manningham downfield got to look up now again without inside of five like what's important here perfect Hart for the first time russell's but its first intent for the Wolverines and it was set up by Mallon his ability to get the ball a little bit further downfield on that second down pass just the threat of his ability to throw it Brent it's a great block for the fullback he'll move who opens it up gives hard enough of a seam to come underneath his block and then get down field that was well executed that time on third down by Michigan now Washington is locked up with many hands toward the top of your strength now let go looks the other way there's 15 more yards in a first in 10 close to midfield touchable come over here but interfere number two you know Manningham is known as their threat down field but Arrington has the ability especially oneonone this time against Malcolm Jenkins Malcolm Jenkins had his hands on Arrington's back after he makes the play at the end he's back to the football he's got to be very careful that officials make that ball every time Jenkins cutting implementing ham at the bottom of screen Harmons the other side I put that but there's a fly this one could go against Carson Butler let's see what the call is holding is going to be the call the tight end went to get the outside man and it's against the Wolverines there's a little bit of the hitch of the giddyup there folks at play we saw he limped off a little bit after that hitting number 85 on the offense 10yard over to the side of the five repeat first up Butler was frustrated because he felt that Larry Grant slipped on his own without being hooked by the big tight end continue to keep a close eye on Mike Hart because as much as they need to throw the ball with mallet that balance that Hart can provide is very important he's out now with minor hit recalled already hit he has gone to the locker room hard is nothing on that fat big tax code great block play is going to be sacked from behind Vernon gulstan this is the matchup that everybody wants to see burning Golson against the allamerican Jake long top of the screen the same move that he's used on the other side against Schilling is just a amazing first step it gives him the edge in the leverage that he needs to go around the tackle Kirk I give you wrong but that might be the first sack that jake long has given up this year I think I think you're right it guys saw he's everybody here to give it up very minute entire career deck second down and 20 for what golson's have a great game malik overthrew matthews had him and overthrew him folks help decide the Pontiac gamechanging performance of the day go to espn.com espn.com search Pontiac to determine which school will win $5,000 and a chance to win $100,000 at the end of the season third down in 24 for knowledge and the Wolverines with the basket mallet was where you had one receiver taking the safety way and it opened Matthews and Wolverines are forced to play there's a different vibe right now with the live arm of mallet in the game but the end result is you still have to protect if you want to get it down field takes a lot longer to get the ball down here to take more time to be able to protect the quarterback Ohio State's still applying a great deal of pressure into that backfield the Wolverines but has continuing for Michigan small and part the to return then the Zoltan moscowbacked again our line driven back inside the 15 look for the light burn attic and people are taken out from under him at the 17 yard line and whoever my drew that Monday Night Football on ESPN continues next week it's not a mile high bench young can he come back and leave the Tennessee Titans against Jay Cutler and the Denver Broncos Monday Night Football he has been at 8:30 Eastern oh it's been trouble with the Titans last weekend not a few bruises one thing I've done if any of that was coming beneath it and here is the not very successful return after limping off a tendency that we've seen this year from Ohio State it's when beanie weld starts to run the football defenses have to adjusting the way you adjust if you have to get up and attack the line of scrimmage getting eight sometimes nine guys into the box Jim Tressel this year's recognize that and Beckman had thrown over top of defenses they're proud of the last Rhodes will see if they go to that into the fourth quarter so what a job Jim Russell has done with Ohio State against Michigan the Trussell coach teams have dominated this rivalry ever since he came to the locals fourth quarters coming up and college football presented by best buy returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations tie against Ohio State that Lloyd Carr kills to breathe fire into an offense that is struggling the fuzz around here is the Lord they call it a career at the end of this season right now he's on the short end 14 3 and Jim Tressel has dominated for the first time today Lloyd Carr has gone to the headset only 1 in 5 against Jim Tressel he's being dominated just like he dominated our friend John Silber once upon a time and because of the last six years and now working on in seventh I think it's affected his legacy here in Ann Arbor he loses this game it really would be a shame some of the fans the radio callin shows have really been tough on Boyd carnies last few years because of the way he performed his team performed against Ohio State now third down Buckland those angel blades are roaring at him and he had pressure on him that dime from Jameson Tim Jameson number 90 has played a blind game for car in a Wolverine can Jameson and really I think outside of when BT Wells has been able to pick up some great blocks and run downhill into the Michigan secondary the Wolverines are doing enough on defense to keep them in this game still waiting for the offense to catch up they're down 14 to 3 both Trapasso for the buxom mess go for the Wolverines have done their job set much yes he does get this before it goes out of our far side down the sideline out for the Wolverine he has given them their best opportunity since the first half moving down the sideline on a punt that was headed out of bounds as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary girl well it's been a lot of beanie wealth today and good blocking for Ohio State up front you can see the type of day that Wells is had and first play at second half he went the distance but the Michigan offense yet to get on track Chad Henne he's been fighting through an injury they had to sit him down and because of that now Ryan Mallett comes out for his second series at Michigan office in great field position a 27 yard return by Matthews gives the Wolverines a first and 10 Buckeye territory at the 34 yard like the challenge ruling on last play they said that the runaround for him to challenge their brand early in his games nobody from the sidelines must have seen something I'd be shocked if they're wrong on this as Chad Henne is coming back Shane took champagne he came back to lead him to a victory the folks I on the right foot of Matthew all right there that question he's going to talk to the Wolverine about 10 yards that would be J looks like 10 to 12 yards left foot steps out of bounds was at the left of the right foot looked like his left when he made the cut right well further back further back they're running it the technical advisors one of the best pearl cell is in the booth right next to us here and John Langdon the technical adviser is over there and they will communicate with John O'Neill now and Chad Henne looks like he means business he's back throwing Bryn I think you're right the right footsteps when he steps that about fit about the 46 yard line nickers well no that was the left so what both of them that angle is not going to be definitive number indisputable is what they look for is that indisputable right there with the right foot was that industry or look like if it is they'll come back and market it should be about 12 yards amiable spotted right now 34 yard line say in the trestle early last week against Illinois there was a controversy on aniline I play of player was approaching the goal line and it appeared as though he was down and then on a another look at a replay the ball was coming free and went into the end zone was recovered by the Buckeyes shouldn't touch back coming out in the 20 you would have thought but he does something malfunctioned or whatever and Jenny what the look is back enough here comes Roy come after him interesting very interesting Lloyd car is back in the huddle now I think Chad Henne fed up I'm going here white car who is Lloyd said let's keep the young buck in there maybe see what happened here I have a same sort of read that you did on the on the situation and meanwhile we've got a little field position decision to make here this is not in any way going to give the bucket to him it was determined that the runner steps out of bounds at the 46 Carthon Chad Henne again shaved the Champaign Illinois when he decided to try to fight through it went into the locker room in the middle that game if you remember because of the initial shot that he took on his throwing arm came back and miraculously led them to a victory on the road so that becomes a 15yard massive return instead of 27 now meanwhile minor is the tailback for the brains any on incomplete Chad Henne comes back from going into the locker room in a very first play this is why I think Michigan fans have been waiting to see with hynny downfield a Manningham but give Kirk Coleman a lot of credit he stated home off with a bootleg not only that he high points the ball and he's undersized in about 510 for a safety Chad hit is probably the first time he'd let it go since the first play of the game when he tried soy downfield tomorrow again second and 10 13:57 and there's a penalty flag on this by Manningham he lost a couple of yards without a Washington coming up but there was a penalty flag thrown on the play you know a thot Brent and everyone Michigan went to the nohuddle really created some tempo and slow to Ohio State's defense down that probably was their best drive it may be a fun little formation on the offense er less than seven men on the line of scrimmage that penalties decline third down sorry the only time they put Ohio State on their heels is when they went with a hurry up with the no huddle that Kenny eventually ended up leading them down the field for a field goal is instances yeah third down and 11 the Wolverines are 3 of 14 on third downs or get to the aisle safety and a penalty climb this was definitely not a Willis Reed robot motion number seven was going forward at the set that certainly declined for that right that's on the quarterback Chad Henne and Adam Krauss the spin are not on the same page kind of leaning forward I think he was coming up ready to make an adjustment which he does very often after that kind of the decoyed snap where he lifts the leg the crowd that he on a different page let's go and small turtle comer he gets on it at the 9 yard line Oh the Buckeyes and Jim Tressel dodged a bullet there is small gets back on it you're watching ESPN on ABC well they played a hundred and four times and this is the 43rd time that Ohio state of Michigan have sudden the Big Ten championship in their game and now the winner will head to Pasadena 143 we've got thirteen and a half minutes to go the star of stars certainly has been beating wells at the ball carrier Kirk and you and I talked about some of the folks might not a purchase order but I can't get over how big vini is and fast how he could mature into something so it's that special blend when you have power associated with great speed in such quick speed and I think he's grown at the back I think he's become a more mature patient running back from the beginning of the year to where he is now with 11 or 12 games of experience get started go back Ohio State will continue to feed him the football the fourth quarter Michigan defense has to make a play to give the Wolverines hope Turkey's 26 yards away from you take a look at what he's accomplishing I think it starts up frying the fact in Ohio State's offensive line have given him some opportunities blowing from blocking fullback when he gets into the second level he definitively in the country because of his power but safety comes up to try to bring him down any front right through the shore affects him day after the Cooper River is big maybe 95 is the man watch the game today what a day how supposed to be any Georgia dentists exactly right daily George Dickel Heisman Trophy winner of Ohio State repeating he's been the star player so far here comes the Blitz picking his way when he get the first down sheds a turban No so the Bucks are forced a month in Ron English at the defensive coordinator realizing under 12 minutes to go now he's got to be willing to take chances and Jamar Adams 22 the safety cheating way up brought the Blitz taking Ohio State no chance that they might throw the football and it worked out to their favorite macrinus we've got to give a previous some props for the snapping that has gone on these puns for professor 56 is bending over on a bill wet sloppy day he's been on the money just like that all day long and apostle 31 Matthews at the 36 is written down at the football the official best work this one out keep it big play that time a little green Wow save the football game by coming up with that recovery seelet's number 35 Doug Dutch Doug on that side watch Dutch ball is loose quarterback Doug Dutchman was a wide receiver wraps it up stays the day this presentation of college football brought you by this by this holiday will help you put together perfect gifts pattern with five totally new models it's just something to rethink about Saturn DLP HDTV DLP is the official ESPN on ABC HD telecast sponsor of college football and Heineken it's all about the beer but on this day advantage Buckeyes their defense has yielded only 92 yards 24 rushing and 68 passing it has three pack today City back deep throwing sighs heavily interference many am interfered with 15 yards and an automatic first down good call here Anderson Russell gets a little bit Deeks on the pump and go it's caught they're guessing number 21 in the defense 15 yards from the previous spot automatic first down and on a slick field you don't have any chance once you guess Jenkins is up tight Anderson Russell back and right there little give and go and he gets by him he's going to run right by him he locks him up and that is pass interference it's Ohio State because he just touched on him Brent the same defense last week sitting back on their heels looking very hesitant indecisive because of Illinois and juice Williams in the way they attack them and today they've been able to get back to the basics of being aggressive 1st down and 10 for the Wolverines and harsh gives up about three yards of a Michigan fan you're well aware of what's happened in the last four games coming into today last five games they've trailed by it leaves ten points and for those games they've been able to fight back in with those football games and even last week when they came up short against Wisconsin they made some plays in the fourth quarter with the pass game to give himself the chance not like Michigan to lose three games in Ann Arbor in a single season but that's what they face now with ten twenty seven left any pocket hole high incomplete Arrington reaching up for it and the phones were coming folks it's pretty good job by Michigan's offensive line an area that they've struggled with his protection this time they give any the time and you need to give him the time and you have a receiver coming all the way across the field and much like we've seen today Michigan wide receiver unable to lock down catch the football hold on to the ball whether it's the conditions and the balls are not perfectly thrown yes somebody's got too big either gotta make a play there down corner quick picks up input place fourth down Donald Washington coming that time like Mike deboard said they come from every angle in every place this time Washington coming from the corner on the Blitz and one thing that happens here Brett in my opinion is even though Washington didn't get there it affected him and in fact I think the Russia that time of Larimore may have affected the throwing they may have touched the football or touch Chad his arm as he was coming through smaller heart line continued about from restaurants all of the money but down it at least when he's livid about recycling and the Buckeyes will put it in play just a few minutes from Pasadena leave it 143 there's a national championship who's wields MIT thing but as a Big Ten team if you can't get there definitely the role schools through the grand prize anytime you have a chance to play in the Rose Bowl you know you'd be excited we've got a consolation prize for one opportunity to out there to the Rose Bowl the granddaddy of them all granddaddy indeed and the winner of this game qualifies at the pick ten champion automatically into the room full out west will it be Oregon USC or Arizona State that is still to be determined I'm feeling well since the MVP of this game for the Buckeyes now let's take you to the Allstate standing show you what we think it would be near impossible Ohio State would have to climb over all of those teams above them except of course LSU together that second but now Oregon's Austin quarterback remember the big 12 will eliminate two in figures up to three but there's still West Virginia but Oregon's gone 203 from the big 12 for gone Emily's really LSU in West Virginia along with one of the big 12 teams that will eventually emerge you are my favorite book Iowa I don't think they're gonna get there go deep huntail pickets besides don't want to investigate it I didn't sue I've been too long since you know the Ohio State's been to uh Jim Tressel taken Ohio State to a Fiesta Bowl the BCS game Oh two oh three oh five OH six and now this year they're fighting today to try to get the Pasadena I don't think they're going to be able to get back up there because I don't think what Virginia will lose I don't think lr2 nor LSU well I suppose if George if you catch him ya know and I that could happen that might be trouble for here's their down let's get the bucks can pick as well you know who he will not get it Jamison was helping out number 90 they met beanie at the point of attack and they're the Wolverines are not going to go without a little bit of a fight here that's a great job by Terrence Taylor in this entire Michigan front I continue to say this game feels is the field is tilting towards Ohio State but look at the pike look at the effort even will Johnson is in their third and short game on the line every second the fourth quarter counts and Michigan beats Ohio State up front to force this fits up punt would you go out to this punt Mattie we're all over you know if you're not going to create a turnover you have to press the issue on special teams what does that mean setting up to the big return or going after the block you have to make a play to be able to get back in they're going for the return good to hold up the Gunners which you've seen 10 for guys out there Matthews and this one going to rolls bed at about the 32 yard line we check about Matt Winer and d'art Matt I friend this SportsCenter minute is powered by Vizio Florida's Tim Tebow became the first Bowl Subdivision quarterback to reach 20 touchdown passes in 20 touchdowns once and a single season he's accounted for four sports today floated up big in Manhattan Kansas Missouri freshman Jeremy Maclin has more than 310 yards in allpurpose yardage Sean just 15 touches three touchdowns to do a big ethical we went forward Kirk and I to see in that Missouri being next Saturday night in Kansas City they're on it against unbeaten Kansas think about sure down next Saturday night Oh is hit by number 50 ghosts and Sunday as much as we talked about beating wells on the offensive side the story for the Ohio State defense the entire crew but really has been burning ghosted what happened that time Brent is the receiver that he wanted to throw the football to to Adrian Arrington got off track he actually flip and burning dosto was able to get there fast I mean underneath and back to the original line of scrimmage is very old Manningham and that was Marcus Freeman the linebacker riding him down so here comes a third down inside of seven minutes and the Wolverines still need 10 yards burning Goulston the speed in the power much like Benny Wells has been tough for Michigan to be able to contain up front and again they moved him they flopped it from side to side make it very difficult on players and coordinators he's hit release almost intercepted off Farrington came right through the defender but there was pleasure by number 58 dope that was in on top of it it's been seen throughout the game at this time he gives Michigan's offensive line a field of power he goes right through Schilling and right through my heart to be able to get there once you go right through Schilling harsh tries to help out and still burning ghost and puts pressure on Chad Henne let's go is back so true waiting this of our line and small let it roll visit the 33 yard line and that's where the I have a confession his last game in Ann Arbor and it's been a painful you we'll the biggest music stars of the planet come together wide performances by Rascal Flatts won a Kirk's favorite maroon 5 Lenny Kravitz forgave Rihanna and more for the first time every year both will decide to win the American Music Awards live a VZ my man Kenny Chesney perform I look better oh me too your figure the Year show the day mr. Weston would coalesce he tiptoes for boy I'll tell you then he picks have a lot for you are just anything is going to get only too well quiet quiet big house here in Ann Arbor it's the largest since 2003 versus Ohio State over 111,000 Susan's came in we're gonna have to get out of here because they're going to start a remodel that job okay you long beak on the inside you caught a lot of games in here you're probably as excited as anybody very oh yeah it's a beautiful facility but your magic coming back here in the next two or three years when it's finished or these ought to be as good as there is second down and six ten guides of the line of scrimmage Brent so you mentioned a clerk and uh here's what Dave had loft got to hold these cards for us and there was your luxury boxes across the way that says the earth Street winds won't have to sit outside in the rain that come about 2010 they will put them right over there and I don't know if game day I'll have any more room on the field no it's fine what a beautiful universe box you can see something they've already done modeling's out back in Columbus was ruined here we are third and seven now st. is back in at the money back spectrum of you can pick this one up through the air no doubt no doubt he won't Oh mr. Jameson how do you do sending he's played a heck of a football game insane I want to see that like this play again with a bait excited to come with a blitz Brent so obviously the linemen have to make an adjustment to pick up linebacker and if your friends up Jameson who just played great football game that was business small crew lined up in the backfield he took that black he wants to be ready for a wide receiver here 180 mm give me back on the outside get get that beanie fella back be out of here I don't want anymore that mr. pants Oh really short punt this time and a bouncing we'll see where that one's marks here you see the side Chas running right to respond second half has not been pretty for Michigan Brent her offense I was trying to think a first downs have they've been able to come up with you can see it is very long haul and with it at the combination of Chad Henne not feeling well an Ohio State playing very very well I think it's a high on state winning the battles in the trenches are separately burning Goulston and just having too much the permission involved in supplying it was continued slow it is back to the shotgun bolston closing it again all day for the young mammal to separate children he has had to fight through this and at one point they took a man and man to give him whatever he might need to come back and try to finish the game as good as Ryan Mallett will be they just need Chad Henne and his experience in this rivalry game to try to lead them back and make this game competitive and it's just just not meant to be at this point for Henny and Wolverines month Altman is not take a cracker post and they moved him in a right tackle good luck they comes inside and get picked up by the back and Manningham what's another one the third drop passed by number 86 today and the boobs come down Manningham has had a just a rough day trying to hold on to the football that shot showed you not just that the ball is slick his eyes are going up he's looking at who is closing in on him before he holds on to the football we've seen Manning him do that we've seen Arrington do that and it's not like the Michigan wide receivers to get intimidated the way these guys could play it so far in this game hit on the release and it is fourth and ten but what happens is when you have one individual that's the top dominant up front by Goulston the offensive line starts to think so much about Goulston that it frees up other defensive linemen to be able to make plays in that time it's Larry Moore who fights in and beats oneonone opportunity to get after Chad Henne and they're going to go for it here on fourth down yeah 351 and you're down 14 3 ball game right here if the heart converting third in to label important in going downfield any ham nope like Ohio State takes over 344 to go it's all that separates the Buckeyes from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena what a difference one week makes for an Ohio State defense last week against the Illini that played back in play with much confidence and much swagger this week Jim came back and Luke federal decided to turn this defense loose and we're almost to the end of the game in Michigan right now has 91 yards of total offense Jim trussel go to work on the play clock I should say that game clock in to say and looking to the place like myself that time baby Wells of course you play the game as far as Ohio State is concerned it needs to be noted a lot of talk about Mike hard and Michigan and these seniors trying to to win this game but Jim Tressel we think about this what he's had the success against this Michigan team but 15 with two seniors on it one on offense one on defense so we're back in the big house some happy folks where Dre some unhappy ones we're in maize and blue junior quarterback pot Beckman 23 years old took over from Heisman Trophy winner Torrey Smith and then once are closing in on a Big Ten championship Michigan use the timeout 3:30 to go a lot of anticipation this week about Lloyd Carr would this be his final game he's been very tightlipped about that throughout the week which is what you would expect from Lloyd Carr and I don't know at the end of this game if he's going to make some kind of announcement saying that he is going to step down but my memory of Lloyd Carr will be forget about the Ohio State Michigan game it's the way he has gone about his job he is a coach that hasn't forgotten why he got into this business the reason he got into this business is to build relationships between himself and his players and when you see it behind closed doors it's amazing to see how many people that he's affected in his time in his 13 years here as a head coach because he takes his role as a teacher very seriously and it's not just X's and O's in football Brent it's about teaching these players about life as well he's got a great child here in Ann Arbor here's Janie picks up the first down down to the 30 yard line the one point though that I want to make about Lloyd is so we can about the halftime interviews and sometime he's a little bit of a curmudgeon to deal with but when you talk about a class act and representing his school yeah I totally agree with you he's a solid football man and no matter this is a bum year and Michigan fans have a right to be upset about the way it started the way it's ending I don't blame him but when you look at the whole body of work ladies and gentlemen it is very positive for Lloyd Carr and that's how he should be viewed no matter what he decides we in Kirk you and I have no inside information I sort of think that this is it did he have fall in a career and in step away and I think I'm going to remember in a very positive way like you yeah I mean 13 years to win five Big Ten championships go back to 1997 winning a national championship and he started great against his rival Ohio State the last six or seven years it has not gone well I just hope that the Michigan fanbase realizes the entire body of work and that what he has done here in the job that he's done in the way he thought about approaching his job with these players crowds in excess of a hundred thousand fans the players who meet who come through this we've all met the lowlands oh just like the Buckeye players it's a very positive experience for the athlete and clearly in every way you want to measure this game the Buckeyes have been superior today I think that's very personnel I think you've had superior play calling and Lloyd Carr has been unable to get this team back in it yeah and and I think it's fitting to give a tribute to Lloyd Carr because of what he's meant is a as a head coach and just as fitting to recognize the job that Jim Tressel has done for the hioh State secure of this victory I just mentioned 2002 in the BCS Championship game over free they went back to a BCS bowl game Oh four or o5o six now seven five of the last six years he's let Ohio State into the BCS two of those games in national championship games right now he proposed to the town in Columbus Ohio and so teeny break spray again we've got a 200yard roster on our hands folks in a Michigan Ohio State game people talk about what you do in the Ohio State Michigan game is to remember forever will be T Wells must have looked in the mirror and had a some serious soulsearching as he approached dis Stadium I mentioned he said earlier this week to James Laurinaitis who conveyed that to me he said James I got to start fastest game so many of the games this year I'm waiting into the second half to take it over this game I want to start fast and you can tell his attitude was on display this afternoon and the first carry for his back up Maurice Wells never Brandon seen was in a little bit earlier so I've got 39 carries for number 28 for 220 20 yards left the day in the office this day will be remembered for all time of Ohio State fans the effort could be well one more carry will get him to 40 carry about a workhorse true sophomore about a workhorse true sophomore the very leaf comes back for one more year for Ohio State final seconds the Buckeyes will just kneel down they're not going to try to connect one on they don't want any to be remembered for were to Gables tickle and that's pretty classy at Jim Tressel to take a knee and be happy with a 14 to 3 victory so he sticks out Lloyd Carr immediately shakes hands the photographer's going Lloyd as beanie welds comes up in boy car trudges off the big house turf a loser for the fourth time this year and the third time right here let's go down to Lisa with the winning coach coach Tressel seeing that both offensive struggles in but what ultimately was the difference for us well we ran the ball pretty well I guess we ran it for two hundred twenty nine yards and that's pretty good against the Michigan team stuff to come in here and win you know Michigan has had a lot of hard knock this season with all the injuries and so forth and they played with a lot of courage our kids played extremely hard awfully proud of the Buckeyes Christine Weldon bring both of those to them both those guys are playmakers they're great kids was very important to them to win this football game and we're the Big Ten champions I thanks a lot coach congratulation thank you for sure so Jim Tressel a winner again now six and one against the Wolverines who headed at least for Pasadena Murray be matched against Oregon USC or Arizona State that is still to be determined and our Chevrolet player game you're looking at one of them given a radio taketv Dini wells 39 carries 223 yards and from Michigan we're going to highlight number 90 folks mr. Jamison was a load and that defensive end tackle is in the defensive line three of them for a loss today and so in honor Chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution each university's general scholarship fund that wasn't pretty necessarily for either team but potential hi Oh State Michigan the Buckeyes holding the Wolverines under a hundred yards but the day will be remembered for the effort that beanie Wells put put forth today once again the final score 14 3 Ohio State beat Michigan in the rivalry game coming up out regional college football action event for ABC HD and ESPN HD his state versus the Michigan State Miami versus Virginia Tech on ABC Iowa State versus Kansas or Cal versus Washington for Lisa Salters and Bergstrom I promise burger we hope you've enjoyed Michigan and Ohio stay down let's send you to John Craig had a Flutie man in our New York studio taking away Big John well Craig in the fluty man pulling me in just a few moments time and if this in fact has been lloyd cars last game as head coach and they make an announcement after the game we will let you know but coming up our 3:30 game check local listings for the game available in your air some of you are going to see if Mark Mangino can remain unbeaten Kansas against Iowa State others get a key matchup Virginia Tech looking to go on and get to the ACC championship game facing Miami some will be in the big pen where Penn State looks bad on to a pretty good season as they face this part of Michigan State while others will be Cal against Washington coming up both scores and highlight the Flutie man and craggy moment
