============================================================

we welcome you back to the Superdome as we get ready for LSU and Alabama now let's go to the public address announcer here is Doug green we would ask that you please rise and observe a moment of silence as we remember our servicemen and women overseas and pray for world peace and now please join New Orleans native Metropolitan Opera star and cast member of HBO's Boardwalk Empire Anthony Latura as he sings our National Anthem oh can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming whose broad my time bright stars through the path despite her heart we watched were so gallantly streaming hey truth roulade I that our flag was still there oh the hot sauce and Halloween and you wonderful job by Anthony litter and you know folks it's amazing how much goes into it evening an event like this one for New Orleans and everyone watching the national championship around the globe we are all ready for an ultimate clash between two college football giants LSU Alabama who knew that the reverberations that started on a Saturday afternoon in November would still be felt on a Monday night in January a defensive battle the agent sets up a rematch only under the biggest lights meaning nothing less than a new town The Revenge of all three mansions here we go it's about James I'm at the 2012 allstate BCS National Championship Frank's is the top two teams in the nation the Crimson Tide the Tigers square off once more the showdown will have no trilogy the winner tonight will walk away BCS national champion but where Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger a little bit later we're gonna hear from Erin Andrews Tom Rinaldi also down to the sidelines let's talk a little football my friend let's talk with the Tigers of LSU well everybody has been talking about kid to possibly be more points scored in this game after their first matchup at 9:00 to 6:00 and overtime of the Tigers winning I think the big thing is Jordan Jefferson he's kind of the xfactor for LSU tonight his legs have got to become a big factor for the Tigers running the ball to the outside for LSU trying to get to the edge against that big physical Alabama defense and then he's got to make some throws on third down to try to keep the football and keep it away from Alabama every we know how good Trent Richardson is but what most Alabama do tonight to win the rematch well if you look at Alabama Trent Richardson is obviously the key but LSU knows he's the key they get a stack line of scrimmage with probably close to nine guys more often than not I think Alabama is going to have to show a willingness to say AJ McCarron you're a firstyear starter we trust you we believe in you we're going to make you on first and ten with playaction try to make some big plays in the pass game try to get that defense to soften up and then go back to Trent Richardson and ride him all the way and championship victory so Alabama miles out of this locker room here at the Superdome Nick Saban who has coached both of these teams to national championships will lead them out so the tide and what a great feeling for these young men on the other side less miles holding the Tigers back now LSU's turn this has been the Nissan pregame chip no these are the moments in the faces that we all remember so well epic battles even more epic retaliation the causeandeffect David versus Goliath Goliath versus David the rematches the Thrilla in Manilla poly in Persia wibbels McEnroe and four Duke in UNLV the national championship right here Florida Florida State the Super Bowl times and Patriots and tonight in New Orleans LSU and Alabama here we go again so now the captains Assemble Tyron manson of course on the other side and you're taking a look at some fellas from the new orleans saints who are going to be honorary captains that's Heisman Trophy former Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram recently underwent surgery on IR his teammate Roman Harper and of course representing LSU Deborah Henderson our outstanding wide receiver all three of these fellows played for the Saints this year they're our honorary captains they received every leaning over these teammate now Harper shaking hands with everybody in Ingram now for tonight's coin toss our BCS National Championship referee the big 12 Scott go back that's tail that's heads that stay what is your choice choices tails it is sales you won the toss where we see the Tigers will get the ball first here tonight against Nick Saban's fabulous defense from Alabama these two teams were unable to produce a single touchdown now Tom Rinaldi is with Coach Saban so let's go to Table nine thanks a lot Brent 44 days since you last played 65 days since you played then all the planning and preparation in practice why will tonight be different I don't know there will be different they're two good football teams you know in some ways it's unique that we have two teams in the same division in the same conference playing in a national championship but I do think there's a two best teams in the country appreciating it good luck let's go over to Erin Andrews Erin Tom thanks well coach the city has fired off the Superdome is electric what if he told your team about handling all this emotion early tonight keep your feet on the ground get ready to you know they get a play at a time it will take the place that you came to make you saw your path not take it all right thanks to my friend Thank You Erin for me there is one distinctive check mark for LSU that's in the kicking game and the special teams and they get to return the opening pickoff no doubt about it and Tyrann Mathieu tonight will have a lot to do with that as far as trying to create opportunities you look at the punter and the kicker from LSU and what they did in the first matchup Brad wing drew Holloman they were the difference in the game so we settled back now with this crowd and more than 50% represent LSU because it was so close to their campus they picked up the extra ticket so it doesn't seen any question about that no you look around this this beautiful venue and you can see a lot of purple and gold and you know that it's not by accident you go back and think about oh 7 they want a championship here in O 3 and their crowd had a lot to do with both of those championships against Oklahoma no three in Ohio state no 7 Kate Foster will put the ball on the tee and as we get ready folks settle back and enjoy the sights and sounds the BCS Championship is about to begin at the 28 yard line so Jordan Jefferson who was suspended for games earlier this season was just coming back in Game one but because Jared Lee threw a couple of interceptions in that game hurry he is now the man for LSU there's two things LSU had a chance to prepare all this time with Jordan Jefferson knowing he was going to be a starting quarterback and Alabama's defense has not prepared for Jarrett Lee they've been great getting ready for number and everything he can do with his so Michael Ford will get the first series they'll try to get to the edge but not on the I'm backing tour Upshaw comes up to make the thumping hit on that as we take a look now at Ford the running back and you can see the key men Rueben Randle so pivotal with their game plan here PJ Lonergan is back and quickly on the snap and there is the man Randall that they want to go to on the slick screen and that will give them third and short Rueben Randall's their difference maker on the outside they feel like if they can get him matched up oneonone he can make some big plays for them one thing that LSU feels that they've got to be able to do against the size the physicality of Alabama and their linebackers hit the ball out to the edge and variety ways Kenny Hilliard the talented freshman is going to come in at tailback and he'll bring JC Copeland with him as the fullback this is third and short wants to make sure that he's got the check with Jefferson tumble on a snap Jefferson will have to eat it for a loss so the first bottle of the game and it means three and out for LSU it's the first third down in the game the emotions are high Jordan Jefferson's got to keep his hands in there a little bit better with Lonergan trying to reach out there to make a big block the emotion to the game are going to be so big here now here's the key guy that you have talked about for days Harvey as les goes over here is Brad Wang from Australia for 15 years play Australian Rules T man back in Tuscaloosa over mazes head again maze feels it inside the 10 yard line one of the best folks that we have ever seen and Matthew the gunner was down on top so here her me now is AJ McCarron 64 205 pounds first year starter taking over for Greg McElroy went through five interceptions he's going to have to make some plays downfield tonight with his receivers especially Brent we're going to have to try to attack LSU defense through the they opened with Richardson is a voluntary back in member 17yard they moved the tight ends over to the left side play action and the currents going to roll and dump it off that is spelling somebody who figures buried for this offensive lineup for the Crimson Tide a very high percentage throw and here are the fellas were going to be watching Richardson it goes from Pensacola Florida there is smelly from Tuscaloosa hometown young man behind this offensive line the Outland hope he went to Barrett Jones from Germantown Tennessee goes to the Memphis area he's the big left tackle and it's first down in ten play action again first two plays passes first Rita smelly that's for the 29 yard line at random Taylor with the stop for this very talented defense little bit smaller than the Alabama defense up front but keep an eye on blockers and Logan they are the unheralded key and the linebackers they like to get five and six defensive backs out a big first down puts him in jeopardy and this may be the best secondary in all of college football speed speed second dad now inside handoff LSU who the run was coming sooner rather than later the first couple call pile chosen it really what they want to try to do you have an athletic aggressive LSU defense it doesn't respect McCarran in the passing game therefore they are flying to Trent Richardson and flying to the running game Jim McElwain the first couple calls uses some misdirection rolls McCarran away from that scheme and gets them on the air the nickel and dangerous when he steps up on the slot receiver he now edges down at the top here number seven third down Matthew trying to get in he's picked up complete and it's a first down that is Williams a big tight end hurry did a great job of number seven he was trying to get in that time and they were ready for it they get created when they moved Matthew to the nickel but Barrett Jones a left tackle picks him up what was impressive to me is Michael Williams two balls behind him a bit tremendous effort there by Williams the fight to be owned a number one catch the ball and they get across the first down line to pick up the first down first downs in this kind of to effect field position they stay in nickel you can always tell when Matthew moves up to the slot that puts Simon at one of the corners first down in ten incomplete maze was coming across that time and Kevin Miller the middle linebacker picked him up talked about how on first down they've got to throw the ball they've had three first downs they've had three passes on those first downs trying to break tendencies this time LSU gets a little bit of pressure on the care and forces him out of the pocket and to throw the ball before he's ready to LSU expects a running play francois checks back in off the sidelines they give him the extra linebacker McCarron IDs the middleman the micro Becker and they were running and it was read perfectly by john chavis he sent the extra linebacker right on the field what they're able to do is just look at the personnel groupings when they see a certain group and they saw an application couple tight ends come into the game that's why it forced them to be able to put their more base personnel with the three linebackers more physicality to be able to hold up against the run still a pretty good game because it sets up a third and manageable hair for Bama here's the defense of Jim McElwain pulls the freaks six defensive backs are on the field now for LSU Brooks checks in he is third down in hands it off on a running play Richardson tripped up taped at the first down stop the yard short on that play a game where field position is going to be so big tremendous effort by LSU's defense he pending short of the first down and forcing the punt here by Alabama but by Bama picking up the first down again they can affect field position here with a solid punt they'll set the return when Matthews goes back deep that means they want to return against Kody Mandel touchdown to each Avella shus the last two games returning punts Arkansas and Georgia and the SEC Championship big part of this game right here alabanza keep it away from number seven so we'll take a break and when you come back LSU will have the ball again aerial coverage brought to you by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you've got to get DIRECTV the city of New Orleans on a Monday night so we want to compare hunters Herbie Wings pump 59 yards and Alabama's birthday now Hilliard stays in as they go to that pistol formation he's directly behind Jefferson and it was stopped but it looked like they were going to bring option to the wide side of the field prior to snap false start on the offense Alex Hearst six foot six inch right tackle moved a little early stay couple little mistakes here by LSU on this third down snap and now the false score it's the last thing the Jordan Jefferson and the Tigers can afford to do against this Alabama defense they put Randall in a slot they are determined to try and keep the doubleteam off him tonight if they can Beckham is out wide that's bottom of your screen they come back with the freshman running back he is a big boy and Les Miles has called this big boy football and when you go against his Alabama defense you are playing against some big boys now Nick Saban likes to get all his pressure up front with seven does not like to have eight in the box if he can avoid it second down and law there is that option look that we were expecting and Jefferson a little bit sloppy that is a slow developing play by George Jefferson against Alabama I understand running the option get the speed to the edge challenge the size of the Alabama linebackers but if you're going to make the run these line these safeties and corners are up to run support you can see mark fair and early in this game a big factor defending the run very physical and understands his defense as well as anybody but George Jefferson they run option he's got to attack and use his speed so third down and ten in Spencer we're in this is where with the tackle and here's an example torn Jefferson you've got to be able to take their pitchman out of the play watch Courtney Upshaw not only is he forced to pitch then he runs down the line and makes the play on Spencer where the quarterback has to take away the pitchman account for him and then where may have room to be able to get to the edge and be able to pick up the first down so maze will go back deep again and here's that battle Brad wing he could do it rugby style on the move straight away like this boom it and maze will return this from the 25 comes right up the middle quarter 45ft maze bricks wing is there that way he looked like pulled a hamstring or something there did that towards the end of that play almost gave up on the plant went out of bounds and he is a true leader for this team he played in the first matchup with a sprained ankle for his safety hope that's just a cramp we'll take a break but before he limped off Mays game the Crimson Tide a golden opportunity there you can see pulled it up just shy of the 40 and then he steps out about so when we come back Alabama will have the ball on LSU's 26 yard line you the whole state BCS National Championship is brought to you by Allstate played the Allstate championship challenge at Allstate challenge calm gatorade these teams have what it takes on the inside to win do you join the conversation for dr1 and directv if you call yourself a sports fan you've got to get DIRECTV call 1800 DIRECTV wonderful views of the Superdome courtesy of the DirecTV ultimate picture cam so Herbie Alabama with its first golden opportunity nasal go back to the locker room after apparently pulling a hamstring a 49yard return and it gives them up the first golden opportunity of this championship and I'll first down McCarran got time comes in underneath and a sliding catch at the 10yard line by Darius Hanks who must now become the goto God let's see if he gets his knee down before he slides out of bounds tremendous effort like that right knee got down I may take another peek at this but another first intense pass by Alabama breaking tendencies they know they have to throw the ball against this LSU defense when it's more on when they want to throw not now LSU to dictate when they pull the football constantly shifting Titans offensive coordinator Jim Mackel from the pistol Richardson is jumped in the backfield big many Logan was the first man to hit him that loss of maids at this point you see if he's able to come back Alabama fans know with Julio Jones leaving is going to the NFL Mays has become the guy on the outside not just their best playmaker but really the leader you can see his reaction how emotional he is the offense in a young quarterback that really relies on him and his leadership so let's keep an eye on him and his health and whether or not he's able to come back in you're right Hank and Brad smelly have got to be able to pick up the load in the passing game and they bring two tight ends tight to the right side of the formation on second down incomplete it will be third down and Michael Williams was covered that time in the corner of the endzone remember the first matchup when Alabama moved the ball will at times they'd get inside the LSU 40yard line and they were unable to come away with points their first three drives they move the ball and ended up missing three field goals now here they are again in plus territory and this year in this game can it be different are they going to be able to get touchdowns and not settle for fuel boiler parents now they send Richardson out of the back up with kenny bell on hands three receivers to the left McCarron checks to the right take it again hit from behind on the throw and gets it off in time glad smelly makes the catch but the fieldgoal unit I believe is jogging on to the field this has been a kind of a reoccurring theme for Alabama this year when they got into the red zone not just against LSU their struggles in that game but really without a true threat out at wide receiver outside of maze they look at what they've done when it comes to scoring touchdowns they've only been able to convert 58% of the time for touchdowns 23 yard Shelly nails it and that is huge for his confidence he was lethal in the pregame warmup and Alabama takes an early heal goalie this year's AT&amp;T allamerica Player of the Year Robert Griffin the third from Baylor on behalf of AT&amp;T we'd like to congratulate Robert and thank all the college football fans out there who voted the AT&amp;T allamerica Player of the Year determined by the fans and that of course the Baylor quarterback who also won the Heisman Trophy earlier in December a fine young man and believe me a lot of NFL scouts are getting very interested in our g3k posture with the ball on the tee LSU has struggled on offense both times they've had the ball Brianna Claiborne is a terrific kickoff returner fields this one from the 8th great coverage by Bama that the 27 so it has been a tumultuous season for LSU off the field in many ways offense equator Steve Greg cook was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and replaced Russell Shepherd wide receiver suspended Jordan Jefferson Jones were arrested it was a fight in a bar Baton Rouge Jefferson charges were reduced he came back to the team and then of course Matthew where and Simon were also suspended and somehow Les Miles and his coaching staff kept this team together Alfred blue the running back leaping grab by Odell Beckham jr. maybe that will settle Jefferson down Herbie if anything Jordan Jefferson just has not settled into the game they're coming up quickly to the huddle they're coming without it so they're going to go fast now Jordan Jefferson keeps it that's what he can do hurt you on the run you critical of his option ability but when he takes off like that he's a strong and he's got to be able to make a difference when things are covered this Alabama defense will cover down a lot of things and his legs have got to be able to be in create it keep blaze alive this tempo I think has much to do with trying to get him to not think as much and just play the game trying to pick it up and here is on a read and nothing doing and that was Kirk this is what Alabama's defense has learned from the last time they faced LSU and that option they got to play a little bit more cover to which gets a corner up and run support Drake or Patrick as they're able to make a play LSU averaged eight yards a carry in the first matchup when they ran option with Jefferson that time for Patrick's there to make the play Jefferson complete to the 47 yard line and Beckham again it's a big completion because now they get back to where their comfort zone is where they're a little bit closer third and four they need to avoid those third and six plus chances and get to third and three to four nickel coverage on this they drop it off to blue reverse against that defense that time and that was CJ Mosley CJ Mosley had Alfred blue manforman coming out of the backfield and what was amazing is with that hurry up Mosley is just running out of the field and he looks up he's got it for I got it hold some of the balls right there and he's able to make the play out the flat so Alabama little hesitant getting the right personnel and getting the coal in but it didn't backfire on him so Alabama with mays out now faces this first big decision as Brad wing will come in days late to get on the field this time got it off in time and fair catch is signaled at the 10yard line and that was Christian Jones a young freshman receiver who was back as the punt return man so very busy sports rig in the front of yours making all of it just a huge fan RIT lifelong sustained Reds fan very happy for Barry Larkin going into the Hall of Fame welldeserved so up by a field goal AJ McCarron brings Alabama offense back and again they keep the field split and in trouble slips a tackle and it will be incomplete Matthew had the coverage and he was all over Hanks that time but there was pressure from Ryan Baker a linebacker from Florida and interesting that you see Hanks in the backfield and when he releases makes it very easy for Baker there's confusion up front on that offensive line but when Baker came McCarron did a nice job of avoiding the pressure and just being able to get rid of the football there Brandon Gibson one of the family severs right now Eddie Lacy as in as running back there's a penalty flag on this play lacy tried to get the left edge is stopped at the 15 by Kevin mentor but the line judge threw the fly Kendrick Adams the defensive in guilty lSU has made more mistakes yes in Alabama and maize if he can come back is big here for better to be interesting to keep an eye on him as I said is a true leader for this offensive where their best playmakers when it comes to the passing game his prey Kevin Norwood also one of the wide receivers do playaction macaron on the roll going to drop it off too smelly underneath for a first down maker makes a stop and let's check in down below with Tom Rinaldi Brett the training staffs at Berkeley space was considered questionable II obviously just answered that question by coming out of the locker room his left leg has been wrapped a hamstring injury he is expected to attempt to return we'll have to monitor it going forward it martavius mingo harvey just checked in a speed rusher and instead of lining up on the left they've been working him on the right side of this defensive line all week in practice and he'll sit down over there Karin deflected cop on a ricochet and it was caught by Underwood one of the tight ends and this defensive alignment here Mingo because he's so athletic he can sit you can see that he can drop back out into the flat but looks like that time Betty Logan just puts his big hand up there and knock the ball down but what tremendous concentration here by Underwood and when I love with Jim McElwain doing right now is he's moving AJ McCarron around now they have Barrett Jones lined up as a fullback here is showing a lot of different looks 14 plays and 10 passes by Alabama they have broken tendency come back with Laci and he is stopped right at that first down marker and he appears to have moved the chains yes he has for Alabama over load to the right where Barrett Jones their allamerican left tackles lined up as a fullback and moves up to the right side and they overload that right side and again just a different look you have all this time to prepare and Jim McElwain clearly taking advantage of it a lot of different formations and personnel groupings trying to create some confusion for LSU McIlwain loves it unbalanced line now they shift to tight ends over final seconds of the opening quarter here's macaron gonna go deep leapin Tex at the 38 yard line and Norwood the bench made a leaping catch for Bama as the first quarter comes to an end we talked about who's going to step up with maize out and here is Norwood a sophomore only had seven catches on the year tremendous effort to go up and over the honey badger and make a huge play on another playaction pass on first and ten honey badger better care about that one that's 26 yards and this young man's in his own has put a charge into the tide playing with some confidence every which is what he's a lacked in game one enjoying himself first quarters come to an end families hit a field goal with Alabama and LSU world we seen that before folks from sentai believes it and heard what about that first quarter I'm impressed with a chain McCarron and who a Jim McElwain is utilizing him in this passing game they've had a lot of success we talked about before the game first intent is the time we want to attack Ellis here he's five for five on first offense with playaction passes to stores the care and Laci stays in the game play action he's got a wide open smelly and he just overthrows him by a yard he was breaking free on that far side number 17 is a huge part of the game plan but my question is what has happened to Richardson and Brent look at what they're looking at on first and tenth Eddie Lacy's in the game for Trent Richardson a little bit of action there with the reverse there the freshman but all the eyes of the defenders in the backfield and what's happening is these tight ends are slipping behind that coverage in that time he just missed making a huge play again on first and ten Harrison Jones one of those tight ends is off to the right Kenny Bell is number 7 playaction left open takes off and flies to the new yard line so this will put them in a third and manageable very good decision by the young man from Mobile Alabama and because they're mixing up the play calling what has happened is I think LSU has lost some of their aggression and I think the pass protection has been outstanding for McCarron he's had time to evaluate look down into coverage and then here he makes a great decision to pull the ball down instead of throwing it away to pick up some Bible yardage lacy stays in is the running back and her they now shifted to a power formation question from the linebackers and relay si not been a good day wasn't on the field that was Matthew came up to make the stop see it Matthew back here and he's going to get in run support and Brent you're right the first matchup you know Trent Richardson had three touches inside the LSU 40yard line and for whatever reason they in plus territory again and number three is not until I know Cade foster trots in there comes you're 49 it's a fate telepath inside oh it's going to be close it is really going to be close Underwood everybody said why didn't save and pooch punt why didn't he fake Saban was listening it was fourth and four it is going to be so close folks that push the players away bring the chains out that's about as close as you can get Brent Underwood came from the left side Wow Wow Alabama moves the change by Underwood's lined up to the left here he's going to come under the action is this way it's just a little shovel pass LSU a good job on these long field goals after the way the first game went being observant expecting the fake and you might see LSU challenge this call actually under review without them needing to challenge it and that is David Aames he is our replay official he is from the big 12 this is Scott Novak screw so they're going to take a look at this spot there's the shovel pass he broke a tackle from Matthew Matthew could not bring him down Mingo finally did we'll take a break and come back with the decision well it is a first down for Alabama Chris Underwood was able to pick it up by an inch and now AJ McCarron and here comes Trent Richardson he is back on the field for the tie play action to Richardson coming in underneath the Hanks incomplete takes a blow on the play from the linebacker Baker who picked him up here's an adjustment here by John Chambers he's tired in these passes out to the flat he gets his linebacker Baker out there on a burst in ten how many times do they have to see playaction with AJ McCarron rolling out and having either a tight end or receiver out the flat that time great job of seeing what the call and Baker that time using acceleration to dislodge the football we get reports that Mays has gone back to the locker room intrude on a punt return second down and ten here is a handoff to Richardson and he stopped at the 25yard line live Matthew Hammond has got to be able to get points when they get into plus territory it was a big big story their first matchup in Tuscaloosa 21 plays inside 240 only four yards in tonight been 11 plays 33 yards it come away with a field goal but let's see if that courageous call by Alabama we have fake Hill goings have given them a chance to get points here third and seven Gibson or out to the right as a wide receiver goes quickly incomplete and it is fourth down and messy with coverage for LSU interesting they look for the matchup and they go for Norwood who made the big play earlier against time in Matthew he's very very physical at the line of scrimmage climbing there McCarron trying to get the ball out of his hands and I'm sure some of the Alabama fans are saying what about pass interference tight coverage by Matthew there now Shelley is on the field for a 42 yarder he put Alabama head are you dumping clock that excites the LSU crowd lockers the big defensive tackle get to hand on it great left hand by number 90 those two defensive tackles Logan 93 rockers 90 they've been underrated all year long you the allstate BCS National Championship who's brought you buddy dr. pepper tell the world what makes you one of a kind with the IMA hashtag on Twitter Taco Bell think outside the bun Tostitos Tostitos knows how to party and Bud Light it's the sure sign of a good time here we go my pants were celebrated at a party at the Bud Light Hotel this weekend getting geared up for tonight's big game and so far we the LSU offense hasn't done much although Jordan Jefferson has completed his first four passes Jordan Jefferson only first down at a game today was a scramble here again another miscue here by LSU Nick's saving at the end that drive when they settle for a field goal their kicker ends up missing it after everything happened the first game Nick Saban here comes over to them and addresses it Tom Rinaldi is standing right there you can see em in the background actually said he coached statement went over and say hey we believe in you we're going to come back to you're our guy I love to see a coach role in the game reinforce the confidence than he is team having it that's a third penalty against LSU here's Beckham they try to set a screen and nothing doing as Minzy the corner that Juan Minzy came up and made a fine blood their arguments that this may be one of the best defenses of all time in college football this Alabama group you think they need help you think first and 15 is the way to try to attack Alabama now their second long and you get behind the chains against this defense they're going to get very creative and that's when they can get very very aggressive with their blitz pressure Randall's in the slot to the right Jefferson looks in that direction juggled and he hangs on to it made a mine juggling pitch to the 29 yard line with that I'll tell you what that was almost a big play for Alabama Donte Hightower here in the sig abuse the DirecTV ultimate picture cam he jumps the route almost got his left hand on it almost a step away from being able to step in front of that and take it into the end zone for a touchdown now Spencer where replaces Kenny Hilliard in the backfield he's number 11 for the Tigers Jefferson is back in the gun it's 3rd and 7th Randall back in that slot again Jefferson looks in that direction comes in underneath and in come using where as a receiver out of the backfield and again LSU cannot mount a drive against Alabama it's also interesting that Alabama brought for that in blitz they didn't bring pressure forcing Jordan Jefferson to read zone defenses which sometimes for a quarterback can be a lot tougher than being able to see the coverage in mantoman all right he's back for his second return as we told you he's the question wide receiver Christian Jones Brad wing standing at the LSU 14 yard line low and drops it at about the 25yard line so Alabama will have the ball and McCarran in the early going is 9 of 15 for 92 yards ille next win at his left field is spread to the right Richardson with his first reception coming out of the back field out of bounds to the 30yard line Alabama looked like they might have a chance to put points on the board in their last Drive it was a big play here again first and ten play action giving McCarran time gets him away from the pressure Norwood went up and over Matthew to make the play here's the big field goal backside little shovel pass to Chris Underwood and then the field goal attempt which was blocked and it's interesting BAM has gotten down to the LSU six yard line and the LSU 25yard line and they have three points sound familiar yes it does and Chavez checks in with three linebackers on this second down and six here's Richardson hit in the backfield for a loss that time Mingo lightningquick defensive end he uses quickness here and just is able to attack the gap watch how he just shoots down DJ fluke for the right tackle can't deal with that speed in fact the right guard that time McCullough also I make surprised by the slant the movement of this LSU defensive line John Chavis at time guessing right planted the deal I'm the speed there amid the and he keeps three linebacker John does not go to the nickel beeps Matthew outside on the corner forced out of the pocket fire is complete Hank's got the first down at the 37 yard line he picked up number 15 and AJ McCarron continues to impress for the passing game his third down john chavis dials up some pressure of his own in fact Kiki Mingo drops back in coverage like a linebacker from his defensive in position watch Hanks not came up on this his quarterbacks fine a little time little robber out there not only catches the ball but deals with Eric Green who makes a big hit there to try to dislodge that football but right there's the young man that has got to step up with more mark Cui's maids down Darius Hanks the seniors got to be able to make Richardson around the right side finds a hole and steps into into the 43yard on on that first down Adams and that's a good first down run for Bama watch Norwood and smelly sustain their blocks 87 and 17 not only they lock on and Adams does a good job Kendrick Adams 94 does a good job to fight away from Chris Underwood but that's a very big key in this game for Alabama they thought in the first matchup they weren't able to lock on in sustained blocks and it affected the running game now Simon checks in so there are five defensive back go to the slot receiver on this second down he's looking at Hank one Richardson against the dick to midfield I love William play host centered at six one three hundred pounds he played so much football for this football team he and Barrett Jones a left tackle who won the Outland this year are the real leaders up there but maybe the most talented man up brought his chance for Mack the left guard just a great group of linemen now toss Jones is back as a linebacker that will bring Simon back out and Matthew will go back to corner first down and ten Clayborne up in bumpandrun and so is matthew trying to get linebacker pressure they can't smell a comes underneath and well sniffed out by McIlwain he read what Chavis was up to that time and it's for the 45yard i can't say enough about AJ McCarron I know Alabama is not putting points up on the board but he's seeing this defense right now the 44 days of preparation has allowed him some fans upset maybe thinking about a late hit here but he's seeing the coverage and getting the ball out of his hands quickly seems to just have a presence about and tonight that we didn't see in that first matchup Oh suck it down the delay Richardson got daylight 14:35 going to be run out of bounds Eric Reid coming over but he saw the daylight no one outside to the left like toy yard Brent you're exactly right it's the vision watch the tight in here Underwood again he made the big block earlier on this Drive this time he locks up with T key Mingo pushes into the inside and when you're on the backside of a run with Trent Richardson your blocks on the backside because of his vision is just as important on the play side Hank's is in the backfield right next to the quarterback that offensive line giving McCarran throw too tight coverage incomplete that time coming over which Hatcher the middle linebacker give you an idea of how Alabama's dominated this game they have ten first downs to LSU's one so far it's interesting that in the first game and I thought it would be different the second game Trent Richardson when Elliot when Alabama gets into plus territory goes out of the game and he's by far their best playmaker and he's not injured he just goes out of the game lacy comes in and this is an offense that has struggled in plus territory without Trent Richardson in the lining delay was lasik spins to the left and matches inside on a his best of the night to the 16 yard line and Claiborne cleans it up bit of a risk here by LSU they brought the house a lot of pressure they brought their linebackers and that's going to be feast or famine you're either going to make a play in the backfield or if the backs able to be able to get around him there's a lot of room to run a good job of picking up the blocks up front and pushing Ryan Baker out outside and then how about the spin move here by lacy blockers and Logan check back into the middle of that defensive front for LSU on this third and short lacy the running back smelly the tight lacy is written down short of the first down and Drucker's makes another impact right after he checks back into the game you and I both love these inside guys Brokers is involved here love this shot here but watch Kiki Mingo he's known as it's a pass rush expert but this time gets involved in run support this time he beats the block and the big tight end Underwood and gets him ball to push Eddie Lacy back so Nick Sabin coming right back with Jeremy Shelley ball will be put down at the 24 yard line remember now McCarran is the holder this would be a 34 yard field goal they have fake groin earlier nails this one here we go again Alabama up by a pair of field goals in the BCS championship we welcome me back to the 2012 allstate BCS National Championship game Alabama six LSU does it you know Herbie down the stretch with LSU they had a tendency to fall back in the first half and then come on and yo it turned around Matthews punt return touchdown and until we see something differently whether it's a punt return a kickoff return a turnover a sack something to spark LSU to get their fans into the game remember Alabama in their last two games against Georgia Southern and Auburn they gave up kickoff returns for touchdowns so if LSU wants to maybe try to do something maybe they get a big return here to get this crowd going gets the momentum back miss Foster's kickoff and here is Claiborne he took a big win back against West Virginia in a 27 21 game does a great job of not letting him get outside and he's brought down at the 21 yard line so here are the LSU possessions doing nothing offensively three three and outs in the one time the Jordan Jefferson scrambled to keep a tribe alive they picked up a first down but still they ended up money so here we are midway through the second quarter and they've got one first down it just reminds me a lot of the SEC championship game when Tyra Matthew had to give them a spark by having a big punt return for a touchdown we've got a nice oh look as poplin the 280 pound fullback checks in the freshman hillier they're determined to get hill you're going there is picks up a coupling is that fierce fierce Alabama front as good as any you will see they did everything in that game back in November except win and yes that counts but this is a fabulous front seven these guys when you see them on the hoofer vu and I requested I said wow it looks like they could be playing the New Orleans Saints on Saturday night and by playing a three for those defensive linemen don't necessarily make a lot of plays as far as tackles but they consume the linemen and allow those four linebackers to run around and make all the tackles Jefferson checks with a sideline for a change in a signal LSU searching for a play something big to happen they roll Jefferson to the right he's going to hoof it outofbounds Beckham was the target as he rolled right he got checked in that zone coverage and was trying to sit down and Jefferson had committed to the run but that was just outstanding coverage Jefferson's looking in to this defense and he's trying to find somebody to get it to Beckham 33 he's locked up there there's nobody open eventually Jordan Jefferson tries to make something happen there to try to pick up a yard or two one of the tight ends were 88 Spencer where the better receiving running backs are very deep at that possession but so far Jordan Jefferson has been confused quarterback draw steps out and it stopped the line judge prior to the ball being snapped I'm out LSU first charge in the first half in 30second timeout so LSU burns a timeout here with 244 to go you know her bad the easy thing to say is maybe we should see Jared Lee but you know that's that's not always what you want in this situation Jefferson's a better athlete than what we've seen here so far yeah and I think it's a little bit premature number of the game in Atlanta when they played George and they couldn't get anything going offensively they had a big punt return and after that not only was it a punt return for a touchdown but it seemed to get Jordan Jefferson and it got him some momentum there a player two away from this team gaining some confidence I know it's much tougher to do against Alabama if I'm looking at LSU one thing they've got to be able to do is take some shots downfield try to get aggressive with your play calling and give Jordan Jefferson out on the edge where he has the ability to run or a trove you've got to do something to slow down the aggressiveness of Alabama's defense since Surrey is the free safety for Alabama on this series we're down at law back in centerfield terrific special teams players son of an Alabama assistant coach Rose stamp Jefferson picked it up nope they are forced to punt so they burn a timeout they come up with another sloppy play and it continues and this is coming out of a timeout the clocks down to play clocks down to three two one torn Jefferson's looking off to his right he gives it the leg leg kick but as he's fielding the snap he's actually looking at the Alabama defense so I drops the ball it's like see his eyes peek up his eyes look up because he sends his pressure and by taking his eye off the boy just drops it on the ground another miscue did BAM is forcing on LSU is offense that's the foot three and out Brad wing hangs it up in the air Jones fair catch signal and the 22 Matthew the gunner in on top of him as we take a look at tonight's Taco Bell touchdown spotlight back in 2010 folks we're going to show you naca roids much down stella family against LSU Julio Jones there's one problem Julio Jones is in Atlanta Greg McElroy with the Jets they're not coming out of that locker room this Alabama team has got to do it right now I think AJ McCarron is playing pretty good football tonight like I said he just looks to be the two quarterbacks the quarterback has been able to get off to a faster start and I think it's affected his confidence in the offenses confidence despite not having mark Wiens Mays in the lineup they've done a great job of mixing up their personnel groupings and mixing up playaction pass on first and 10 moving the pocket rolling him around they've just done a lot to slow down LSU Richardson you saw the picture check back in first down drops off the screen pass to his running back and he's down at the 30yard line so McCarran you certainly heard you pointed out you cannot fault anything he's done tonight 13 to 24 a hundred and seventeen yards the quarterback comparison Jordan Jefferson's relatives may want to look away right now and it's not pretty LSU has 17 yards if you look at the rushing yards to go along with the 26 passing yards that's not going to get it done Richardson short of the first down everyone expects that this is Richardson's last game with the Crimson Tide that he will declare that he's going to the National Football League he's raised a couple of daughters or I should say helped raise it they're back with the mama back home in Pensacola he's going to father since his high school days don't Walker Award winner this year third down and two it's a shot he's got the first now he has a tremendous base he is so hard for one man to bring him down and it missed the flies hurting me why they don't use him down in the red zone they've been moving the football and it looks like they're going to go hurry up themselves they've been moving the football getting into LSU territory and you're right he has been checking out of the lineup first down not going to go airborne again tried to tropica smelly at this time LSU has made an adjustment and they came hard with Brandon Taylor the safety that time the Fox winding down Nick Saban ends up calling the timeout remember Alabama does get the ball to start the second half so right now they're just trying to fight to get into field goal range but AJ McCarron without having Mayes is not going to be able to get into field goal range by dumping it down underneath there Brad smelling well coming up on the Buick halftime report Chris Fowler Gene Chizik and Chip Kelly will break down the first half I don't remember our friendship Kelly taking the Michael James out at critical time when they got close to the goal line will Knox know I mean it's a mystery here it really is not to mention that they've struggled in the last game and in this game tonight they again they've gotten down to the six yard line the 25 yard line and then the last drive 17 yard line and despite having those opportunities they're not putting the ball into the end zone they've come away with just six points LSU was one play away from making something happen and getting right back into the game and capturing some momentum and that's what they did against Arkansas giorgia the SEC Championship you can't leave them in the game when you got a chance second in 12 for the time Matthew is picked up coming on a blitz and it's complete to the 45yard line and that is Norwood again good job of Trent Richardson picking up the Blitz blitz by Matthew Bama trying to hurry this up here clock is moving after that first down turned in underneath with a completion to the 41 yard line Simon makes the stop on Williams the tide in Bama with two timeouts and use 21 seconds they used one nick saban trying to help out making some timeout calls here from the sideline Bama very impressive with Norwood and what he's been able to do here and make it a few catches that a couple catches for 46 yards trent richardson picked up honey badger coming off the left edge to give McCarran a little bit more time long as you see where he's coming gives you a chance there McCarran steps up into the pocket to make that throw that one of the great nicknames we've had in college football a long time number seven the honey badger with that dyed blond hair he he didn't know what it was so to coach John Chambers got that YouTube and it showed him what a honey badger does over there in Africa honey badger don't care and Matthew now he loves it there's tshirts all over New Orleans and Baton Rouge check it out and six now Safety's are deep for LSU McCarron on the move throws on the one to the sideline that is a great catch over there and stops the clock across the 30yard line they come back again to Norwood Kevin Norwood with another opportunity to sophomore is making some plays how about AJ McCarron keeping the play alive getting away from pressure day he's a better athlete than I think people realize it's six five six for 205 pounds he had a great smile on his face after practice the other day and he said you know I just got to enjoy myself more I've got to turn it loose and that's what we've seen here than I 17 to 24 here comes the Blitz picked up AJ throws to Hanks trying to break a tackle from Matthew and he keeps going to the 23 six seconds on that clock big statement already called the timeout with four seconds he's looking at where the ball is spotted and how far this field goal is going to be tell you something that that's an impressive Drive just to get into field goal range here playing off of Hanks and they'll tell you that he's their best route runners matched up there with Tyrann Mathieu not only does he make the catch but he fights with Mathieu to pick up every yard that he can to help these poor field goal kickers out from Alabama and not giving up on that play and you saw Sabin on the headset they're making a decision as to who to use here you know a long field goals has been Cade Foster but Shelley was impressive in pregame warmups and he's going to trot out now he has hit the two here tonight for Bama keep in mind that McCarran is the quarterback and holder four seconds remaining it will get put down on the becomes a 42 yarder for Jeremy Shelley laces were spun beautifully and he puts him up 53 field goal Oh AJ McCarron talking about emotion seeing him run off the field first half he is without a doubt the MVP is that effort by playing quarterback and as you said spinning the laces hair to give his kicker Shelley a chance so here's time to know with coach down on the field Tom thanks very much Nick you've dominated the first half offensively how do you translate that into touchdowns in the red zone well we've got to do a better job and score more points I mean it's a good football team they play good in the second half they play very well as a team so we're going to have to continue to do a good job defensively but we need to score some touchdowns here thanks very much Nick appreciate it let's go over to Aaron Tom gain so much lesser offense just not in slicking how do you get them going in the second half we got to make our best calls you know I'd say it's interesting we had Cades issues bumbled staff I mean every possible mistake was made it's got to happen at this point this we got I'm going to chuck that you got to go to you know those things that we came here to do all right thanks so much Brent halftime of the 2012 Allstate BCS National Championship Alabama leads it by three field goals right back for the Buick halftime report Chris Fowler movie regeneration coming out February 16 30 years being calm music as we walked me back to the second alley all state BCS National Championship the statistics tell the story and for LSU they are flat ugly they have not been able to even cross midfield as you take a look at our numbers right now with Bama leading by three field goals here I'd say LSU should be very grateful that their defense is played well enough to keep them in the game I mean Bama hits the field goal there at the end they have to make it a twopossession game with nine points but it could be a lot worse considering how bad LSU's offense looked in the first half but less miles I'm in there at halftime and say fellas we're 13 know for a reason we've been in these situations we look awful in Atlanta in the SEC Championship we turned it around and third score 35 straight in the second half against Georgia we can find a way to do it again but in order to do that Les Miles need somebody from his defense to make a play to give Jordan Jefferson in this offense a short field to work with give him some confidence and try to get the momentum back meanwhile Marquis Mays the senior from Birmingham has apparently played his last game for the tide pull the hamstring returning a punt actually that set up their first field goal and the man very distraught on the sidelines about his inability to come back on the field with his teammates emotional guy great leader for the time from deep in the end zone 30 by Young Christian Jones who has replaced Mays as the ACE return man and so Jones the freshman gives them a charger to start the second half interesting to see how LSU tried to slow down this offense AJ McCarron they took 18 first downs in the first half 18 snaps 16 of the 18 or passes and they rolled him out with playaction a lot of times to take advantage of that aggressive LSU defense got him outside dump it out in the flat let's see what they can do to try to contain him and come after them a little bit more to try to create those turnover opportunities Richardson opens the second half and smelling flex over to the right side of the offensive line then McCarran off first down has been a Florida night over the honey badger to Hanks Darius Hanks who has become the goto guy and they burned number seven on the first play from scrimmage 419 and great timing and rhythm between McCarran and Hanks the ball is out of his hand by the time Hank's made the cut to the outside and they're actually going after Matthew and man coverage now that slip screen to the outside and Bell catches an ally and Bill in a footrace is an imam ere agree chasing him and the young man takes it all the way into the red zone right now for vampire print watch Hanks on his clock on Tyrann Mathieu to get him to the corner right there nice job with a catch in a play the next play Hanks comes up with a big block to Spring Bell lose down the right sideline good effort there again by tanks 23 when he stepped out of my a little bit shy of what I had originally thought and Richardson on the field right now here in the second half does get the first carry so perhaps they were using lacy to give him a little bit of a blow here for the second half but he's staying on the field this time keep him on the field you get into plus territory he's your difference maker Alabama there with a little bit of hurry up maybe to try to slow down LSU you would think would want to come out aggressively but they got on their heels in a hurry after that great throw by AJ McCarron first down has bugged the tide against LSU second down and 10 wide open Hanks and he is to the 18 yard line before he's brought down my mentor the linebacker good job of bringing Hank star moving him around now here he is in the backfield they slip him out linebacker comes quick throw to the outside you got a linebacker out there trying to deal with a wide receiver out the flat so Jim McElwain after this game will become the head coach at Colorado State is upstairs dialing in plays there is Jim young man from Missoula on a central high school quarterback Eastern Washington and he likes what he sees with McCarran drawing deflected and that was a chance for Eric Reid to pick it off but he couldn't quite get there once the ball is deflected like that against the secondary it's a real jump ball it's tight windows Brent great effort that time again by penny Logan and knock that ball away Reid you're right almost comes up with that big play but give LSU and their defensive creditor give it up yards but they're not giving up touchdown so Jeremy Shelley 35 yards this time slides it through from the right hand Jeremy Shelley 12 LSU nothing this telecast is presented on ESPN 3d by Vizio well here's the seasonending award that's the coach's trophy presented by Dr Pepper in Alabama trying to come back and if things their only setback of the season hold that tiger look out the skies today is that honey badger but he hasn't fooled the crews entire LSU bench looking very dejected and concerned at Jordan Jefferson hope he realizes the importance of his Drive getting the ball to start the second half for the LSU offense at Claybourne ever dangerous but Alabama has done a great job of holding their lanes or seen him back to the middle breaks out at the 20 yard line and he is down at the 24 terrific coverage and a reminder Wednesday night he has been as an NBA doubleheader featuring some of the biggest names in the sport will start at Wednesday night seventhirty mavericks into something's that's at 8:00 p.m. they'll tip it off that'll be fall about it eatin the Clippers a lot of interesting at clipper team this year unlike Alabama success in the first half on first down LSU was kind of the opposite into the spectrum six first downs only thirteen yards of total offense put him in on a second and third long situation that's going to change LSU has been all over the map offensively they haven't identified at all what they want to do here against this tide defense they'll roll on first down Beckham is open and they take it into him that gun was wide open that time this is what we talked about Brent taking a few shots downfield against the Crimson Tide defense and being aggressive the freshman here a little bit of a double move he gets behind Kirkpatrick but Lester sitting back there and cover to is in that area we supposed to take out a wide receiver but I'll tell you what the angle that he took there if Beckham was able to undercut that and hold on to the football he might have been able to escape Western get to the end zone that Alabama defense licking its chops they've got LSU in second and 10 just what they wanted going to fire again back they've got it this time they hook up and Lester did not get there on Beckham and that gives the LSU bench a spark for the first time a little life down there some applause and big completion for 19yard LSU trying to attack right into this window right here for Patrick's gonna slide up Lester gets back it provides a nice window right here there were they're going to try to throw the football and the fact that he didn't get anybody to slow him down for Patrick with his eyes and the inside of the offense made it pretty easy and that was a nice throw that time by Jordan Jefferson for Patrick pushes of the line and now they come back with a running boy and makes a stop for the tide at the 45yard line so it's going to be second down but again Alabama's defense winning first down here against LSU now Kenny Hilliard the freshman there have been four running back youth by the Tigers Spencer where Michael Ford Alfred blue and Kenny Hillier earlier the figure of the backs Jefferson's in trouble brought down sack by court a Upshaw one of the top one a top outside linebacker defensive ends in the SEC and maybe the country 41 comes from the backside the right tackle Alex Hirst did not even look out one guy you have to account for when you throw the football is number 41 and he gives you an idea how much speed he has coming off the edge there 265 now Sunseri will come in as one of the safeties and that market fair enough and support so it is now and Jefferson in trouble on the move and he is out of bounds and this will force LSU to punt well short of the first down but a sack by Upshaw foot LSU and that third and long they're against against Alabama that's not going to go well there now oh four six on third downs remember they have a freshman Christian Jones is back there there comes Brad wing even the government American football until just a few years ago in the high school in Baton Rouge 15 years an Australian Rules player Jones from the 10 and he is hit the Gunnar Brooks down on top of him in a hurry there a late penalty flag came flying at the 10yard line let's see if the tackle was up too high he called a fair catch I guess is what the signal is down below that he did signal for a fair catch and Brooks didn't realize it that's a personal foul obviously Oh like less miles in the LSU bench saying that it wasn't so clear that he called the fair catch he's discussing with the officials downstairs it clearly moved his right arm planta 30 outside no question about that we'll be right back the allstate BCS National Championship is brought to you by Allstate the only car insurance with a claimed satisfaction guarantee Discover card it pays to switch it pays to discover Chevrolet and their awardwinning cars trucks and crossovers and AT&amp;T an official sponsor of the Bowl Championship Series Preservation Hall you like jazz you love that location in New Orleans Rogers ready who is in our booth the national coordinator of officials said that that was a legal fair catch signal and it should have been respected so it is first down in 10 AJ McCarron and Alabama nup five four field goals McCarron going to go deep clock at the 49 yard line Kevin Norwood again has stepped up huge tonight he did it in the first half when Mays went down and it continues in the second half a post corner the ball is thrown perfectly by AJ McCarron I tell you he's getting very comfortable with that route throwing it early and putting it right over the shoulder the receiver away from the defender to make some big plays for this offense 24 yards for the sophomore from Mississippi they continue to throw the football in first intent against mantoman coverage McIlwain has been strong on first down all night long and he's not stopping now McCarran rolls throws deep downfield and Hanks was open on the sidelines and he overthrew it they couldn't connect Hanks broke free and AJ spotted him but they couldn't connect GIMP eyes a little bit more time and Brent you're right the defense because of the time that the Karen was able to pick up with the scramble they just lost it they lost him in coverage he snuck behind Simon there and he's got right down the sideline he was all alone honey badger comes off the bench to come back on the field and they've got him as a nickle man he's looking at Hanks at the bottom of your screen number Southern Cross coverage here second down and 10 that's exactly what AJ McCarron sees that mantoman coverage by the Deacon's they'll run against it with Richardson is jumped for a loss so this will be third down and long and so far the defense of LSU is holding after that big first down catch by Kevin Norwood where they like LSU likes to bring in Ron whoops Ron brookson Tyrann Mathieu off the edges have had a lot of success bringing pressure and blitzing and hitting the quarterbacks and creating pressure and a lot of times creating for over third down and up over to smelly Alabama is forced to punt so the pressure was coming that time from Simon off the left side Simon was coming in on macaron macaron read it saw him coming it's smelly there but they're going to have to punt the ball LSU defense gets the stop get the ball back to LSU you start to think about this if you're an LSU fan watching at home Jordan Jefferson is in a funk so far in this game do they start to think about Jarrett Lee are they going to ride it all the way with George Jefferson here's the first thing that thinking about can the honey badger give him a punt return and he ignite this team he's standing back on the ten Mandel is the punter will they even get him a chance to catch and hits same player that's Kirkpatrick had the coverage he was the gunner and had he stayed on the other side of the goal line he might have stopped it inside the five honey badger did a good job that time of singling for the fair catch late Kirkpatrick loses it he was so intent on number seven and it will come out to the 20 Estevan alone three espn3 D brought to you by Visio fans are here at the Bud Light viewing party in New Orleans experienced in the latest technology firsthand and speaking of fans many who are not here have taken to Bourbon Street as you see a shot of that famous Street here in New Orleans from the Royal Sonesta Hotel down in the French Quarter and for some the party already is underway JC Copeland and now Michael Ford will try it Jordan Jefferson stays in at quarterback and here comes the option here is for quick not get to the and that was jorel Harris the linebacker well Jordan Jefferson is struggling on this option it's a big part of their offense in the first matchup watch how he pitches off a Harris 5 and then Harris goes out and makes the play when you're attacking a defensive end or outside linebackers make him completely commit to you there's no way he can you can pitch off of a man and then he runs down the line and makes the play on the back completely disrupts the timing in the rhythm of the option attack this great defense dominating first down Spencer we're coming in need a dozen to get to the first down marker Jefferson intersections thrown away a horrible mistake Mosley's got it Bama is in business again while tremendous play here and again LSU in Jordan Jefferson he just throws the ball up just trying to shovel pass here as he started to scramble he starts to panic he has time to make a throw there's we're helping out then he's kind of sneaks out where thinks he's going to take off and run with it just kind of flips it and Mosley the big injury there Jefferson just thought where would stay with and where started the block mostly makes the play for the big interception so Mosley receiving medical treatment here the only good thing that Jefferson did on that play was it was a strong tackle but that's a horrible mistake so we'll take a break Alabama is in business on the LSU 27 yard line aerial coverage brought to you by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you got to get Direct TV but CJ mostly has been carted off the field in serife ik terrific young player young linebacker and last year is a consensus freshman allamerican he has a wonderful future we hope he's going to be okay so now the second Alabama drive to start inside the 30 of LSU remember that punt return by Mayes and what's ironic is that on both the plays that set up this field position key players were injured Mays has not returned after the punt return now Mosley after the interception is forced to leave the field and it will be AJ McCarron this time handy to Richardson lost the art gave it up on that particular play a rare run on first and ten for Nick Saban in a tied offense got to catch him by surprise that time and gave a brown Les Miles has got to be thinking now do I go to Jarrett Lee or do I stick with Jordan Jefferson yes we said that a little earlier it's interesting the crowd here they're trying to get involved helping Les Miles make that decision with each errantly chance and he's actually such a hormone to loosen up for the first time that we've seen Morgan and here is Richardson banged out of bounds on the near side at about the 24 yard I struck a look big picture you have 618 to go in the third quarter you down well this is obviously another situation where LSU has to rely on their defense they cannot give up a touchdown here you hold them to a field goal attempt even if they make it there's gently stretching out even if they make the field goal in a 15 still a two possession game absolutely with the twopoint conversion and seven now here we go needs to reach the 17yard on return fires and miscommunication incomplete and here comes the oneman scoring gang for this game mr. Shelly Jeremy Shelly is a junior from Raleigh North Carolina talk about a young man is having a redemptive night that 42 yarder he missed if you want where this was blocked by alignment 23 was the first one to put him ahead they've never been behind this one from the left hash here comes up 41 mrs. to the right now LSU very much in the thick of things here if if they can mount any kind of offense against the number one defense in the country he hits it good he just pushes it to the right an LSU defense yet again makes the stops and forces the field goal to get the ball back to this Tigers offense you know we've not seen a spark of energy from LSU on this side of the ball since maybe the pregame the team is running around with confidence in Jordan Jefferson ends up coming out and boos from the crowd LSU has not crossed midfield Hilliard checks in with Ford so Hillary will be to pull back prick pitch the Beckham on the outside and Beckham to the 27 and Harris making another stop defense can run quick throw a young receiver the outside and not only in dealing with cornerbacks and safeties but the linebackers and defensive linemen are running to help and pursue LSU has got to continue to be aggressive trying to attack the Alabama secondary with some quick throws by Jordan Jefferson family shows Blitzen bucks out of it Oh Randall shook off Kirkpatrick and then he is thrown down at the 26 yard line they want to throw the screen on the other side and luster here's the view from our DirecTV ultimate picture cam does the quick throw unfortunate thing is right now I don't that Alabama doesn't feel threatened with a vertical passing game from George Jefferson they're squeezing down on these shorter throws Kirkpatrick is there in a hurry Randall was lucky he held on to the football Heather were down and eight coming up and LSU is old for six on third downs over six where is a running back stop at the 17yard on the tide Roland Chitra in on the quarterback Gordon Jefferson a bit rattled here third down he's got to think I got to get the ball out of my hands in a hurry bulk to his left there he actually had a receiver breaking three if he would have been ready to get rid of the football Kade Ron Boone from the left coming over to the right if he would have thrown that ball in time he had a chance at least to get a shot at a first down Spencer where could not pick him up with the block and Gentry just continued to power in now Jones is back deep for Bama not want to wings better punch from in the middle Jones still on his feet and he's to the 47yard I'm a freshman where some fine returns also picked up a personal foul penalty we remind you that Super Tuesday presented by KFC begins this week on ESPN speaking to the sec Georgia Florida will be the opening game followed by the big tan Ohio State and Illinois outstanding deal condition for the Crimson Tide see if they could take advantage of it here lacy will be the running back for the tide 59 yards of offense tonight for LSU 306 for Alabama lacy breaks for the second level first down run still moving a pile that was some run by Eddie Lacy the sophomore and he just would not be stopped and Alabama has got a first down at the 36 how nice is it to bring in your backup tailback to give you this kind of effort looks like he's down LSU just trying to strip the ball and by trying to strip the ball you're not you're not going to make a tackle he just keeps moving at his legs it picks up that first down tremendous effort lacy akin to the middle and again he's breaking to the second level this time 25 for another first down backtoback tremendous power runs by lacy you wonder if the way this game is going is starting to take an effect on the LSU defense's psyche he breaks through that potential arm tackle by Anthony Johnson the true freshman defensive tackle had a shot at him but he runs right through the arms back one again maybe fatigue mental and physical fatigue potentially setting in on LSU Gibson flanks out to the right now they bring smelly over to the left side of the form and they'll come again with Lacey can't get the corner can be thrown for a loss on that play Mingo made the stop for the Tigers negative yardage on first down they were able to set the edge that time they did not give any lacy to corner Busch came back to the inside when the ski the LSU defense was able to corral it they've been moving AJ McCarron when he has thrown the football a lot of bootleg a lot of naked moving away from potential pressure from LSU Richardson is now the Alabama running back he's a fine receiver Norwood has been big tonight playaction McCarran fires middle to the wine and complete is being waved off by the field judge peel judge came quickly up Gibson was the intended receiver when a huge play Derek Reed made in the first matchup between these teams in this time he is able to dislodge this football and I think it comes down right towards the end right before he gets to the ground the impact from Reed on Gibson he's able to separate him from that ball scott gains the field judge when the big 12 was right there and Eric Reid may have been shaken up a little bit Eric Reid made the biggest play of this football season now he comes up with another one as Herbert okay here's your third down and ten and a timeout is called by Alabama and AJ McCarron's not happy about it 30second timeout so we're going to take you back to the play that Herbie mentioned Tuscaloosa on November 5th maze from the Wildcat fires the Williams but it was Reed who took it away on the oneyard line for the interception now Herbie tell everybody why it was there it's amazing Brandon Gibson runs the wrong route to bring him over to play he comes off with mantoman coverage on Gibson the ball thrown by Mays is fluttering he has time to be able to adjust back and be able to make the play in a year for the Tigers defense Canaan who knows about sand I have it this could end up being again there's Gibson involved into play reads they're able to get him away from that football was a big big hit there by Eric Reed and the tide faces a third down and 10 Richardson stays on the field would been a target will come to the slot on the light ten smelly goes for that side in trouble shakes it McCarron dives and here comes that man Jeremy Shelley again so impressed with AJ McCarron you this year is the first year starter taking over from Greg McElroy you waited for the moment that he might have look at this effort here where he might just grow up and this team starts to become his tonight is the first time I've watched him play all year where he just seems to be able to come up with answers and this may not seem like a huge play but the fact he was able to scramble up there and get a few yards gives them again a chance here for another field goal attempt so here is a 45 yarder a little bit out of his comfort zone at times officially say it's a 44yard Irma Karen puts it down for him and he bangs on it got it a 44 yarder for Jeremy Shelley that's a careerlong a careerlong puts bama up 50 nothing and now the heat is really on LSU talk about how when you're you're a kicker I think it has so much to do with your mindset and your confidence and right now with all these kicks that Shelly's been able to make I think he's approaching these kicks with a different edge about him and a different approach as he gets a chance and Nick Saban has worked so hard on these kickers in their preparation after what happened in the first matchup and trying to keep them confident I'm going to go to you hit earlier with Kate Foster tonight and Shelly's been able to step up and make some plays for him well he took over to an allamerican lead Tiffany and certainly Shelley has handled most of the field goals for coach save it inside the 40 but tonight coach had confidence in him and he steps up big for Alabama and it's 15 nothing right now Kate Foster will put the ball on the tee I want you to watch this coverage by this Alabama kickoff team they have swallowed Claiborne so far tonight he's back there with Ron Brooks this is a well coached football team from Tuscaloosa so here's Claiborne from a yard deep trying to get a left return nothing doing down at the 21 yard line Sunseri was a devil coming down from right three was right there this ladies and gentlemen has been the year of the field goal kicker so many missed opportunities Bama missed four in that first game on they lost Boise State on a plate for a national championship for Oklahoma State how about Oregon's missed then Stanford the other night in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl and Virginia Tech missing one right here English Allstate Sugar Bowl Kenny Hilliard we'll try it with where still no change at quarterback even though the Baton Rouge natives are growing restless tires low and it is completely with the 29yard on Daniel Oh Peterson's first catch of the night but checking down below at Tom Rinaldi Tom well Brent after that fuel goal was successfully maintained Jamie Cameron the quarterback and the holder on their field goals limped off the field he's being treated medically his right leg being rubbed down right now we'll have to keep an eye on that as we head into the fourth quarter he's telling everybody that he's all right there Tom on the bench but we will nick saban went right up to him as he came off one quarter left for Jordan Jefferson the sands at time running out in New Orleans welcome back to the 2012 allstate BCS National Championship with Kirk Herbstreit Tom Rinaldi and Erin Andrews I'm Brent Musburger another field goal battle but this time Alabama has all five of them LSU can't get across midfield being stoned by this Alabama defense which has yielded only 8.8 points a game best of the decade and they're closing in on another one helmets come flying against this defense it's amazing Alabama leads in total defense rush defense pass defense past efficiency D third down defense it is incredible when you watch these players two years ago they had an outstanding defense led by Orlando MacLean last year they had a lot of talent but they were young Nick Saban this year using the experience you could see the year I have to know is their defense allowed nine touchdowns on the season then Clemson gave up more than that mr. bowl game the other night third down and one furgus check in for LSU growing a short man it wasn't easy the freshmen lined up the big back and LSU had been old of seven on third now no five ever and all the years of watching LSU football ever seen an LSU team is lifeless is this football team Alabama has just come after them and taken look at it through the attitudes you've never seen LSU look like this Michael Cordes stays in as the LSU running back battles his way to the 36 yard line picking up maybe four yards on that first down run let's check it out with Erin Andrews Erin Murphy just to add and Brent on your comment about LSU looking like the coaches were urging them to get some sort of energy down here Alfred glue the running back Jefferson on the roll and he's going to step out of bounds short of that first down they have just taken everything away from LSU tonight Alabama is not giving him a thing tuck they're playing like the 50yard lines the goal line they still have a cross xx that 50 yard line either just incredible the way they took advantage of these 44 days per be smart the defensive coordinator Nick Saban up to this point there's nothing that LSU can do to try to move the football Kirby smart he's going to be the next one to leave no saben staff down the road he's a great young coach and nothing doing Copland the fullback Jim curry again he's blown up the middle of that offensive front you know all the names like Josh Chapman and Jesse Williams Damien square let's say a guy that has been able to make as many plays for this Alabama front is Nick Gentry the senior sister grinders a defensive lineman uses his leverage in his hands net time slipped right by the guard on a short third down Tim near mile SUV where the Mad Hatter if Alabama doesn't show a good defensive front on this play Brad wing is fully capable of taking off but there's a couple of linebackers back there and they don't give it to him so here comes Jones over an out of bounds what a good pair of hands for return man it'll be Alabama ball at the 17 Nick Saban closing in on a third national championship aerial coverage brought to you by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you've got to get DIRECTV and the DirecTV mobile studio has depleted its drive to the national championship live shots coverage of both teams all week long look forward again soon on campuses across the country DirecTV mobile studio is fired up for spring football in April first down at 10 Trent Richardson the running back AJ McCarron hands and the Sabin gang goes to work on the clock OHA McCarran tonight has done a lot of things that under Center is a quarterback but tonight the state look at tonight's good hands play rocky by Allstate is him as a holder he's at five different occasions where he's out there trying to make sure kickers are so finicky Jeremy Shelly wants that perfect hold and he's been able to provide that for him so McCarran getting it done on special teams as a holder and obviously leading his team as a quarterback second and eight working on the clock with Richardson you know never has there been a shutout in a BCS bowl game much less a BCS title game the closest we came was Oklahoma jumping Florida State thirteen and Miami did defeat Nebraska at a national title game back in 92 they have not let the Tigers across midfield here tonight this is one of the great defensive performances of all time seven quarters these two teams have battled this year not a single touchdown yet McCarron mentor all over him at the 10yard line LSU brought pressure and it frees up men are seen outside both the outside linebackers came Richardson was occupied because of pressure Barrow also came but men are the one who gets home and this is where LSU typically can make something happen that's that they didn't get the mobility of math you can give a big return they got a shot to cross midfield on this part Matthew is standing back on the LSU 43 toady Mandel the sophomore kicks it over to the left side takes an Alabama bounce honey badger picks up dangerously honey badger affair at that time the time that was kirkpatrick the gunner who got down they've been working kirkpatrick as the gunner all week long and this is what they wanted a piece of the honey badger here the tide honey badger played the old days easiest national championship is brought to you by Allstate play the Allstate championship challenge at Allstate challenge calm Taco Bell think outside the bun Mesa proud partner of the Heisman Trophy and Vizio delivering entertainment freedom for all let's the Voodoo spiritual temple established in 1995 priestess Miriam they've got any quick vibrations for this LSU offense which is gone no further than the 47 Richardson over there on the Alabama sideline right now Spencer where is the running back and it comes where he pangs to the 40 so they're within 10 yards of midfield trying to get there a lot of people look at this LSU offense they haven't been to midfield you think why not make a quarterback change why isn't Jarrett Lee in there to try to get my spark well Jarrett Lee has had his chances in his career couple starts against Alabama look at those last two numbers one touchdown in seven interceptions mine had a lot to do with why he's still to sideline they're counting on Jordan Jefferson only 915 remaining Jefferson no first down it will be third down fairly manageable this time as the priest comes up not only are the ones making tackles mostly of course is out but now the twos the threes are chipping in for coach Nick Saban what a fabulous job he has done along with Kirby smart we were to practice or be save it never took his eye off the defense never even looked at one snap offensively lift it up to knock away Stanley and now is the pullback and here comes Hilliard here comes power looking for that first down look for anything good to happen toss play pillion freshmen bust through keeps going getting at the 15 tonne just show them my goodness give me somebody to excel about a promise touchdowns tonight look at this for field goal well third and short it's just a battle in the trenches there power play follows willowford around there to pick up the first down and go with their power back Kenny Hillier is able to give them the first time and that's not going to get them on the board 18 touchdowns they got to get the ball downfield becomes pusher picked up Jefferson forced to take off 4540 puts up the middle and down to the 31 yard line and that's the most penetrating offense that the Tigers have had 17 yards first time I've seen George Jefferson run aggressively they brought both the linebackers ecoat Johnson time say Hightower once he escaped them he recognized a huge void in the middle of the defense and look how he didn't hesitate he just took off first time he's done it all game so across the 50 for the first time today bull 32 yard line running the option didn't run it decisively pitched to the man who stretched out of bounds all year you've seen Jordan Jefferson run the option from the shotgun well tonight he's run son from under center here's our view from the DirecTV ultimate picture cam again he attacked Harris when Harris is involved in being able to make the tackle also a great shot by feet Daquan Minzy getting off the block attempt that time by Reuben Randle to get involved as well option has not worked for LSU tonight spencer where he's the money back second down and 13 for the Tigers Henry flag comes out splits appalled start another mistake you know the Alabama has played this game without one ten to six has not been one penalty called against the Crimson Tide here in this football game tonight this is a very special defensive performance and we cannot overlook McCarran going 23 for 30 for the only hasn't done is stick into the end zone he lost his goto receiver back in the early part of this game and very efficient offense not been able to punch it in but they still have been able to get into pretty good field goal range but the defense is good spin a huge story obviously what they've been able to do to George Jefferson Jefferson back in complete and Jeffersons complaining that his receiver was pulled out on the play with Brennan's a tremendous effort actually by Nick century the back up nose guard who was in there watch him get around the block he gets a hand there on Spencer where good sir we're behind the line of scrimmage they're trying to set up the screen and gently try and snips it out there third down from the 40yard obviously having the offensive ooh so on third down Jefferson wings it deep incomplete pressure was coming again young Sunseri was on the field the past was that Jarvis Landry the freshman since aerial at the left edge a true freshman when high school football last year as a linebacker he gets the pressure on Jordan Jefferson he would have had a little bit more time he had his own true freshman Jarvis Landry oneonone against Minzy and he had a step one and just didn't have enough time to make the accurate throw some Sarah's brother at quarterback at Pittsburgh fourth down fourth down in that could be a fumble Hightower got in on him Dante Hightower ripped it loose that's a fumble turn it over look at the time celebrating now 615 of 15 dominating with this defense this is a mulling folks of Mali number 31 of the great linebackers you play along I'm in the National Football League cryptic loose a teammate falls on it I believe it was Gentry who's had a whale of a game who's able to get his body over on the football for dick Simon we welcome you back to the 2012 allstate BCS National Championship Alabama closing in on the first shutout in any BCS bowl including the championship game and the young man Gentry fill on that bundle there's Dante Hightower he was a lot finalist this year simply one of the great allaround football players on this Alabama team and a gentleman off 1st down and 10 Richardson on a bit of a delay you can appreciate this Dante Hightower plays the middle linebacker but on third down situations they'll move him the defensive end now what he does here at Alex Hurst is instead of coming out wide he actually fights him to the inside I think he catches the right tackle by surprise with his suddenness and how quick he moved to the inside and then look how he keeps after he knocks the ball away he fights to keep Jordan Jefferson away from the football to give Gentry enough time to pounce on the football for the turnover there is the young man sitting on the bench very versatile defensive end I'm back are versatile linebackers employing the defensive in on third downs which will help him at the next level that versatility want to remind everybody to stay tuned for the fourth VCS postgame show immediately following tonight's game so second down Alabama working on the clock now leading by 15 points Karen rolling hard to the left take it himself dive forward so we're caring on that sideline he's been a bundle of energy that I watched the defense flow everybody thinks they're killing a clock Trent Richardson is going to get it they're going to run the bootleg look at AJ McCarron with the wheels and the presence of mind to stay inbounds this is going to be a run all the way he got to the corner got around Sam Montgomery picked up the first down and in stayed inbounds was showing again an athletic ability that I think may be surprising some people tonight for AJ McCarron only a sophomore now they come back he stays inbounds too so well coach they're agreed making the stop in the youngsters who have stepped up big there are the sophomores and you can see that they all lost in the BCS National Championship game but AJ McCarron can break that streak he could become the first sophomore freshman to win the BCS Championship he is within five minutes the Andrew white one of the wide receivers is now out to the right should not go in calling the plays hammering away at the clock right now and Richardson breaks prey on the sidelines end zone a touchdown between these two the eighth order of warfare which and LSU and Bama scores on a 34 yard touchdown run by the Doak Walker Award winner print Richardson who broke a lot of imageless record back in Pensacola Florida and he surely will head for the National Football League next Seder right but easy shellay hits the right upright no good when have a missed extra point that was touchdown with him stop somebody's gonna see this for tomorrow take other three touchdown scored there is Ingram of course Richardson backed him up for a couple of years eyes over the left side of the offensive line you off the ball seal the edge and number three finally gets to the outside with some Running Room Hey there are a lot of LSU fans headed for Bourbon Street as you look from the balcony of the Royal Sonesta Hotel over in the quarter there are all kinds of empty seats they do not want to see the awarding of the trophy to one of their arch rivals beckham is back deep with brooks so they'll give Beckham a chance on this kickoff return and we'll see if Li cleans up this game last appearance for books which they returned mint that's on back to the touchdown Trent Richardson is able to get some great blocks on the left side they just covered everybody up from the LSU defense to division to bounce this outside and follow the blocking Michael Williams to tie it in kind of sealed the edge on the block against the Barrow but this is classic Trent Richardson feeling bouncing get to the outside and then you got the speed to be able to take it into the end zone Alfred blue will be Jordan Jeffersons honey back so it will be Jefferson who will take it home here for LSU down by three touchdowns and it will be second down and ten Alabama is known for how they pressure how they blitz you they've done some blitzing on third down but for the most part Brent it's just that the front four from Alabama just getting pressure and beating LSU's offensive lineman up let's take you back to Pasadena two years ago Marcel Darius drove Colt McCoy out of the game with an injury in the first quarter Bama won the national championship tonight they've made Jordan Jefferson basically invisible in this game as Dante Hightower comes up with the play on Spencer where so another awesome defensive performance against an opposing quarterback by the Crimson Tide outstanding defense combined with very poor offensive play and quarterback play from LSU LSU has not been aggressive offensively you thought it might change from the first matchup to this game but George Jefferson insisted not that 19yard hightower again number 30 this time they did bring the pressure this time they get him to third down and long they decide to dial it up and put the heat on him which is what they're known for the offensive line I want to put this all in Jordan Jefferson the offensive line especially on third downs just kidding overmatched upfront physically and at times in that case just getting lost on who to pick up because of how complicated Alabama's coverage can be and how their blitz packages watch out Christian Jones we'd like to turn it loose here on Brad wing generally fly you saw the movement on that side even the kicking game has gone sour on LSU if I went out of bounds at the 46 yard line offside on the defensive 91 fiveyard penalty replay fourth down that's the first penalty of the night and Nick Saban was not happy about it the perfectionist leading 21nothing 258 head the ball near the middle of the field villa perhaps crushed the clock and instead they've got to do it again and give wing the second chance 24/7 football coach Jones lady on but he worse this one this one was worse than the previous part post a midfield I'm only a 27yard punt back in 1931 the tide shut out Washington State 1963 Orange Bowl blanked Oklahoma now they're closing in a BCS Championship and the second in three years for Nick Saban and you've got to wonder have they finally found the coach that can make them forget the bear now I will never forget the bear one of the greatest of all times how much fun we had hanging around with him our folks a great gravelly voice let me love this it comes Lacey now working on the clock Eric Reid makes the stop you know Alabama will be without an offensive coordinator as soon as this game ends as Raja McIlwain will head to Fort Collins he'll be the next coach at Colorado State the rumors are that grunt peas will be leading Boise State as their offensive coordinator but guess what there's a tug of war between Florida and Alabama for pieces services Brent Pease was once the offensive coordinator at Montana he also knows Saban from his days as a backup quarterback with the Houston Oilers when Nick was an assistant on that staff my agent on line two on that one for brim piece it's a pretty good tugofwar difficult now is that true as he Norbury and it will be third down they got the clock down to the final two minutes and it just seems inevitable now and you know we've got a couple of minutes I want to say something to all the fans in Tuscaloosa you've suffered a great deal back in April a tornado ripped through there were deaths great destruction this football team came together helped a lot of people in that town but I daresay this is for you this one on behalf a segment of the players is going to be for the great folks in Tuscaloosa handoff to Lacey clock continues to run what a night not a single turnover only one penalty that came on a punt here tonight they have completely dominated this game they have held LSU to under a hundred yards of offense they have 381 and what is it about Alabama for the third straight year that trophy is going back twice with the tide and of course last year with Auburn amazing it's amazing to think about the legend of Nick Saban and how it just continues to grow after the championship two years ago what this defense was able to do tonight to lead them to yet another national championship for the Crimson Tide on fourth down remember last time of the championship and hit him over the head and they tried to get the water let's see if he told them be careful this time fellas Alabama gets a second chance and makes the most of it they win the BCS championship behind coach Nick Saban and quarterback AJ McCarron if it hadn't been so decisive you wouldn't wonder if the Associated Press would vote LSU number one but after what they've seen here tonight there is no way that anybody can vote a team better than what we looked at with the Crimson Tide look at Nick down there with the middle of it hey Johnny enjoys the bath this year two years ago he tried to keep mark labbett look at that recipe let's go down now to Tom Rinaldi thanks very much before I get to the defensive duck for the performance you saw the Gatorade shower this time you reacted a little differently what to do I loved it I loved it how would you describe the effort of your defense in this game well I think it was a great team win I think our defense did a great job I'll tell you what our offense control the momentum in the tempo of this game from start to finish job on specialty got you great team would here every fan we have every supporter in our program this is great for Alabama what was the difference in AJ McCarron tonight well you know AJ wasn't quite himself in the first game and you know we knew that he was going to happen play well because we knew first down a lot and he did a fantastic down in this game has shown great leadership and poise when making good decisions when you lost November 5th the light of your players credited the way you had walked a little not locker room and the message that you delivered to them what did you say that night that helped this night be possible milk I told the guys I said we got to finish things right that's our character that's what we do and if we do it right we may get another opportunity and if we get another opportunity let's make sure we're going all the things every day that we're going to be able to take advantage on I know it's about the program and the players I know you love them but for you first coach students three nine titles in the PCs era what is that what does that mean to you but you know what right now I'm just so happy for our players and our team and my family and all of our fans and the University of Alabama that you know it really isn't about me it's about all those folks it's a lot bigger than that LSU's got a great team they've got a great team and it really kind of too bad that there's two great teams in our league this year and in the same year but finally Nick I know Tuscaloosa has been through a great deal you and your team have been very involved it's just a football game in a victory but what message do you hope to send to that town tonight well I think it gives everybody a lot of joy and spirit and hope you know that we're going to continue to work and move forward and try to help people restore lives in our community but things like this make everybody happy and give them a lot of hope they congratulations a great win Aaron Tom thanks so much I'm here with linebacker Courtney Upshaw is putting on that national championship hat Tide defense shutting out LSU what was the difference in the rematch tonight with their offense this long on a run we knew they would come in and try to run the ball and talked of the team but I got to say we are killing it all 50 of them today and I morning how are you guys able to get so much pressure tonight on Jordan Jefferson well we actually didn't really called any met too many blessings we just you know we got his love and when we called mush Russia tried to contain him in he sit down a cup of time but once we got the opportunity together we got him so that's what we did the stephen said in the first game there was a lot of mental lapses and that's why you weren't successful what was the focus this time around just to go out and execute especially on that option we basically stop dodging all night once they tried to running it that was a big key to the game Trent Richardson said in the first press conference this week this team had a chip on their shoulder because many people felt like they shouldn't be here how's that shoulder feeling it feels real good and we knew that a lot of people in the state that's to be in this game or didn't want us here and thought the LSU's is going to run the ball down our throats there's no defense and we don't want to come out of Institute and I'm just happy I don't care what nobody says I'm happy I'm gonna try to be a part of them let's celebrate with your teammates congratulations right over to you all right Aaron thank you so much you have to go back to 2002 before you can find an LSU team shutout and guess who did it November 16 2002 Alabama 31 to nothing so we will come back and award the trophy to Alabama the bcs national champion with a Ford postgame show and the presentation presented by Dr Pepper right after this you
