and the pleasant good evening everyone welcome to college football tonight on ESPN three Brock bowling alongside Wayne Gandy and the theme of tonight's game is the potent and uptempo Arkansas State offense against the dominating defense of Utah State should be a good ball game Wayne how do you like the matchup well Friday night in flow the Arkansas State Red Wolves has to make some plays down the field only problem with that this Utah State defense loves to get his hands on the ball 22 in interceptions over the last 13 games is going to be tough sledding well we start with Arkansas State and that offense is led by quarterback Freddie Knightly number 9 the junior he's a good dual threat quarterback yeah when you watch him he's without Michael Bourn he's had to lead the team in rushing he's also had to make plays but the key to this offense tonight is getting the ball and Jady Jady look has its hands and give him two more reps whether it's in the air or handing it off however you can get DePaul get it to him and as for that Utah State defense it's been dominating all year and it's anchored by a linebacker number 53 Zac vigil he's the reigning Mountain West Conference Defensive Player of the Week vigil vigil pitch well you're gonna hear that all night whether exact or his brother Nick Pisa he was a heck of a player all over the field last week interception touchdown shows you the speed he can make hits he's all over the field from rush the passer great linebacker alright so coming up its Utah State and Arkansas State here in Jonesboro will come back with the opening kickoff in just a moment you're watching college football on ESPN 3 hey we're back in Jonesboro Arkansas Centennial Bank Stadium week number four of the college football season as the Utah State Aggies take on the home team the Arkansas State Red Wolves brought bowling alongside former Auburn Tiger offensive lineman Wayne dandy Utah State head coach Matt Wells in his second season at the helm of Utah State also played here in the early to mid 90s graduated from Utah State and also served as an assistant coach for a couple of years before taking over the head coaching job last season and tonight a little warm and breezy but still a nice night for football 89 degrees at kickoff time tonight little breeze from the Southwest and clear skies a good night for seven intra conference football action this evening there's Blake Anderson in his first season as the head man at Arkansas State he was born in Jonesboro moved away as a young child and now he's come full circle back as the head man at Arkansas State v different head coach Wayne in as many seasons here at ASU the bad news they keep losing on their coaches but the good news is every year Arkansas State just keeps on winning yeah this program is used to turnover that used to winning coach Anderson is glad to be back home as we spoke to him this week because he knows his team here it's hard to beat he's finally got an opponent that he feels like these people and talent we've been on the road to Tennessee been on the road to Miami has some struggles there but tonight he really expects to win this game earlier I asked Blake Anderson if he feels any added pressure due to the success of the last three oneanddone coaches at Arkansas State he said that really is bad that the program had success the last three years of those different head coaches but he wants Arkansas state to be better the day he's done coaching whatever that is here at VSU than he was when they first when he first got here and he wants to build a monster here at Arkansas State there you see the five head coaches in five years Steve Roberts was there nine years got fired q freeze one year went to Ole Miss Gus Malzahn oneanddone went to Auburn Brian harson last year he went back to his alma mater at Boise State and now the Blake Anderson era 44 year old head coach Blake Anderson here at Arkansas State and will he be the guy to start the trend over not being one and done here at ASU well as you look at that list Brock you see a lot of those coaches have left and gone to bigtime programs but coach Anderson has no fear of coming here and staying this is his home roots he's just here to win Arkansas State will receive the football first and Utah State pick it up here in Jonesboro Utah State two and one Arkansas state one and two there's Darryl Rawlins Davis he is a fast and furious kickoff return guy he had a lot of kick returns last week in the loss at Miami both teams have played Tennessee this year early in the season and both teams lost to the volunteers in weeks one and two respectively and Jake Thompson boots it away for Utah State returnable for Daryl Rawlins Davis at the goal line and he's taken down at the six 16 and a half yard line that's where Arkansas State will have its first possession of the game first and 10 at the 17 early on here Brock I really look for Arkansas State to get this tempo going when you're going against a team like this Utah State defense that really likes to make you onedimensional as coach will Hills talked about you're really gonna have to get this tempo going and try to get some success on first down there is Freddie night in the junior quarterback he'll run this uptempo offense Arkansas State likes to get in about 80 snaps a game and likes to also snap the football with no less than 15 seconds to go on the play clock leaves deep the intended receiver was trash he's seen this at a pass interference on Utah State right out the passcodes offensive coordinator with Coach would walk bail starting with a little trickery going for the home run had to receive a kind of under throw him right there by night he was under pressure but right here we seem like we have a pass interference on bronze that's interference defense number 21 15yard the previous spot automatic first down it was basically thrown into triple coverage and Brian sweet to the guilty party with that pass interference right there a little handoff the Johnston white he flips it back oh it's obvious pass interference right there by we first down Arkansas State they hand it off to Johnson White no it's a fake handoff and night in on the run goes and finds a receiver that's cut by Trent Houston down the right sideline but a penalty flag on the play back at the 37 usually on plays like this probably have offensive linemen downfield thinking the quarterback is going to scramble and run rockets telephone offensive line especially when you have a running quarterback like Friday night you you think let me get out in front of and make a block and then next thing you know he pulls up great throw by him but offensive lineman downfield I assume you've been guilty attitude yes so now second first down in 15 the little flip to the a back JD mckissick and he's wrestled down strong safety Frankie Sutera number 46 and there's the offensive starters for Arkansas State tonight veteran group up front with Clark mondegreen Wright and Jackson on the offensive line get the rest of the backs and receivers here in just a moment on second down little quick flip over that Brandon box the corner inside Utah State Territory to the 49yard line LT for the young gap push to method ions but it's a first down for ASU Johnson white a muchneeded run right here we when you look at this Arkansas State defense on the offense they want to start with the run they haven't had a lot of success with that excuse me Brendan cops right there showing the speed ran out of real estate big gain and a fresh set of downs for ASU trying to snap a 2game losing skin and Nitin finds the backup feedback Brandon parks again he gains nine yards down at the 40yard line brings up second down and one for the Red Wolves and ASU using both sides of the field early on in this Drive you can see real quick how Arkansas State is trying to keep the tempo going Utah State defense is not really sure where the cold right now how Arkansas State often keeping the pressure on about getting the place in and out there you see the defensive lineup for Utah State over the middle pass from Nitin in complete looking for Dijon Paschal one of the wide receivers for this Arkansas State Club brings after second down and 10 we run that threefour defense as Utah State does you have bigger linemen up front so that tempo really can wear them out you already see they are already moving in and out line up this is freshman Brandon finer and he gets the first down across the 40 down to the 40 the 38 yard line tackled by John Taylor backup defensive end for knee tossed and look here they go just as soon as the ball is spotted they want to play as fast as the officials a let him its first down in ten my turn to the right platform McKissack or has now cut a ball in 30 consecutive games for Arkansas State he's pushed out by free safety Bryan's sweet nice loelai here by night great being able to pull the ball on the run delivered a good pass that JT Mackenzie could catch and get upfield when we talked to coach Anderson this week he said he needed this tempo because he knows he can't just line up and run the ball against this Utah State defense and Brandon Piner again going back against the grain and he's tackled inside the 20 down to the 19 yard line Frankie Sutera the strong safety once again on the stop for Utah State Rock as you can see that Utah State D line already having to us you're in a new group this tempo seems to already be bothering this team at least on the defensive front nitin quick throw vines tres houston lost the football is he down or was it a fumble they say fumble Arkansas state and Utah State has recovered as we talked about in the open as Utah State defense known for causing known for causing turnovers nice play here by fretting nitin press Houston is having a great year for this Arkansas State offense ball out the young they chill on the play knocking the ball out that's the younger brother of Zach Nick Mitchell number 41 they say he has more godgiven ability than his brother Zach vigil but Zach is the reigning Mountain West Conference Defensive Player of the Week for the first time in this game Utah State at the football hunters sharp on the end around and he's close to a first down had to get to the 29 for the first down he got nine to the 28 another sharp at a Palmdale California junior college transfer from Antelope Valley College in California his cousin is Derek Johnson linebacker for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs there is Darell Garretson starting quarterback replacing the injured Chuckie Keeton is out with a knee injury but this is not Garrett's ins first rodeo six at one last year as a starter when Chuckie Keeton went out for the seasonending injury in 2013 and his pass is padded incomplete as Chris Odom number 93 got his paws up there knocked it down and it quickly brings up third down the Utah State offensive line Kevin wimpy one of the strongest men on the team fill from foul also up there in the offensive line Houston Cutler sharp and Matson for the five star wide receivers there for Utah State is able to use a lot in different situations here tonight third down and one Eric garrison is not that dual threat that Chucky key usually brings of his office tosit confidence coach has all the confidence in the world in him here's Jojo Nance at first down and more inside Arkansas State Territory and finally forced out of bounds at the 41 yard line he needed one he got about 19 and why not have confidence when you have players like Jojo messing around you great handoff great speed to the outside smaller player a lot of speed very elusive watching him all night long building and making plays for this offense Utah State yeah last week he had 78 yards receiving against Wake Forest and had 49 yards rushing 143 allpurpose yards combined last week at Atlanta against Wake Forest Garretson quick throw it's cut by Ronald Butler he gets helicopters helicopter spun down pike who Shawn Lee the linebacker number 48 of Arkansas State the PSU defense a young defensive line the oldest one is Dexter black many as a lot of experience there are the linebackers Charleston Gurley a threat in the linebacking core and then a veteran defensive backfield with brown hunter and injured Tryon Kishan beyond that last play reminding us brought that he's one of the top linebackers in the country as well big hit by question lead and carrots and finds Hayden whicker's he gets the first down eight steady Eddy receiver for Utah State hits the first down brings up 1st down and 10 my strong throws right there by garrison out to the outside it seemed to be early on trying to use the short quick pass instead of trying to run the ball very effective so far it looks like they Reece pot the football so it's now second down in one not first and 10 second down Wells takes a timeout head coach for Utah State and we'll take it with him 956 to go opening quarter no score here in Jonesboro his score here in Jonesboro 9:56 to go in the opening quarter third down and lessening our to go for Utah State one hunch tries to go up the middle of second effort not going to get there looks like he's joy it brings up fourth down and short for Utah State EJ Sutton along with Chuck's Oda nice penetration by the defensive front of Arkansas state number one thing that kills the run is penetration by the D line as you can see no movement upfront by Utah State offensive line bigtime play big big big stop right there on third down injured Arkansas State player looks like that's Javon Roland Joan's no it's money hunter money hunter starting safety the sign of Detroit Tigers outfielder Torii Hunter of Major League Baseball and Torii Hunter a native our kanzen grew up in the Pine Bluff area and money hunter shaken up having to be assisted off the field limping a little bit on one of his legs Torii Hunter a great outfielder used to running into that wall I'm quite sure he's passed on some of that toughness to his son hopefully he's okay walking on it just a little bit gingerly hope he can get back in this early a little later the Arkansas state looking to snap a twogame losing skid and thought about please try and do it here at Centennial Bank Stadium ASU 42 9 and this stadium since 2005 unless in yard Utah State going to go for it to give to Rashad hi stopped working so state holds as Andrew Tryon and Xavier Woodson come over and stuff to play and Arkansas State tips over on downs sorry on and Woodson once again penetration by this defensive front Dexter Blackman in the backfield and that's what you want we'll be trying to stop fourth in 1/4 and 2 penetration by the D line big play by this Arkansas State defense so Utah State's defense forcing a turnover and then Arkansas State's defense getting the ball back to the offense on downs Freddy night and coming back onto the field the 511 189 junior out of Little Rock he was a backup for two seasons and considered transferring try to figure out his role here with the team but he stuck with it and he is now the starter for this offense this year on first down night they're gonna go deep down the sideline ball broken up an incomplete Daniel gray able to knock it away from the intended receiver perc remains just great coverage here by Utah State really nowhere to go with the ball that he had great time start walking first now couldn't find anybody open night and tried to make the play down the field gently right there the offside personal foul roughing the passer on Freddie tonight so they moved the ball up to the 48 yard line fresh set of downs for ASU and they give it to mckissick no they fake it to McKissack and Eichmann keeps it himself what a disguise that big handoff so well and that's it's got to be very frustrating for the Utah State defense does imagine a vehicle meet you in the cameraman up here by Utah State a great play by them right there on defense and 19 is sacked in the backfield he goes down as Devin sinners wraps him up for a loss down to the 41 yard line and here's the look at the previous play strong safety blitz off the end Utah State defense is adjusting to the short rollout for Devin Center 22 tackles on the season two sacks right there another sack great to see strong safety when he can make a play in the backfield like that for loss third sack of the season for Devin sinners and now third down and 17 for Arkansas State nights and has time ask to dance out of trouble throws on the rod pass broken up nearly intercepted it's incomplete to Zac Mitchell right there in the middle linebacker number 53 broke it up and Arkansas State has to punt it away brings up fourth down coach Wales talked about making a team onedimensional for the season 28% Utah State is on third down right there great coverage just nowhere to go with the ball he's looking for Friday night looking downfield couldn't find anybody almost came up made a bad mistake throwing the ball in the middle field that late and Luke Ferguson who also serves as the place kicker for this team bounces it out of bounds inside the 20 who can get away from Joe Johnson is very dangerous in Utah State he will have it inside the 2747 ago 1st quarter still no score in Jonesboro this tradition families can score a touchdown Ptah state back at the field with the football there is quarterback Darell Garretson that name might sound familiar gonna should because his grandfather is also named Darell Garretson the former NBA referee and his uncle is a current NBA referee Ron Garretson you gotta wonder if maybe those relatives gave him some tips on what he can and can't should and should not say to officials to try and court the officials a little bit during a game and Garretson and that's his second touchdown reception of the season Derrick s taking the snap through Center automatically knew where he was going hunter shocks showing you great speed on this nine route it's just the goalie just ran by number 10 Octus Brown touchdown big play something that does Utah State Office leads when you have this kind of defense you can take that kind of gamble and go for the big play and Nick Diaz on for the extra point he has 99 career PA tees made and now make it 100 career points after touchdown successfully achieved in his Utah State a geeky R and one in Dunn goes Utah State a one plays 71 yard drive hunter sharp makes it seven to nothing Utah State strikes first on Darell Garretson 71 yard touchdown pass to Hunter sharp to make it seven to nothing when you watch this play you see Darell Garretson hole his head in the middle holding his safety so he can't get over on this goround and just shows you how strong a bomb he does have hit him right into the hands touch down does it go round Brock showing the speed by a shark JD McKissack back to receive this kickoff from Utah State Jake Thompson number 36 will do the honors for the Aggies Utah State out of Logan Utah been there before it's very beautiful they beat Wake Forest last week 36 24 now trying to get a road win here in Jonesboro Arkansas as McKissack will take it out from the goal he's finally wrestled out of bounds near the 30 last play Adair garrison hunter Sharpe is something that Miami did well against Arkansas State last week and something that Coach Anderson is talking about trying to eliminate the big play and felt like that's what really did his defense in last week I'm quite sure he's not happy with that so Utah State's defense back onto the field which has now forced eight turnovers in his last nine quarters including one earlier in this first quarter here tonight on first and ten night here comes the pressure and down he goes sacked for a fiveyard loss back to the 25yard line as Zach vigil the reigning Memphis Conference Defensive Player of the Week takes him down visual vigil we said at the beginning of the telecast he's coming from everywhere he can sack the ball he can intercept because all around the kind of got it coach well says you you can have marry your daughter in the interview last week yeah he spoke very highly of both Mitchell brothers and there's a pass to Tyler trove scene suddenly used wide receiver as he steps out of bounds at the 31 there's a look at the Aggie defense now make it beat Turley turnovers they've forced in the last three games 22 picks in the last 13 games look at that force 54 turnovers in his last 26 games overall and three defensive scores already this year that is tied for best in the FBS with UCLA finds it open receiver and beside Pascal has the first down past the Florida he's pushed out by Daniel gray left corner gonna bring up first down and ten for ASU two reasons that you can get those kind of numbers with this Utah State defense one is they stopped the run early on right there Fred Knight taking the hit delivering the ball consistently C in this passing game is what's going to prevail for Arkansas State today so at what was once a temple offense now slowing down a little bit for this particular play for Arkansas State on first and ten Brandon Cox goes down not much there in fact he lost yardage about a six yard loss back to the 36 yard line once again Devin centers up the field nobody's respecting Freddie Knight and right there on the fake gang tackled by Utah State that's why they're the top one of the top rush defenses in the country like myself that's Brandon Byner here's Nitin on the playaction down the side looking for trails you said no please Taemin Davis with tremendous coverage might have gotten limits in face guarding no flag pass incomplete brings up third down in law babies running step for step with Luke Ferguson the key to this is that Davis got his head around ball could have been high out of balance right there that's what we're after we could have seen that if it's uncatchable going out of bounds and that's why he didn't fall flat get the Johnston white and on third and 17 they just run the football on the right edge and white gonna get to that seven yards to the 44 and out comes the kicking team for Arkansas State your Aggie fan one thing you must love about your defense is how many people around the ball the ball carrier when he's running right there about five Aggies on defense making that tackle it's hard tough sledding to run against a team would that kind of pursuit to the ball fair catch signal by Jojo natsot out to the 23 yard line that's where Utah State will take over first down and 10 we invite you to share your comments photos and final score predictions on Twitter follow along tonight's game with hashtag USU versus AR st Utah states off its back onto the field it struck first on its last possession of oneplay 71 yard drive a bomb from quarterback Darell Garretson to hunter sharp and that's so far the difference in the game Garretson on playaction finds that man hunter sharp who had the touchdown grab a moment ago and a drive ago and he dances his way to the 31 yard line pushed out of bounds by Artest Brown of ASU a Joe Hill being out of the lineup today nice fake by garrison quick release the thing that you have to love about him is his accuracy delivering the ball where the receiver can catch it and do something after the catch and Jojo Nansen one of the leading rushers on the team despite being a wide receiver not much of the game they're pushed out by Xavier would sit number 55 with ASU brings up third down and short 57 150 pounds Jojo Matson leading the team in rushing and receiving yards you think a little guy like that can't be tough enough to handle the duties but he's done a great job so far in the first four games for Utah State from its own 32 yard line third down and two begin to Rashad Hall and Hall is very close very close to the first down marker had to get to the 33 maybe the 33 and a half yard line it'll depend on the spot it looks like he'll be a little bit short brings up fourth down and one his Arkansas State deep fence once again third is short penetration by the D front by Sun Lee that's that guy again predicted to be the top linebacker in the Sun Belt Conference making a play I don't think you gotta go there's Matt wells apparently does not like the spot we talked to him earlier this week nice nice young man he's one of the younger coaches in the FBS played at Utah State four assistant go to Utah State now the head man and he's back short one inch short brings up fourth down an inch people lead to the Provo brah they always say football is a game of inches this personifies it one hits barely too big look you can't give arkansas state a chance to stop you right here taking a big gamble by Utah State in this offense Matt wells also a former assistant coach in the d1 ranks at Navy Tulsa New Mexico and Louisville how about this fourthdan an inch going to go for it or they could be trying to draw Arkansas State offsides we'll see what happens they go for it and they get the first down Rashaad haul off left guard lowers that shoulder he gets the first down to the 35 yard line gutsy call here on fourth and an inch in this play is all set over those because you have the kind of defense that Utah State has you can take Gamble's like this left side of the lines is coming down taking anybody that crosses their face hard run right there by Rashad Hall getting those shoulders swearing upfield this is a running game that is a little bit banged up right now Joe Hill not out there tonight he put an ankle in the last game here's a quick throw from carrots in over 2a Devante Robinson and he fights his way for six yards Devante Robinson at a Delray Beach Florida brings up second down in three tackled by Andrew Tryon of ASU to make up for that lack of running game as you spoke of you can see them already in this game throwing a lot of short pass it's kind of similar to what Arkansas State did in their first drive gain of seven officially so second down and three derrickson over the middle through its lumpy behind hunter sharp and he couldn't hang on it's incomplete he was trying for that slant route and through it just a little bit behind him and he couldn't hang on trying to get it in for sharp got to do referee right there just couldn't hold on totally played right the on the receiver Harnish off to catch that going through all that traffic sterling right on the coverage number 44 Arkansas State now brings up third down in three Garretson over the middle has the first down hunter sharp mr. reliable with those hands he's inside Arkansas State Territory to the 49 Saviour Woodson I can stop at another first down for us you nice Rock here by Hunter sharp nor where the sticks are Darrell garrison delivering the ball as I said with great accuracy so he can even after you catch the ball get upfield and make some extra yardage first down quick little swing pass to choke Joan Metzen and so far he's not been able to make the big play on pensively at for the itas state he gains a few but hunter sharp has definitely picked up the slack and that quiet receiver department here tonight this Arkansas State defense is doing a great job on first and second down they're just having problems on third and fourth down with getting off the field something they couldn't do last week against Miami they're gonna have to do that today because Darryl garrison is in a rhythm and Hunter sharp looks like he's that ready for a big day today and you gotta wonder if Arkansas State is still recovering from that loss last week losing two in a row at Tennessee at Miami and trying to get back on track here at home here tonight here's Rashad Hall as he fights his way across the 45 down to the 44 penalty flag on the play as Paul is tackled by ku Sean Lee the Mike linebacker for Arkansas State holding up in number 59 June yard in front of the plow replay second down that is Austin Stevens redshirt sophomore 63 to 90 out of West Des Moines Iowa as he kind of anchors that offensive line unit for Utah State so 10 yard penalty now brings it back to second down and 19 Garrett said plenty of time and nearly intercepted it's incomplete Oh Chris stone head of neck sex yet of defensive lineman's dream we had a wide open x6 head he held on to the ball get a complete Garrett's a step they couldn't find what he really wanted to try to go to the screen Christmas in September could stumble he just gonna unwrap the gift he was so shocked he was right there in the breadbasket just couldn't hang on must get to the 39 yard line of ASU territory for the first down Garrett said hit as he throws and it's sales atamans incomplete he is looking for thunder Shug we had a touchdown grab a drive ago brings up fourth down USU has to kick it away this young defensive front Argos Allstate Safari without you in there on the pressure great pressure on Daryl garrison never really happened receive open just really trying to get the ball to make a play that wasn't there good defense by Arkansas State finally getting off the field on third down Jaron been true to kick it away at his own 30 blaze Taylor stands back at his own 24hour consolidate and nearly had it blocked away by the short punt and bounces inside the 30 and goes out of bounds they say at the 24 yard line that's where Arkansas State takes over and Blake Anderson and his crew trying to get something going offensively and then he toss State defense living up to its billing here early on first couple of drives all these less states had the 2 ball they want it we're moving the ball moving the ball and any penalties installed and pressure by these Utah State defense it's going to be a hard game all day they're gonna have to create some big plays ready night in this offense and JV because it is going to have to touch the ball more as this game goes along it's Hollingsworth's and but just say lined up at the back filled with tonight did and we may get a false start on Hollingsworth kind of moved prematurity in the backfield we'll wait and see what the call is go first now you don't see that very often delay of game on the defense first when I've seen all you taking the last couple years usually that's when the defensive play caller is moving around or jumping but you can't move once you sit on the defensive front night it becomes the pressure and barely Frankie cetera of Utah State the second turnover by a Burkinshaw stay here tonight Dan Utah State in great shape great field position for the Aggies back at the 30 Jordan Nelson with the pressure coming off the edge Friday night and couldn't find the short pass as we said he had to be good with the ball today because this defense 22 interceptions in the last 13 games right there they're opportunistic defense they love to get the hands on the ball just a bad decision right there by night and for Frankie Sutera that is his second interception of the season and Garrett's an introvert who goes down as he sacked by Charlson Gurley the Nickelback for Arkansas state and for Charleston Gurley he had ten tackles last week at Miami that's his first sack of the season Oh Kevin calling up the Blitz off the edge by Gurley the best part of that is he made the tackle a lot of times you see the quarterback are they able to avoid that first initial pressure right there great tackle by Gurley game clock winding down though they get a playoff in time nope first quarter is in the books a defensive slugfest but Utah State the difference in the game a 71 yard touchdown pass Peggy's lead at 7 under one start of the second quarter seventh nothing Utah State Brock bowling alongside Wayne candy and Wayne the Utah State defense causing fits for Arkansas State's offense already two turnovers forced by the Aggies and Utah State has the football in Arkansas state field position in territory rather good field position as you start the second quarter really other than the big bomb from a garrison the sharp behind the field both defensive have played tough today we expected of Utah State defense that's Arkansas State defense is accepted the challenge of the turnovers and then has come out stuck his neck out playing tough doing a good job for making up for the mistakes that the Arkansas State offense have made second at sixteen Garretson that's nearly intercepted hobble away twice by two different defenders for Arkansas state it's incomplete Charleston Gurley the last one there to not get away brings up third down and 16 you know you and I were talking earlier in the week how were surprised that neither team has played a conference game so far this season we're in week four both teams are off next week both teams play their conference opener the week after on October 4 yeah eight of the last nine games being conference games for both teams Arkansas State losing the last two games really leads this game to stay in bowl contention coming up but they both coaches had no problem not playing the foe conference game so far and Ronald Butler short of the first down tackled by Gurley and Lee for Arkansas State and you know Utah State is in the Mountain West Conference Arkansas State in the Sun Belt Conference but Utah State spent two years as a member of the Sun Belt Conference 20032004 and they tied for fourth place at o3 tied for seventh place a note for so they're back in familiar territory here in Jonesboro Arkansas playing it Arkansas State and be a little pooch punt by Darren Bent root and blaze Taylor catch it going out of bounds of the nine yard line sokurah Arkansas State Wayne what do you expect here come but just missed you see Blake Anderson's Club making here in the second quarter well they need to let's try to establish the one they haven't even really handed the ball off to a front in fact consistently tonight Hawks having a couple of carries earlier that they some yardage but then they got away from that they're trying to use the short passing game as their run game we might be born being out if there's a lot of pressure on Friday night you'll make plays with his feet but they're gonna have to get back to that tempo they were using early in the game there's Matt wells the middle of your screen for Utah State he's the head coach he was a player at Utah State in the early mid 90s quarterback the team former assistant coach all over the place including at Utah State for two years now the head man in his second season and Logan and we asked him if you know this is his dream job he says you know it's pretty special being a graduate being a former player former assistant he says it's not about him it's about one team one school one unit no one's bigger than the program he's just a part of it very nice humble man and talked to earlier this week a lot of places young coach to 12th youngest coach in college football age of 39 he he said it was his dream job to be back and like lot of coaches they'd love to go back and be the head man that their alma mater he has that chance last year nine and five this year already two and one with a big win over Wake Forest last week so here's Arkansas State trying to get something going here in the second quarter down seven the give deterrence Hollingsworth nicknamed tank and he gains a couple to the 11 yard line and Terrence Hollingsworth number for the Alabama High School Athletic Association's alltime career leader in total offense allpurpose yards and rushing touchdowns he had 113 of those and 9800 career rushing yards in his high school career that's amazing as Freddie Nitin goes down for a loss in the backfield down to the 11 yard line sack vigil right there they're wrestling down vigil pigeon vigil showing you right here the speed and the comfort space that he can make up even being a middle linebacker he reads the play as you can see a boys to cut block and when you a great linebacker the one thing you can do is tackle in space vigil on the plate second false start penalty tonight on Jamar Clark redshirt sophomore he's a big boy six six three oh four out of McCrory Arkansas and just like that now third and long third down and 17 not a place you want to be here regardless of who you're facing but definitely when you're facing the type of defense that Utah State puts on the field nitin gonna air it out down the right sideline and it's cut but out of hands is Tyler true scene it's incomplete brings up fourth down and long they'll have to kick it away these corners of Utah State is going a great job right there Daniel great making sure as he run he turns around and finds the ball and that's the key to playing cornerback you can find the ball that gives you the right into the airspace and it allows you more contact nice play there by Daniel gray finding the ball Luke Ferguson to take it away Jojo Nansen the dangerous Jojo dancin standing near midfield at his own 48 pretty good kick by Ferguson fair catch signal made by Jojo dancin at the 47 yard line and that's where Utah State will begin a sex drive away comeback time out of the field 12:43 to go first half you by 7:00 a good thank you all a state fans you know football league is it a 47 is it be 46 is it C 44:57 everybody Arkansas State fans clad in red and an unusual set of jerseys going on tonight with Arkansas State it's a read out for them red tops and red pants normally at home they wear black tops and red pants going all red tonight on first and ten Garretson swings it out and a huge hit out of bounds on fire cue Shawn Lee as he knocked Davonte Robinson out of bounds close to a first down push on Lee says hold on Zach I can cover the field as well big middle linebacker all the way out on the edge delivering a punishing hit preseason Maine big hit in the conference what a play what a tempo setter push on Lee gets to everything for this defense they got enough for the first down so first down in ten and up the middle goes Rashad Hall and he gets a first down run backtoback first downs for Utah State as Andrew Tryon takes down Rashad Hall it brings up another first down in ten nice inside right here by Utah State most of the night they spin out on the edge right here just a simple handoff and hard running every star Hall between the tackle this is a huge game tonight for both teams but especially for Arkansas State ASU 1 &amp; 2 right now if they win they go to 2 &amp; 2 they lose this one they go to 1 &amp; 3 going into the bye week and still haven't as we spoke about haven't played a conference game which conference games are always tight really really get to that point where they're gonna have to make some plays and the pass incomplete as Garrett sim is looking for vacuum tight into Jefferson Court you got knocked away it's incomplete brings up second down and 10 it seems that the hitting bug is coming along in this game and your tie run right there delivering a blow Arkansas State defense all night long has been tough this gave up a couple big plays if they can stop that they're doing a great job so far five wide receivers for the Aggies of Utah State Garretson on the rollout he finds Ronald Butler he dances his way out of bounds inside the 10 to the 6 yard line brings up first down and goal to go for at Utah State garrison regardless of whether is from the pocket or on the move showing you that consistent accuracy hitting receiving where he can catch the ball and get a feel that is HUGE anytime you're being playing the quarterback position to deliver a ball that a receiver can do something with once he gets it in his hands Ronald Butler 58 yards receiving last week against Wake Forest he also had a 44 yard touchdown pass in the game against the Demon Deacons Jojo Nelson there's Jojo Nansen as he tries to run the football normally a wide receiver is bounced out of bounds and the six gain of four brings up second down and goal Jojo does everything here at the center Kevin taking the ball from Center getting some hard tough y'all well you got that kind of talent you do try to find a way to get him to paw any kind of what you can good tough run there to set up second goal Garretson quick throw to the endzone way overthrown and incomplete looking for hunters sharp who has put on touchdown and who score in this game and now a huge third down and goal to go situation from the six for Utah State Arkansas State trying to at the very least hold Utah State to a field goal of his Drive dark spot on this defense tonight it has been on fire getting off the field right here need a big plate don't want to go down 14 nothing to this defensive garrets in ball looked away and intercepted they say that's too young if their sterling yawn that's his first interception of the season and number six in his career huge flame of the ASU defense garrison trying to look the safeties off go back trying to throw the slant sterling young is having a great season so far for this defense 20 tackles 1 sack has the int nothing bigger than stopping second it and go third and goal from the six big play for this team not just a defense don't want to go down to too big to this team of Utah State with such a defense they had a huge play by Sterling young a veteran man in the defensive backfield by Arkansas State now ASU not only holds them to a less than a field goal they hold them to a turnover and now Justin white able to get a first down huge carry at the middle I guess that's good Utah State defensive team Arkansas State has to come out and establish some semblance of a running game Utah State is trying to make them onedimensional some of it is being because they haven't run the ball right there good tough inside run by Johnston white knight in hit as he throws and it's incomplete looking for Booker Mayes number 18 for Arkansas State redshirt sophomore out of Pine Bluff Arkansas remember this Utah State team is fourth in the nation in the FBS in defending the run but Arkansas State got a huge run by Justin white two plays ago second and ten nitin has to get rid of it then he airs it out of bounds incomplete looking for JD McKissack in the right flat just like that quickly brings up third down and 10 Big D and John Taylor out putting them applying the pressure tonight you good decision just to throw the ball the way can't afford a turnover on this on this short field this side of the field for your offense I tended to keep it himself has some room and he's got the first down it was a broken play had to make something happen he to tin got 12 to the 35 yard line tackled by Zack vigil above an Arkansas state first and broken play can't tell whether it's a quarterback draw tonight but he saw all that room and decide to use his feet and he completes the pass night in tip Darion Griswold the tight in and he is deep inside Utah State Territory penalty flags come flying out of the feel that this might be against Arkansas state nice were you here bye Fred night hitting the bit tidier they're going to bring the ball back the first down stands but they're going to mark off the penalty yardage not sure what happened this might be unsportsmanlike conduct on Arkansas State that's Brandon finer didn't see what happened but it's a penalty at the spot of the foul they still have a first down but it's not nearly the ball is not nearly where they want it to be it was inside the 25 but due to the spot personal foul generally they bring the ball back and they barely got the first down coach Andersen talked about his team missing tackles mental arrows and also too many penalties in the first three game that they had that they needed to get back to the basics and start a usually technique right there negating a big gain still able to get the first down but a big gain negated by it once again a penalty correction they do not have the first down it's they haven't changed the yard marker on the far sideline it's yes they do have the first down its first down into you don't see that very often 1st down and 2 nitin under pressure and he's got the ball back to the line of scrimmage and now another penalty flag comes flying in in the backfield and this might be on Arkansas State initially good protection by the offensive line there's a holding that's debit Maundy out of Olive Branch Mississippi redshirt two years ago played just two games last year and that's one of the things that coach Andersen talked about a few weeks ago same and he's got so many young and experienced guys in the trenches on both sides of the ball but they're holding their own so far this year and getting better but a big holding penalty right there on Devon Maundy now brings up first down in 12 I can tell you being a former offensive lineman myself when you have a mobile quarterback sometimes you tend to grab because you see a blur out the corner of your eye running by you and you feel like if I can just get a little snug on his jersey right there getting caught Monday with his hand in the cookie jar the play fake to white night then trying to make something happen and he's taken down by Mountain West Conference Defensive Player of the Week this week zag vigil of Utah State nine just doesn't seem very comfortable in the pocket right now edition route not there he's trying to make something happen with his feet making good choice by pulling it down you don't wanna just throw the ball up against this defense they they are known for getting interception so not a bad player pulling it down he did Richard Gaines quick throw night into JD McKissack he's been a little quiet tonight but he gets past the 40 out of bounds in about the 41 yard line brings up third down and short for Arkansas State and we mentioned it earlier JD McKissack now with a 30 game reception streak he's caught a pass and every game he's played in at Arkansas State in his third year a junior out of Phoenix City Alabama third and three night Tim finds Tyler's first seen and he's got the first down Taylor Rowe seen Adam Felsen California 511 180 a junior tackle by Devon centers the strong safety of Utah State everything about this play was just a nice nice drop strong throw by night and great right route right there by to receive her way to tuck the ball grab it out of the air tuck it in get some extra yards right master football has picked up by Devin centers in the game force by Utah State and Devon centers pounces on top of it for the Aggies Devon centers all over the field listen off the hand just working hard none stopped he looked like the Energizer Bunny right there froggy he shedded the running back tried to scoop and score having a big night in this first half already but Devon centers that's the second time in as many weeks the Friday night and there's lost look Molly had a pull the unconventional fluke Bible of loss of the football last week against Miami and then the same thing happened tonight here against Utah State Garretson gives a Rashaad hall as he tries to fight his way for the first den and he's close to it gains 9 to the 35 yard line in Arkansas State Territory sterling yeah I'm gonna give a tackle for a yes you starting to drive off just like they did the light the previous Drive tough inside run by Hall both teams as you can see in the second quarter trying to establish the run both defense is playing tough on third down great play right there for Utah eight yard game Utah State they do that fly sweep to Tojo dance and he's going backwards and he lost about five yards back to the 40 yard line as Arkansas State's defense read that right away quickly brings up third down and six Joe Joe Dassin might be small in size but trust me this Arkansas State defense heis a wide no matter where he goes our Utah State trying to get him a ball as much as possible great great play right there by the defense just making them stretch out and run out of real estate third down and six for Utah State Aronson over the middle finds the tight end Wyatt Houston Hays short about a two yard two yards shy of the first down marker as Andrew Tryon covered him up and took him down brings up fourth down for the Aggies and they're in tweener territory here might go for it as they're little too short for a punt and too far away for a field goal try once again this is just a function that you have a great defensive team so you can gamble a little more when you're Utah State because you feel like even if you don't get it you can send that kind of 10 team out so a timeout taken six and a half minutes to go in the first half and so far it's been all Utah State everybody it's time for the kiss cam from racing Utah State on the road invading Jonesboro and has a seven nothing lead on the red walls of Arkansas State Brock bowling alongside Wayne Gandy and it's fourth down and three yards to go for the Aggies trying to get the first down Arkansas State Territory leading 7 to nothing and Arkansas State has elected to take a timeout and we will as well seventh nothing Utah State and we're actually going to keep it right here Utah State against Arkansas State Utah state's defense against asu's offense and so far the defense has prevailed over the offense here in a quarter and a half yeah the best thing has accepted the challenge of Utah State seafoods that they're not the only defense in the country Arkansas State defense is highly ranked a lot of betters in the back end kahshanna leave Xavier Woodson and route I run making plays and right now just a deepness the battle good oldfashioned defensive play and Utah State giving Arkansas State a lot of different looks up front and in the secondary you know normally this Arkansas State team likes to play fast you know snap the football with no more than 15 seconds to go at the play clock and how many times tonight have we seen Utah State force Arkansas State to look over the sidelines change the play what do you want to call ok getting down to five seconds to go on the play clock and they've had some trouble offensively tonight as Utah State elects to punt it away this time on fourth down after the timeout by Arkansas State they down it Kennedy Williams downs into the 5 Arkansas State takes over trying to get on the board for the first time tonight down 7 7 that I think 6:20 to go 2nd quarter at a multiple fronts that Utah State put up front it makes you blocking assignments on and some time specially when you run that no huddle fast pace offense and you get off kilter trying to figure out who and what responsibilities I have especially up fronting the old line which is causing some problems right now and I will take that commercial break with 6:20 to go in the second quarter it's 7 to nothing he tossed eight every man constantly read war zone just like every inch passenger a farmer out in the field at Case IH were helping farmers all over the world of farming has changed be ready with case I made about supporters of the Red Bulls running board case IH comm /d them so far Utah State shutting out Arkansas state here in Jonesboro seven to nothing with 620 to go in the second quarter and Arkansas State has the ball deep in its own territory first down in 10 and to give to Johnston white and he gains a couple down to the 9 yard line and Arkansas State trying to get something going here before the halftime intermission Zach vigil number 53 made the last tackle for the Aggies to give to white again as he fights his way for yardage past the 10 down to the 13 yard line and brings up third down and short Zach bill julik in on the tackle for Utah State how many times we said his name tonight my goodness you can see you Arkansas State trying to get the tempo going trying to get in and out get the plate in and out get up to the line right there we have an injury how Harris on the ground that's Kyle Harris shaken up down on the field and coming up at halftime on espn3 Kirk Herbstreit will talk to Jameis Winston about his on the field accolades and his off the field antics who also talk live with Arkansas State athletic director Terry Mahajan up here in the booths and of course 11 first half highlights and stats all coming up at the half here on ESPN 3 it's Kyle Harris 6 for 280 a junior he originally signed with South Carolina in 2011 at a high school transferred to the JUCO ranks now he's back at the d1 ranks to South Carolina holding his left wrist and let's hope it's nothing too serious seems being a lot of pain holding is that and even look like you can't even squeeze it right there hopefully it's not dislocated already thin in this front line is offensive line with Arkansas State and Johnston white akin gang tackled up front Frankie Sutera and Zack vigil both singing him down at the 15yard line fourth down and short and Arkansas State looking to go for it here Wayne deep in its own territory down seven that I think the offense hasn't done a whole lot tonight fourth down and a food to go for this surprise you if coach Anderson Poole is a lot of I think we should go to Vegas he's very deep in this I don't know if he's got I would think that he's just maybe trying to draw him offside but here's a roll of the dice if I've ever seen one Johnston white gutsy call gutsy Ron he's got the first down of the 20yard line it was fourth and a foot from the 15 and he got it the blackjack deal and this will be false start penalty we think on Arkansas State once again penalties that's Colton Jackson yeah we talked to Blake Anderson yesterday he said they have got to cut down on penalties silly penalties like a false start and also defensively they just missed a lot of tackles the last couple of games especially against Miami some of these penalties are just focused they got to keep their focus the Sidra penalties are usually just focused you have to go up to the line you have to get set sometimes it's the defense the fear of the defense's defense of Utah State is flying around a lot of young freshmen sophomores in this offensive line but they got to do a better job penalty's and a fastpaced offense really sets it back Zack vigil and Rashard Stewart both take out takedown night and on that play loss of five in the play brings up second down and 15 quick throw from night into the a back Brandon Cox and Cox able to elude one defender and gets pushed out of bounds but no gain on the play he's out of bounds right at thee I gots a gain of five of the play back to the original line of scrimmage at the 20 nick vigil initially cos makes one miss here comes the other one out of nowhere what cover speed 53 Zack vigil has what a linebacker on third and long nightin tries to go down the sideline it's incomplete looking good put your main snow flag on the play and asus2 kick it away Jalen Davis on the coverage for Utah State these corners of Utah State is just doing a great job on these deep routes just couldn't come down with the cats great play by jaylen Davis Luke Ferguson decent punt Jojo Nansen has a chance to return it and it is blasted special teams sortez brown pretend a little a on lick on Jojo natsot Jojo nasan dangerous the ferret caught it trying to get up make something happen for this all artists round we used to call that laying the lumber that's nice bit by our tails so he tossed a takes over leading by seven a 71 yard touchdown pass from Darell Garretson to Hunter sharp the difference in this game and Garretson finds that man hunter sharp again as he turns the corner and gets close to a first down disease ativans at midfield 314 remaining in the first half and Utah State so far leading 7 to nothing and a goose egg of the board right now for Arkansas State guitar state going to the world once again on the sharp seems to be that guy he's here in the first half making plays for Darell Garretson they're using the short passing game as their run gained at least for this half knifethrowing kids low on hunt he's got a couple of carries on the night he gets the first down he needed three and got four down to the 46 yard line of Arkansas State Territory and Utah State has one timeout remaining Arkansas State has two as we approach 245 to go in the second quarter if your Utah State you just want to get maybe three up on the bullet going in to have the way your defense is playing you want to make sure whatever you're doing at the quarterback position is garrison calling the play is safe and that you come out of this with some positive yardage Garretson swing pass it's caught by hunters sharp he's got the angle of he almost had the first down as he goes down at the 37 yard line Nickelback Charleston Gurley on the stop for Arkansas State missing wide Houston loses tight in running flat down the middle of the field wide open decided to go with his man tonight fingers talking more positive yards third down and less than a yard to go Rashaad hall has the first down and more cutting to the outside fighting off defenders and pushed out of bounds inside the 10 down to the 7 yard line of the first down and goal to go but a penalty flag is on the play at the 20 you talked about Arkansas State offense having issues with penalties Utah State offense as well couple of payment penalties offensively early on big run right there by Rashad halls who seems to be holding a shoulder going out to the sideline love it flew the flag now they're having a discussion on what the call was like thunder at angle we can't really see it a great great visionary virus are all starting to the inside and cutting back out fortunately Arkansas State as will its first and goal at the five trips receivers at the top of your screen but handoff to Lewan hunt gains a couple down to the 33 yard line 100 seconds remaining in the first half Utah State going to the run you can tell they're trying to just make sure they keep something going this Drive and maybe kick three up on the board before halftime Garrett's it has all kinds of room to run and slides down to a stop nearly got his head clobbered he goes down inside the 30 to the 29 short of the first down Clark running with a minute tend to go in the half actually early in this play had hunter sharp crossing the defense on missed him but side goes and positive yards third and three Milan hunt and he's got the first down HOF left tackle he hasn't had a whole bunch of garnish tonight but he's has some key runs and key first downs made for Utah State and Garretson gonna spike it stops the clock with 45 seconds remaining still two timeouts in his pocket and his team leading 7 to nothing on the road when you look at this offensive series for Utah State all of this is predicated on the kind of defense you have you feel like you just every point you put up puts more and more pressure on the other team because your defense is that stout when it's on the field Utah State taking their time going with plays that they know they won't be miscues any turnovers positive yards getting in the range of field goal right now in good position second and ten play action by Garretson here comes the pressure cue Charlie wraps him up and takes him down and for cue shun Lee that's his first sack of the season you show you the whole package tonight frog he's out on the edges making tackles he has a couple of interceptions on the year and he's doing the one thing that you want you to know linebacker to be able to do see the ball go get the ball push on leave bigtime player there's Keyshawn Lee the defensive MVP of the 2013 godaddy.com bowl and the 2012 godaddy.com bowl for Arkansas State he had a hundred 34 tackles last year 100 the year before he became the first player in ten years at ASU with consecutive 100 tackle seasons that's pretty impressive I'm quite sure all week he's heard Zack and Nick vigil in the paper how great they are he's out here tonight in this first half there's hasn't been a defensive player making more of an impact in him what a leader what a player and the thing that I like about him is he can rush the passer you can get out on the edge and he's great and making tackles in open space he's the preseason Sun Belt Conference Defensive Player of the Year had an interception last week against my inning now for Utah State third down and 13 must get to the 15yard line for the first down garrets it going into the enzone passes out of anne's an incomplete looking for Damon Patterson the wide receiver he was double covered the ball was uncatchable anyway incomplete brings up fourth down and 13 Shawn they set that up creating with that big hit on the previous play nowhere to go with the ball both defense is just playing superior third down business today Arkansas state needed that stop any points on the board right here really Hurst them in the second half Jake Thompson on to try a 45yard field goal which one is very wobbly and very short and it's no good and Arkansas State gets another win on defense despite its hot Vince not doing much tonight hold C tossed eight to nothing on that drive Arkansas state takes over 24 seconds remaining in the half dodged a big bullet right there Utah State early in that drive had a lot of momentum going moving the ball have a big play call back for a penalty Joe Joe Dassin like Paul tried to settle for the fieldgoal missed it still seven nothing leaf is a battleground and the ball gets away from night and on the snap and hits to pounce on top of it very fortunate that that ball didn't hunt squid away from a man the Utah State defense able to get on it Freddie 9 just seems lost the ball it wasn't I thought it usually it was high a little to his left but a catchable ball right there coach Anderson is just gonna let the clock line down and go to half steps and nothing and half time is here it's been a back and forth defensive battle here tonight only one big play so far that was a 71 yard touchdown pass by Utah state's Darell Garretson to Hunter sharp halftime is here your score

on Arkansas State Jameis Winston won the Heisman Trophy a national championship and last spring was a standout for the Florida State baseball team unfortunately is off the field runins were as much in the news as his onfield accolades Kirk Herbstreit recently sat down with a 20 year old who is hoping to put his checkered past behind him ultimately it's going to be up to the State Attorney's Office to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against Jameis Winston I can confirm that Jameis Winston will not be charged for the crime you went through so much off the field last year how did all that that term won't affect you when you were going through such a miraculous season well it went it went straight to my game we started playing harder we started working harder we saw doing things better because we felt like somebody was trying to take something away from us and I wasn't gonna let that happen I wasn't gonna let my off the field issues you know hurt them my goal was to win a national championship in real companies so we get through that then in April the situation with the grocery store Heisman winner Jameis Winston is accused of ripping off a supermarket of 32 dollars worth of crab legs you go into a store you go into but to buy something it's crab legs leave and say you forgot to me that's not acceptable what happened there I mean it was it was it was a mistake I apologized for it and that's okay everything all the fear that I need to take care do you feel like these experiences have taught you anything I think that all that just helped me just realize like hey man you got to hold yourself to a standard that no one else can go on talking to schools helping with kids and Ashley the community service that I did that changed my life do you feel like you're a role model yeah I do I feel like I have the responsibility that comes with that it's pretty large I want to be a role model I want kids to look up to me that's what it's about the kids I want to influence them to do the right thing and be the right person because that's basically that's our future those were kids you're one of the most confident guys that I've been around where does that come from I mean I know you're gonna think I'm crazy but I look at every football game like a little league football you know a little league football I did it so why can I go on the big stage and do it so I'm always will have this confidence about myself only thing that I haven't done yet just play on Sundays what's your motivation for 2014 you got to be better you got to be better and there's a lot of people saying for the state not gonna be able to do it again that's the real motivation the only person they can beat us the sport of state I think there's a target on your on your back yeah you always got to feel like that people gonna try to say he ain't like he was last year it's all good cuz I'm better right I'm better than what I would lash you're saying bring it on yeah that's like that's how you got to be on the football field like a football if you're good you're gonna win right if you're not good just a mute take a seat and that was Kirk Herbstreit

booth here at Arkansas State University brought folding alongside director of athletics Terry Mahajan thanks for joining us here tonight tried to be here and a defensive slugfest so far thoughts in the first half you would never thought that these two teams and now it's it's been great I think Arkansas States it's probably coach Anderson's probably like hey we're lucky to have be down by seven so they just gotta get rid of some of the mistakes and an obviously Utah State can move the ball I mean they're doing well so let's talk about the facility upgrade plans here at Arkansas State and every time I come here for a game I always noticed there's more and more progress being made in the north part of the end zone of the indoor practice facility that's going to be completed around March

appreciate you coming here all right that's athletic director Terry Mahajan of Arkansas state we're at halftime in Jonesboro it is Utah stage 7 Arkansas State nothing more on the capital one halftime report coming up here on ESPN 3 this is the capital one halftime report and we're at halftime in Jonesboro Arkansas State University halftime score Utah State seven and Arkansas State nothing has continued on the capitol one at time report run bobbing alongside Wayne Gandy and that Wayne your thoughts in the first half a defensive slugfest here tonight defensively both teams showed up tonight Utah State we know they're deep what their defense can do the Arkansas State defense came to be counted as well the biggest thing that's happened in this game is turnovers and penalties every big play was negated by a penalty and the turnovers just said it both offenses back when they had positive plays not surprised about Utah State only having seven on the scoreboard very surprising though is the fact that Arkansas State has a goose egg without a uptempo potent offense it has what adjustments you look for by Arkansas State offensively at the second half I still believe they have to come out and establish the run I know that Michael Gordon child I know they've been banged up in the offensive line but for them to have any success of getting the ball downfield they have to get Utah State to respect their run game something they didn't do in the first half all right let's take a look at the first half highlights in this game so far tonight and defensively a lot of big plays made by both teams here tonight question on Lee all over the field hitting both teams both linebackers groups making plays both quarterbacks early on was successful then the pressure started coming on them as you can see defense all over the field Utah state known for being able to get out to the quarterback and the number one thing that they do is get interceptions right here garrison just going to fall out the hunter sharks join this I'm a big play for protein in the hunt first half let me take a look at the first half stats in this one total yards dominated by Utah state's rushing and passing penalties are even and turnovers the Red Wolves just shooting themselves in the foot three penalties serve it making the turnovers right now in the first half compared to just one by Utah State the biggest thing is only five penalties for both teams but all five of those penalties almost negated something that was very positive specially for Utah State on the big run early in the game to set off first and goal late in the second half first half those a look at your first half stats and that concludes the Capital One halftime report your halftime score Utah State set in Arkansas State nothing third quarter kickoff coming up after this on ESPN 3 how did the overall experience of the dr. pepper tuition giveaway change your life dr. pepper gave me something this priceless honestly the hundred thousand dollars all experience of the dr. pepper we should give away change your life dr. pepper gave me something that's priceless honestly the hundred thousand dollars and tuition is great but it

who's next liquors with the Hail Mary here his whole idea play off the ribbon find it this year was crowned the first true undisputed number one encounter it's like the beginning of peace now the founding fathers you know we've been like elected you ever seen the record book over there aspirin and for free off pepper oil for playoff after play this is like a first real signal football Thomas Oh another field mano a mano mano Evans superbee I'm sorry that's okay back in jonesboro start of the third quarter Utah State leading Arkansas state 7 the nothing Brock bowling alongside Wayne Gandy it's been a defensive slugfest so far and Arkansas State received the opening kickoff it will kick off to Utah State to begin half number two and quarter number three Kelvin Lee and Kennedy Williams back deep for Utah State this is returnable for Kennedy Williams at the 5yard line tries to turn the corner and Tyler trophy no special teams forces of men abounds 23 yard line that's where Utah State begins the second half of play first down in ten Utah State I look for you toss they did come out basically do what they were doing in the first half they've been having a lot of success cut off the penalties here and there Erickson Darryl garrison is doing a great job going the ball on the move their office is doing what they need to do I think to win this game with the kind of defense they have they just have to come out and cut the mental errors in the combs up and Rashad Hall gets the carry not much there Andrew Tryon takes him down to the 29 yard line Utah State played 14 games last year 12 regular season games the Mountain West Conference title game in the bowl game they went 9 and 5 7 and 1 and the Mountain West Conference and beat a very good Northern Illinois team in the poinsettias oh and the team finished ranked 12th in total defense and number 7 number 7 in scoring defense last year the defensive a success continues again this year as they hand the ball off again to a Rashad Hall he's got the first down to the 38 yard line nice block there nice block by left half of Kevin Winsley the only returning senior starter up on that offensive line good job of getting first stone inside allowing Rashad Xavier to bounce to the outside now luan hunt at the back field of the right of Garretson on play action and on first down and Garretson dumps it off to the right sideline he's got a receiver open hunters sharp has the lone touchdown scored in this game is pushed out of bounds by money hunter garrix in the sharp once again nice roll out nice touch on the ball I can't emphasize that enough nice ball to be able to catch and still get up and get extra yards out to catch pickup of eight brings up second down in to forgive to Kennedy Williams his first carry on the night rushing the football he has the first down he needed to and got a lot more ease inside Arkansas State Terence all right down to the 43 just a simple handoff get to the outside and make quick cut nice speed once he gets up in the hole good part tough running for a little guy definitely also eight Kennedy Williams I should say also a return man specialist for the squad fresh set of downs for you Stas state first down in ten plenty of time for Garrett said he goes long for Hunter sharp and broken up and incomplete coverage by our tez Brown for ASU almost became the second touchdown of the night for Hunter sharp once again garrison drops ball bag tried to look the safety off and just puts it up in the air trying to let hunter short make a play on the ball for a second there it looks like sharp half position just could not adjust to the ball that's the second third time that garrison has bent over and started stretching his hamstring that extreme you have to see if that's a problem as this game goes on that's a backward pass to Devonte Robinson and Robinson scutes is way out of bounds for no gain on the play running the ball inside throwing these quick passes to try to get something out on the edge and use your speed that's been there all night for them making positive yardage brings up third down and ten for Utah State must get to the 32 yard line in Arkansas State Territory for the first down Garretson on the option little shuffle pass to Jojo Matson and only gained two yards he's ain't yards shy of the first down marker nice read here by Lane not being fooled with a little shuttle pass Utah State kind of laying it up right there just going for something safe trying to break a run or two nice play by ranked Lane reading the play making the tackle in space Johari Lane on the tackle a tofudan Tyrone George at 510 185 and a freshman who Bonaparte Utah State to punt it away it'll be flag on the play I think we have a false start on each on Damon Patterson he moved a little too early for the Aggies will push the football back five more yards starting this game brought Arkansas state defense had a problem getting off the field on third down about the middle of the first quarter on until now they have been doing a good job of creating third and long and getting off the field jaren been true to kick it away from his own 40 and blaze Taylor standing there waiting for it at his own 10 high punt by Ben Trude fair catch signal made and caught by plays Taylor at the 11 yard line in Arkansas State will have the ball the first time in the second half when we come back timeout taken early third quarter still Utah State leading by seven let's see like the best mirrors of it actually for me to read and scan a furniture Wow supported at least a gold there's our press box our view from the stadium there's Wayne Gandy and here's me it's about airtime there for us that's where we are so I had to move over the run of you Tonopah and a way to show them and prove to them that I am here I'm not just some voice guys somewhere there's a handoff for Arkansas State and Justin white gets taken out short gain to the 11 yard line by Brian sweet Utah State let's see what Arkansas State does here its first possession of the second half the goose egg put up on the board in the first half of play Knight need to throw and he finds Darian Cruz Walter had a big catch to the first half the first down at the 25 yard line and Arkansas State wants to run the offense in a hurry it's good to see Griswold back here that long catch earlier he went into the locker but it seems to be fine making a nice grab right there johnston white up the middle just shy at the 30yard line Vica before on the play zach vigil the outside linebacker on the stop go read zone blocking right there Johnson white in the tackles no never you get four to five yards on first down that's two that's all you're looking for JD McKissack on the end around and he fights his way with the first and he's a little bit short we didn't wings up flirting short for McKissack and both coaches talked with the head on the perder in the week about the key on first and second downs in this game long defense all you're trying to do is string them out to the sideline Utah State defense nobody does it better the pike the kiss that got his hair grabbed there that's harder to the part of the Jersey Johnston white on third and short and I don't think he got the first down now he's a yard shy as John Taylor the backup defensive end stops Arkansas State on that play brings up fourth down the punting unit comes back on again for ASU Arkansas State first couple of plays seemed like they had something going really trying to pick up the tempo third down conversions tonight for them have been tough sledding Luke Ferguson to kick it away for Arkansas State Jojo Nance's standing back at his own 25 a pretty good punch by Ferguson Jojo Nance it makes the branch at the 20yard line Arkansas State goes quietly on that drive Utah State back on the field on offense when we come back tonight he's gonna take the finish the lyrics to the popular song fancy and get the chance to win a prize pack from our good friends Newt right are you ready you think you can do approach so Sharon ma must go some of the time I'm so fancy to taste this gold remember seven to nothing at Utah State leading Arkansas State the lone score the game came midway through the first quarter as he tossed eight with its second possession of the second half I think complete past their Darell Garretson to davontea robert said almost a backwards mass but it's having him played on a forward pass long long pass the no yard is dangerous I play they've gone to to a lot tonight Arkansas State is starting to read it Artest Brown breaking on the ball making a big play Darell Garretson he's the backup quarterback this year filling in for the injured Chuckie Keeton who tweaked a knee last week against Wake Forest's late in the first half he sat out most of the Year last year Keeton did with a knee injury and Paul Karason Davis goes 6 and 1 in those games last year as a starter he finished the game last week against Wake Forest and he started the game here tonight 6 of 1 career as a starter at Utah State behind big Kevin with me defense still claims stout against the the negs third down and eight for the Aggies around 21 yard line Garretson incomplete looking for Joe Joe Matson and just like that Utah State with a three and out kudos to the Arkansas State defense Arkansas State defense about the last four and a half has really dominated this game great third down third and long situations that's all you want as a defense coordinator to keep a team in third and eight 39 where they have to make and convert long yardage right there Joe Joe Dassin couldn't come down football Darren Bent rude that is the snap and yes to do that and Arkansas State will get the ball in great shape great field position that the Utah State 12 yard line as venturi just bobbled it had to eat it under pressure all night behind Arkansas state coverage team and like he tried to roll out before he actually had control of the ball pummeling the ball big break just what Arkansas State's offense needed the short field Arkansas stay with the ball at the Utah State 13 yard line trying to tie this game up trailing seven to nothing writing to the guy and he gives to Terrence Hollingsworth up the middle and the freshman gains a couple down at the 11 yard line Devin sinners strong safety took him down number 37 he's the son but larry centers who played 14 years in the NFL running back late for the washington redskins turnover by the arkansas state special teams this Arkansas saga saw state offense really needs the punches in you got to get some momentum going in this game and you got to get sevencourse on when you inside the 15 night in little backwards pitch to Hollingsworth and not much there Brian suite number 21 one of the first guys there for Utah State and yeah if you're Arkansas state you want to take advantage of this mistake on special teams made by Utah State they won seven not three Devon centers right there on the play once again shedding the tack the blocker getting up off the ground and making the play Johnston white no razzledazzle it's a reverse JD mckissick inside the 10 six sending us here a chance to tie it up no trickery here my walk bail now when we first night making a nice little clock offensive lineman getting moody down the fuel make and why not go to the man that makes everything happens for y'all kiss JD McKenzie he does not have a receiving touchdown this year but he got a rushing touchdown on that play just a moment ago Luke Ferguson on for the extra point to try and tie the game up a low kick but he got it we're tied at 7 in Jonesboro a timeout taken midway through the third quarter JD McKissack helps tie the game up at 7 second half here in Jonesboro because we have over 700 employees this this is some of them got together on the weekends some of them she's father and son tie game at 7:00 here in the third quarter in Jonesboro and JD mckissick second effort got him into the endzone for 6 the key to this play is 74 moody and 79 Clark really selling the run to the right so that the backside linebacker sucks in try to outflank him as offensive lineman you don't have to necessarily have a perfect block you just want to get in position to tie you up the defender to create enough room for JD McKenzie just punch it into the end zone tied at 7 Lee and Williams back to receive the kick deep for Utah state's Luke Ferguson to kick it away that's one thing that Blake Anderson is happy about in the kicking game for his team at the Ferguson Tim ferry on kickoffs this year can't deep sometimes either battle begin as Williams by the kicker himself Luke Ferguson at the 25yard line who says kickers don't like to get their nose in the dirty up Luke Ferguson big leg on kickoffs then little shaky in the field goal area loses games with big leg on kickoffs get in the mix right there usually they just choose not to get in the mix from a momentum standpoint Arkansas State clearly has it on its side how much can that really pick up this team on defense here on this Drive and keep the momentum going well this defense has been feasting for almost two quarters now as Utah State offense playing at a tempo that definitely can win this ballgame they set the tempo for the offense once again a penalty on Utah State offensive front number 76 Jake Simon itch guilty of a false start penalty played in 14 games last year six five 286 a sophomore out of Danville California four new starters up front as Wilson they're coming along starting to learn how the past walk a lot better today that's too many false start killing hands give it to LaVon hunt goes around the left tackle and he has a first down on first and 15 he gains 16 to the 36 yard line and Utah State same territory the fresh set of downs coming up for Utah State student body left get behind your blockers the shot Hall making a key block right there kicking the corner out the Sun hunt hidden up inside good day one hunt gets the carry again this time goes to the right side and crew Sean lien tackle him and Lee shaken up around the 43 yard line cue Sean Lee right in front of his own pinches down and he's banged up to this defensive for Sean we can't get up and come back from this he is the guy in the middle who sets the tempo once again little middle linebacker he can cover a lot of field just the shoulder seam to get up under hunt when he fell down he's up on his feet walking to the sideline which is always a good sign from its own 43yard line utah state second down and three Rashaad Hall and he's got the first down to the 47 yard line haul out of Lynchburg Virginia originally signed with Colorado out of high school registered it in a year ago as great breakaway speed and tough guy to tackle great in the open field he'll come out and sit out a play he's at a pretty decent night running the football as has Utah State as a team the night they said the downs for Utah State first and ten now they give it to Jojo nets in the wide receiver and he gets taken down by Quan Theriot Heath the linebacker number 52 for Arkansas State Aggies an ASU territory at the Red Wolf 49 two straight plays by Utah State right up the middle with Lee being on the sideline that could become a tree and as this game lies down but if Lee stays on the sidelines this is Kennedy Williams and Williams fights his way for the first down and he has it Quan Theriot Heath picks up the tackle once again for Arkansas State and the running game are the Aggies doing some damage here in the second half and overall tonight game of chess with Shawn Lee on the sidelines no better opportunity than to run the ball in between the tackles his domain so far so good for Utah State in their running game and now in the Wildcat formation here is LaVon hunt taking it in the shotgun and penalties come flying in this might be the illegal procedure on Utah State wide receiver hunter sharp moves too quickly before the snap and Wildcat way is all for nine and that brings them first down in 15 yards to go third fault false start penalty of this half for Utah State willing to Gaiden a good Drive with these bad penalties just a lack of focus on the offense from unit the lion hunts up the gut inside the 25 and in the 44 were Utah State lost its season opener on the road and Tennessee 38 7 then backtoback wins at home against Idaho State 4220 and Cole the Wake Forest of the ACC last week in Logan 3624 Arkansas State trying to snap a 2game losing skid it's one and two on the year Garretson quick throw hunter sharps got it and quickly taken down our tez Brown wraps it up at the 41 brings up third down and long for Utah State nice no roll here by garrison delivering the dawn of time our test Brown picking on special teams it makes some nice stopping tackles against the receiver and just stops in his track and eight Garretson over the middle he has Ronald Butler and run a butler road race for the endzone and he's got it touchdown Utah State Brenna Butler with a score and that is his first touchdown reception of the season Ronald bought low just coming across the middle of the defense last week last week throwing a touchdown to Jojo Matson this week just running a crossing route showing great speed to the endzone big play once again for Utah State two touchdown passes on the night for the backup quarterback Darell Garretson of Utah State Nick Diaz I for the point after he's got it and Utah State back in front by set it again penalty flag on the line might be offside against Arkansas State and it is outside defense number 21 FLDS Darell Garretson hitting running Butler coming across another field as I've said all night great touch on the ball being able to deliver a ball that the receiver can catch and keep running real key and in mobile quarterbacks being able to deliver the ball like that Arkansas State had this issue last week with Miami with the big play two big players today 14 7 we invite you to share your comments photos and final score predictions on Twitter bottle along tonight's game with hashtag us universes AR st just like that after Arkansas State ties the game up at 7 Utah State comes right back and Darell Garretson finds Ronald Butler for a touchdown strike to make it 147 Houston Utah State by the way Utah State doing that drive over cane penalties the lure still able to keep the ball moving finally coming up with a big play and once again we can't talk enough about their garrison and his accuracy at the quarterback position six and one as you said last year as a starter this game looking sharp as well darrel Rollins Davis let's ago out of the endzone be a touchback in Arkansas state will have it first and 10 at its own 25yard line Arkansas staying a team that rarely loses at home 42 and 9 record at home since 2005 and they say the ball went out of bounds before it went through the endzone so that'll be a penalty on Utah State and Arkansas State will have great field position to begin and there you have it home sweet home some good home cooking for the Red Wolves 42 and 9 record here at this stadium since 2005 not a bad record too shabby and movement on the line no timeout taken by Arkansas State Mountain Arkansas a timeout of the half so just a 30second timeout we'll keep it right here and take a look at the upcoming schedules for both teams here coming up at the moment when I ask you a question Wayne what about Arkansas State five head coaches in five years continuity issues differences but you played for three and coaches in three years of the amount of Malcolm's talk about the pros and cons of having a listen to a new voice each year for the best part about the coach changing here Arkansas State has been they run the same offensive system it's always been spirit has always been high tempo weathers you breathe whether it's Gus Malzahn they're up to the ball they want to get so the personnel hasn't had to change and that's the key it's the same type receivers and things like that so they have been able to take advantage of that and the players are used to that you have some of these guys is on this field that hasn't had four or five coaches which is a which is a salute to them to be able to still go out and win as they have done so at the 35 yard line Arkansas State first down in ten nitin sets up a screen and he finds Justin white and light tackled for a gain short game past the 35 to the 36 gain of one LT for the young gun for the tackle for Utah State alt looking like the LT of old for the Giants showing a lot of speed to be able to come from that backside linebacker position to make that play and Johnston wide with a handoff up the middle and breaks the tackle stays on his feet has the first down and more inside the 40 Judson white the redshirt freshman out of Covington Tennessee is another Arkansas state first down Arkansas State hurrying up to the ball to keep the tempo going just great balance and vision right here by Johnston why keeping this pounds almost going down the bag drill came in handy right here keeping those knees de tourny night and on playaction in trouble airs it out down the field has a man it's incomplete the open man was Jean pass koi he just couldn't hang on to it as he had to come back for the football falls short incomplete brings up second down and ten Friday night and I'm the pressure right here you tossed a that guy's just could not step in through the throw to be able to get enough air on it John Pascoe a guy that Coach Anderson says we really need to get going in our passing game just couldn't come up with the ball Brandon finer the freshman not much there we might add that starting running back Michael Gordon he's missed the last couple of games with some injured ribs and it's been a running back by committee to fill his shoes with people like Brandon pioneer Johnston white and Terence Hollies were at the nick vigil comes up a makes a huge tackle on Brandon miner huge loss in the play brings up third down and long for Arkansas State one of those individual boys are on the plate nice hit godgiven talent is what pays well said he has over his brother Zach I don't know which one I would take they both play hard and they both play the game on defense the way you like as a coach fourth down now not third down fourth down now and Luke Ferguson said a busy night we'll kick it away Jojo Nats it and that's it let's it bounce into the enzone touch that going on steady downs that look like it's gonna fall out of an inspector when determining goes and bans in the tune nice job by Luke precious end place that ball deep inside Utah State Territory at its own sometimes the shape of the ball helps Joe Dassin waving it off then they go over his head and anything inside the tin as a punt return you let go fortunate Balfour who falls state so instead of first and ten and its own 25 Utah State has it first and ten at its own to finally back in at middle linebacker to Arkansas State good to see them here Red Bulls fan big drive here for Utah State they need to get this ball and put the field get out of this tight situation and Rashad Hogg no gain on the play might've lost a yard number 97 Bowden big freshman at a Jonesboro Arkansas he's a local boy right here in town just too much penetration right there over thanks to the Blackmon all in the backfield Oh penetration in the run game Garretson quickly throws and it's incomplete looking for the tight end Jefferson Court he wasn't looking it in time for the ball and now third down and 11 yards to go Utah State from its oneyard line waiting 47 don't you two get over third quarter spread offenses a lot a lot of tough times in these type situations when they need to be able to get into tights and come off the ball push it off by running the ball they just don't have that type personnel right there trying to get a quick pass out of the backfield Garretson as LaVon hunts out of the backfield with waves short of the first down marker and he tossed a it will have to kick it away nice to mrs. stand for the Red Bulls for second third and long putting Utah State and Garrison in the situation where they got to pass the ball nice completion the better tackle and just what this Red Bulls team needed the greatest short field for their offense Darren Bent rude remember he bobbled the snap a while back in this game he'll take it away soon plays Taylor standing right at midfield and bhim truth barely gets it away takes a Utah State bounce and Taylor just gonna let it roll dead and Arkansas State will have it at the Utah State 48 yard line to begin its next drive with just seven seconds remaining in the third has a play by plays Taylor realizing that he wasn't going to be able to get to the ball clean don't want to give up bad field positioning or get in the situation where you're gonna get a turnover just let the ball lie what does WR line the starting to drive and the enemy's territory I don't think that's bad here's a look at the Arkansas State upcoming schedule Red Wolves are off next week and an at home against Louisiana Monroe and then three straight road games at Georgia State at Louisiana Lafayette at Idaho then three of the next four to round out the season are at home here in Jonesboro Arkansas I do backwards past a Hollingsworth acts like he wants to throw he goes nowhere LT for the young guy first man there number five they take him down and that is the end of the third quarter play at the end of three here in Jonesboro Utah State trying to knock off the Red Wolves here in Jonesboro it's 147 Utah State okay to achieve textbook brokers is the official daily quarters for all a state back in Jonesboro started the fourth quarter 1472 state but Arkansas State is driving first in ten corrections second down and 18 yards to go it's only 45 night and had the ball deflected at the line of scrimmage and it's incomplete Utah state's defense causing pits on both the run and the pass tonight former Arkansas State when you're playing a threefour defense d tackles nose tackles when they can't get to them to the ball they're taught to just jump up and try to bat it down nice play right there by that defensive class and they're playing big all night Jordan Nielsen John Taylor those guys work scholar tackle from up here or maybe they just grabbed his hair bring it out for Arkansas State nice and completion attitude even kids they're just the back of his jersey what scholars remember the hand has to go inside the pad right there just throughout the back of the jersey way up here where the nose bleeds up here in Jonesboro we're almost higher than the lights but we love it here in Jonesboro nice punt by Ferguson and goes dead down at the five and Arkansas State Hazleton four yard line and another deeply in its own territory situation for Utah State with the Yankees still leading by 7 over ASU for the still 147 Utah State with the lead and he's have the football but deep in their own territory first and 10 at the round five yard line for the most part it's been a very defensive battle here tonight this is lawand hunt and it'll be Flags come flying in lay down to the play he goes down to the line of scrimmage no game lost again Arkansas State's defense in the perfect position to be able to give him the short feel really need a huge facemask penalty called upfront on number 77 Dexter black man he's the anchor of that defensive line the senior out of Silver Alabama called me God so instead of no gain on the play it's a pending yard penalty in a first down for Utah State gennadiy williams and not much there you just take it down my savior what's in the linebacker number 55 of Arkansas State come on hug right there on heart is brown it's coming on the quantum blitz to even be able to give Bruce at hall another get to the line there's Charleston Gurley nice story on him used to be a walkon for two years backup defensive back he went to coach Anderson asked him earlier in the offseason what I have to do to get on scholarship and Anderson said you know you haven't had that great of a spring really want to challenge you to see if you can approve to me that could be as good of a player as I think you could be and he took it too hard worked hard in the offseason on his game the weight room his body is mind and coach Anderson said he killed it and practice all summer long and he called him out in practice on August 10th in front of the whole team and he said come on up here I wanna say something the badge in dirty buddies in trouble he's like what did I do it is you didn't do anything wrong and he said that he was concerned pressed with his workouts and his attitude and his work ethic that he gave his scholarship on August 10th an old team just really rallied behind him and gave him a standing up pass broken up and incomplete on third down and Utah State has to kick it away nice defensive stand by Arkansas State even after the big personal foul 15yard penalty this defense was able to threeandout this offense to create a little room a little feel for this Arkansas State offense the oak Erikson 3step drop well lucky right there art is brown breaking on the ball almost comes up with interception he came down awkwardly and looked like his leg kind of snapped when he hit the ground but sitting up now Martez Brown veteran defensive back corner preseason firstteam all Sun Belt Conference this year that of Newport Arkansas 13 starts last year as the left corner had one interception no picks so far this year but there's a lot of season left he was a stud running back back in high school at over 3,000 yards rushing there's Matt wells head coach of Utah State in his second year that his alma mater in Logan Utah jaren been true to punt it away blaze Taylor standing back at his own 40 this will be returnable for Taylor from the 37 stays on his speeds and then gets tackled from behind he's down at the 46 yard line Arkansas State in good field position at its own 46 trying to tie up the game timeout taken early fourth quarter the home team Arkansas State trying to stay in it we've got a man Tyler each one is going to have a chance to get tonight's attendance I went prize packs for no TMT will start with share what do you think 23:7 what'd you say all right price to drive style you're out Tyler I don't want a 28,000 Arkansas State trailing by seven but with the football first and ten on its own 46 Johnston white not the middle not much back to the line of scrimmage and that's it was he one thing we haven't seen a lot of ready night and pulling the ball he's handed off at least nine out of ten times it'd be nice to see him pull one of these and try to get some the arts with his his speed 19 finds JD mckissick with an acrobatic catch as the first and and a lot more inside Utah State Territory to the 35 yard line need a big play all up JD McKissack 39 corn there the whole time never looked off there he goes holding it and Freddie Knight NASA first down run that's one of his first big carries at the night a first down run down to the 20 just speaking of is of him pulling the ball all night he's handing it off right there called the defense right up the middle you never think the quarterback will take the ball and run up the middle nice play by him and the flip to JD McKissack and breaks one tackle and break the other he's taken down by sang vigil happening tonight so we called his name tonight not just in the pregame show dragging him out of it several tackles here tonight the vigil boys Nick and Zak very disciplined never stopped working Nick initially had the tackle mystic got up off the ground hustling back Zak coming to clean up I can bobble the football I'm a shotgun staff and somehow it gets positive integers on in Denver get some yardage down to the 23 yard line Arkansas State moving the football down the Neal trying to tie the game up again 142 and 9 record in this one facility since 2005 third down and 12 nitin in trouble and tries to keep his balance and he can't do it tackle for a loss Frankie sutera brings him down pretty night dropping back trying to find Trey as Houston they on the slant just couldn't find them in time under the rest Tori green with the pressure being able to bring with an arm tap it Freddy Knight and down Luke Ferguson will try a 44 yard field goal from the left hash Steven Hogan will hold it for it it's a line driver and the kid is no good with important Poole Murchison missed a couple Emil calls last week at Miami and misses a critical one right there early in the fourth quarter still 147 Utah State on the road on top who's responsible sort of moving off the wall before the break a missed 44 yard field goal by Arkansas state's Luke Ferguson keeps the score at 14 to 7 Utah State with the lead Aggies have never trailed in this game tonight it's been a defensive slugfest to get the ball to Jo Jo Nansen and the wide receiver goes down if some kind of bounds no game of the play in fact he lost about three yards this rain Wolf's defense is still playing hard playing to the wheel so he was drinking this play out the best thing you won against the speedsters just make him keep having to bounce it out right there the Arkansas State defense doing this job second and 12 five wide receivers including the tight end in motion there in Wyatt Houston quick throw Ronald Butler he had a touchdown grab a moment ago he gets out of bounds near the first down marker pushed out by bunny hunter the strong safety of Arkansas State nice draw back by garrison delivering the ball as he has all night in the area of the body and with touching up that the receiver can catch it comfortably and get up yard and use a speed grading third and short right here vagus yes third and less than they are to go we'll call it third in about half a yard for the first down for Utah State Katzen quick handoff to the line hunt and he fights forward to the first down at the 39 yard line they'll move the chains in a new set of downs for the Aggies hunting hall tonight combined with a decent job while hitting the ball in there running strong making some nice adjustments as the game goes on as a combination doing a good job for Utah State and Milan hunt keeps it on the ground and it gets taken down forward progress though has stopped it the 42 Saviour Woodson 455 on the tackle for Arkansas State Savior Woodson 6 1 to 15 looks like he's about 225 plays very physical for a small linebacker a nice hit and a hole right there by him on second and seven little quick pitch to under shot the man in motion he gets taken down by freaky checks in and Chris stunned the first couple of guys there and and take him down for a loss of the play big play by asu's defense discipline discipline discipline cristal checking his keys staying in his holes same discipline good enough feel and make them attacking good play by him so loss of five yards brings up third down and 12 for Utah State must get to the 49 yard line of its own territory for the first down incomplete on the inside slant receiver screen looking for chocho Nansen and a big stop by Arkansas State on defense brings up fourth down the Utah State all night hasn't looked very comfortable in third and long situations once again third and 12 not being able to convert Arkansas State and still is playing tough regardless of the score given there off as a chance plays Taylor for Arkansas State waiting to receive the punt he's standing at his own 25 that's been Trude it's away a high punt as a sideways roll and downed by Utah State by Marwan Evans at the 33 yard line inside of eight minutes to go here in the fourth quarter it's still 147 Utah State is the Utah State upcoming schedule by week next week and then finally playing a conference game the first time and all season October 3rd at BYU you see the rest of the Mountain West schedule nurse an impressive teams on there at BYU at Boise State it's a tough road ahead for them once they get inside their conference mainly because they got to do a lot of work on the road penalty flag comes flying in this first play of the drive trying to get the players name right it's the second time we've seen that tonight Wayne delay of game on the defense for messing around with the signals and another fiveyard penalty in Arkansas state's paper something we have probably haven't seen in the last ten years we've seen twice in one game Utah State calling out plays trying to get the offensive line the jump is Justin white breaking to the outside and almost broke attack though he goes down and mid field a first down for white and Arkansas State trying to tie the game up on this drive inside 7:45 to go big key to any up tempo offenses you got to get that first first down right there Johnson white finally getting to the outside finding some room to show his speed big play for Arkansas State Darian Chris wall the tight end he's caught two passes tonight he actually free passes the seeping and he goes down but he has a first down Darian Griswold only six catches on the season so far big things were expected of him he still has a lot of time and this season to live up to that building and this game alone already has three catches one negated when he ran for 750 yards earlier in the game bio penalty Johnston white the ballcarrier as he fights forward across the 30 down in 29 Arkansas State just keeps moving that football down the field and an injured man number 70 Travis C melts that gun nose guard is shaken up this is a huge drive for Arkansas State the clock is getting a little tight and that angler you really can somebody just got tripped over hey man maybe twist his ankle always massaging his calf ah he's cramping talk about when the game started August Allstate wanted to keep that up tempo because when you're playing a threefour defense especially in the middle with the middle three guys you have a lot of beef in there it just feels cramped Travis seatbelt six to 310 a junior at of Peoria Arizona academic all Mountain West Conference member the last two seasons doing well on the field and in the classroom Octus allstate keeping the pressure for c4 hell could even get off the field they're already lined up and ready to go it's second down and six knightly keeps it himself LT pedagogy does make vigil and Frankie Sutera I'll take him down inside the 25 ever the 24 Friday night and pulling the ball keeping in his self Thank You positive yardage something he hadn't done all night Brandon Piner trying to make something happen Jukes to the outside and he's inside the 20 to the 19 it's enough for an Arkansas State first down there in the red zone trying like crazy to try and tie this game up here at home a 631 to go running back by committee on both sides to the Paul yep running backs running hard whenever the Delawares call good run right there Johnston white goes up the middle and gains a couple down to the 18 yard line made of wall a Utah State has never trailed in this game that's seven to nothing a halftime led 14 to 7 after three night it quick throw incomplete on the right side bring him third Danity looking for JD McGee Singh you saw state's defense coming with the Blitz on the backside I run away from it just couldn't deliver the ball on the move a little rushed on that throw finite now they officially call it now third down and nine Nitin here comes the pressure and the pass is incomplete he was looking for johnston white but Tori Green came with the pressure that hit number 39 for Utah Steve and white here's a look at it Toby Creek oh he almost trip he became so free getting to the quarterback just got to the ball too fast even on the screen you need a little time somebody has to bump him Arkansas state seems like they're going forward here on fourth down now the kicking game has not been kind to the Red Wolves the last couple of games here they go down seven third quarter 544 to go gonna go for it on fourth down and nine and a timeout taken I believe by Utah State belts by Arkansas State brought very interesting with three timeouts and almost six minutes still in this game just not trusting your kicking game let's coach Anderson is usually right here you put three on the ball and that you defense best is when you're deep has been playing go out get a stop and try to win at the end he's born for it right now deep and Utah state territory we invite you to share your comments photos and final score predictions on Twitter follow along tonight's game with hashtag USU versus AR Estie but Anderson a guy that really paid his dues get that first head coaching job 17 years he spent as an assistant coach in the Division one ranks the last four years as the assistant coach and offensive coordinator for Larry Fedora at both North Carolina and at Southern Mississippi at his first career win three weeks ago now trying to get win number two tonight night and on fourth and nine to the end zone that pass is incomplete to the clinic comes in and it'll be face guarding face starting today on Utah State that'll be at first down good lemur stand go big break for the Arkansas State offense JSU Kevin centers in great position on the play tries to get his head around the seat of ball but before he could do it he runs into the chest of Darren Griswold big penalty inside the 2 yard line for the this offensive really needed a break on that play has to punch this in right here to tie the score but only 5 37 s in the game markets off state once the 7 and not the 3 here they're in great shape first down and goal to go from the 2 they gave to Johnston white and he lost yardage lost to denim the poor yard line every second down and goal from before this Utah State Aggies defense is come a big all night once again trying to step up to the plate and hold this Red Wolves offense out of the end zone the defensive front of the Aggies played big big play right there by Travis cave who's back in the game see failed state dispensing wait for this third rushing touchdown of the season and a chance Boreas here to tie it up and now the Ferguson will come on in for the extra point a try and tie up the game officials timeout or a replay review we go to the replay to see if he got in before the knee went down but even though we're clearly way up here looking pretty obvious to us he was in the floor that he went down I think this call is going to stand we'll take a look Johnson white right side just everybody blocks down pick up who you see right no left guard Devin will be pulling around big time trap play just quite just hidden behind his enough guard its touchdown the first thing that came down was his hand and that ball was already across them waiting to go about it oh sure before I had a drink the replay but they say the call stands and now the extra point attempt by Luke Ferguson of Arkansas State big big drive by Arkansas State right there Brock capitalizing on the penalty punching it in to tie the school and Ferguson things at 3 never tie game but at 14 err but under five minutes to go in the it's been an uphill battle all night long for Arkansas State but for the second time in this game the Red Wolves have tied the game up here at home you can see coach Anderson Palace I will relief right there even on the extra point kicking J hat so shaken up he's not even testing yet your points we talked to him yesterday in his office and you know he's just a just a regular good old guy just a football coach likes to talk football likes to make us feel welcome and every time we come to Arkansas State everyone makes us feel very welcome some good southern hospitality and this red wolf team having to figure things out on offense all night tonight and finally they've made it happen twice with touchdowns in the second half they were scoreless in half number one give them hospitality they keep giving us those gift baskets though crowds we're gonna yeah we're gonna end up leaving you know I don't know feel the jog around but each time we come here they give us a nice little gift basket for the room thank you to Arkansas State gennadiy Williams Kelvin Lee back to receive the kick for the Aggies Luke Ferguson will kick it away for ASU this will go into the end zone and out of the game zone for a touchback in Utah State will have the ball first and ten at its own 25yard line there comes Darell Garretson filling in for the injured Chuckie Keeton you got a wonder at Wayne what this game would be like what the offense would look like tonight against Arkansas State's defense of a healthy Chucky key we're on the field is a very very good deal threat quarterback well with the Joe he'll being out we definitely feel like he could have been played a big right now they're getting it done by committee it's dialing up a Beck's number Darryl garrison has played big today that's the play big right now a nice ax Chris stone and Dexter black been taken down for Arkansas State huge play above the ASU defense slow developing play here by the Aggies and fakes just pressure off the in our town everybody was coming to the kitchen on that play great play by Chris stone who's been playing big from the imposition all night loss of eight wins at second and an eightteam Barrett's in finds Kennedy Williams out of the backfield and androids high stop say the cooler drag race snap at the 16yard line in the ASU crowd on its feet here in James Brown tie Ron Artest Brown who can go out and be kidding out of the second beer tonight Krystal hustlin chasing the down from the backside every time I come to clean it up he was play here for the Aggies Jordan forever wasup down at nineteen five wide receivers for Utah State and a timeout taken by the Aggies a Utah state line of scrimmage is the 16 and a jaw state has to get to the 35 yard line for the first down this could be a huge let me go for both teams third and 19 we like to be able just don't you know draw full screen right here that's the Jesus is playing you want to make sure whatever you do is safe the defense did you have that you able to play on to the next nap right here you can't afford a turnover if you Utah State it's been impressive with Utah State has time tonight just really controlling the tempo and the beam at this game the market so states been very aggressive as well in the second half Utah State at halftime pointless under coach Matt Wells the last two years third and nineteen Garretson pass cut by hunter sharp but well short of the first down marker and Utah State has to pick it away perfect perfect defensive technique on this give up anything shallow of the sticks and just come up and make the tackle on a sharp coming all the way from other side of the few arc says Brown once again chasing him down to make the play Sharon Behn Trude he bobbled one snap which eventually led to a quick Arkansas State touchdown earlier in this game this time he gets it away with no problem this is a beauty plays Taylor from the 27th when of a flag goes down he's out of bounds at the 40 flags all night on the field it has a bit bad lease between the two teams maybe about 15 penalties during the kick holding receiving team number seven that 10yard penalty will be assessed from the end of the kick first down 10 outfit is a little one time now for the top of the line impact performer and tonight's Capital One impact performer is Justin white throughout the game tying touchdown on the previous drive for ASU and he is getting close to a hundred yards rushing on the night dr. Bryce Villa man just right here from Michael Gordon he's been out last couple of weeks running hard between the tackles doing well his call to him whether his blocking running screens are running out wide I ten on the quarterback keeper and sack vigil we've called his name sometimes tonight he takes him down for a short gain down to 23 two and a half minutes to go Arkansas State all we needs a field goal to take the lead it has one timeout remaining in its pocket Utah stay here showing blitz Friday night and checking out of the plate I didn't quick throw tres Hewson he's got it man lowers that shoulder he's got the first down as the dirty and a new scent announced for Arkansas State they'll stop the clock and move the chains first and ASU nice play call they're about 90 the clock is clicking here I'm you saw state leads to get a little more down the field I know you only need a field goal but you need more big chunk two yards here with only two minutes left he calls his own number keeps it himself down to the 35 yard line Jordan Nielsen up front one took him down brings up second down and five again a flag on the play not really going as fast as they need to especially the way they're kicking game is you would think they could speed up the pass tapped by Darian Griswold the tide in it's incomplete looked like he took his eye off of it in the last second Darian Griswold out of to miss Arkansas drops the ball now brings up third down and five yards to go Friday night needs to be dairy couples this ball Utah State is known for interceptions and it'll be Flags come in this might be on our estate all fart up empty I'm a 95yard number gopher down that's the tight end again Terry and Griswold he moves too soon so now third down and ten damn session on my patient Blake ended for either one of these coaches something tells me is gonna be a lot of running all these false starts and Gentiles in this game Ayten stay in business danny has the place down he biddies himself after dropping a ball and giving a false start penalty just the first day at mckeil nice fake giving Darien Griswald time to get across it feel this time secure in the catch to the wine to the pain of one to the fifty we walk home brings up second down and nine or approaching one minute remaining in the game could we see over time here in Centennial make stadium in Jonesboro very surprised at the temple Arkansas state not really getting to the ball and getting the play out not much of a sense of urgency here as night must the football and he's picked up by Utah State they just slipped out of his hands and Utah State has recovered with 47 seconds to go that's the second time tonight this is happening he saw his receiver going on a double move coming open right here he sees his receiver coming open he decides he's not going in the ball just slips out his hand the receiver was there he was open he just didn't throw the ball got his hand and now Utah State with it at the Arkansas State 38 yard line 47 seconds to go two timeouts all it needs is a field goal to take the lead and possibly win this game a third time in the last two games that net he's had the ball slipped out of his hands two of those three times 20 city lights on first down Garretson quickly froze and it's landing complete looking for Joe Joe Matson brings up second down and 10 and with two timeouts garrison hasn't realized he can be a little more patient he could have taken his time right there deliver the ball you can throw the ball any part of the field when you have the kind of timeouts for just looking for about 15 yards for a good field goal attempt fortyfour seconds remaining in regulation Garretson Jojo Matson has it and keeps it as he goes out of bounds happy 31 garrison steps back there was a strike I don't know how you find a man this fivesecond on the side he was able to great great grab by passing on that a crucial 13 three and it's cut out of the backfield by Milan hunt and Izzy have the first down it's gonna be close they say yes he got it by a yard new set of downs for Utah State nice read but they are garrison 100 so word about kids out of bounds even realized how much he had in front of it if you try to score you might have ended this game real quick 36 seconds to go Garretson out of the backfield again as LaVon hunt she breaks a tackle and then is forced to the bounds by Xavier Woodson of Arkansas State Park stops with 30 seconds remaining right here you expecting probably a draw cause you already in field goal range good balanced by hunt catch the ball take the hit put his hand down the stabilising realize you still have some room in front of him get up feeling it out of bounds second and six one hunt finally gets taken down Xavier would sing short gain of one brings up a critical third damn clock running with 15 seconds to go no one taking a time out yet and Utah State gonna run the clock down and call timeout just a couple of ticks left they'll set up Utah State trying get out of Jonesboro with the W all this set up for at night fumbling the ball as you said third time in two games twice tonight get the ball of the slipped out of his hand one for definitely something that him and the coaching staff won't have to address just a bad break here for Arkansas State if Utah is able to kick this field goal and win the game the ball is spotted Nick Diaz was I again when he filled yard attempt so win the game Diaz for the Lannisport by saving here's played by the special teams alert it's lust hate the home cookin continues for ESU coach Anderson has been a little nervous about his all kicking game all night this Utah Aggie team is their chance nice block bad choice to go back and play with the ball by Chris Oldham get away from the ball in that situation that the ball be down what a break for this for the last quarter yeah I talked to the Arkansas state radio playbyplay man Matt stoles before the game and so what are your thoughts on tonight which a prediction he said I think Arkansas State's going to win in and he said triple overtime he may be he may be right you think we may be here a while but that's okay we're having a good time at Centennial Bank Stadium in Jonesboro overtime coming up here's Utah state's upcoming schedule once again a bye week next week and then at BYU Air Force at Colorado State the games on the road at Hawaii and Wyoming and then the season finale regular season finale at Boise State you know he's out of state Mike's do well again and end up at the Mountain West Conference title game just like a year ago when we play defense like Utah State you always gonna be yourself a chance the adage of defense wins championships we definitely proved you take this defense against any team 14 points tonight on the road 50 has an Arkansas state also has a bye week next week and then it plays its conference opener against Louisiana Monroe on October 4th and then the three straight road games at Georgia State and Louisiana Lafayette that's a tough place to play at the kibbeh dome in Idaho and then South Alabama that's a good team Appalachian State near to the league and near to the FBS at Texas State and then New Mexico State comes here also near the name Sun Belt Conference are the Aggies OH NNs you yet only thing that's positive about that is three of the last four before three games on the road in a row makes all those games tough opponents over time here in James burrow as you know to be equal possession from the opponent's 25yard line the captain's for both teams come out of the field to try and decide who gets the ball first who's on defense first it's already been a threeandahalf hour game and the fans gonna get some free fun number time look in this overtime period Utah State in the last field goal block neither coach problem is too confident in their kicking game so you watch out for a big play somebody trying to go to the end zone get one timeout for overtime period no timeouts carryover regulation no timeouts carryover if we go into second and third overtime overtime you must go for two points on the tribe heads and tails fails what's your choice answers this choice it's heads you've one to talk you want to play defense but you know the field right so Utah State is one more toss in Rio I don't have the bottom line version which is the smarter mate because when you play defense first then you know what exactly what you have to have on offense but it's your turn with the ball often this type of deep pits you don't have a problem of playing defense first Utah state's defense fourth in the country to stop the run it's their fault their hands on balls all the time couple interceptions tonight the Arkansas State going into this overtime has a thing big it can't be thinking field goals it has to think touchdown pretty night needs to make some plays my job with JD the kids at Arkansas State will have the ball first at the Utah State 25 first down and 10 overtime session number one I didn't hands the left at johnston white my aids animal down to the 23 brings up second down and eight we mentioned it at the top of the broadcast two minutes ah state it's demons is fourth in the nation against the run night throws it into the endzone passes it's first touchdown reception of the season in some states finished in overtime Deshawn Pascal six money 197 big target downfield as we have just mentioned this Allstate needs to be aggressive they don't need to be in a situation where they try to kick field goals they can play over time going towards the end zone touchdown graduals Luke Ferguson on for the p80 Arkansas State 14 and now Utah State will go on offense it's part of the overtime the Aggies must have a touchdown to extend the gate a turnover on this possession wins it for Arkansas State a touchdown at an extra point for us it's a to double OT for Utah State their garrison them and his office has had a lot of success tonight moving the ball no choice but to get into endzone sometimes that's a good thing this is a game the Arkansas staff really he's at record at 502 and to a lhasa top six of the one Jean as a buy week next week and off the to the net city nearly games line down to the 24 yard line brings up second down and nine by the Roland Joan's on the tackle for Arkansas State nice tackle Utah State trying to get the ball to their Bigfoot player and Jojo nothing right there on first down Garrett said under pressure comes it off but it's incomplete dizzy through its Brinson thirds out and nine the second error of August I'll stay great coverage only that means plenty of time to find somebody just nobody walking looking looking looking next backside pressure garrison in his office for Utah State Barrett's into the right side it's cut to turn at Sinise short of the first down it brings up fourth down and one the biggest play of the game coming over right here nice glowing tip between Jojo Matson and Darryl garrison to set up this court in one situation that twice before Utah state is Guinean against his defense and penalty flags come flying in and we have a false start penalty on Utah State prior to the snap false start up in 83 I'm you're filming there for town so stop by Arkansas State and the game is over first down by Utah State the game continues down and six that says they tied at7 down 14 sided tie to the courts those 21 to 14 going to a play Darell Garretson that he's run all night delivering the ball just a big kid can come up
