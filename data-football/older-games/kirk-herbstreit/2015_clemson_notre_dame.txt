============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on 83 something rare and special in Clemson tonight they've waited forever for this event but a Fighting Irish to return the faithful undeterred their spirits undampening flooding downstate a heavier deluge is due here later two playoff contenders must step forward and prove it right now never days versus Clemson Death Valley is alive and electric the moment is here a clash of two teams who haven't faced one another for nearly 40 years leave it all on the field tonight on Death Valley and the implication star opportunity to make a statement take this football team spirit the numbers which the Irish are still struggling to find their identity and tonight they place their faith in the hand of a freshman facing a Clemson Tiger squad playing with myself when the lights are on totally got greatness in you but you've got to make a decision to be great numbers welcome the ranks we'll be defined with their rankings and pride on the line tonight hello and welcome to a special Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo and this presentation of the SEC on ESPN a heavily anticipated collision of shoes hot 12 teams the M defeated six ranked Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and Excel Frank Clemson Tigers and welcome first our Herbstreit Heather Cox will join us it is hard to overstate Kirk the energy the anticipation for this game Joe Montana was the hero the only other time Notre Dame came here it's been that long there's so many elements tonight including the elements the rain started to come down it's good to get much worse in a while here hey you know it's something to keep an eye on obviously when we're hearing maybe the second half it could get really nasty for now it's raining as you can see that front is moving this way but at the same time for instinct early it's about your footing it's about taking care of the football especially with this kind of atmosphere who's going to make a mistake early is the weather going to contribute to that later both quarterbacks day they can handle the weather he got the to DeShawn's you know about Watson but in some kinds of proceeding with Malik failure went down in Virginia he was the hero he's got two home wins but this is a little different isn't it yeah and I really think Notre Dame is a group spending on the most resilient teams in college football in first month and a lot of that has to do with the way that Sean Kaiser stepped up in that game in Charlottesville differently when he came in brilliant never taken a meaningful snap and Frank Kelly told us himself he didn't know how he would respond he converts on a fourth down on a scramble I'm in this master will forward for the touchdown they're able to get out there with a win it's going to be different tonight I think he needs to rely on CJ Prosise one of the most gifted running backs with Carson season so far in college football take some of the pressure off him I think Brian Kelly goes for that high percentage throws just to kind of settle in but make no mistake at some point they're going downfield because that's who they have become as an offense with him a quarterback you know approach size six hundred yards and four games no Irish back has ever had war in the first one but it's tough to run on Clemson what about you son watch that it's been a quiet start sadistic lead for him you know a couple of very easy games and then Road win at Louisville it is more gifted young quarterbacks that I've in a really long time and it because he just sees the feel he played in his name office when he was in high school so I think his learning curve was very quick and it allowed him to come into this this season last year instead of when I had an injury and I think the big thing is now is he brings all three things that you're looking for in any quarterback running any system and s Markowitz and awareness when you're going to tempo off is it look how calm you it's nice to have a quarterback seen the field make the wit decision to be able to get the ball out quickly the second thing after awareness is decisionmaking any quarterback D be able to make good decisions obviously to Shawn that the real shrinkages and in order to find the open man the last thing is the accuracy I haven't shown it yet the way he did last year but I know he's anxious to have an opportunity tonight against the Notre Dame defense I really would feel person when you look at this game on a mother from exo standpoint I think it could be hard for them to run their tailback Wayne gentleman in this game because Notre Dame is so gifted in the front seven I think you things need to show once and wonderful fall a little bit more and then up on the perimeter to try to make the big plays in the past yeah they get some gifted skill players on the edge don't they the Irish Sea flicks for the most part has been really South except for the occasional laughs and letdown they'll be on guard tonight position exactly what you want to do is you want to show enough window dressing different formation run the football and at deshaun Watson had an ACL surgery in December they've been protecting him tonight I think they'll turn him loose you mix in some of that and then you take your shots downfield 15 Clemson very tough at home Irish not a great road team but it's a tossup game virtual cost up tonight here in Death Valley the real Death Valley's once again the center of the collegefootball universe you're gonna happen to everything that you have this seems good it is on fight Notre Dame or the ACS people it should be vying for that playoff spot this game screams playoff implications doctor did Jesus picket and that's the truth this was a tough ticket I can you turn get to done it and then containing me forward leave it all on the field have no you John thank you the Clemson Tigers Kirk have waited 16 days since their last game that when an Louisville and it's almost game time deshaun Watson licensed candidate went to break loose tonight yeah no doubt about it this football team I love their approach demos telling us is almost like a free season we had 16 days it was almost like we went back kind of self evaluated where are we strong where do we need to improve and they use that time there's two weeks to get ready to go and now they're just ready to explode onto this field and play Bevo has said treated like any other game it does not feel like any other game now Notre Dame and Clemson Tigers await their dramatic entrance welcome to the docket effort championship drive game of the week Tiger Stadium awaits the Clemson Tigers make a very short but intense bus ride from the locker room on the west side I ran into the eat not Clemson and how it's wrong some players very quiet some rowdy and that rock from Death Valley California right here almost a half century ago and place to the top of the hill one of the most electric rituals in court I think this is one of the more anticipated entries in the country and just wait for this all week the Tigers have come running down that hill they will hear Tiger Rag they will carefully descend the hill and a floppy evening you behave nobody mystic grandeur entrance and the Tigers in Death Valley we have more caution on the descent with a wet field to our youth the same curve some guys taking their time and others still T they can't help the emotion coming down that hill I can the Tigers he fuels use this energy the Irish have not been a great road team but when we talked about Virginia NAFTA sprink of five straight losses on the road so there's something for this Notre Dame team to prove and yet at the same time it's interesting Brian Kelly this week using the Florida State game in Tallahassee last year in a game that they competed and they had a chance to win it came down to that one play and he felt just that experience in a tough environment in a similar a these matchup he felt that that was enough to be able to tell his team hey we can win and these kind of games not to mention the LSU game in their bowl game away from their home stadium liked about the suit is John born four months apart lives are there and Watson her buddies from their high school days of the elite 11th quarterback damn mourn that as it unfold the intrepid and always prepared Heather Cox is on the sidelines with Brian Kelly heaven Chris thanks so much coach we talked about the difficulty preparing for this environment especially with an inexperienced quarterback what have you seen today leading up to this moment that gives you confidence in Deshawn Kaiser was alone up to this moment so we'll see what happened but it was a pretty boys candy the mature kid he knows what to expect he's going to have to go in there man the offense because it's not going to get any quieter out here so it is probably how fathers would replace brawling keep requirement you know he knows what he's getting for and coach telling we knew this weather was coming you guys practice with footballs all week but how does this weather affect the way that you call this game well I mean obviously the bill conditions are pretty good right now so we'll run our offense we may have to go underneath center a little bit more be careful you guys take care of the football in these conditions George thank you so much for your time and guys certainly with this inclement weather comes some changes down here on the field both teams will go to half inch long spikes the maximum allowed by the NCAA also both teams are using a 36 game balls they expected three times more than they typically use the 12 on a dry day now the officials will try to change out the ball after every play that the pool of course get wet and heavy another like this yes use finger suppressors to have success that most weenies cookies team Heather indoors to practices they did water down the footballs Kirk to do a simulation of these conditions if you can in practice yeah and it's just by dumping a dry ball into a bucket over the course of an hour hour and a half practice is not it's a good it's a good attempt by both these teams but it's not going to prepare you for what you're going to see tonight on this natural surface Irish won the toss to forego comes them to get the football and Tyler Newsome who doubles as the footer will kick it off to begin this North versus South flat your kick in the fine receiver our Tabas from the five has a brief and breaks down across the 35 deshaun Watson III sees an ACC Player of the Year goes to work right now it's important for both these quarterbacks to settle in and that's the play callers on both sides know that with the weather like this the emotion deshaun Watson typically stays very calm that's his trademark aren't on him even though he's very young is only a sophomore but I look for they've also to take some chances on this first possession if they get the opportunity to be tossed in the open Chris Notre Dame's big giving up some big plays and comes to wants to try to take advantage of that despite the weather his first play empty backfield and five receivers for Watson and he takes on fundamental Watson breaking free across midfield clashing to speed down the sidelines and run out the park of her friends and we talked about him in the open about running the football could be a tough night to run the ball and look into numbers there's no linebackers by having the five receivers out wide it meant nobody in the middle of the minute linebacker Joe Smith wanted list from the right but they got to the left ended up showing what he can do his knee is healthy they told us they were going to turn him loose and on the very first play a huge game for deshaun Watson 38 yards now it Stallman the hard running steady tailback through muscles down to the 20yard line Bauman is a sophomore for George you just doesn't quit on run no I say it's the footing and attraction in the trenches we've watched games you and I all afternoon and one of the things that came up was washing the linemen you think about the receivers and a quarterback in the ball but it's really the linemen and being able to get leverage in pushing a 300pound body and trying to get it to go where you want it to go the advantage you would think would be Notre Dame Mike who's got it he just throws it away the offensive line that has no starters back from last year Ryan Norton their Center was the only returning starter but he is an MCL sprain so there's a couple of veterans up there a couple of young guys but but no second year starter no and I think because of that they rely on tempo to be an equalizer and it's a similar offense that you see when you watch Albarn it's a similar offense that you see when you watch Ole Miss they rely on the tempo and some of the trickery to be able to be kind of offset the athleticism and the speed and size of a defense the guy to watch his Sheldon day on the defensive line number 91 scouts in the backfield on 3rd and 5 when they flip it to him in the flat but he had to spin around miksa man this gets a first down god to the 12 yard line kind of an example right there what they ask from their offensive linemen on a screen pass out there they're just trying to get in the way there wasn't anybody who came up with a big block but they shielded the Notre Dame defense from and what a video Scott gets the first and now Dalton takes the handoff on first down gets the edge and dive down near the 40yard line limbs been executing well on this first possession in the rain no doubt about it and some good blocked up to the top area that they feel they have got to dominate forget about the trenches out of the perimeter time pique the receiver and leg at the tight end we reflect out to the copiers great and go picked up nice block and he threw one second down Watson had trouble collecting this Nath was an awkward to hand off to Gulman who loses a yard as number 91 or Eldon de the allamerican and he's going to be in the backfield the entire game and Clemson realizes that that very fortunate to somehow secure this football and get it into the hands of Gulman well that was a great job there by Watson to be able to get his hands on the football lipread football and get into the hands with Sheldon de got penetration through third down after the loss they need four Ronson rolls out flips it into flex gets me Gordon luggage ours for a touchdown the way you get a crowd into this football game nice job then we talked about recognizing things awareness he saw the Blitz they got one on one opportunity the linebacker could not get out in time to be able to make the play to safety I beg your pardon shumake could not get out in time he was kind of rough her screen he couldn't get out a mantoman coverage and Leggett is all alone a 64 yard drive with Greg Google the first free picker makes it 7 nothing and I receive posted have been very fast starting sir it had four straight three announce good of a consent here watch the Blitz coming from here here's the man who's going to get caught up in traffic Elijah Shumate watching tried it's like it over there one of the receivers got in his way hold him down just enough to free up leg it into the flat and watched invalid for the touchdown Tigers divert a couple third downs in their first possession Watson to Leggett for a short touchdown pass now to John Kaiser the unnoted aim quarterback will get his first possession already down a touch Emin lake if the kicker from last year comes off suspension his first action not booted away mere Carlyle average dangerous receiver takes the s25 defines his face and tiptoes out to the 25 yard line the Deshawn charm a sophomore appear with a threesport athlete at Pluto Central Catholic if six for 2:30 I think as Brian Kelly watches his every game he learns more more about what he can do and what he put he's maybe not quite comfortable with but I think Brian Kelly over the years has worked with different types of quarterbacks experience drop back boy Kaiser is athletic he's adjusted his scheme to who ties were is going to drop back quarterback for the distributor at one career path before that Virginia game feed CJ Prosise two bounces off press if they cannot get away from Travis blank let's take a look at tonight's chickfila impact players for Notre Dame on office we've talked all all night here so far about to DJ Pro size and what a great start is he is off he needs to be able to get on track to take some of the pressure off will fuller big playmaker on the outside number 7 BK could sit for Clemson middle linebackers got to be a leader in the Kennedy Alexander number two road sites again nowhere to run as the Tigers swarm in the middle will be third and long they just come right into the interior right in this area right here they're coming from the outside as well they just closed they're theirs they realize that they need to zero in right now on this running game it's wet you're on the road Funston just went up 7 nothing you're trying to ease yourself in and Brett visible to turn his defense Luci first two plays one defense last year on third down East 15 here not find anybody needs to play alive those elusiveness toby drops ten yards short of the marker this is what kaiser is going to get tonight prints from Brent Venables if they get him to third and long he showed five is if he's going to pressure blitz five and it's a sample of all two of those five drop and they're you know he's only rushing three three I'm Glenda Godsey is eight guys in coverage Kaiser had nowhere to go with the football and had to just eat it to try to pick up what he could I learn Newsome the punter for the Irish off to a terrific start averaging 47 yards a kick this is not a good one no off the side of his foot and no puppets ball back in Notre Dame territory they're still marching down that sideline to the 45 so newson we've been rock solid 52 yards of front last week bakes one 415 buns and Mac and business up a touch Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought to you by United Airlines the world's most flyer friendly airline United fly the friendly skies Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking done and needs on premier partner of the Heisman Trophy we welcome a regular guest the national championship trophy presented by Dr Pepper awarded on January 11th LenDale of course the semifinals New Year's Eve in Dallas and in Miami the Irish defense had only allowed six points in the first quarter of this season that fetch down by UMass on the final play of the quarter were used to getting off the field quickly now they're under some pressure here search function takes over after the shank at the 40 well Clemson deserves a lot of credit for the way they started the game with that opening drive but Notre Dame has got it settle in they need somebody to make a big play here to kind of get the momentum swaying the other way Domon has stopped immediately a sale on Smith the freaky on world linebacker jumped in the hole that we're talking about somebody's got to make a play we think Jaylon Smith number 9 Sheldon day 91 91 and then yet Joe Schmidt the leader kind of the glue of the defense 30a those are their playmakers up front grim forced a couple of fumbles against Georgia Tech that looms very big in that Irish home field when on 2nd and 10 playaction Watson fires downfield kiss me under Renfro then you're handed possession receiver beaked Avari Russell well the thing that stood out to me in these conditions if he gets outside they're blitzing it but how about the hands of Glencoe we can get conditioned I point the ball and makes the catch in front of Russell 24 yards puts the Tigers right back in the red zone and Watson initial traffic inside tries to bounce it and does die of forward for positive yardage feeling strip grab him but you ain't when you see him do that again we talked about his awareness and understanding of the offense they'll give him a like almost any offense in college football today they give him alerts they'll give him a run in a pass on the same play and if you just have four down linemen and one linebacker in that box area he's going to more than likely pull it down himself and run the football that's where the quarterback run game which hasn't been a big part of Clemson attacking first three games tonight it will be on display.this to give them the numbers advantage but maybe they might think the tempo down a bit with wet football not so far watson plant fight frame lock then a onetwo punch for the tigers and the irish on the ropes early now this John Watson his razorsharp distributing the ball and Clemson quickly up a couple of touchdown I think this is the deshaun Watson a Clemson fan saw a lot last year of and he hasn't quite played that way and especially their late game couple Thursday's ago against Louisville but here's just recognition soft coverage be able to get to after a low snap falls right on the money the kids got a chance to protect himself keep its feet to be able to get into the end zone but it's the timing and awareness powered by Watson hit with superior Tigers have run 11 plays and have 14 points you so Clemson storing in its first suit possession sandwiched around a three and out for the Irish it's 14 nothing quickly here like if TJ's tenders at the free use free Sanders finally wrestled out at mid fields a good field position for the Irish but when Kelly and his young quarterback down two touchdowns what now well first he's thankful that he got a huge return here by Sanders who took one to the house last week against UMass that has tremendous speed for a true freshman and has a great feel to how to make plays in the open space look like potentially faith ramps but a good nocall in that state your right now is going to settle down and and I think the big thing in this situation usually like to turn to your guy who's my goto guy your goto guy is CJ Prosise in will krohler you've got to be able to get them going here get a first down and kind of just stop complaining and just be able to get settle into your game plan first down attempt for Kaiser delivers near side because he's made by a mere Carlisle he's wrestle around the cassadee hover for an update the studio dr. pepper championship drives I'll take number three Ole Miss in serious trouble will Grier with a sports CD passed off the half this one San Antonio Callaway Hill Florida has been dealing with the flu all week for this whole miss fans probably feeling sick right now rebels down 25 nothing on ESPN Moff is alive and so is Death Valley Prosise this no running room so far Jackson junior next great defensive lineman at Clemson on the tackle and a guy to keep an eye on tonight and he'll be matched up a lot with allamerican Ronnie Stanley the left tackle from Notre Dame but again early in this game that Clemson defensive line allnew starters this year getting after that Notre Dame offensive line I received six on Thursday Kizer wellprotected delivers a strike and Chris Brown makes a first down catch inside the 40 around the senior for here in South Carolina two things that stood out to me number one the offensive line picks up pretty exotic look is some pressure but they pick it up they give him time the other thing is he felt that pressure but he didn't allow it to affect his vision he settled in showed some composure distribute that football for a first down long for the defensive end downfield to make the tackle there Kizer wrestled out of the backfield by mr. Lawson who can rush the passer he can create mayhem me strong against the run is it sort of a doitall defensive lineman and kaiser on his own Reid here gets confused he's actually reading Shaq Lawson right here he kind of gives him a little bit of this and then comes out if he comes down on the back that he's going to want to give him or pull it out at this time he comes out initially and it jumped out of the quarterback and he confuses Kaiser and her green here with too high was off the hands of Torii Hunter jr. he's lucky that was just an incompletion on its third and 13 very fortunate there was a lot of traffic in there anyway even even if he was able to put this ball on the money there was really nowhere to go that did this Tigers defense right now Chris is just swarming they have their ears spin and they are coming after the line of scrimmage it's coming after this quarterback if there's a lot to handle in your first row start Tigers show some pressure kaiser rolls away from it and delivers any complete as a flag down it was Ali's eighth Jones the talented freshman tight end from Vegas the intended receiver and Johnson Jeter Johnson was in coverage what Johnson's got to be thinking keep it number 18 automatic first down you know he just makes a mental mistake here and he's frustrated but he definitely died early to the receiver and he's in there way way too early and that's been experience he's going to try to get his body and around the intended targets there Jones and try to use his hand and SWAT at it from over top of him he's the guy that made the pick to steal that threepoint win at Louisville but the penalty loses the ball inside of 34 sight this is a guy that's averaging 150 Notre Dame's had five straight games of 200 plus yards rushing and they're just trying to get get out of the red here but again the problem you have again is they're going to make their Debrett Venables the defense coordinator from function is pretty easy what his plan is they put eight men at the line of scrimmage right now against just seven blockers so they have an extra man and they're basically telling Brian Kelly's your quarterback that your receivers are going to have to beat us and until they do we're going to continue to stack the line of scrimmage either on the loo takes his birth downfield shot and throws it over the head of Chris Brown I think I think Clemson feels very very good about the matchups on the perimeter and we've got some great matchups Tanglers Tankersley who has tested there he's been tested all year against Chris Brown but the real matchup is will fuller number seven against Mackenzie Alexander we're talking about two guys that have bright bright futures and Alexander is following him at this point all over the field whether he's on the left or the right to the field into the boundary now there's the bottom of the screen on third down there is a brass shut down corner teams rarely test him so you have that matchup unfold tonight Tiger shows the pressure up the middle Irish pick it up and Kaiser delivers incomplete delivered a hard shot that Brown couldn't gather on a wet night it's going to be tough on his receivers it sure is and I couldn't tell it been blue air who is rushing number 10 got a hand on this football right there no he did not balls coming in just fast and it was a pumper Carlisle to be able to secure that would have been a first down if he came up with it knowing all the pitcher he when he throw 94 95 in high school sometimes the changeups better than Justin youn is the true freshman kicker from Nashville he's four for six of the young season it from 46 yards he shows why he's one of the top kickers in the country good Nashville product blooms it through Irish on the board still down 11 Irish commode appeal go this is Justin Yunnan a wet track any of the winter again into the wind tough conditions freshman teams down 14 on the road you need points thrills it was the ritual that the Scott daily number 61 the long snapper and a holder half fetcher every made tick noon warns the parents of Korean distant in Ohio then move down to Nashville and not only Chris is it points but it kind of slows things down a little bit for Notre Dame just to get points on the board is this Scott a yard deep they faked the handoff and Scott has a little room chased down from behind at the 29 yard line by Nick Coleman this week on ESPN Monday Night Football to the Pacific Northwest Russell Wilson and the Seahawks Matthew Stafford got a little sore but I'll get went down hard on that Alabama today the Detroit Lions desperate for their first win it got born as behind that just Judge Georgia struggles well I think we have a new rule in the MVC Alabama is no longer allowed to be an underdog they they seem to take that to first lady you know the streak was 72 in a row right so make it another 70 do so he doubts them this is Watson on the keeper and he's knocked down the far side there by Elijah Shumate the senior safety well he's off to just a great start and and you know we asked him in our meeting about the neath we had a pl it played through it in the South Carolina game had surgery December 12 kids today whether it's college or the NFL you still come back eight nine ten months he's right around that ten month mark and tonight's first time he's really turning it loose since then Gulman a short game now Washington didn't play in the whole game the win over Oklahoma didn't do a whole lot of spring ball was able to throw in the summer Kirk but he all that time the study tape like an Advil and in bougas knowledge he's really a student in the game it's just a passion it is mentioned the high school background and running a very similar is all offenses high school coach came and visited Chad Morris took it back to high school and he ran it same terminology so when he came in as a freshman he really had an understanding of what they were trying to do but he continues to take it to the next level with film study and understanding of coverage the third third in the median for the Tigers and that one has just tossed away Scott not quite on the same page as the quarterback so on Tigers forced to punt for the first time and the Irish getting the foot down again they come up with a field goal they get a stop to different energy right now for now in this stadium and now it becomes a little bit more of a level playing field and now you try to go out and you get back to your game plan and you go out try to execute junior punters in the keys doll wonderful trying to keep it away from CJ standards already has had the big return you mentioned what a dangerous weapon he can be Sanders the freshman from California he makes the fair catch with the pedals and calexis just inside the 20 yard line 47 yards on the punt now the Irish back to work my Stanford is the offensive coordinator working actually the you know quarterback coach he's got the OC title Brian Kelly so Colin applause yeah yeah but an up incoming assistant coach and of course he was at Stanford is passing game coordinator out with David Shaw I went over to Boise State last couple years he ran the offense at Boise and Frank Kelly recognized his qualities of the coach and a great recruiter and brought him over here and is really really helped Iser with being thrown into action his development the first an attempt geyser over the middle gets made and Corey Robinson receiver who just has been dealing with a knee problem that has finally full go this week you'd love to see the patients and I love the call by Brian Kelly here's the eyes you know you don't want to stare down at Telegraph to throw but he has shows patience here for him to get into that throwing window to give himself a chance he had to clear fin go where the linebacker once he did he shows you the tactic for the football when he had time to draw either changing the play hairs that found a get louder are in motion Prosise they are all over number 22 night this might be one of those nights where you see Brian Kelly he's learning and talking to Mike Sanford he's watching everything and getting feedback might be one of those nights because of the way Clemson is choosing to defend them where you're going to have to throw on first and ten more to set up then going to go back to prosigns right now on first and ten they're facing an eight nine man front there's anticipating rolling roll the way they did on the previous plan to then set Prosise up later and spirited five times negative five yards and the Tigers shown pressure off bitch Tiger has to dodge does get away it has plenty of room geyser down to the 40yard line finally the tackle is made with DJ Goodson wisdom highrisk highreward when you're aggressive as he can rican actually run this right here with Prosise see the linemen downfield I would throw it out here he couldn't do either what if he do he runs it himself that was a play to either hand at the pro side throw it out one of these one pass options he couldn't do either so the idea is hey there's a whole dere Prosise can't take it I'll take it myself there's nobody left in the middle DJ green granted fight off the Dukes brother quarterback was able to make it tackle or Kaiser met him get running like at five Amendola offended timeout because they end up scoring on this drive that that's play that he just made that is a great example of his composure for a young guy that's never been in this setting instead of just giving up on the play or just kind of taking a knee or just digging in for a yard or two he's trying to try to pick up big yard fare that was nice this is the first visit of the irish year since 1977 this is a team loaded with NFL talent the Tigers had the lead late they're still hot about the fact that they let this game get away Vegas Ferguson met a big catch in in Montana and a couple of very short touchdown runs in the fourth quarter as the Irish came from behind I was Dan Divine's eventual national championship team to beat the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl unbelievable to think that the white Clark is on the other side how do I Clark's on the Clemson to you but of course everybody's the owners so they're together later you know a fair you know four or five years later we're best friends we're going to fighting the back of the end zone of the catch Joe got in that day but of course they looked up famously first down again Clemson showing pressure geyser keeps it this time they're all over the quarterback and they stopped them for no gain there it is first and ten you're not only facing guys in it's in the bosphorus those linebackers Boulware and Goodson they're up shooting gaps I mean they're making it tough on the offensive line and even on a zone read there's just nowhere to go and a really good job by lost and they're collapsing down on the play they're going to run their losses the local guy lost 10 pounds slimmed down a little bit this year to get even quicker but he's still very very strong against the run even the bottom of it the defensive line they're standing up both sizes stopped again in the backfield he's got nowhere to run there's you got bull we're joined by is the safety green let's watch let's breeze in here at the top and look with what he's facing he's going to get his safety come down you got linebackers coming down your defensive end standing on the end try to be an offensive lineman and deal with all that and they're just attacking downhill not respecting anything down field and Notre Dame's got to be able to capitalize on that kind of approach from Clemson on the early down they haven't yet grinded target will fuller is being guarded by McKenzie Alexander final minute of the quarter I repeat 11 on this third down our roles and throws behind the receiver and it's incomplete the rush or the tight end and Ryan Carter hammered him not a very precise throw four down thrown behind him wisher has to adjust fast to try to make a play on it could have been able to catch it but still would have been well short of the first down and at the same time you might have given Brian Kelly something to think about the possibility of maybe going for it but wisher could not hold on to that football he's not quite field goal range for you and so Newsome is on the punt trying to improve in his first ever this drops the point it's a tie and short and the Irish coverage team will tout it at the 312 ESPN college football action and take on the go the watch ESPN app streams every

road you got to do something you can stay plugged into your game Kelly is usually pretty calm with Kaiser you seem to be anything but calm distorted back to the past but there's some confusion Watson would be wondering a hand adult almond wouldn't free to take the ball but they still get six yards well you know that's there was confusion but he didn't give up on the play he takes a turn to the right Galman goes to the left and he says yeah not going to get the ball in there I'm just going to follow him ends up picking up five yards it's no white confusion with a wet football down there outside your 10 yard line I've just the young goal nurse on the lead in the final seconds of the first quarter so clemson sport quickly led 14 nothing the irish tack on a field goal back after this message and a word from your local ABC stations you start of the second quarter on Saturday mad football and ABC presented by Wells Fargo Tigers switch around backed up at the 10yard line wins if they're back now the handoff working in the middle and this is why Garmin is loved by the offensive line major doesn't quit Heather Cox as the weather games Jen there gives an update in the wind and the rain what I can't tell you sir rain has remained steady it is expected to rain a good two to three inches throughout this game and get worse in the second half but Chris what has changed is the wind has certainly picked up a disgusting about 10 to 15 miles an hour and it's expected to gust up to 25 miles an hour at times that could definitely play a role as the field it's been beautiful condition a million multimillion dollar drainage system installed a few years ago before their last excuse me since their last rain game and it's holding up great run around the edge he's got about nine yards it's amazing they haven't had a rainy game here since 2009 it really it's one way to test that field out there multimillion dollar system that they have to try to keep this field dry at least give them some traction and chance to be able to make some plays ok Octavia Scott has some live legs tonight so this once and often pistol formation wants and gives it to Gulman that's another he wrestled down hard there by Max breccia but they moved it pains again I've been really impressed with how Jeff Scott and Tony Elliot disco offensive coordinators have decided to come into this game running the football because if you look at the two sides Notre Dame's defensive line and their two linebackers Schmidt and Smith and you look at the offensive line you see a big advantage for Notre Dame but here in this first half way they have been able to control a neutralized Sheldon day and found that finding some room to run I'm looking for room to run now he'll backpedal and just lob it out of bounds yeah Chad Morris who was given a lot of credit justifiably for running this offense to confer SMU to become the head coach Scott and Tony Elliot two former Clemson playmakers now sharing the play calling duties Gonzales that Elliot's go to the overall play caller does a lot of the 1 calls and right and Scott does the pass plays it's an interesting arrangement it is and I always get concerned when you hear oh coordinator because you really want to know who's calling the shots who who's the guy that is trying to take control is not the mission filter Suga Chad Morris empty backfield and it was the design run all the way but big hill didn't day wouldn't let the quarterback get away third long and they also they're bringing a lot of linebacker pressure that's one of the things that they came in feeling that they had to do and it's kind of a staple Brian Van Gorder is try to turn Joe Schmidt loose ooh this time they bring him up from the top and also to let Jaylon Smith kind of clean it up one thing I'm stated Jaylon Smith is starting to spy to Shaun Watson Watson game is game not running a lot this game he has been running so they put their best athlete number nine on it exactly if there's one guy who can spy him it is number nine and it back off inside breaking free rook and that's a nice run a little use playmaker for the Tigers but on third and long they get close to the marker it's going to be fourth down now so CFO dad was in a gambling mood up 11 that's a good job of picking up some positive yards there Joe Schmidt was picked up by an ice block and Max Redfield who's been playing with a broken thumb he broke his thumb against Texas he kind of cast for three weeks they've held him out some because he hadn't been able to make a lot of tackles with that cast he came up to kind of wimp on Brooks they were lucky that it end up being a first down stopped him about a yard short and so he's delved into punt it's a good one with the women is back bouncing roll dead asked about the 10yard line I thought it was touched at the ten are going to sputter at the five so poor field position on a rainy night for Kaiser yes be thankful for net one of the few backcountry we've got off to a better start than CJ Prosise for Notre Dame but he has gained negative 5 on 6 carries yes one of his six years actually gained yardage he's got it again and this is that's the run of the night so for Notre Dame and the reason is we talked about first in 10 what Clinton defense is done tonight is there they're crowding the line of scrimmage and they're shooting gaps with linebackers and safeties and they're winning that battle they're willing to take chances against a young quarterback because they assume the pro side is going to get the ball and early downs they're leaving their defensive back to isolated oneonone I think the guy we have not called yet I'm sure Notre Dame fans at home were saying where is will fuller whether it's a quick brain or something number Seven's got to get his hands on the ball guys there's nowhere to go on second and 5 Travis blanks came around the edge damn fuller with 22 Texas coming in an injury for that using defensive Austin Bryant a true freshman backup defensive end helps to the trainer's table we could talk all we want about what's wrong with the owner dean's office why aren't they giving Prosise through but again it's 15 and it's right now it's the way they've crowded it and take an advantage rather let me go then it will bring some heat right now I don't think he will you're right they only rushed for Heiser have some time and completes it on the far side there Torii Hunter junior bins across the 30 so that time with plenty of time Kaiser makes a good throw well he motions him over and he has soft coverage on third down that's one of the few times we've seen soft coverage and it's a mismatch with bull we're trying to stay with Hunter he locked in he finds him and again when he had time to throw and he tested see he's going to put the ball on the bunny let's see if they go play action here give fuller a chance the 16 got 16 yards instead they needed to precise this time does get around the edge they offered not quite full we're on the running back being his lotta like number 10 but I do I just don't want one I can't think about what they lost last year and look how he failed to be he's coming around he's got tremendous speed he exposed his left shoulder right in to the headgear there the shoulder of CJ Prosise it located he hit that shoulder found a bow on a scooter some hard hits that Bulgin he really emerged stepping in there to defend risky step on in city and linebacker and Vic Beasley and Grady Jared up front it was seven of their top ten defensive linemen this is a completely new defense with the exceptions it's a handful of guys at a hurry the Kaiser not spot the play clock here comes a flag killing play again didn't get to come out one quarter bun oh sure again Brian Kelly understood coming in that that's part of it that's why he was trying to do the best big fan of getting to play in as fast we began to give him some time to work with because he had options once he gets the ball he has to look at the defense he has to make calls so he need time to be able to be able to make those decisions once again the Irish behind the chains here suck it in 12 take right tackle Mike McGlinchey with junior tackle from Philadelphia plus the spinners head he put the down and back up his tackles had not dealt with this on a crowd Stanley on the left is it a veteran he's been kind of atmosphere McGlinchey had never been in this kind of atmosphere he's out of the in there they're working with five eight counts it's more than rhythmic saying not to mention he's worried about that defensive end lined up across from hurry again Kurt doing the play clock does he see it and as another flag a first great penalty for the thyroid offense come backwards Ellison pointblank tell us you find open to 511 you know at some point you have a delay of game that you have a lineman move and then you have another delay a game you might want to just jump in and all timeout to help him out and kind of stand let's go the filler show is go we're going and going backwards seconds and 20 to some confusion on the Clemson defense they're not really set as a snap it's a screen in the middle here Prosise runs in there heavy traffic again Carlos Watkins stopped them it'll be third and very long and get with three straight penalties like that they're getting back down to going in the wrong direction and your Clemson and you got a young quarterback get they can draw or a screen or something simple and it didn't fool anybody they were ready for the exciting let's go run it run it in third and 17 a rush for Kaiser has protection delivers a throw off the hands of fuller so the top receiver went up but could not collect the wet ball at midfield first time they even looked this way when they clear out the middle linebacker and it opens up perfectly he needed a lot of time for that play to open up but more where the middle linebacker is cleared out Jude opening in the middle of that defense that their best receiver bowler just cannot hold on to that football the guy that made that touchdown guess with 12 seconds to go that heave from Kaiser when they were in the wrong protection he just threw it up anyway but that was a costly drop now a fumble on the punt got was backpedaling it bounced off his chest looks like the Tigers retained possession there so they dodged trouble Brooks on the recovery there that could have been a momentum changing fly but Clemson keeps it you Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Michelin a better way forward and Buick proud partner of the NCAA 143 Clemson our Tector pepper tip which deprived game of the week ever go camping in the rain now a lot of it you never have now never I never have across from a stadium I don't know hopefully you have the app you have the app you're good but a lot to see for Clemson fans so far you go back to work here in a first down row Watson again hi it's just uh fun receiver that's a nice soft throw really should have been caught there by Deon Kane is a very hyped true freshman receive yeah and you're not going to find a quarterback that throws a more catchable ball then deshaun Watson he puts that ball right there Cain's a true freshman by the way came they feel with Mike Williams out for the year they feel they D on K at six to two hundred pounds of the true freshman needs to emerge to become one of their vertical threats down field number eight that at Tampa Watson there was a little Buena spin picks up about three it'll be third down I came into this football game we talked about not burning it loose with his legs not needing to in their first couple games it's doing it a little bit the Thursday night that they play Louisville but tonight it's been a very different look and we kind of anticipated that he already has six carries on the night for 50 yards Irish show pressure up the middle Mitch chases down the quarterback who flips a screen and a heavy traffic Gulman was there but so are a bunch of Irish defenders as day was involved quickly well Gulman is going to try to work here to get out but here comes the Blitz and nobody picks him up they just shoot him right through the a gap he's trying to get the ball out there and obviously when you blitz the linebackers as two would have gone in a over being right yeah that's been fast that's right if he would have dumped that out there but he had just enough time to Feldman would have been able to get out there clean there's nobody left a risky defense they brought the pressure and it works out Joe Schmidt opposed he loves to play in the rain never get a chance to in Orange County in California this is this kind of night enforces the incompletion I mean the punt the Irish again will just let it roll dead back inside the 15 the midway 2nd quarter Clemson still protecting that 11 point lead 52 yards in the fun ladies to a good start now Allen part of that same elite 11 quarterback class both of these quarterbacks here tonight Kizer this protection and delivers again high and off the hands of the receiver there I was Chris Brown on number of drops for Notre Dame tonight Heather excuse me it's that sort of a perfectly epic fellow what does he have for us here and that was time for tonight's Aflac trivia question Notre Dame has had seven Heisman Trophy winners in their history Clemson none which to Clemson players have his highest agent Roca finished two guys who finished second here is a completion the Torii Hunter junior will ponder that as the Irish do move the chains here you get out of danger three receivers working from the left to the right who picked the right one in the middle that was able to get a little bit of separation and put the ball right where it needed to be then get those that's going nope flags come flying is Kevin da the other book in opposite Lawson invades the battery this is the defense that was number one of the country tackles from West here offense number 56 about that late the claw perfect that group was manhandling Texas in Georgia Tech it's a totally different story for the oline oh yeah I mean it not only is it a different story as far as being on the road you don't have Malik Dyer who's a door threat guy you got a young quarterback on the road and right now this defense is assuming run on first and ten it makes it tough on him up front they lose seven on first N&amp;R Kaiser delivers a strike and the catch is made finally they involved will fuller for the first time a tackle for T so makes it third and manageable by far the cleanest uniform on the field until that play right there it finally gets involved he missed one on the last series how about Kaiser hanging in the pocket just long enough to get that football out he was a little bit late on the throw and he finally finds fuller to get a chance here leads on third in another second app config of this season against the corner McKenzie Alexander flags begin clumsy with crowding the line yes McGlinchey is second time they are really struggling up front you got to remember if you're at home watching this you've been working all week on a silent count and all of a sudden you can't hear you're worried about this guy going around you know that he does this and you start to flinch and you get called for it it's because of the atmosphere gives it crowd and assist there's a difference between third and grade third Nate geyser gets the right here's another flag to get to get a hold in the backfield in the quarterback escape he does get first down yardage but this is going to come back Clemson's guys are are whipping him up front the Irish getting rattled and that was a great matchup because Ronnie Stanley against Shaq Lawson and Shaq Lawson Lowell the battle offense number 50 he's been a beast tonight he's got three and a half tackles from off already Chris watch Jack Lawson at the top of his spin move spin move right there two offensive linemen they both had to hold and rape tackle to pay form look at that Stanley you're talking about Friday families may be the best left tackle in college football check off to where the central goes right by him it was alive but he was hot jack one of his staff further down and long again imprecise and not escape wrestles down again by the six five safety day on Kurt so it's for fast yeah rush three drop a great thing about that is even if they Roger you have eyes on the football they rally to the ball and Brian Kelly there is just saying you know what we're going to go into putts a football play field position with 4:30 to go see if the defense can get a bout and people we can get one more chance with better field position you have to have a conversation with those big linemen over there Kelly did it before when vice and they came off the field this may be even more intense there's a punch bounced around down there looked like a touch somebody they didn't they didn't pick it up that way and the Irish you're going to down the ball at the 8 yard line he wants it off it touched his gunner Farley who was down to safety or if it may hit the Clemson player who was blocking him I think that's not your opponent I didn't some but I thought Farley kicked it the safety Matthias Farley Davo wants an explanation 41 to see if he kicks it in a spot a yeah they're going to spot the ball back at the 27 mark fields never even came close to the football so Clemson before oh six and a half goes back on offense if Brian Kelly wanted an explanation pretty simple bias Farley the Nickelback who is down there covering the funny hit his leg and so the ball was spotted at the 29 so you're starting to add to a lead before the break when Goldman the running back has not really gotten loose tonight is one at seven times for 23 yards they give it to him for an eighth time in the heavy traffic URIs Hilary one of the talented freshman defensive lineman for the Irish on the tackle well I think Notre Dame's defense was kind of settled into the game this game started so fast with Watson making plays and it was running he was throwing and before you know it they've got their first two possessions 14 points on the board and since then you can see that Notre Dame has settled in made some adjustments and they're creating their own pressure for this Clemson offensive line similar to what their lines dealing with yes sweep motion Scott Jukes is way to the 35 it'll be third and four it's an electric gun with the ball in his hands Chris Brian Van Gorder the defensive coordinator from Notre Dame now in his second year one of the great minds in college he's been up in the NFL he's come back to it to work with Notre Dame and I he's got a great looks on his eye line but second year at his system I think it's allowed his defense to understand him and they allowed him to play much faster this year the second year if in quarters defense can get Watson off the field a third down throw was dangerous into traffic Redfield was closing in wants to knock down by day after the throw and it's fourth down I think he got away with one there Redfield is actually reading that the receivers his eyes were on the receiver and not on the quarterback and if his eyes were on the quarterback he would have been able to see that he had a chance to make the interception there's Sheldon day finally making an impact that have to get the sack but get into the face of Watson you could see the eyes of Redfield 10 he didn't even realize the ball was thrown in his direction if he would have he had a shot at an interception been gorgeous defense another positive series another punt from T's doll in a fair catch rules juggled it but recovered by CJ Sanders there we've been so busy I don't know if you've even thought about you like what let me see it bear what do you got again and now it's time to answer test I've got to really question we told you Notre Dame has had seven Heisman Trophy winners Clemson done two guys finished six it's the highest who were they the answer 1978 speed fuller 2009 CJ spiller yeah I should have got CJ spiller but six is the highest effort for instance I may be defined Watson before he's done rewards the quarterback in that game that the Montana woman is eight heroics here in 77 for the Irish to 46 to work with a couple of timeout Dodgers last the time now backpedals throws it across the middle of completion and in a hard hit after an eightyard gain beyond curse delivered this shot there in Carlisle I just cannot get over this president that the Kaiser has and we get an offensive lineman it was down whiskey is up now watch Kaiser here I mean it's incredible it was waiting and waiting and waiting and it just finds enough time here to be able to eventually find his man he got some open receivers he's just having a hard time locating it but unfortunately his offensive line he's been able to hold up there Quentin Nelson guard the sophomore is the offensive lineman down boy the last thing better Dame fans want to see is another starter they've had what six of them kapha down injuries so they'll examine that what boy Notre Dame came in here to a hostile environment inexperienced quarterback in this situation the Shawn Watson Kirk was just razorsharp the first two drives found themselves in a 14 nothing hole we though oh look out now what is Kelly going to do to get back in the game they got the three but it's been the Irish defense it's impressing me so without a doubt I think both defenses a combination maybe the conditions and not necessarily especially in Notre Dame's or Clemson's defense not necessarily fearing the pass game so it's allowed them to be ultra aggressive and they're going to be they're going to stay that way until Kaiser's eventually makes them pay for that but yeah you're right Notre Dame had a chance there for a second down 14 the crowds in the game and it's looking a little scary they got the field goal kind of settled down from that point on Brian Bank corners bunches definitely kept them in this game because going to have to make some plays along with Prosise on a windy night with a wet field field position has been important and the Irish have had terrible field position the for possession so they had to be a little bit careful they'll get the ball to begin the second half and and we'll see if CJ Prosise he can finally get loosed it'd be hard to imagine Notre Dame to be got here with a win if he doesn't do something well as I said for him to be able to start to become effective they're going to have to get the passing game hope it's going to open some running lanes around the end is hunter he takes a hit but he makes the first down two minutes to go and at the same time you don't Brian Kelley the one thing about him and he even said to us this week we've got to be patient we've got to be patient on the road with our play calling it's a four quarter game it's a 60minute game we're going to stick to our game plan guys are trying to get it to pull a kirby McKenzie Alexander is all over him and gives a little wag of the finger that's part of his game and not necessarily something everybody loves about it no no but it kind of fires them Elton he also likes to try to get to the head of the guy he's going up against it he's going up against will fuller this was the matchup he kept for quiet tonight so far almost intercepted across the middle of Boulware had his hands on it as Kaiser didn't spy on me well Boulware has had some chances and I think he's learning as the game goes on watch the eyes at the quarterback he does a good job of looking off and then then once he locates is tied in with sure who he wants to go to I don't think he ever saw bull we're just waiting there and kind of waiting for that throw he was fortunate he got away with one there this is what Kelly was fearing another 13 long against this Tiger defense Boulware shows pressure up the middle they pick him up Kaiser another high throw over the head of fuller a flag it's not coming down because I think bull where was in the neutral zone I think he may have had a three play there all five defense fiveyard penalty third down but once the Irish offensive line didn't flinch the men will give a third and more managable look now gyrus has struggled on third down at Virginia on the roto 410 they were four for 11 against Georgia Tech even though they were productive it hasn't been a great third down offense so far this year Levi is polar up here at the top tygris again showing pressure they bring a bunch of it Kaiser has time but couple receivers in the pattern now if quiet comes down in the secondary it's going to be against the Tigers defense kobalava now it's a great call Amir Carlyle was actually about to break free from Travis blanks and he got fooled and like most defenders when they get fooled they just kind of put their arm out and try to grab on and he did he locked on to a mere Carlile great call right there by the officials in the right call but one thing I'm starting to see is Clemson secondary moving after the snap and fooling Kaiser he had a wide open will pull over that time because the kill the kids gala gander bailed and he had a curl route for a first down and he never even looked that way because he lined up the way he is right now in press and it bailed like he is then he's a firsttime throw far side way over the head of fuller that's exactly this time I don't know if somebody fit the message in Mackenzie Alexander's showing press and it is the ball is snapped he's bailing which means we have the underneath route if we want him he missed the last one on third down that time he came back to me to fit the throw get the thoughts of John Saunders Brock Bay and Mack Brown on this game all the happenings in a busy Saturday the BMW halftime report is coming up minute 29 filled the break Munson had the Irish at third and ten to pregnancy's gave them them first down into Tiger territory Alexander doesn't pan out here that's the great matchup is he bail gone sir as the ball goes down field for Robinson who makes Alex August to making the catch in his hand he was running against Tankersley in the Admirals son has been nursing and he could not collect it it would have been a great catch but Chris remember I talked about this and also watch this down the middle of the field this is part of being young and being a quarterback they bring the Blitz and look right here how break free and look at this open man right there these are sayings we already had locked down on Robinson Robinson had a chance but he had two wide open receivers he never saw the gray pointy he went to the boots the third easiest guy right and then brown third and pen across the middle at Hunter making a catch but hit hard by blanks short of a first down so fourth down ball spotted in the 44 to Brian Kelly mark they've just kind of worked a little bit of clock here getting under a minute you talked about they defer so they get the ball to start the second half try to gamble here yeah I think was depending on accountant he's going to take the clock all the way down here and then probably make that timeout make a decision it in case he misses it if he ends up going for it he didn't want to give to Shawn watson much time to work with guys are nine of nineteen receivers haven't exactly helped them out it had a few clutch drops ESPN after the duck and the Fox in boulders SportsCenter on the cover with a complete postgame wrapup or some I saw this morning to think that the Buffaloes are not a very big underdog the Oregon have a chance for a milestone get capital on ranking is here he's here stapler they had to find off against the a very feisty Indiana team a lot of heart sevenpoint win UCLA now down 22 literally under this potential upset their their ohio state fortunate to get out of there with a win so make the sorely start to heat in October you starting didn't juniors their five Kirk was always got to be where we can but the outset be sure there's a recent trend good continue so the punt team out for the Irish Phillip lemon will take a timeout wouldn't figure they try to do too much no but good you want it down there you can see the intensity down there with Davo Sweeney just good to be just to be safe go punch safe and be aware that potential that that might happen Davos got a pretty good in a record heat but Sweeney against Thompson opponents when he's the lower ranked guy five and two one four know the games have been home or neutral and he pointed out to us the other day no player on this roster has ever lost a game to a team that finished a season ranked outside the top ten that seven losses the last three years but but none of those old quote unquote clemsoning losses that we know about the old days when they lose to a team they should handle ezel and lose to do for instigator of a flat three year 35 and 7 some wins over LSU over Georgia Ohio State Oklahoma the Newsome to punt into a wind it drops the point he picks a short kick but a nice roll and so inside of 30 seconds ones that will have the ball at the three yard line well tomorrow and until insiders get your day started followed by them in a soul Sunday countdown guys 10:00 a.m. for the insiders 11 o'clock for countdown Sunday on ESPN beginnings ended streaming live on watch ESPN app at Cincinnati Bengals ball club off to a pretty good start you say that every week and they they won again the defense or the bronze medal didn't it does indeed Alton Dalton was excited watching trevone Boykin and CC you did drop the hammer on the horns they were 17 30 nothing's you see what the end of the first never thought I'd ever see PC you or anybody up on Texas 32 nothing in the first quarter so safety news Watson take city boy is a fast start for the Tigers took the first possession of the end zone got a three and out and were quickly up 14 nothing but the Irish defense rose up he plumbs and only out game Notre Dame by a total of 15 yards in the first half Irish would get the ball to begin the second half the end of 30 minutes didn't Death Valley the BMW halftime report including headers interview with Davo Sweeney coming up right after these messages welcome back to the junker pepper championship tribe game of the week you'll get saturday that Football on ABC presenting Wells Fargo and his presentation of the SEC on ESPN Clemson trying to give the ACC a muchneeded signature win they lead the Irish 14 3 at halftime party mood here DJ Shaw yes we have a live match out here that you keeping it going here is it start to the party for pumps and a does quick 14 points the lead but the Irish methodically kind of getting back in at Kirk this is an offense for Notre Dame that's but hit a lot of home runs in the first four games a lot of chunk plays seven touchdowns of 50plus but only one really explosive play tonight it was a scramble by Kaiser what can they do to create more of those plays well they came into this game their bread and butters CJ Prosise and their running game and on the early downs we talked a lot in the first half Clemson is anticipating run on first and 10 and I I think that's when the chunk plays could come in a second half for Brian Kelly he's going to they're going to end up running the ball they're going to want to run the ball because that's who they are with Kaiser a quarterback but I think first and 10 you got to take a few shots against this demand coverage and count on will fuller and the other receivers getting separation against that oneonone coverage and making a play Robins the met a chance to make a play couldn't collect the ball at the goal line fuller had a big drop on the third down play at midfield isn't did that help the quarterback out of tough conditions for receivers with a wet football Clemson's receivers have had few problems relative especially early if Sanders collects it on the hop and the freshmen follow some blockers break the tackle loses the ball and Clemson says they've got it at the 30 the kicker lekha who comes off a suspension came flying down there may have knocked the ball loose I think he did he knocks it loud welcome back to the Clemson Tigers again a tough start to the season you don't expect this from a checker I mean this is incredible on a technique before his helmet right on the football and the big that is unbelievable play by the kicker in DJ Greenlee ends up coming up with DJ fuller may have been involved in the recovery as well so Notre Dame's immediately has to go on defense kirkin kind of prevent this from this lead from growing but if you're a Clemson after a big turnover like that you're here in attack mode talking to the freshman got on the pop pack and though couple of walkers out front a nice first down game before Smith got him really reminds me of how the game started Clemson got the opening kickoff and a nice return and a big run to start the game by Watson and they got the Notre Dame defense on its heels and they became the aggressor early in the game and now they get a turnover here to start the second half and right away they're there in aggressive mode Scott is in the backfield as they emotionally Gulman out and the throw is incomplete it was low and trying to come back to the ball there was jermonta hopper third and two now a double screen set up to the left and the right Thunder Dame took away our Tavia Scott and also did a really good job of taking away the receiver to the right nice defense anticipating and expecting that after the first turnover of the game and then needs to the Irish this would be a normal enormous for the Notre Dame defense to get a stop after the fumble the recorder back run was a real weapon for Clemson Scott in motion Washington does keep it it heads to the end zone 21 yards churches you're right the second half begins much like the birthday and it kind of went away from it which was surprising with the early part of the first half we saw a lot of runs from the John Watson and here on a crucial third down and started second half and get exactly the look that they want again this guy he doesn't run the globally Tajh Boyd used to with the physicality but he hits the crease that he's got the speed to take it to the end zone so Watson has grown for two and now run for one he's got 72 yards on the ground it's all because of this fumble great shot by the kicker causing it Winston jumps on top of it a couple plays later big third down to John Watson solve his own number gets the look that he needs the block stand into the end zone so Watson touchdown run bills the cushions the Tigers biggest to the night 18 like if the kicker they're going to keep CJ Sanders and the returning team and they'll be no return this time with 15 days between games they had a lot of things to work on they fired a couple of guys at the kick coverage team and they produce a turnover take a look at our Pacific Life game summary and talked about the fast start deshaun Watson awareness accuracy decisionmaking and also tonight his legs great block downfield got the look that they wanted they motioned the man over opened up perfectly how about this bunch of defense we're about to see them again making it very very tough on EJ prosign when he is running the football just nowhere to go nothing but board jerseys the Irish soda bread get the Falkirk down 14 three and now a fumble the ball is loose scooped up by curse a second turnover and clubs in a champ and a bogus open as the Irish selfdestruct then Boulware knocked the ball loose first recovered it terrible night for Prosise well it's been one of those nights for this Notre Dame all offense he finally gets a little bit of room to work with the contact for bull where the club that comes through the ball is down they had a little bit of room and there's the safety curse jumping on top of the football just say there get the ball you think down 11 to start the second half with the fumble kickoff they get it back down 18 and now in the first play cop it up well it this issue's right here to see what happens you look at all the good schools in the stakes the things that have not gone their way but this is big and I think dab low Sweeney it is all fit the coordinators they sensed an opportunity here let's see if Notre Dame's defense can step up yeah hoping it's a screen in traffic the catch is made by talented true freshman rayray McLeod but a short game the talen Smith nice job there again he's in the middle of that defense along with Joe Schmidt and when you're on the ropes like this you're on the road that's where you typically are going to hope that a guy like Schmidt or Smith our shell today can make a play to help this defense Watson gives it off the Gulman at the short game myths and Smith to buddies or they say on the same page they almost have a telepathic communication they're also golfing buddies but you're exactly right somebody right now has to try to turn momentum but this thing gets its twenty eight three and a wet yeah and you have big big buckles absolutely right that's why I'm saying that this possession right here is crucial for actually for both teams already wants to keep themselves in it and Clemson looking for a knockout punch it's all coverage at the top you'll recognize that it's actually changing the protection right now moving to tied in legen over but he's got soft coverage if you wanted to peek at the top 39 looks back to the left lobs it down the field Scott with a diving attempt could not come up with it had a chance to make up all is the beautiful pearl laid out there by whoa yeah so instead of going to up to the top of the soft coverage he decided to go to one of his goto guys Scott the ball is absolutely perfectly thrown on the outside shoulder you see the separation Scott did what he needed to do at the line of scrimmage to pull away from Luke the ball is thrown to the outside shoulder where you can go away from the defender he just what not wasn't able to hold on to the football you can't you see the rain coming down in receivers hate to have excuses we've seen some great catches despite these conditions as a receiver you've really got to lock in and focus when you have those kind of opportunities Sweeny upset you sent Gregg Hyuga line firm what would be a 52yard field goal the wind it is it is back so even though that's five yards longer than his previous best this year they didn't see the play clock running down and had to spend a timeout you don't see dad we'll get that fired up you might be thinking about dance in the locker room later but right now he he is fired up oh boy yeah we Apple out the the rayray the where you'd like to whip the nay then you'll be dancing the vapors they close this one out you can you can guarantee that oh we may pull the Navy out here on the field talking to Heather they win this game now fiftytwo yarder again we've got a tailwind here this is tough conditions zip line is the holder and it's a fake it's a punt Google just takes the direct snap and pushes it down there and shows pretty good touch quarterbacks get touched good as the kicker marks decision put a big stop by Notre Dame's defense after that turnover Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Chevrolet fun new roads Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking gun and chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich dr. pepper vintage to drive game of the week is 21 free survey the Irish turf get a date see you've had turnovers on consecutive plays here 95 yards away the rain is pouring wind in your face yeah and you're going to face the defense that's going to tennis tears and shoot the safeties and linebackers to the line of scrimmage Prosise fixed his way for one of the better runs of the night against 10 yards in the first down well that was a great job by the right side of that offense the line of opening up some room finally for CJ Prosise they got a great push and just opened that up elmer the right card McGlinchey right tackle with Rises the guy turkey you would 91 yards against sexually visit threat from anywhere on the field if they can get him a little crease like that hard earned three yards Heather well guys amazing Brian failing out of the locker room nothing he talked about nothing but the running game and then BOOM backtoback turnovers how can he find success he talks about the oline needing to block better he talked about finding the perimeter and taking advantage of his limits there and he talks about finding that those gaps and guys as you can tell this is definitely the toughest hardest reign of the night to fight and look with parse ice and has your powers again over the head of fuller was closely covered by McKenzie who's winning that oneonone battle so far yeah Heather touched on something there at the end of her report about the weather and just from up here you can tell it's like sheets now coming down brain with that wind right now they're they're facing that wind that's down there I don't think is going against them in another third and one the pressure from the left for the skyvan is showing us in the left and right bull where lined up with the middle linebacker good and off to the left outside of example yep here they come they pick it up well lipped in the flat Prosise makes the kitchen get free CJ Prosise brought down across the 40 it was a savings tackle by Alexander that might have gone a lot farther to watch could send they both are showing it home where comes he disguises and then comes out to try to pick up both sides coming out and because he hesitated just so actually he tried to stay with him just a great move by precise to get separation and then a great punch bro by the Jean Kaiser that's double running but picks up 23 as a receiver there either looked right didn't have anybody he's dragged down behind the line of scrimmage by Carlos Watkins look like a little bit of confusion by this Notre Dame offensive line and also great Sutton is right here he shoots the gap nobody picked him up by the time kaiser's even concerns of the law he's already in the backfield watches with great acceleration too big for little used here there's a mistake up front little mental breakdown there by the Irish offense alive just Adams is a freshman in the game takes the handoff kind of a frustrated reaction from tigrerra for the put that he want to pull the ball yeah it's a zone read where the quarterback you got it you got it my freshman running back and the quarterback who's trying to make a read and when you make that read the running back in the quarterback have to be on the same page they have to read the same thing so it's not like you just handing it all and carrying out a fake you don't know who's going to get the ball till you're if that next point depending on what the defender does Adams is a talented young freshman prospect with his first area the night sets up a third and 12 Kizer stepped up nowhere to go dragged down again that time initially but no one to throw to you know they rush three in Krabi again he has people and it's one of those things that when you have an offensive line it's going to give you that kind of time you've got to be able to locate it whose eyes are on one or two guys it's hard at his age with the lack of experience to find a third guy but rushing three and that time Kevin Dodd is able to get there and apply the pressure see Kelly asking him what did you see Scott is gets away from it the ball will roll out of bounds runs then will start inside their 10 11th year for Allstate sponsoring the good hands field goal nets I'll say making contributions to general scholarship funds for each field goal an extra point kick allstate has contributed millions already in scholarship funds 53yard punt you some pins the Tigers back deep now well that's again you're looking at the big picture 21 to 3 at the very least Notre Dame was pinned back inside their own 10 to start their last Drive they pick up a few first downs they get a good fun now their defense again now they've got to get some they got to get a stop and try to get the ball back to their offense a good field position you are running by Wayne Gulman pretty good gain on first down John Watson a game where he's been involved in the run game which we anticipated a couple touchdown passes 72 yards rushing returned over 10 yards of carry when he does keep the ball and of course the last touchdown they had was him keeping it getting into the end zone second down moment again the Irish game tackled him shift short of the markers it'll be third down on the need a couple Domon hasn't had a lot of room averaging 3.4 on his 11 carries we hear the heavy rain now pumping our microphones on the field the long one in third down figures to be a quarterback run will often able to just wrinkle for enough room to move to change I think you and I and Joe Schmidt everybody else when they saw Gelman motion out of the backfield coach Schmidt pointed to Jaylon Smith to be ready Joe Schmidt took on the block and he was hoping the Jaylon Smith might be able to make the play to keep him short of the first down so even when you know it's coming sometimes you're not able to stop it and it officer Gulman on the edge where you could hear the pads pop it was nine versus nine as Smith brought him down quickly that's fun to watch that gives you a feel right here to be out of the peel some speed right there coming Ryder with bad intent as you said we didn't take a lot of that last week now from though you're going to zone that even now you pointed on the needs this Irish defense defer to make a play turn things their way Watson rolling he's brought down hammer really hard outside the pocket there that's what makes runs and fans really nervous his Tillery arrived and that helped and again you're talking about a guy that had ACL surgery just ten months ago so not you know he's put some weight on last year as a true freshman he was he was quite he 195 pounds now he's up to 210 pounds and you could just tell and we haven't seen him since last year where you see him on film it's one thing you see him in person he's gotten thicker but still you hold your breath with a guy had a knee feel 10 months ago rolls out on 3rd on fires near side hip I catch no ruling yet they're talking about yes on it fit read and fro came up with it Irish you're arguing he was juggling the ball Clemson trying to play very fast if they can feed a potential replay review a lot of times they don't they don't make the adopting the action in which they do Joe Ryder early on this is the replay official they passed that play is under further review right next to us here watch Renfro Prince this is like backyard football planning the slop in the rain off of two players and it's going to come down to whether or not that he had possession when the left foot was down I don't think so I don't let's take another this would be a good angle because initially you can't see that you can't see that and I don't we the extra team initially touched the ball he possessed the ball and then he looks like he let go of it this is a very very large the ball yeah the ball left his hand so I think by the time it left his hand he ended up losing possession of a single here right and I think he got possession after he's already out of bounds see people think rate not it's not about that because I'm telling you he loses the ball and now his feet are in the air I don't think that's the completion it's a huge potential overturn we would be fourth and seven again watch the ball get away watch the ball it's in the air and then he's in his feet go into the air you right so he was right there with an opportunity to make the play that would have moved the chains it's nothing like calling a game Eric when some of the fans are about six feet away turning to you and I saying is it good or not good you signaling completely don't like everybody stays on the side like I don't think it's good they're like come on like like we see them down you know they're all race and everybody whatever friendly way to the statement you guys are on there we go you should be looking right over here that those are the guys making the decision just off that directly I think I think s unny considering completion as the Villanova incomplete guy is Joyrider nodding his head leave us with the guys next to us we're not sharing in the press Bob Young Renfro very shirt and a receiver minute but a tough catch in the rain earlier bring our rules expert Dave to tie in what the what is your opinion of what you've seen well Kirk and Chris it's very close but I have to agree kinda with you that lift foot is on the line Douglas I want Paul go into the air Dave right right down here there see it right there and he to me does not have possession in bounds if you would have held on to it on that first possession when he first possible I think he might then the debate would have been about to be about the left foot delay oh but he but the ball went back up into the air and then he secured the ball and by then his feet were in the air news it was an income so I have to agree with you Kirk that's we looks to me after further review the ruling on the field player did not maintain possession therefore is incomplete not popular here that we think correct so it is fourth down on a punch coming up instead of first down it that was a great effort though it wasn't great effort one of the reaction of renfro's he met their faces they're like why how can you believe even if we're so caught up and was the inbounds or out of bounds it's nice to be able to step back and say it is pretty cool to see him somehow in these conditions would see a guy that balls thrown right to them profit he somehow able to focus and concentrate to come up with that football Sanders lost the football to begin this half desperate to try to make a play redeem himself is back deep he's still punt that's high and it's going to bounce and spin backwards so no chance for a return Irish with six minutes to go in the third down 18 Thank You Cassidy hearing what the wild clips do these folks are ready for even more random 50 even more rain headed this way go down on first down Kaiser at the sidestep the rush and delivers to a wide open man drop again this time it was Torii Hunter junior a rough night for the Irish receivers in the rain and where we are where this this big orange tiger paw has and there's a lot of orange and yellow stuff headed up from the coast Charlestown has been badly flooded the last 24 hours and figure see little uglier here and looking at the score knowing that that's on its way 21 to 3 Notre Dame better hit some points on the board in a hurry and takes the handoff and is hit immediately in the backfield a flag comes down Kevin Dodd is joining Jack Lawson both defensive ends have an intron night a Notre Dame player ran onto the field in an illegal substitution against the office 5yard penalty second down you know the confusion in a tough environment continues for Kelly's offense will fuller ran onto the field I don't be curious to know what Brian Kelly is here what he's upset about I mean the ball was just about to be snapped McKenzie Alexander the corner for the Tigers was slow to get up he's now trotting off he's the guy that's been shadowing fuller all night pullers off the field he'll go off the field he's right there at the top and he goes off and then the play goes on and then at the last second watching the merge back here he starts to come back on the field and they spent the ball so third down and long again any pen eyes are rolling he's got room to run takes the hit in his doc sort at the 45 yard line it'll be fortune to Christian Wilkins chased him down interesting I wanted freshmen on the scene interesting decision right here that time Kaiser just turned his shoulders and just knew he was going to take off and run with the football but Clemson gets to stop Notre Dame is going to have to punt the football early to gamble in your engineer these new yards le yeah I mean you're still in the third quarter you still feel like you trust your defense to get the ball back there is no return man for the Tigers Newsome just boots it away and bounces around we will drop in the 16 yard line the reminder of Monday night on ESPN Seahawks in the Lions interesting when desperation comes into play in the NFL furtherly in his seeds and that is the situation for datoria but a fairy top spot having to go to Seattle you could see Eastern on ESPN in the watch ESPN app Prosise wasn't in there at the end of that last drive trying to stay loose on the exercise bike kinda limped off the field curcuit he's been held to 32 yards so there's 13 carries two and a half per carry does have two receptions for 28 yards it's kind of been their answer to try to get him loose Coleman tries get loose and he lowers his shoulder picks up seven and I've been impressed by Clemson running between the tackles is Alexander who's going to go in and get looked at in the locker room that's a big loss because he has been matched up against Notre Dame's best receiver but I've been impressed with their I get a ton of yards but 132 on the ground and Galvin's been able to contribute to that along with Watson again takes the big shot at the end of the run but you know Domon maybe not the most naturally gifted running back but he really makes up for with effort and toughness I don't know doctor we could show that Sheldon hey that defensive tackle who's an allamerican candidate that time he's been getting worked over we have not called his name much at all tonight in that time Joe Gore and Tyrone Crowder just took him out completely out and opened up a nice running Lane bishop near sun Vaman sit back and get to the open field and move the team to get into the 42 so now the tiger running game be getting to get revved up and I'm sure Jeff Scott and Tony Elliot because Co coordinators are looking down at this and thinking they're probably kind of looking at themselves and talking themselves saying hey how about this I mean we thought we might have to run more with deshaun Watson but right now we're starting to really control that line of scrimmage beat Gulman again gets the edge we've got a beard which offensive line Kirk would have success against the the opposite D line it's been Clemson so far it really has and if you watch the first three games for both teams you would never have anticipated you would have thought you know the scheme and the tempo could be an equalizer helped Clemson but that that offensive line deserves a ton of credit for the way they have played in his slop against the talented front floor it moved 34 yards in the Drive all of them by Gulman until that keeper by Watson so it'll be third down and short but midfield Notre Dame has played this year they have played well and then they would have they give up a big play you know more often than not through the air but they have played well they've shown you what they're capable of doing especially up in the front the front six I say fix because you know that most their outside linebackers walked out because of the spread look that they see so Watson checks the play card in 33 Zach Brooks was in the game Watson just takes off breaks the tackle move the chains again that was pretty tall to say it gloves are off we had the knee is healthy DeSean feels good this is a tough opponent we're going to have to run him tonight and the timing on that quarterback counterplay was exceptional Tyrone Crowder the right guard pulled it through Zac Brooks the the running back had a nice block that opened up perfectly Brooks that comes in motion and they give it to him and he fumbles it still putting it around this is that's rayray MacLeod 34 and it's an incomplete pass because it was a pop pass the freshmen couldn't we can grab the handle there that's the good thing about that kind of a boy wait exactly it happens really fast and it's just a little bit just a little pop pass but you know right away you just assume you think it's a fumble and one thing they might look at is it did he have possession of the ball did he take a did take a enough steps to have possession you could see his eyes kind of turned up feel young guy was hot yeah look at more he was going and didn't secure the ball watch them spun around and hit for a long so the Irish defense gets in there Cole Luke on his corner got there quickly and stirred long now yeah that time they're trying to just do anything to try to change the flow of this offense they brought the corner from the bottom on the Blitz there as you said Luke and that right now you're on the ropes you got to try to pull out all the stops and Brian big order is known there's an aggressive defensive coach whether we can Bryan tonight what's that see yeah you got out of the green leprechaun look just said do you not like he's going to go with the career what you want but he's there any bad watson a downfield shot in a flag comes in under Renfro was tackled by Suvari Russell so Renfro who almost made that circus sketch off the Kerr ambassador fairs defense number six 15 yards out that's a guy you expect to go to use but he be Russell no he gets around him and shows the pretty good quickness he gets outside Russell's known as the top cover corner for Notre Dame he's in pretty good position actually but right at the end and as run froze going for the football that's where Russell ends up having to get it we hold on to look like under his belt maybe the penalty moves the ball to the 33 and a half approaching the final minute of the third quarter of renfro 510 175 pounds former walkon yeah just got a scholarship big pretty good at big moment for him py now pop it down deep peak juggled it Luke was defending and it's picked off hey I got to say something you're down to 21 to 3 write it in that to score yeah it's 21 to 3 and and you just make it playing you still talking to the crowd I mean you made a great play you're trying to get the ball back to your to your offense and you're worried about looking up to the crowd and giving them the sign I just don't understand that we see that all over college football and NFL football makes no sense to me you're losing twenty one two three so anyway besides that right boy yeah he's in position the ball was just thrown up if one of those plays you hope your receiver is going to go and you just throw it to a spot and enjoy to a spot and Luke actually did a nice job of anticipating it got in position to be able to go up and make the play but he just seems to be happy they got the interception now you hope the offense goes down in four papers into position Luke has both of the picks the Irish have named this season first ice knocked down after nine yards southern well it looks like that bike did CJ Prosise some good he's been stretching out that left quad and staying on that bike to try to keep the form you've definitely got a pool there but obviously we'll continue to play also his quarterback deshone Kizer cramping in both casts continues to stretch those that this one up Somoza with receivers and said we've got this we've seen here before referencing the virginia come from behind wins thank you first ice on this pin free does spin again and gets the first down of the 40 they were not down 18 diverging now it's a big difference yeah and they weren't playing this defense but you can understand what Heather's saying about hey we've been here before the only difference I would say you got a guy down looks like the safety you know that's green it you're down three possessions and I at this point I'm not feeling any urgency you know I'm saying with Kaiser right you know you're only going to get the football back so many times and you're going to need to start to you don't have to go hurry up but you need to kind of get out of the huddle and have a little bit of urgency to you because it's not just about scoring on this possession you need another stop and then another score and then another stop and another score they have not been able to create the chunk plays the kind they were able to create in the first four games NFL insiders and Sunday NFL countdown begin your day at 10:00 a.m. Eastern and then countdown comes on at 11:00 and streams live on the watch ESPN app it's tomorrow over on ESPN so Green has helped up and that didn't look anything serious and painful for sure momentarily but this helps off just got it in a vulnerable position there he's been active tonight seven tackles four Venables defense which is so far done a tremendous job still can't believe this is this was the best defense in college football last year if you look at the numbers and they lost virtually everybody off of that defense and this defense first four weeks of the season playing the way they are says a lot about Brent Venables his team and his relationship with these players absolutely number one yards per game half sufficiency tackles for loss and third down and they are looking like they're not missing a beat in 2015 back after this message of the word for your local ABC station you beginning of the final quarter this presentation of the SEC on ESPN runs in one of six eight PC opponents the Irish are playing this year the rain is not dampen the spirit is still a rowdy party in Death Valley a long hill to climb the irish geyser time now decide the takeoff and slides down at the 45 it's a good first down game would you'd like to see him for God and again how do you how to create a welcome probably the problem is preventable smart guy got to safety that are seat taking away anything drone downfield unless you can throw it over the middle of the field or you can try to hit a slip screen the preventable as it knows they need to hit from chunk plays he wants to make them have to drive the field for everything that they have animals in his fourth year his defense has improved it's allowed every year McIver gives the fake and loops it down wide open his Prosise on the sideline stays inbounds and scores so there's that chunk play for the Irish they are still alive 56 yards and they snuck him out of the backfield and the defensive backs from Clemson just completely lost him they were their eyes in the backfield they didn't feel him sliding out of the backfield at all I think they were so concerned about will it fuller and the other receivers that he just got lost and Travis blanks number 11 tried to catch up with him but just he got behind him see if he did stay in bound he really I feel down the sideline or touch down that play is under for the review did not see him touch the sign I was very close right after he made the catch I know this would be a great look you know I think you stayed in I don't know I'll take the heel I don't think the heel went down if the hit would have gone down he would have been out of bounds but if he looks like it's up they will ask your opinion what your lighter is going to decide here at the touchdown I just don't think I just don't think that's enough because the heel doesn't go down Kirk as you've seen that is not enough to reverse this play this should be a touchdown so close sighs Kirk has been held 250 yards and his 15 carries as a runner now has three catches for 84 and that's touchdown ending the review here after further review really real is confirmed touchdown the eighth touchdown this year for the Irish of more than 50 yard that's more than they've had any season going back to Oh to think about that yeah but in Frank design it's not it's not by an accident remember that they're 21 to 3 we're talking at the break you need to touch down an extra point or a touchdown twopoint conversion and then a field goal to try to tie this up is we wondered we wondered if they've scored where they go for two right away or wait that they have to go for two on one of them he's elected to go for two now that way if they missed it he knows he just needs to touchdown oh I'm out all over the board for today so they have to spend a timeout that that is not what you want to do when you're trying to climb out of a hole here crushing let's go back to the touchdown here and Prosise is right here and you're going to see one receiver go here another receiver go here and that's what really occupies the defense you also have a safety right here brain who's tied up I think he might have been the one that had to be responsible for prosigns but look at the eyes in the backfield right here nobody's really keeping an eye on pro side sneaking down the sideline and by the time they react you've got the speed after making the catch to be able to get into the end zone they just simply simply lost him too much focus on the receivers see what Kelly cooks up after that nice little play he took the house smart Venables is Kelly Kenneth Rick two men time yeah exactly but on that twopoint conversion he wastes the timeout it looks like it fit players out there I think he was waiting with Corey Robinson to be out there roadsides to the right of the quarterback and Roberts who goes in motion as it looks that way throws it is a tall guy you can't get it Robinson is six foot five went off his hands again and he put it exactly where the big man could go off and climb the ladder make the catch she just wasn't able to hold on to it Irish score in the big play but not a real good sequence for Corey Robinson Murphy pointed out he wasn't on the field yet it's been a timeout and then a very catchable pass yeah that's big to be able to get this game within 10 points and I think Brian Kelly not only upset about the drop and it has more to do with having to burn a timeout on a twopoint conversion in a game where you're trying to play catchup you need you need all three of those timeouts do some boots it fuller in green in our back because Scott taking it across the 30 yard line he's our Pacific Life game summary Kirk with his quarterbacks yeah definitely you got to look at what the Shaun Watson has done and the numbers aren't going to blow you away but I think he's just made the plays that he needed to make a crucial moment and the three touchdowns and for Kaiser a young guy who is literally learning with every single rep that he faced against a very aggressive Clemson defense but give him credit for hanging in there the guy is battling tonight against the defense as I said is kind of had the notre dame's offenses number for most of the night Watson back out there off his fourth interception of the season frozen near side effects is made by Ray Ray McLeod and the freshman out across the 40 near the marker ray ray McLeod is going to become the next great one you would think a true freshman out of the Tampa area he along with our savior Scott thing about Octavius Scott Clearwater Ray Ray McLeod is Tampa James beyond cane for Tampa and who opened the door Sammy watching from Fort Myers it's right Gulman cuts back inside breaks the tackle calm in the midfield you finally chase down inside the 25yard line max Redfield save the touchdown but Goldman gets loose for his biggest run of the night giving up big plays that theme kind of continues it's the poor tackling great effort here by Gulman but pointcab all right Russell's got to be able to make that play he was right there and just kind of got his hands on it but didn't secure the tackle all of a sudden jerk after that 33 yard run Gulman is closing in 100 yards got it again and not get the edge is run down there by Shumate for a loss defense you know it's been on the field a lot it's been tested it's really surprised me to be honest with you to see this defense give up some plays in the trenches I mean they have coming in I think they had a great deal of confidence and how they matched up but there have been times where we've seen even in the second half with that offensive line is kind of asserted themselves and they're not in a hurry at all as they work that clock CJ Fuller is the freshman back in the game now you got three running back to go by CJ in this game Davidson fuller and of course Prosise in a place where CJ spiller made me one of the great Clemson players ever Dan was thinking of CJ spiller if he's that good we got to find a few more see me every guy named CJ he's running back well yeah third and 10 now Tigers have been a little bit more efficient tonight on third down 5 for 11 once you stop trying to get there and engineer this you're our lake wants at five and now they'll spend a time out coaching staff spotted something on the other side Kirk had wanted Watson to notice it yeah they're actually trying to get there was certain coverage that they saw that they wanted him to go to that play and he was just a little bit confused so he called the timeout Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Pacific Life for life insurance annuities and investments choose Pacific Life the power to help you succeed or we go further so you can and gently experts around every corner to help you leave worry behind the folks having fun with the reindeer pumps and of course many folks in this state and other states in the lying seaboard are seriously affected by the flooding the rain really doesn't have a lot to do with hurricane Joaquin it's just a combination of rivers running high and tide coming in this is Washington now is safe play in the rain it keeps it in makes a nice game just going to say you're up by 12 and it's not just about converting and getting a first down it's about trying to give yourself a chance that is a field goal to go up by 15 points you go up by 15 points and now Notre Dame it's a twopossession game they've got it again score the touchdown get it two point conversion and then score another touchdown so I makes a lot of sense with dad Luis when he did they're just running around the left side clearly this kicker likes it from the left hash to see if he can convert to give them the 15point lead 35 yarder for the walkon Gregg Google who is four or five this season first attempt they got a hurry which they want to spend the time out it's going to Miami Mack five yards though they didn't notice it on the sidelines a full sprint force we need in there to spend the timeout feels a lot better about the field goal that this range is five yards basket ok wheels for the coach going back to the claim day had it had he turned the Jets on it I think the crown may hello if you enjoy the exercise on a rainy night that but judging from the

tomorrow night 9:00 and central on ABC the hukill will kick into the wind it really shouldn't be a big factor on a field goal this range to be just about a thirtyfive yarder trying to build that lead back up to 15 Seth Lyon is the holder in a wet night is a good job to get it down and Hugo knocked through so 10 256 to play and the Tigers are backed up by two things Espie Thank You that Bruins team Kirk was so impressive in a hammering errors on the road last week what we knew was going to be tough in the pac12 to go through unscathed and they drop to the first time looking around in the first four or five weeks week and I were just talking there it's a break about think he said it was oh seven it's going to be one of those years even with the loss you're not out of it No teams are going to lose he the shortened hick very short kick into the wind field it the Irish are going to have decent field position that as a 36 yard line is Doug Randolph big defensive London get his hands on the football well we knew that it was going to be a situation which quarterback which receivers could handle the wet conditions fuller with the drop to would have been a first sentiment field Robert said it would be touchdown and again a would be a twopoint conversion he's been Clemson's receivers they have been perfect for the event little for sure handed and now with 1052 remaining in his football game it's not just about trying to put boys on the board you going to hear his 15 points so you need to be able to execute put it put points on the board and then you got to get the defense back out and try to get a stop if you're Notre Dame Princeton obviously trying to get a three now Kizer there's good protection dead spraydown decide to take off and the big fella loses the ball bouncing around the Irish have recovered it was precise right there a very fortunate hop as Wilkins forces quarterbacks bumble Heather Chris you guys are talking about conditions while Clemson defensive end Shaq Lawson's just whipped out shoes as you see the stumble going on guys he actually went from a molded cleats to a halfinch screwin doing everything in his power to get better footing better leverage on this very sloppy night here thank you as reported earlier that Lawson left to have a lead one of his need geyser has time flips it off again and it's a wideopen Chris Brown and the average should be getting to find some space in a secondary Brown runs through a couple tackles and finally out of bounds blanks forced him out but they're inside the 15 you're going to see a crisscross here from Notre Dame wide receivers in Boulware 10 is going to get caught up in some traffic and there's Brown clearing underneath good job again he needs time for these planes to develop but how about Chris Brown after the catch getting some blocks downfield by fuller and picks up few jars again 33 exactly what Notre Dame need a trend it spread quickly here both sides came out of the backfield Kaiser looked that way now dance is free it's inside the ten cuts back inside the five it'll be second and a yard average knocking on the door again there now you're starting to sense some urgency from Kaiser you ever seen a guy that hasn't played a lot of football at this level in this kind of atmosphere have such composure in the pocket there's blank blanks has been kind of locked just been hobbled here in the second half of course he's had two ACL surgeries on the same knee over the last few years they worked so hard to get back he's a very respected smart member of this Clemson defense he takes off to row watch him here Carlyle get involved three right there that's the guy who right now blank he's down but he may hit a mastery win yeah yeah and he's already kind of been like he's been struggling he's chasing earlier on that touchdown by Prosise that looked like he's really laboring didn't really rotate a lot of guys in on this bunch of defense they asked for starters to play a lot of time are they wearing down both ice gets over on second and one keeper Kizer touchdown and the Irish are coming back he just said you not only you need is four but you need to score in a hurry how about a minute 49 could put a touchdown up on the board and instead of going for two now they're going to go for seven and try to get it in and try to go for the the extra point before seven points now and wait to get the two pointer if they get the football back this would cut it to an eight point margin if they can convert here but you're right for plays 64 yards on minutes 49 they needed round sketch with the big play in the drive you guys are a strong runner remember he's been the comeback kid against Virginia on the road he said the guys we've been here before he excuses guys and it's just really impressed with what he's done not a great night but he's hung tough but he's given his team a chance to come back at his game Irish are down 21 three and ever in the quarter but times er let him do a couple touchdown drives yeah and again I you know his numbers aren't going to blow you away when you pick up the box score tomorrow but what's going to impress you if you watch this game is how he's just kind of hung tough they've not been able to run the football they put him in some tough positions I can't get over how he sits in a pocket how much time he has and how he didn't panic Scott your deep the Irish coverage team had him corral but our Tavis Patrick's right now case data bound by the kicker that's a 45 yard line it's slippery receiver also a dangerous returner in Clemson as nice field position as they protect now an eightpoint lead in the final nine minutes here martini does a good job of getting down there he just can't come up with it the attack when I think a lot of the Notre Dame kickoff coverage team thought he was already down he picks up about another 25 or 30 yards and toes in a little skiff arm at the end there Hewson was the punter and the kick of God good job to get Scott out of bounds so now it's watching at the 44 and all of a sudden it's a tight game and Gulman hammered hard spins forward if you're the play callers Jeff Scott Tony Elliott what do you do now with your lead down eight all of a sudden I think you go right to number four and you put the ball into his hands and you say all right earlier in this game when we had some success it was him throwing the football and also the quarterback run game and I just think you ditch guy is like to take the Clemson coaches feelings was one of the most talented quarterbacks in the country you definitely want him to be able to want to be able to make the decision he's also working clock along with trying to pick up first downs yeah for once Clemson not playing an eye for speed really working the play clock down to seven Yaman lucky carry but nothing there against the Irish front was big Irish eyes across Yale and its third and long one thing I think you have to be careful with still eight minutes to go is getting a little bit out of character you know you start to change your tempo and you start to change the mentality of this all the offense is used to cranking they're used to having that kind of gogogo mentality and with eight minutes to go I don't know it's a little bit enough time I don't think you need to really work the game clock that much comes in lotion washing the hands looks a short catch maybe they've hit immediately the Elijah Shumate knock down leg it's a tight end in Clemson going to have to give up the football now yes Shumate made a great read and it looked like it looks like Watson felt that leg it was going to slip out and nobody's going to pick him up you can see the top of the screen the entire time Elijah Shumate has been seeing that counter boot one too many times they scored a touchdown on this play earlier this time Shumate is right there soon as he makes that catch clearly down before the fumble came out these domes upon it and will fuller Irish top playmaker has been held largely in check tonight chance to make the play as a returner Fuller has lets it bounce seems like that's been the instruction to the returners don't even try to feel if it's the ground get out of the way movie Allstate Saturday Night Football Plus provided shelter ports today once in all the games the Allstate gets good sweepstakes the chance to 100,000 bucks both the VIP trip to the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game as well as prizes with its Notre Dame team Kirk with the awful weather down 21 3 entering the final quarter has found a way to make a couple of chunk plays so they've got a chance now potential gametying drive we knew they needed to have those plays and it's been the passing games opened up something for them and now now Brian Kelly can just execute his office with 641 to go here they still want to have some urgency to Kaiser as push play out of the backfield is leaving throws effect here UJ Justin the linebacker makes a huge interception in our top decision from the young quarterback and and when he goes back and looked at that he just never even saw CJ Prosise who from up here it's easy to see but in reality he's a check down Prosise was flied out over here and he's wide open but he ends up just forcing this football and I don't think he gave what's been much of a chance of Sarah Goodson and he think that he thought he could make this play and he can show some pretty good closing speed but he'll go back and look at that and instead of forcing it he just wants to check that down to his running back CJ Prosise it's been one of those big strong linebackers he benches for 80 with a tough customer against the run makes a big interception and now clemson gets the ball back and again just hands it to Goldman thread ahead you know how clemson defensively most this game has been kind of pin in their ears and shooting gaps against Notre Dame when they've tried to run the ball right now Notre Dame and Brian Van Gorder they've got to take some chances against this running game our tables got the event Gortat er limped off a few plays ago these back in the game now he's at the bottom of the formation if they have Washington throw the ball here on second and 11 inside of six minutes keeps it gets the crease Washington makes the hit slam down two yards short of the marker it'll be third and two you know because they've been able to get Wayne Galman going I it now when he carries out a fake he had two or three defenders chasing him down this is when you really have something going there's two guys completely gone in fact he got tackled he got hammered and it opens up some room therefore for deshaun Watson to run the football Nashawn took a hard hit himself at the end of that play Gorman to the right of the quarterback on third down now motions out Watson running all the way but running right into traffic dropped for a loss Irish were all over that keeper that time he loses a yard and it's fourth down a slow developing play he's waiting for his left guard 78 to pull around mcclain watch how slow it develops he's waiting and waiting and waiting Rochelle does a nice job of just kind of fighting the point of attack there's just nowhere to go you can see they're able to keep contain a wall Oh as well just nowhere to go for Watson Schmidt and Smith the two linebackers converging on the tackle so forth and three this would be pretty difficult field goal it's into the wind there's a crosswind he made it earlier from 35 at this per hukill is from 45 to make it the 11 point game hello booth and it hooks you missed it so the interception doesn't put his points to the Irish still down and only eight except it's a tough kick in for a kicker there you know 45 yards the wind is kind of swirling it's wet it would have in effect maybe put the game away but not able to convert it and as you said they have the turnover there they had a big opportunity there to maybe put this game out of reach but Notre Dame catches a break they get the ball back to Kaiser and they've boarded their last two possessions in a minute 52 in a minute 48 and they have scored empty backfield cars our pressure drop Carlos Watkins joined my Christian Wilkins the freshman you have Watkins in there but look at the entire defensive front Porsche a Clausen to the bottom there nine he's also involved the true freshman Wilkins they had an entire group they're closing in on and nowhere for him to try to pick up Saban lost nine yards second and long ties er flips it short Brown has Running Room and Chris Brown's loose crimped up but in the Clemson territory well how about the speed of Chris Brown on these crossing routes he's catching the football the exact same route he ran earlier picks up a little bit of a rub and now he's just leaving people behind him there's no way Kevin dodge he catched him in the open field but how about Tankersley the corner who's with him he also gets less than serious wheels there by Brown Prosise in this block on this empty set it brings pressure Keizer picks it up again flips it short and hunter makes the catch 235 another first down he with receivers going downfield that underneath game in their passing game is open because you've got some linebackers that are shooting gaps Brooks in that time and Boulware both came and if you're not going to get home you're going to leave a vacancy underneath good job of finding it and then get stomach dumping it down for that first down thirtyeight years ago Joe Montana came in here and introduce a fourth quarter comeback against Clemson the Shawn Kaiser trying to do the same thing Robinson demotion for has the catch of the end it has to block and he's lose for wearing to the secondary down to the 11 was the last time you watched Notre Dame football with this kind of speed on the perimeter and Chris Brown and will Pollard both I mean you talk about yards after the catch I'd love to look at that number in the second half alone tonight for Notre Dame 23 yards is fuller finally makes an impact than the Irish now do want to have to play 12 yards from a potential gametying touchdown they need the cue point conversion of course lob to the end zone broken up over there that were Tankersley knocking the ball out of Browns hands he's a quarterback often picked on because Alexander is so good but he makes the play there yeah he wants to be able to get this football thrown a little bit further in the corner that's with the fans from the Notre Dame fans are upset about look at that grab it Jersey yeah I mean he's supposed to go up there make the play when he's grabbing a jersey and pulling him down by the way he had Nick wisher underneath all low nose underneath routes are open even down deep in the bunch of territory flatout missed that interference call either look left dumps it short gets made and taking a shot losing to Paul Clemens got it Chris Brown hands a ball was headed toward the end zone for a potential gametying touchdown and it was not free and the questions who had to pick earlier made the recovery yeah it looks like curse got his hand on the book lon knocked it loose Chris and Goodson gets on top of it we just said the underneath routes are open watch how open they are it just clears out the great read Browns their crowds been dangerous after the catch it's not that hit it's right there the left hand of one curse gets in there there's the initial hit in the left hand jars the ball loose and then the middle linebacker BJ Goodson jumps right on top of it it is the for Notre Dame turnover all of them in the second half so they've been able to make some big plays but selfdestruction for Notre Dame and that's athat's a tough one after getting that close to potentially touchdown on a two pointer to Tyus built two timeouts remaining for Notre Dame down to stop Domon you get the ball back and you know Brian Kelly knows it's tough with a wet ball but his reaction not better the fumble it's been one of those nights with selfdestructing but it's this game is far from over make Clemson's probably a first down away from being able to isis but brian kelly electing not to use the timeout that they lost when they didn't had to use the twopoint conversion for the time I'll anoint ten men on the field he decides to let the clock run here then they're going to try to get stops on second and third down with the timeouts to try to get the football back around midfield and Watson working to play clot snaps it at four gives it to Coleman it all hurt for you do you worry about a fumble almost every time as the Irish make the stop and then do spend that second timeout with one night team to go and third down coming up for Watson Monday night on ESPN the Seahawks and the Lions 8:15 Eastern Time on ESPN streaming live on the watch ESPN app their Clemson got it think they run the football to force Notre Dame to use that last timeout the Irish are thinking stop them use the last timeout forced to punt get the ball midfield maybe your own 45 with about a minute to go still time to do what they need to do on third and six uh very safe play as Watson keeps it but does not get much one wall over the linebacker stopped him and now they'll spend at final timeout with a minute 13 Mont coming up yeah into the wind by the way I can tell he's been thinking the same thing that you and I are talking about he decided to let that first down play go called it on second time called the timeout on second and third down they're going to get the ball with a minute to go without any timeouts and the way they've been throwing the football they've got to feel pretty confident that they can execute if they can take care of the football it may change that come down to a twopoint conversion screening and Scott and Elliot electing to his call safe plays keep it on the ground a rainy night into the wind and then trust their defense to try to protect this leave but Kaiser has been making plays that they just make a too many mistakes no doubt he's thrown now for 284 yards on the night indeed teased all in his endzone and fuller is set up at the 45 you'll have a planet takes it at the 41 puller down to the 32 yard line and Kaiser and company set up perfectly a minute five no timeouts but a lot shorter drives they had when they were down at Virginia he gives his Notre Dame defense a lot of credit for hanging in there and doing what they needed to do to get the ball back to Notre Dame and now if you're Club sitting your Brent Venables don't you think you got to be thinking to yourselves you know was that underneath crossing route it's been wide open we'd been glitching some linebackers leaving gets lost a little bit of coverage it's not just the long throw downfield it's the underneath route to safe god I think being concerned about best starting field position for the Irish napkin at one loss the ball just came out of his hand okay remember no time outs he's got to have some urgency here they work on this he doesn't have a ton of experience in his other than the Virginia game but he's got it cranked this is where you've really got to have some intensity inside of 50 seconds thing 160 yards there Kaiser steps up flips it short incomplete out of Browns hands that actually is the best thing that could have happen to Notre Dame because if he caught that football that he's tackled in bounds and they don't pick very many yards up and o'clock just keeps going and going Quentin doing a good job right now they've got eight guys in coverage and they're trying to keep Notre Dame in bounds they want that clock to just keep going your plays to get 16 yards and keep up alive I just could not take a stack we've got to be aware that he's going to throw it away if he feels pressure it brings some pressure fires far side lining play catch made Carlile's got a first down in a red zone how bout that they bring that pressure it's right in his face and he knows if he takes the sack the game could be over and he stands in there he gets to time and he throws and they're going to fire it to kill the clock we need five seconds to go Kelly decisive and actually he's quarterback to clock it here's the catch it's his hands underneath it's the legs involved whatever it takes to hold on to that football but I couldn't believe the way he just sat in that pocket and waited for Carlisle to break free didn't panic one thing to make the throws has ended saying not to panic when you have a Notre Dame game on the road against the ACC a year ago along third down conversion who were there for Florida State dizer looks it near side Prosise breaks the tackle get down to the two box tops with the first down a missed tackle there by Clemson they had him inbounds and short of the first down that were not able to pull him down how about the strength era Prosise well lambs it wasn't even Seth they were trying to clock the ball but the chains really weren't even set up yet so a flag comes in Clemson has 12 defenders on the field that's the problem now that's that's not good you're kind of torn against this according to Kirk you trying to get your short yardage package down there from the yard line right illegal substitution defense half the distance to the goal Phil first what do you do if you dare run the ball with no timeouts Reba sure I don't think you can I think you've got to trust this quarterback he's had the football in his hands he's make good decisions if all else fails he also has a big body can go for that goal line I try to use his leg for a touchdown he plays tackled in bounds a serious trouble though came cobroker tackled in bounds Kizer linkster for the endzone touchdown Torii Hunter junior with seven seconds to play the Irish your tooth weakened froze in a way from overtime Chris you mentioned last year's Florida State Notre Dame game how about this how about this right here perfectly executed to open it up exactly the same situation to say the side of the field at this time will fuller give him credit he looked into the quarterback instead of like looking at the defensive back perfectly executed by Notre Dame ironic a year later the exact same corner of Enzo with a game on the line they still need three more yards support so t guys are grown roses traffic and comes up with yards short for we're working and the Clemson defense rises up so hold off a furious notredame rally interesting call by Brian Kelly relying on the feet knee leg of Kaiser this is all about the defensive line up Winston blocks Todd and watch Watkins work here and then you have the safeties and linebackers come in and help out but a great job up front I mean Kevin Dodd 98 would not look at an extension there against the tide in wisher he just throws him back into the end of the quarterback Boulware is involved you saw blanks get in there and of course you saw Kelly's disappointment Watson's relief the decision by Kelly to go 42 early in the fourth quarter they get that first touchdown will be questioned now the way things eventually worked out no doubt about that and now we go to the last second here with seven seconds left yet an unsportsmanlike penalty here on on Clemson so Notre Dame is going to be kicking from midfield for this onside kick and if they slip free field it's wet if you skip this and you somehow recover it at least it gives you a chance to either a Hail Mary or a really long field goal cassadee hovers will be along in this video the Ford wrapup show went after the game have reactions to this one early in his quarters limbs enrolling at of 21 we could we could think about heading home early on a rainy night the Irish made him play right down at the end but just like the game he referenced a year ago in Tallahassee it looks like a Notre Dame perfect season is going to come to an end with a close call on the road the tough environment insanity theme let's see how this onside kick goes this is the freshman kicker Justin youn they practice this all the time trying to get that perfect hop and it does not get the kangaroo hop and is fielded by the Tigers we're going to take a knee with a hardearned threepoint victory in Death Valley their 12th straight home woman that is a very relieved head coach he's promotional right now the big win for his program think about this in the last three years this Clemson program is now 36 and 7 with wins over LSU Auburn Georgia Ohio State Oklahoma and Notre Dame he has taken its program to a whole different level and so what you saw where the call there was not just relief but just he is so proud of his program and what they built here yeah forget the staffs plumbs it is out game bigtime Notre Dame mistakes crew still for second half turnovers but they play but on a heart with resilience on the road Kaiser who helped lead that comeback coming up one yard short on that stupid conversion Carey that's really what you need to take away from this game it's a huge win for Clemson early in the year at home against a good Notre Dame football team but Notre Dame with Tiger at quarterback on the road in these conditions down big looking like they didn't have any any chance at all they four turnovers throughout gained over 100 yards how in the world is that football team going to have a chance to come back and have a shot at a twopoint conversion to getting it into overtime but they didn't so give give them credit they can build on this you know the Tigers have some some folks ahead Georgia Tech is up next here in this field they got hammered by the jackets a year ago but SEC is struggling Clemson Kirk with the loss a headed end in the rankings for the top teams a chance to really jump up in the rankings in and become a big part of the conversation for that potential playoff thought the Irish with a tough schedule not necessarily out of it with a two point loss on the road how emotional Dabo Swinney was a moment ago he's now with Heather Christine so much devil congratulation so what does this kind of a win for your program go well make the porno and it keeps us on track what we're trying to do and you know have a great season hey hats off to Notre Dame you know we had them down they thought about just what great teams do well coach man I'm just so proud of our team you know it's what it's all about you know it ain't always perfect but what I told them tonight was Justin we give you scholarships we give you you know stipends and meals and a place to live we give you a nice uniform I can't give you good and I can't give you hard and tonight it would be 100 G for your own good and they want some dances somewhere thank you gonna come to order my dad who was limited anyway freakin way this play don't worry about I screw up play this play win this down and you know just after they never quit but again great effort by Notre Dame let me just tell you Ray Plato's a beggar nascent ISIL there will be a beam to check you to tomorrow is a balloon doctor remember when I thought he might pull the whip out out out down on the field there well he's going in methanol on curry he knows it wasn't perfect they've got a lot of things to correct but it was a Brazilian defense that had been burned a bunch hit me Notre Dame was moving up and down the field making big plays and they come very close they do force the force turnovers in the second half they didn't limit precise on the ground they got in the backfield a bunch Kirk boy they were really tested a yard away from overtime whether it was the first time remember how you and I were just kind of marveling and what they had accomplished you know for losing their entire defense from a year ago and how good they've looked up to this point where they got they got vulnerable in the past again Tiger ended up throwing for over 300 yards tonight and you know did that aspect of what Brent Venables is probably gonna work the hardest on to get his team ready to continue to try to improve GT v8 ciency strong performance just enough for Clemson you know what went with Notre Dame visits Clemson it's only happened twice at the last four decades it's going to come down to the finish Joe Montana just got it done the last time the Irish were here and DeSean Kaiser came very close to a comeback that would have joined that long list of Notre Dame largest a yard short tip it's up they can build on do I think this team even though it's a loss yeah and I think you're exactly right this is going to be a whacky year in college football you have to do is look in last weekend and especially today look at some of the scores it's going to be one of those years where the committee is going to have have to really do their homework it's not going to be as clean as it was even though there's some controversy last year Notre Dame's not out of this thing I mean if they can regroup and learn from this they're going to be just fine and for Clemson as well I mean punch of the football team that they've got a quarterback they've got a defense that they could be proud of but they've got enough that they can learn from today and continue to try to grow and just keep and he said we're for know they're going to hand us the trophy tonight we're for now no no they now have to play eight more games in eight weeks they had the long time off before this game but it's going to be a grind in no weeks off for the Clemson Tigers as they head into the ACC schedule Florida State does come here early November seen this had their number in recent years another look at the stop of the tiger defense on the 2 pointer get Dodd he kind of sets the point on the edge doesn't let Kaiser get outside and in the rest of that defensive line and the linebackers are there to clean it up but really if Kevin got a lot of credit for holding the point on the outside that defensive line when they had to turn it up tonight they did for the most part we will never know what would happen at that conversion been through it this thing would have headed to overtime because odor day would have brought a whole lot of momentum oh yeah and do it well the party on a rainy night in Death Valley is just getting started here as Clemson holds on 24 22 over the Fighting Irish hope you enjoy tonight's game it was produced by Bill bonel directed by Derek's mably for Kirk Herbstreit Heather Cox and our entire crew which works beautifully in these tough conditions tonight I'm Chris Fowler the four wrap up show is coming to find now Cassidy
