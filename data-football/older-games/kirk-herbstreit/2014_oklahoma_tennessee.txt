============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC you know Norman open skies flames running to the horizon and football running through veins this is big 12 country home of the Sooners it's off place for Tennessee to be representing the SEC two story flavors willing to lay it on the line pride we like the big space for bright lights we embrace it we definitely have our hands full and there's a lot on lon that's why you come here is to play a big game we're in the house on the bar anybody can win or lose on any given day everybody's ready to run we want to compete you know every down every day for big too fast and strong so we're really just going to bring right again now is the time to get it done in between a live and welcome to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo a rare treat as the Tennessee Volunteers out of the SCC visit the Oklahoma sooner nation and impact and raucous Memorial Stadium in a fall mean night in Norman and welcome Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit glad you're with us we may have some things reveal tonight Kirk is Oklahoma as dominant as they think they are a playoff contender is Tennessee as far along in the rebuilding as they hope they are the backdrop of course bob suits victim jabs at the SEC before and after the upset Alabama including the lower echelon quoteunquote with Tennessee represents but now that's his least favorite topic this week well of course he doesn't want to talk about that he wants to try to talk about trying to win a football game but this is an opportunity for Bob Stoops because who's he who he is playing an SEC team because that SEC team is going to play other SEC teams at the end of the year similar opponents so it's an opportunity there it's also an opportunity for Tennessee to maybe shock the world and show them hey we could play with teams like Oklahoma Vols are two enough but they're very young and when you have a reshuffled offensive line all new guys Oklahoma would seemingly be a matchup nightmare tonight well Mike Stoops the defensive coordinator from Oklahoma does a great job of confusing any offensive line let alone the offensive line and potentially is going to be starting to true freshman on the right side so that's something that Oklahoma will try to go after Geno Grissom on one side number 85 and Eric striker who had three sacks against Alabama in the Sugar Bowl so they're very effective they're very athletic and especially on third down is when they're going to try to come up with different ways to try to confuse this line and try to get after Justin Worley what Mike Stoops does have respect for this strength of this volunteer team which is the senior quarterback Justin Worley and some excellent skill guys on the edge well I think that's the biggest difference for Tennessee is the way Justin Worley has played early in this year the first two games remember he got some experience last year this will be his 13th start tonight and I think he's playing with more confidence because I think he believes more in the skill that's around him mark quit marques North on the outside 6 for an ability to go up and make plays in space especially down in the red zone I think the big thing Tennessee has to do a good job of tonight is getting the ball out of the hands of Justin Worley as quickly as possible because there's such a disadvantage up front you've got to get the ball out quick and you got to try to find an opportunity to try to get marques North and other receivers so I think can compete with Oklahoma chance to play they want to get the game to the fourth quarter underdogs do but you got to withstand the oh you overwhelming starts they've been up 21 nothing in each of their first two games the ponies boomer and sooner lead master by owner I promise you that ride is rougher than it looks kickoff coming output set foot John thunders background any canal in the studio that's a bit the Nissan pregame rush is next after this message and a word from our ABC stations John thank you this can be a daunting place for visitors Oklahoma expects to dominate eighty eight and five in Norman under Bob suit but they have been vulnerable to some big upsets in recent years including four of them right here in Norman the first meeting in almost a half century Tennessee in Oklahoma this has been the Nissan the pregame Rush kickoff Norman is coming up but first a look inside Nissan Heisman House welcome to the dunk of pepper championship drive game of the week Walker sweating from a tree whatever got a feeling all day long my heart was being set for the meeting now I realize it was boreal stadium filled a capacity of more than 80 mm for the 61st straight game the first big test of the season for the Sooners Bob Stoops a little keyed up all week as he's in his 16th season here and he's will have a other first thing so much coach fat starts have been your calling card in the first two games else born opponents sixty two to three in the first half of those one how do you carry that momentum into tonight well you know we've just execute we got execute keep our poise and play smart and tonight how does your team avoid the inherent dangers and facing a three touchdown underdog well listen we haven't all we've done is played two games with this team Tennessee I got great respect for Coach Jones and it's fantasy out there Zoe we need to play well thank you thank you Chris Thank You Butch Jones in his second season Tennessee head coaches recruited very well but he knows it's a major challenge for a bunch of guys almost half the roster making their first road trip tonight very close in overall wins the Sooners for those seven national titles including one under Stoops in 2000 senousy believes they should have a couple of Heisman Trophy winners Peyton Manning Johnny majors both runnersup AJ Johnson leader of Tennessee he's trying to assure these young guys they're up to this challenge Oklahoma won the toss deferred so Nick Hodgson to put it away like most of his kicks they sail deep or out of the endzone and so we'll see this volunteer offense in Justin Worley to work and he get enough protection to make place tonight jerk whether this is going to be the thing to watch you have to true freshmen starting on this offensive line and makeshift group they're young they're inexperienced they're going to be great but it's just young at this point going up against a very veteran group from Oklahoma Justin Worley has a lot of confidence a lot of a lot of moxie shown a lot of presents this year in that pocket is the leader this offense and I think it's very important that they start fast you heard 62 is three is the way Oklahoma's outscored their opponents in the first half the senior Marlin Lane for the right of Worley right away they ended up on the eggs trying to get Oklahoma stretched and Austin pig Howard is going to be floor and the dropped for a loss a negative play for the volunteers to start things and decrepitude into it already but it's a great job of containing this tenant the office so this office wants to get the ball out of the hands quickly from Worley get the ball on the perimeter they feel very confident that their receivers and running backs match up well with Tennessee that time struggle to get to the outside thanks to jordan evans doing a good job of containing Tiggle or pig Howard rather lose seven yards on the opening play Worley back throws quickly near side marques North makes the catch but it sure tackle and a short game and mark when North is one of the impact players tonight for Tennessee sick for they going to try to do a good job getting the ball up in the air he can go up and over some of the Oklahoma corners Alton Howard on the other side number two and then Zac Sanchez an allamerican type of corner number 15 and air striker for the best pass rushers in college football be trying to harass Justin Worley the whole game particularly impact lyrics we'll get out the whirly here their dad and thirteen really is protected fires far side you see the arm strengthen its behind North Julian Wilson defending and of three amount for the volunteers is actually a ball that they're trying to throw the back shoulder it's just the timings off just a bit that time it's a good decision and a good idea that time Worley early in this game just trying to settle in just timing down with North just missing a big gain a significant gain there on third down Matt Darin to fund special teams has been a problem area for the volunteers big edge and that Department of the Sooners the night you think the man in serling Shepherd taken over the kick return role the receiver back at his 35 yard line comes up and makes a fair catch s 243 so Trevor Knight some good field position operate with and he build on that tremendous Sugar Bowl game in a good start to 2014 yeah tonight just his eighth start I mean because of the way he played against Alabama I think people forget he's just a sophomore he's the last year he played early he had some injuries came back late in the year had the great Sugar Bowl that everybody's been talking about is off to a great start this year tremendous quickness kind of a dual threat guy and runs an office it's really geared more to run the football more than anything but he also has an ability to throw the football got a big arm you see a talented rotation of tailbacks along with night in the backfield all of them sophomores or freshmen on JP ryan number 32 the true freshman everyone would keep Ford and they handed off come on the left is for the sophomore from Cypress Texas with a bruising runner AJ Johnson one of the better linebackers in the SCC's number 45 he will be all over the field tonight and he's going to have to have a big game for Tennessee Tennessee walked down their safety they had eight men in the box they're almost going to dare Trevor Knight in Oklahoma to throw the football they're determined led by AJ Johnson to stop the running game on second now Knights got it rolls out in the flat finds Iran nail of guksu face and has a first down at the volunteer fortyfive and I think Oklahoma realizes that something they want to do so they go to play action right away a little bit of misdirection and get the ball out to Neal off of that naked looking good job of getting Tennessee out of position move the six they're going to play fast this is key for heading to the right thigh and forward to the volunteer 40yard line Curtis Magette made the tackle can't afford to miss any tackles he'll talk all week about the crowd noise and how they get a handle adversity to young team one area that they feel very confidence Magette at 56 and AJ Johnson these linebackers are very very talented group and guys who have played a lot of football they've got to be able to provide some leadership tonight it's Louisiana Tech and it's also Sooners right down the field Sifu free plays 81 yards and silence the crowd last week and they're on the march again second and five ended up breaking free is four into the secondary hit hard but not before he gains first generics of the 27 where they are crowding this line of scrimmage but right now they're losing the battle up front again Oklahoma has a decisive advantage in the trenches Chris not just with their defensive line but with a veteran offensive line going up against a young Tennessee defensive line that's why you see the Vols walking up the safeties and getting those linebackers involved but they can crease you with these backs and you just saw an example of it right there some versatile skill players for the Sooners they can play fast and not stuff to do on playaction and throw it down to Blake Bell the former quarterback you shift it over to tight end just off his fingertips well covered you cut a touchdown pass last week there's a great job of recognizing a wheel route by Todd Kelly this guy's a true freshman has a bright future his dad played for the balls and he's being asked on the road here early in his career to play a lot of football that was a great job and not just recognizing it but as a safety turning his head around finding the football and almost came up with an interception so one second and ten Alex Ross speedy back the sophomore from Jenks Oklahoma checks in knife looks over the middle fires a dart complete to bail and he pulled those his down to the 11 yard line about Trevor Knight here just buying a little bit of time he kind of backed off he felt the pressure and just kind of bailed on it because he knew that he had his tight end Blake Bell against sauce coverage first down Sooners playing fast he ended up winning lesson there's a hit behind the line of scrimmage this Johnson came flying up he's not afraid to say how he feels from the field Adam shed tried to get to him but it's the play before it's the only just buys time he's just backing up those of the Jets going to get to him but he knows he has his hide in as well that's the experience that Trevor Knight has gained in the confidence that he now has as a quarterback before I AJ Johnson lower in the poem there that was a heck of a play in all starts with a effective first down play it with his Tennessee defenses they're going to have a chance to slow down the Sooners 1 yard loss on that play second down losses hit again so Tennessee TFS looking stout Corey Vereen the end sets up a third and long now for Knight and Christmas the play that Trevor Knight will go back to you see how Vereen collapses down he's just reading that he actually misread that play next time he gets that look Trevor Knight will pull the football and if he would have pulled it there he goes around the corner and walks into the end zone a mystery but they'll come back to it later ninth play of the drive is the first third down for the Sooners nice pad time nowis plus cannot escape but he's dropped for a loss you all better victory for the Tennessee defense uestion with a young team on the road in this environment with after a three and out from your own offense right away Oklahoma is eating up big chunks of yards I was an outstanding job of coverage Chris down field that's who really got the sack Jordan Williams came in and got it but the coverage was great it contained Trevor Knight who's athletic enough to scramble kept him in the pocket and they forced the field goal Michael run again very reliable the active scoring leader by far yes yes no problem so the Sooners get good field position move it 45 yards in nine plays but Tennessee will take it it's a field goal for Oklahoma now touchdown you go on the road with his youngest team and you come up with a stop like that against ever night and experienced team that isn't win for Tennessee to only be down three here early MSP is your home of the new college football playoff you've seen teams that are considered playoff contenders already in the young season seemed to yield of the pressure not play up to the capabilities Oklahoma not in that category to devastating winds and their few opening games against overmatched opponents because of fast starts of pre nothing Lane and Hudson to kick it away again the breeze at his back would not expect a return here you don't get one so Kurt Worley and the Vols lost seven yards last time on first down to put them way in trouble about six Chris I think they're going to have a hard time establishing the line of scrimmage with the battle up front I think the game comes down to Justin Worley and his ability to read coverage make quick decisions and get the ball out of his hands before the pressure gets to him again he's got a bit with his pig Howard Marquez north Froome Josh Smith they have some athletes on the perimeter they've just got to get the ball out to them as quick as they can before that pressure gets to it but a very high path lead in the backfield there Jalen Hurd number one the five star tailback for fruit at a Hendersonville Tennessee but a short gain is Dominique Alexander hit him this Oklahoma defense is reminiscent of some of the old Oklahoma defenses when I say oh when Mike Stoops was here and they were chasing BCS Championships they're very physical and athletic on that defensive line the linebackers second and seven this is an offense that will struggle perhaps with this crowd noise tonight really shifting the fly and going to change up a protection powerhouse nice different young to go emotion watch out throws on the run a nice completion up near midfield and the catch is made by Josh Smith the sophomore from Knoxville this is a great job by Justin Worley comes off his primary to the right finds a little bit of time avoids the pressure by a new way and then finds his man Josh Smith there's a great example the boys that were Lee's been playing with this year that's a bigtime play I love the bones here receivers need to step up von Pearson unit countless player out with an ankle injury Willie pressure throws on first down incomplete he was hammered very quickly just after he got the ball away by Geno prisum right now they're trying to attack in inside on this defense taking a receiver go to the outside and make the quick break but look how quick you've got to get the ball out of your hands I mean Grissom's on one side strikers on the other and you're talking about two of the better pass rushers in the country on one defense like Jason through to make that play as a receiver here the quarterback and second in tune with comes emotionally a throw to him behind the line the suitors pursue and hit him back behind the line for a loss his striker Chris everybody thinks about him as a pass rusher because he had three facts against Alabama but this guy can play out in space the boom in a hurry very very versatile and Mike Stoops has gone from a four to five defense to a threefour to get both these outside linebackers on the field at the same time 1313 really can expect some pressure again that's the way looks downfield and throws complete for a first down of the Oklahoma 40yard line that's big power what this is again a young offensive line that's holding up okay that's third and 13 he gets pressure from the nose Jordan Phillips but he sets up into the pressure boys Phillips and then climb source brought them across the middle that's a big conversion there on third and long you take it to hurt from The Blind Side ball comes loose in the volunteers scrapland forfeited oklahoma ball which in Hayes made the recovery world II never saw it coming you notice that third down conversion Oklahoma did not blend this time right after the conversion they bring the Blitz from The Blind Side with a young offensive line nobody picks up the safety Quintin Hayes and Justin Worley did not recognize it sometimes with tempo Chris it's hard to be able to recognize the coverage and the pressure you might face Worley never even saw Hayes coming he disguised it waited to the very last second and blindsided Justin Worley for the big turnover hey is the senior leader of that secondary forces and recovers the fumble and again good field position for Oklahoma at the 46 you fake it to Ross Knight now pressure those B escape ability it just throws it away on the sidelines the chickfila impact players for the Sooners Keith board leads the committee of backs you'll see all three of them before and I think at this point is the man up front sterling Shepherd is outstanding by far the best receiver for the Sooners they look to try to get him the football we've talked a lot already about AJ Johnson and his leadership and cam Sutton number 23 these corner is going to be on an island a lot tonight playing mantoman they've got to be able to hold up but it's not just Shepherd but the rest of the OE receivers exactly record you see it right now the top of your screen room second and 10 knife keeps it he's quick he said skirt but he couldn't get away from Derek Barnett one of the many true freshmen playing on this volunteer defense a true freshman making a start in this environment he's at a Brentwood Academy in Nashville how about the recognition he thought of stunts he went from the outside to the inside but if he doesn't make that play Trevor Knight picks up a first down in probably some more yards volunteer run seven stepping up so far moves need 11 on third down fire to strike complete KJ young de freshmen night got hit hard after the completion yeah and they're going to go sit over here we're going to show you real quick watch the pressure and watch the toughness of Trevor Knight he knows what's coming it's the second time we've seen him hang on to that football to the last moment before Williams gets to him and he gets the first down are they thinking Ross night rolls fires back across the middle and a nice catch in a high dart he is made there by Shepherd his goto receiver tight coverage from cam Sutton but an accurate throw and he came to the back side because coverage was so good on the play side he had to look back and of course that's his favorite target anytime he gets it in trouble he's usually looking to sterling Shepherd he goes to hyper speed attack his kneel drop behind the line by Michael Williams you're not familiar with Oklahoma part of the reason they go tempo is because it gets them into rhythm but like many offenses in college football they want to wear down this Tennessee defense they're they're pretty thin on the defensive line they want to wear that defensive line out and be able to run and throw the ball but that's why they're going tempo tonight you can see the success they had against Louisiana Tech and also last week in their game against Tulsa keyboard checks back into the last the night drops pay back now puts into the back and for was running room monitoring of the endzone touchdown Oklahoma they cash him to turn over for a quick six all of these young backs are excellent receivers at the 33yard touchdown in a blown coverage Tennessee looked confused from the formation from the outset of that play they brought pressure and Trevor Knight recognized the pressure there was nobody there after the Blitz to pick up Keith's board and he just walks into the end zone in less than two minutes to turn the fumble recovery about Quentin Hays into a touchdown this is what Tennessee fans were afraid of night in the Sooners are rolling early in Norman Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking done Nissa choose nissan today for great offers on our most exciting lineup ever shop choose nissan car and the home depot were saving more doing that's the power the Home Depot both previous Oklahoma Tennessee games were in Orangeville that was the old 1938 season 1939 Orange Bowl when General Meetings volunteers when a national championship has shut out oklahoma 17 nothing data miami never allowed more than seven points in any game that season you can see what was going on back look at Wizard of Oz and Gary Wow no Marvin Gaye was though I doing that year no this is the first regular season meeting show you the second meeting Louisville later on so early in the volunteers back to work but suddenly in a 10point hold the bottom of the fumble recovery you can be an overwhelming place to play even for experienced scenes much less a really young team like Tennessee the stadium stripes by section excellent crown discipline time from student section maybe if they want Hudson this time not as deep we're going to give it a shot with devaron young hammered are to the 15 go see I'm right there loses the ball Oklahoma says it's another turnover Howry burger provided this shot no signal yet the head linesman gave a signal really quick saying it was a tennessee football but see what happens when the ball is down at the bottom there and I see Center here in Norman the volunteers can breathe a sigh of relief as they do hold on to possession here let's go back to the touchdown and a mental error here you see mantoman across the board for Tennessee then you see your linebackers and your safeties two guys making their first start on the road the linebackers the safety blitz is and watch what the linebacker doe he also blitzes so you leave a running back all alone Reeves made and came through the middle Todd Kelly blitz nobody was left there 44 first down they fake at the lane and the plan is completed Josh Malone another one of those talented true freshmen of fivestar recruit from Gallatin Tennessee big future well he's 63 204 pounds this is what we keep talking about we say you're going to like the tennessee skill whether it's malone or Smith or Howard or Norris or chrome they feel very confident again that they can find some openings and throw the football with Justin Worley that time nice job he started to look downfield for the hit and he's lucky to hold on to the football he had a monster spring game six catches a buck 81 3 touchdowns to get the Tennessee fans excited so a first down throw they drop it off the lane cannot break it back over to Heather Cox if you're talking about this Tennessee youth more than half the travel roster has never played a collegiate Road game as intimidating and as loud as this environment as they are calm boys and focus and a note on the Tennessee offense they're going to try to go side to side on the perimeter so hard we look for those wide receivers to get some action here another you see number 55 there Coleman Thomas first time ever on an airplane to come to this game a lot of new stuff for the caisson white girlfriend's tonight as a second man handoff and a short gain by layin it will set up third down see one of the adjustments right now with what Mike Stoops is doing is he's getting more aggressive and blitzing C striker there they walked him out over the slide and then as the ball is snapped they're bringing him you're also being Quinton Hayes and pretend to safety they're bringing him quite a bit for Mike Stoops in the blindside of Justin Worley that's an adjustment right away with that young line get aggressive try to bring pressure empty backfield on third and five Sooners showing pressure off the edge and then back out rush only free but still get to Worley and dual away made the sack and Tennessee is going to Punic in Coleman Thomas a true freshman the right tackle matched up against the man to see just a war daddy and Indu way a senior in 63 290 pounds that's a tough matchup and Worley knows he's got to be able to get the ball out of his hands especially on 3rd that's in do it and you're a true freshman I was in high school Johnna high school Hill last year facing him now he'll block him no you didn't know Matt Doherty punted again and Shepherd is back putting into a freeze and it's a pretty short kick Shepherd fair catch at the 37 and the challenge all week and our thing and play out for Butch Jones is he's got to come up with a plan especially on third down and he knows to be able to help out this offensive line and ultimately Justin Worley and these receivers to try to execute Chris Cotter and Bristol with this Taco Bell studio update USC at Boston College over on ESPN Cody Kessler finds one of his many talented wideouts to H bar Murphy yards out Trojans up early ended up back to Chris cook alright Chris thank you USC on upset alert after the win over Stanford their next game is the conference home game against Oregon State mrs. Ford and then Tennessee defense ring in an attic they've had a lot of excellent plays but the one coverage buses is put them in a 10 zip hole yeah yeah and again they're they're very very determined to be able to match up with this running game of Oklahoma's and they're willing to leave those corners on an island you know they had the one middleware where they gave up cord the easy touchdown but for the most part they're holding up against the run but you leave yourself a bit vulnerable against the pass because Knight can't throw it seemed very well on first down out of all years and Knight does throw it catch made and breaking a tackle is drawn Neal junior out of st. Louis it'll set up third down the reasons that Tennessee felt that they had to come in and and load up the line extremities because it is not just the inexperienced to look at the side of Oklahoma's offensive line and you guys are veteran you heard Butch Jones this week and some of his coaches saying another redshirt juniors and redshirt seniors and we're playing a lot of firstyear guys so they're going to have to do something slant angle the defensive line and also commit those numbers Fick they're down here big edge and pinches on both sides for Oklahoma night protection on third down zips it across to Shepherd shepherd running into the secondary sterling Shepherd cuts back in his dress as 215 by cam Sutton but it's huge play and the Sooners are in position again 45 yards another big third down throw by Trevor Knight grows in rhythm and if you're going to bring pressure you've got to bring your corners up tight against erling Shepherd if he has a three release against this secondary on third down the ball is going to go to number three he is clearly the guy in this offense and he had a free release and when he does he and Trevor Knight are in rhythm he was the slot receiver a year ago but he's the main guy now they lost three of their top four pass catchers on first down Ford for no games like in Tennessee doing the job on first down it was AJ Johnson with the stop here's the fast go back to this pass and you can see this Trevor Knight work very very hard this summer to become even more complete player he had the big bowl game he gets back no hitch ball is thrown right on the money and this is the guy that he's worked the hardest with and sterling Shepherd sterling last week eight catches 177 yards and the receiver that Tennessee knew they had to try to take out to try to make Knight have to find somebody else to make plays share for the productive guy last year with 51 catches in seven touchdowns and about inside afford we muscles forward it'll be another third down for Oklahoma final minute of report the thing to become disheartening if you're a Tennessee fan is if they're playing well enough and we've got a an injured player here looks like the true freshman Derek Barnett but you play well you play well and then boom you give up a big play especially early in the game we talked about how they needed to start fast and get some confidence established see Tina Cornett is and he's backed up by another two freshmen we chose you why Oklahoma is so tough to stop and you've got a guy who's so confident in playing so well at tempo as nightís yeah I mean I think the experience that he had in the Sugar Bowl against Alabama I think skyrocketed his confidence not just in his ability but I think in the team's ability in this offense I think Josh Heupel the offensive coordinator they're calling plays they're just running faster they're executing much much better now that they have a quarterback with some experience and last year he was fighting for his job with Blake Bell now it's his show it's his offense exactly teammates praising his leadership his command out there he's competed his last six passes he needs five on this third down Ford in motion and a whistle I think Tennessee called a timeout from the sidelines because they saw a different formation with the fullback Dmitri flowers coming to the game and that's who Oklahoma was going to try to throw a shovel pass through there well the second to the quarter involves trying to force the field goal attempt volunteer defense just trying to hang around and see if they can get a stop on third down of course a field goal attempt see what they adjusted after the timeout call see if they decide to try to affect Trevor Knight with some pressure it uses the derrick born as the first defensive end who was down is back in the game Alex Ross in motion Knight takes a peek the left throws of the end zone it's incomplete overthrown again tight coverage Jalen reevesmaybin the linebacker was right there and here comes a field goal attempt and remember Jalen reevesmaybin was the linebacker who blitz on the play where there was a busted coverage when Todd Kelly came off the edge that time they try to sneak the wheel route again with a running back this time Reeves mavin is all over it I think guys trying to track down the career scoring record of Oklahoma by DeMarco Murray in his career only is is 66 of 76 chip shot from 27 so for Houma twice held the field goals in this first quarter after long drives not quite as dominant as the starts in the first two games but a 13 nothing lead in a defense that is given the volunteers offensive line lots of trouble Renault fell Sunday should start at ESPN 10a Eastern Sun the NFL countdown presented by Snickers Crisp ermine and the game with all the latest news and updates right up until kickoff and before you set your fantasy lineup so our experts provide that latest news and injury reports fantasy football now delivered by Papa John's espn2 at 11:00 a.m. also on watch ESPN so the one promising drive Kirk the Tennessee mounted in the first quarter ended with that blitz and that fumble by the quarterback well they are as predicted struggling to establish the line of scrimmage there is negative nine right now in rushing yards and it's going to be a rough night running the football so when you become onedimensional you become obviously more predictable and it allows the defense to attack you in a very aggressive manner and I think that's that's the challenge form tonight is how do you save multiple when all your going to have a chance to do really is throw the football and talk about why Oklahoma is so difficult to defend why they create these oneonone matchups that make it tough to help out on those talented edge pass rushers busy quarter for Nick Hodgson the lower kick they can in the end zone by Debra young you goes forward to the 20 here comes a flag in the final play of the quarter first fly by this SCC crew Matt Moore referee player down on kickoff coverage is Derek woods the Richards sophomore wide receiver being attended to there's to be grasping his leg here's the call from Matt Moore return isnan to the goal we will have a nun calm down so the bond Swofford guilty of the penalty will be an untimed down to do it again like Woods is being carried off not putting any weight at all on that left leg the Tennessee gets an offensive snap from their 10yard line and this will be the final play of the first quarter they handed to hurt the freshmen wrapped up immediately by Charles Taffer the fun defensive end so 13nothing oklahoma and to the first quarter here in norman back after this message and a word year local ABC station welcome back ESPN center net Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo volunteers begin the second quarter by the second and seven play and that I've been signed to herd ran 14 plays Kirk in the first quarter almost half of six four zero or negative yardage obviously their big thing is tempo and being able to sustain tries and being able to convert on third down tonight so far one of three here comes another third down see where the pressure comes it's been coming from the field with striker he walked out right now sooners rush only three will he finds nobody open until fires later the middle off posted some fault they were not getting to each other Julian Wilson deflected it went in Hayes was in the neighborhood but it was crowded and they only rushed three that time you know that's the thing that's the versatility of OU's attack they show Grissom and then he drops at the end they still get pressure they still move Justin Worley but you've got eight guys in coverage makes it really hard to try to squeeze one in it on third down really good job by Julian Wilson getting his right arm around Lord to knock that ball up into the air and they almost got the pick another fun food our Shepherd could give the Sooners excellent field position here they are with the breeze that in fact Shepherd makes two fairtex near midfield and Trevor Knight no paloma go back to work by 13 well the sophomore from San Antonio is off to a great start tonight doing a little bit of everything here buying some time and finding Blake Bell for a big game deep in a Tennessee territory here in rhythm was throwing Shepherd for a big game for the Sooners and then the recognition call the Tennessee puffed to the coverage finds the running back Keith Lord out of the backfield threw the touchdown for Oklahoma it's again great field position for the Sooners who averaged an own 43 hamaji Pierre I'm the tough physical true freshman runner with a nice gain on first down reevesmaybin stopped them this is the other concern for Tennessee is this committee of backs with Keith Lord Alex Ross and now Pierre I'm weepy Wright comes into the third guys 245 pounds of pure muscle you and I are on the field before the game and he'll Gunny came over to us and said hey hey hey hey hey you see my true freshman running down my gosh he's been in the weight room didn't look like a true freshman Oh doubt you got it yards on first down and down false start on the left side I think he Brian's also a very emotional guy Corgi understand fiveyard penalty second a nice belt he was in tears after his first college game it was just kind of the culmination of a lifelong dream to get out there thought he played pretty well and just showed his emotions to his teammates edge of the game I think players really appreciate that and what I appreciate is that all three of these young backs you've got a couple sophomores and then he Ryan who's the true freshman and they're all happy when the other guys in they're doing well he'll Gunny told us there really isn't any rhyme or reason for how he shuffles he's backed in he put he loves to keep them all involved let him stay fresh the handoff young guy again it'll set up a third down it also helps to have Trevor Knight as I'm here really a good distributor makes a lot of good decisions we've seen that on display already I think the confidence that he gained in that Sugar Bowl performance where he was the MVP of putting up those huge numbers just skyrocketed his confidence and understanding of what he's capable of doing within this offense ever seen him run the ball yet tonight a big part of the skill set he gained quarters and 45 yards on the water last year right across the middle it's broken up so Tennessee able to get off the field quickly cam Sutton made a nice play and then will force an Oklahoma fun and they motion the back out to open up the middle I thought you might see quarterback draw but instead it it's Neal there on Neal coming through the middle of that defense but great coverage by cam Sutton you've got good size at about six 190 pounds we talked about him being an impact player because he's going to be out on an island about third down coming up with a SWAT there to keep that ball away from Neal now drops back as a punt returner jedd Barnett the senior secondyear finding food Sooners kick it away it's it up into the breeze and it's a free short kick Sutton takes it at the 20yard line so Tennessee's t62 and it's best to keep the volunteers close still down 13 Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought you by Cadillac chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich and Wranglers new advanced comfort jeans unbeatable comfort and twenty percent stronger about thirty years ago at first meeting in Miami the Sooners of the volunteers got after it again year's night 1968 in the 67 season missed field goal by the volunteers late oh you won at noon Butch Jones was not yet born on New Year's Day he's 68 that's the last meeting it's been almost a halfcentury since these two teams have gotten together about the big man in the Tennessee offense do something that defense them well or unrest you take the handoff on the first down orally has some time fixes first shut down feel over through North I just like to call in first content I mean now you're facing second tenth obviously but I like the idea of taking a shot and why not take it down filled with Marquez North 64 has a chance to get behind Julian Wilson they're pushing and shoving a little bit but I don't mind it because it stretches the defense lets them know that you're not afraid to take a shot and also good protection there on first and ten we get near the red zone North is a terrific weapon six for long arms huge hands does that get the ball but Worley is pressured again and dropped for a third time tonight Eric's striker in the neighborhood Grappelli striker this is well you ask me what makes it so topics because of the way they bring guys late look at striker was walked out here and then he comes down here right before the ball is snapped and there's that true freshman out in an aisle in there Coleman Thomas trying to block one of the best pass rushers the quickest pass rushers in the country Alabama could do it the Sugar Bowl we got a true freshman out there trying to block it Romar with the stacking here comes the pressure again and Down Goes Worley Charles tapper dropped in there is a flag down on the side and that over you defensive line starting to Felix up now and check the penalty Oh miss the safety Quentin Hays and that will not make either Supes brother happy as it wipes out the sack Mike's frustrated obviously you can see Hays they've been bringing that blitz a lot it's been very effective tonight walking Ken up to the line of scrimmage they disguised it it's part of the genius behind this offense is the way they can come in so many different ways now they're shown pressure and they lot of move dropped at the snap of the ball now they're all coming yeah safety came over the center they flip it off though a nice little ploy to Jalen Hurd of the freshman off and running gets a block downfield and gets to midfield and finally the volunteers handle the Blitz great call an easy throw and only thing Worley had to do was recognize the pressure Mike Stoops brought everybody and all your going to have a chance to do is if you don't get to the quarterback there's nobody left not only to take the running back he's got a convoy in front of him Oh use lucky that seems all the way to the house did gain 30 yards third catch of the young season for the true freshman first how they hand it to them and heard is dropped behind the line there very quickly was Alexander and Jordan Billis now this Oklahoma defense is pinning his ears back and trying to kind of get this field to tilt one way that's against Tennessee they Lucy the pressure the Justin Worley has been on tonight but he's still hanging tough he hang it in that pocket he's taken his loss under the penalty against Quentin Hayes wiped out the sack need the volunteers new life big boy gets in the midfield but it's second and 12 you can expect more pressure again from the Sooners Worley lost it down field and trying to make a tough catch with Jayson croon Julian Wilson he covered it 65 240 pounds Jason crumb going up against Julian Wilson Wilson a big corner but they're they're kind of going back and forth keep fighting off Wilson with his right hand and he tries to make the onehanded catch officials standing right there could have gone either way good nocall Wilson was the nickel back a year ago still adjusting to the corner position but he has a big fast dude boots bond timeout the plate back was down at five for the volunteers Sooners will spend a defensive timeout Butch Jones young team only eight guys here in their third year in the program trying to weather things try to answer Oklahoma and cut into this lead and you talked about what makes this defense difficult to deal with and it's not just the youth of Tennessee when you go to a threefour scheme you see in the NFL a lot you have three defensive linemen then you have two outside linebackers with Mike Stoops has is three big athletic defensive lineman to give you a push in the middle and the bonus is his two outside linebackers in Grissom 85 on one side and striker 19 on the other is they're versatile they can drop in coverage and they can blitz the quarterback and when they both walk up to the line of scrimmage and you're an offensive line you're trying to figure out who's coming and who's dropping and sometimes they both come so it's really built on deception confusion and then overall speed they're able to create oneonone matchups their favorite want thicker oh yeah I saw the excitable Mike Stoops eight years away from this place at Arizona says it feels like a blur very happy to be back on the 3rd long and they get it up north who shakes a couple tackles and hammers for a first down a muchneeded play for that volunteer offense well as much as throwing Shepherd in to go to guy for the Sooners Marquess North is the same for Tennessee soft coverage again Zach Sanchez he feels that he can give him that cushion because the distance that they had to go for the first down but a good quick throw that time by Worley and North shows what he can do with the ball in his hands after the catch and she has the playmaker in that secondary with a missed tackle own and will make him mad the catch is made by Josh Smith but at the loss we just talked about how Grissom is versatile 85 you think of him at 265 pounds he's going to rush the quarterback look at him outside he's out in space at 265 pounds he came in at 225 kind of a high school basketball player but he's blown into a 265 pound man but he can drop it he can also pressure he's the guy that had the speed from score against Alabama and the Sugar Bowl had a couple of fumble recoveries in that win over Alabama Worley gets protection steps up good or run but fires downfield has a man wide open edex chuck smith touchdown Tennessee Wow a long march Kirk drive prolong by the penalty on hey so they find the endzone and look who he's matched up again this is a very deceiving receiver as far as his quickness and speed and he's a veteran Josh Smith understands coverage he's matched up against the safety and Ahmad Thomas who's a sophomore and I give credit to Justin Worley for buying a little bit of time again once again stepping into the pocket eyes a little bit of time and instead of running because it looked like he could open some yards he takes the chance and finds the matchup that he wanted a 40 yard touchdown his true freshman Aaron medley knocks to the point and Tennessee's defense has done enough to hang around keep it close and finally the offense is able to provide as far that's a great point the Tennessee defense they've been on the ropes but they've hung in there Worley there it is buying some time throws the ball and look at the safety of my Thomas never saw the football great job of great communication between the quarterback and his receiver sudden the volunteers very much back in at 13 7:00 as we continue dr. peppers championship drive game of the week 79 yard drive by the volunteers the longest thatöyou has allowed this season at one point Kirk ever backed up at their 10yard line 90 yards away but Worley converted a third and 11 and a third and 12 on the drive that was huge and especially considering what you're dealing with up front with the youth and we're going to focus on the quarterback and the receivers but I'm going to talk all night if Tennessee is able to hang around about that all types of line and what they're facing that was it we also give them an assist for that drive Jordan Bullock boots it away excellent coverage by Tennessee which suddenly is get a little pep in their step they drop Neal back down inside the 15 we talked you know the game feels like it's out of reach but right now down 13 to 7 ran flag trivia question since 1990 and volunteers have had 10 running backs selected in the first three rounds of the draft the last and the C running back to lead the SEC in rushing so there's some lots of guys to the league the way you think your mom yeah I don't think the bear would ask that if it were that easy I think you're going to have to dig a little bit there some of it goes in the bear he cooks up these questions for us Oklahoma suddenly a little more urgency member this team has not been challenged in any second quarter so far this season night at time he'll just chuck it away Chris for a young team on the road where nobody gave them much of a chance except their fan base and the people in that locker room as I said this game feels a lot more than 13 to 7 my Oklahoma's had their way they haven't been able to punch it in Tennessee deserves a lot of credit for it but after scoring to pull within six this defense comes out of the field you talked about a little bit of pep in their step some big series in his football game for both these games you second down give it ahead to Alex Ross and once again excellent penetration they drop them for a loss Corey Vereen get in there and now it's third and long and we talked about when you're undersized as a defense you got a slant and angle and just Tennessee defense they're moving bodies and they're attacking downhill at the line of scrimmage watch the defensive line the other moving it's a bit of a risk because if you plan or angle the wrong way if you create a crease that time they get thrice sooners only two if I onethird down most of have been third and long night escapes five time fires Sarla it's complete but short of a first down daddy Ron Neil did not get the yardage Justin Coleman was right there this time we see Tennessee just rushing three they used AJ Johnson the allconference middle linebacker as a spy in case of a scramble by Trevor Knight and that's what forced him to have to throw the football instead of trying to run remember he's very effective on third down and running they rush three getting to get pressure and then you can see right there AJ Johnson chasing him down curtain begin also in there as a pass rusher lined up as a defensive end on third down so a second straight three and out for the Oklahoma offense or nets upon it it's a pretty good one the fair catch made at the 32yard line so Tennessee's offense after the 45 yard punt back to work down only six Chris Connor in studio Wells Fargo gets it done the Irish having a hard time getting it done right now inside Lucas Oil Stadium Golson though on the scramble he'll take it from 15 yards out 1714 NP / Purdue right now at the half Chris thank you Chris volunteers play quickly and that's Jalen Hurd Tennessee defense comes up with a big stop to get the ball back remember the last time the Vols had the ball they went into the endzone Justin Moore Justin Worley converting to big third down for the touchdown pass he's been pressured on like or sacked three times 10 to 15 at touchdown the Smith zone replaying the suitors stuff it right away so here come to third down eventually Worley does have enough athletic ability where he can pull that out and he'll probably say that for a certain third down when the defense is not expecting it try to law on the sleeve but that defense was the collapsing quickly down the bat when they give him that action and successful on third down as Utah State and Arkansas state tougher sure here with the crowd noise in the Oklahoma talent you need four where they look immediately let's get to that quick north spins back has a first down at near midfield Wilson stop them it's amazing to me the soft coverage Wilson bailing on third and short and you're dealing with an offense it doesn't have time it'll they're not going to protect the quarterback because it's a struggle form so if anything you would think the corners would be a tight trying to make these wide receivers have to work to get open to try to disrupt the timing but an easy release and an easy throw there on third down Josh Malone the tall question not north on the first half catch they pick the herd Worley look back that way pressured hit is he froze and it's incomplete boy they're worried about four Sooners converging on the quarterback there well they found an area that they're attacking and with all due respect to Coleman Thomas his kids a freshman out of Virginia he'd probably eventually going to be a great player but strikers done this the entire first half he's out walked out over the slot and as they sit close to the ball being snapped he starts to cheepcheepcheep and then his the ball of staff he's coming with momentum and you got a true freshman trying to hold him out they're going to have to use the tight end or a running back to chip striker otherwise you can be in the backfield all night and you get two ladies met immediately Charles tappers combining with Dominique Alexander after the old conference guy a year ago comes from Baltimore excellent hoops player just look at the action again look at striker collapsing down everybody is collapsing in getting inside not respecting the threat Oh Justin Worley pulling that ball and really make another third down play they need eight and it tied in there to help once again pressure cannot get away from Jordan Phillips big old nose tackle dependent never the freedom 34 pounds house crusher at this time they use the back seat to the right that time he helps the freshmen but when you move the right tackle out there's other bodies that are capable of getting in there the big fella showing some moves in fifth jardín Phillips so you worry so much about striker Chris to the outside that you can't double team down on guys like tapper and Phillips and usually vim one on one and then make it into the corner back Phillips the guy who in a back injury last year hampered him stuff when you get all those speedy guys trick you get a 330 pounders you can get in there for the quarterback prototypical nose guard some Sheppard back deep the punt from Matt dark Shepard this time again calls bear cave his mom sherry doesn't like the fact she that he returns punching kick ups and makes her very nervous and maybe that's it isn't I be giving him a sign from the stand another fair catch mom let him run with one laughs like trivia question the last Tennessee back to lead the SEC in rushing we thought that Jamal Lewis was was too obvious as Travis Stevens Drive tamal Lewis I'm gonna say I do that when you're there huh oh my god 2001 so it's been 13 years even though they had so many guys drafted from that position in that last game he had against Florida the swamp to no one you pick it it took a shot downfield look for you for Shepherd it makes a catch out near midfield excellent throw from Trevor Knight V beat cam Sutton all to the playaction look the corners remember they got to hold up on an island here's to the best cam Sutton for Tennessee and sterling Shepherd he's been given a fair catch on the punt this time he gets one on one and he gets around Sutton in a hurry and you can see the acceleration once he gets buying 32 yards your mom's got no problem is a receiver done one and returning those punts and kicks Sooners give it to Ford a short game again Oklahoma not getting anywhere near the production on first down they expected and I love the Tennessee mentality of realizing we're going to we're going to live on the edge this game we have to live on the edge with our slant our angling our blitzing of the linebackers our corners out on an island and so far you know we're 4:30 to go in the first half they're holding up they're giving up some plays but they're holding up Sheppard with 90 yards and there's three receptions second and nine they motioned Ford and it's three and a throw back underneath and this is P Ryan the big freshman fish you go back they kind of ripped the ball away but he takes it to the 35 again he's just a participant folks they motion out a back which gets AJ Johnson watch him run with key for now all of a sudden they say oh it's going to go out to the left and it sets up perfectly to go out to the right anytime you can get AJ Johnson out of the middle of that defense and as you go back to the right it's a weakness for Tennessee's defense in a great area to attack by Josh Eiffel play action on first down Knight just throw it away in the traffic on the sideline Corey Vereen has been active tonight he was once again pressuring the quarterback well the man that he wanted to go to actually fell down sterling Shepherd lost his footing and he didn't have anybody left to get the ball to there again again oneonone tries to get around Sutton and just loses his footing everybody else is covered there's nothing the Trevor Knight could do with the football volunteers knew they needed to have Vereen win some oneonone battles tonight if they were going to get after Knight he's done a pretty good job he Ford flares out of the back till they throw it back to Shepherd shepherd weaving through traffic jumps over a tackler with the big yard line just short of the first out of the flag is down on the near side it picked up the flag so no foul in a game that sets up third and one for Oklahoma Iran that 243 pound freshman is behind night and Shepherd in motion they give it to Pierre item makes a cut hammer straight ahead yeah it's tough for the first guy to stop him he's got a first down each shirt I did to get the ball but no fumble sure doesn't look like a true freshman take a good look at this taken his thumb out as he comes off the field Tennessee players thought when they hit him before his knees touch that they were able to fight the ball away from them when you're a young we are young back it's one thing linebackers especially SEC linebackers are going to do they're going to try to test that ball security at the end of the play he gets the first down but when they stand you up especially they're going to start to fight for that football this v10 is kind of squeezing it with his arm there use a false start those are 77 off yes fiveyard penalty first down Yonsei Savage them back up guard flagged Oklahoma after giving up the touchdown trying to answer here before halftime 237 to play mentioned savage in the game throw he and Tyler Evans another backup guard he's in a game as well I think that's the big thing for Oklahoma can they stay healthy on the offensive line an area that's been depleted over the years which Jones wants an explanation Matt Moore this SEC crew they may want to look at that play again did P Ryan fumble the ball could they tell whether or not his knee was down you can see the volunteers ripping at the ball begins to come loose there he's got it wedged in his arm against his body but it's not secured with the arm and you can see Sutton diving in there the big 12 replay crew David Aames in charge of it it would be enough to overturn the call of no fumble the ball beginning to come loose at the pocket starts to come out they called forward progress then they wouldn't be able to review it second bill Lemonnier longtime Big Ten official to see what the replay officials are specifically looking at here they're going to look to see if the knee is down control the football it appears the ball is loose now what they're going to determine is before 23 comes in did he pull the ball away so I'm not sure we have indisputable video evidence what lets it show it's one that when is it a fumble wouldn't wouldn't he lost possession of the ball he's lost the ball right now oh he does not have control the football so if you're looking at this that balls out in your mind right I don't know right there when 23 comes over his back whether he's whether the runner regained it it appears not so the ball wasn't held in his hands he had a kind of his arm holding it against his side as the knees were close to hitting the ground and Sutton's in there ripping at it see that the official came running in from the near sideline spotting the ball is a first down and no fumbling exactly and bill again if you could just say winning your mind you think is the ball is loose I think the ball is loose right now the other interesting thing that this is is an ace down I don't know if any little driving he's actually driving the legs trying to get the first down I think we got a good chance for fumble here the other interesting thing is the false start gave the opportunity for this place still to be Jackley again I play would have got off then there would it would have been too late after further review the ruling as the knee was down at the place and Oh Butch Jones not going to like the verdict from the big 12 replay crew yes you see officials on the field not calling it a fumble either what a massive swing because either the volunteers you can get the ball back down six instead really ones got it at the 29 yard line really tough to look at that angle and say definitively that that he touched Bob Stoops is very good at running plays quickly period but also when he thinks there might be a question David Aames that replay official said they'll get up very fast shoots is an excellent sense of when you term want to try to hurry the play and prevent the replay the false start as bill pointed out allowed them to take another look yes Savage didn't move that play would have been would have been able to be executed at Oklahoma keeps it with some 15 volunteers walk up some pressure they fake it quarterback keeps it first run of the night for Trevor Knight and he shows the quickness down inside of 20 new is coming we saw it early a couple times where he's given that plays his own read they're collapsing down and Trevor Knight has the quick now he'll get out to the edge pick up some big yards and after the mistake with the procedure call he gets around the corner and gets him a good chance here on second down the averages nine point one a carry on those zone read keepers up again about that amount there on second and six play clock at five for amorous threat ahead spins into the secondary as a first down as he bounces to the ten it's about keeping these back healthy and fresh with three of them he brought away he bounced right off of Brian Randolph there and I don't know Chris all three these backs we've got a bright future but Keith's board looks like in Oklahoma back mean he's got suddenness to him he's got power he bounces off of safeties and linebackers keeps his feet moving averages almost six acharyas of freshmen kind of a combination of the physical bacteria and the speedster Ross Here I am looking on board still in there on first down he's got it again and he's got a crazy touchdown Oklahoma so the Sooners win the verdict and the replay crew birth to a touchdown and stretch the lead as halftime approaches anyone yards in nine plays and four with his second touchdown tonight when catching the one running low line drive from Honeycutt the offensive line does a really good job of getting up to the linebackers another zone read and when the quarterback runs the ball to the edge it gets the defense's attention and makes the blocking angles a little bit easier you see Williams climbing to that second level nice job by the offensive line of fitting just perfectly there in the vision the cutback that holes designed to go to the right but he saw the grass was to the backside and he does a good job with his vision and awareness to cut that back that was a big try for this o u offense between the end of this first half a couple of three nouns before that drive it got started with the lice sideline throw to Shepherd and the seed fans saying wait a second we're still not sure that wasn't the fumble but not enough to overturn it and Oklahoma back up 13 go to Chris Connor for an update all right skirt Prescott 8pd inside ahead set USC at DC over on ESPN somebody calls down on the headset dialed up a reverse German Alston taking it the distance 54 yards out the Eagles about score out rush Dempsey I should say 197 to 8 the first half and they lead at halftime perfect well well it's a BC team Krista couldn't do much on the ground coming into this game Trojans get out quickly but mine Emily awesome I might have liked their guard down a little bit if it upsets all over the place on this Saturday it would be a big one both get driven into the wind by Hudson and no return so a minute 33 for the volunteer offense to work with Oklahoma is going to get the ball to start the second half remember Monday night shift Kelly errbody Philadelphia Eagles gets Andrew Luck and the Colts a rematch of sorts of those pac12 games between yantras in Oregon in 15 also available on the watch ESPN app Eagles very sluggish after before roaring back against Jacksonville fun one to watch what do you do you take a shot you got yeah you got one timeout left you might try on the first down play it maybe give yourself a but you don't want to make a huge mistake here the way your team is battled here in the first half I want to have a saccharine interception we're late again flips it up short into heavy traffic the screen didn't work Heather guys it appears that the Tennessee Oh line is having trouble with the snap count three times during the last possession and just now left guard Marcus Jackson has a slap Center Matt Crowder to get him to snap the ball Crowder came off the field telling his line coach I can't hear and guys it is really loud down here to practice against crowd noise not quite the same as the real thing and again Tennessee Volunteers are so young and once again Oklahoma tries to get him they flip it out just in the nick of time Marlin Lane but the little desperation pass from Worley where the pressures been coming from the right much and a half but now that the pressure comes from the backside the defensive end that we are the outside linebacker Grissom so much of focus on striker now we're starting to see Jordan Phillips the previous Drive and Gino Christo hands past their Kirk get rid of it whatever it takes throw it lefthanded instead of a minute before I found in each seven on this third down I really think you just try to get in and be content down 22:7 especially on the road with this offensive line welcome to play clock lying down not a great deal of urgency at the moment and it has handed off to Hurd who will not get the first down so we'll see if Oklahoma spends its time out to force a punt oh yeah Stoops halfway out on the field caught a timeout which means now it's a different deal now you're talking about a quarterback with some experience and an offensive line and I think Oklahoma they're going to try to attack and try to get in field goal range take a look at the AP top ten brought to you by Northwestern Mutual we're gonna win over Wyoming Alabama hammering but not covering against Southern Miss only won by 40 the Georgia of course the loss to South Carolina Gamecocks basically when to stay alive in the SEC East USC isn't showed you Kris update trailing at halftime sterling Shepard see if he decides not to fair catch and create some good field position give his offense something to work with with 37 seconds for graft on sooners peel back to set up the return Shepard this time we'll take it circle back and is dropped excellent coverage by the volunteers and the Sooners are at their own 30 with 28 seconds to go s cars all new chase begins tomorrow in Chicago 16 drivers going to move on to the second round Chase for the Sprint Cup title one o'clock Eastern over on ESPN also available on the watch ESPN app at 28 seconds and one timeout with of course the boundary in first downs your friend here for Trevor Knight Bob Stoops did not call a timeout to kill the clock he's going to try to try to find some matchups and see if he can pick up some chunks of yards and try to get to the field goal range got about 35 yards he needs to gain they really give his kicker a chance when he cuts through long is from 53 but he's working against to Brees this direction tonight has time over the middle at the dart complete out across the 46 to Blake Bell nice guy being taxed by the six foot six a 10 great hands the former quarterback has and they can they can flex him out the way they just did almost as the receiver he's off to the left again it's the first down now restart the clock night pressured escapes fired over the middle again Belle's got it again suddenly down inside a 35 with 12 seconds to play they needed 35 yards that's 36 yards in two plays still have their time outlet dr. Manickam and Trevor night is remember this is an offense it's uptempo to begin with off running instead of ten fires again over the middle off the hands of a receiver intercepted so Tennessee gets a turnover with Gerald McNeal on the carom Justin Coleman deflected it with three seconds to go about the play by Justin Coleman the fans here in Norman thought that he got there a little bit prematurely and half interfered with the receiver Oklahoma taken one more shot to try to get a little bit deeper it pretty close I mean I think the timing was pretty well and how about they awareness to come up with this turnover for Tennessee great coverage by Coleman great reaction by he'll then came at him in a hurry so Oklahoma's 9 the long field goal attempt Tennessee's defense comes up with its first takeaway of the half Oklahoma stretches the lead back out to 13 with a late touchdown run from Keith Ford after that time defer show non fumble pretend to see hanging around this young volunteer team on the road hostile environment we have to get the Sooners off the field to begin the third quarter Butch Jones always talks about brick by brick it's a process to build this program back up and that was a first half you know they're down 13 but could have been a lot worse they should be happy with where they are and we'll see what happens in this second half oops offense come up with almost 300 yards and 4 sacks Heather's got Butch Jones Chris thanks so much coach obviously very frustrated with the officiating staff what is your frustration well not really frustrated our kids are just playing exceptionally hard and you know we kind of raid with a flip field position we're behind field position all the first half made a play we just need to keep hanging around versus a challenging football team and what were you just asking them about what explanation did you get oh that's between us coach thank you okay all right butch looking yes with a smile Butch Jones keeping secrets you seemed down 13 into the first half stay tuned after these messages for the halftime report coming up welcome back to the dunk pepper championship Drive game of the week welcome back ESPN Saturn and Football on ABC presented by Wells Fargo so the lead is 13 for Oklahoma third quarter coming up Sooners of averaged 7 and a half yards per play they have a yardage edge over Tennessee of 160 yards they've been in Worley space all night Kirk the longest volunteer running play is four yards yet Tennessee has been able to do what they hope to do hang close and that's what they talked about kind of being on the ropes their defense has done that in his first half to at least keep them in the ball game things got away from there towards the end of the first half where home was able to put another touchdown on the board but I think the story now in the second half is really good it's ease on the road with all this youth how do they hold up with their offensive line in the trenches an area that's been a challenge for them to match up with thee with the scheme and also the athletic ability of this OSU deep end bullet Ron's the pick to to go on and here is Alex Ross and running back hammered down at the 25 yard line our Pacific Life game summary looks at the quarterback comparison here you have to give credit to early despite the pressure he had the sack and the fumble 12 of 19 yeah nice to pick at the end of a half yeah great a great half for Trevor Knight 14 to 21 but but I think the story that you can't really tell by just looking at the numbers is just Worley almost every single time he's dropping back to throw he's getting hit and he's happened to step away from pressure big story Kirk I think is the neck beard is trending quarter busted Andrew Luck star Kennedy every month water back in college it rocks the neck beard some pull it up better than I yeah yeah thanks aw Hogan last week for said it is a new trend it's Andrew Luck's fall the paneer set is Sheppard looking for box and gets a couple out across the 35 yard line near the marker Heather I do not have an extra report for you what I can tell you it's about Bob Stoops the emphasis in the locker room was on offense specifically on running the ball 64 rushing yards not enough according to Bob Stoops they also want to use that tempo disrupt a little bit and get going without the defense being set there's a quick throw another first down at the 45 yard line Ford had 45 yards rushing nobody else has done much what Bob Stoops says to Heather I think has a lot of a lot to do with who they pride themselves on being not just tonight but just as an offense they can throw it or they can run it depending on how you want to defend them but they've been facing a lot of eight men in the box and it's kind of forced their hand to have to throw the ball a little bit more than maybe they wanted to so a couple quick first downs and at the four picks his way for a short game you saw the graphic 44 straight times and OU's had the lead at halftime they've won because only back to the 2009 Red River Rivalry this tempo is is very very challenging not just to defend but when it comes to the fatigue factor there on there right now on pace to have over 80 snaps potentially in his football game and again without a whole lot of depth on the defensive line we're going to keep a close eye on on the balls front with those linebackers included night looks near side flips underneath Anil and Doron Neal knifes of the secondary down to the ten yard line before Cameron Sutton to corral them in Oklahoma threatening again for angle by Allah Daryl MacNeil coming up to make a play minute that's another blown coverage by Tennessee when they've given up some big plays it's been because there's been some confusion and that time there was confusion without a doubt this chains with cam Sutton and the safety coming over to help him to the to receiver side he's 43 more yards yards after the catch tonight the Oklahoma receivers took 173 a lot of those catches have been in space as you said because of coverage busts first and goal at the nine this is Ford lowers the head gets about three stays alive down to the five yard line now and that was such an emphasis this week for the Tennessee defense was yards after the catch and they just had to do a better job of not giving up plays explosive plays if they wanted to come in here listen this was not a game this hit as he looked at and said aw shucks let's go in there and be competitive and get out of here with a moral victory they thought about let's go in here and win this game and so they still feel that way but they've got to definitely do the little things and they can't give up these busted plays one second ago Knight keeps it it's the quarter and dives for the end zone an Oklahoma correct is the lead the zone read and not just effective for keep for who scored on a touchdown he other in the other end zone before the half was up but you can see Trevor Knight what he can do with the football when he keeps it and a great block like Blake Bell the former quarterback standing his block and allowing allowing Knight to have room to get into the end zone so a touchdown Drive late in the first half and quickly in the second and suddenly at the 20 point game they've been giving the ball quite a bit to the backs and he's outside linebacker defensive ends are collapsing down everybody comes down on board look at the block at the top by Blake Bell that's the former quarterback doing a good job but I'll say a Trevor Knight he can hurt you throwing a football but also with the quickness and acceleration when he had the ball in his hands ESPN is your home of the new college football playoff the brandnew national championship trophy presented by dr. pepper awarded January 12th and Arlington Sunter fans certainly hoping their team to be in contention trying to make a strong statement in their final nonconference game time before they begin that nine game big 12 schedule every myung is going to bring it out it's a couple blocks taxes across the 25 and then slammed it down hard right there four different guys have had sex for Oklahoma tonight well we focused a lot on Eric Stryker in the first half and he was effective getting around the true freshmen Coleman Thomas leading that inside it's terior push to be able to come up with plays well then they move to back to try to help out Marlin Lane what happens when you google Marlin Lane out there is the big fellas make plays as well getting a push to the middle so this offensive line we knew coming in they'd be challenged they sure have and I expect Mike Stoops to continue to turn up the pressure here to start the second half volunteers were once within six the Oklahoma touchdown sandwich around halftime put them in a hole here first down throw to the 20 it's caught and now they're going to reel incomplete Hurd was trying to come up with it Paul is thrown in front of her was a forward pass in the freshmen student quit the handle boys sucked it that's almost like a running play but when your longest running in it just for yards very tough on a young offensive line the quarterback makes you so predictable as an offense I think they've done a pretty good job of still mixing things up all things config under one yard for first half played on average once again there was pressure off the edge it was striker again right in the face of Worley yeah faint bliss Fame blitz this time coming from the field to the left of the quarterback again he delays delays and then as the ball is snapped there's no way the tide in can come over there and pick up that bliss the truth another true freshman Daniel helm happened to be coming over but a time he got over there 19 strikers already by him and it's a quarterback face AJ McCarron is watching home her lengthy brief interval no any ten on third down that is mics just dialed up now they drop off just rush for and there's a completion nice catch across the middle by Alton pig Howard and they move the chains not only a nice catch but after all the pressure he's been under a good job of sitting in that pocket and putting the ball right on the money to Howard he found some space they didn't bring pressure they brought four played zone Howard sits in that soft spot of the zone and Justin Worley boy he is growing up and if there's any question who the leader this offense is it's over 14 it's 16 a third one third catch for Howard this is heard big Howard is a guy that was at Wildcat quarterback a jet sweep front of a year ago it was suspended for the spring and summer they wanted him to rededicate himself if Jones almost says this is a lifestyle they just be a parttime player right right I think he's made that commitment I think we've seen the difference in him this year in the first three games Hurd is battling for a short hard game just not much room up in this center of it Oklahoma defense Jordan Evans got them there's just nothing in the interior you're not going to be able to get a push and it's nothing against this young line it's going to be hard for any offensive line this year against the 34 scheme Jordan Phillips Charles papper and do lay in the middle and then the force off the edge where instument striker just setting the ad well in his defense over fur family need five they move the pocket whirly hatch sometime initially and then just threw it into the front row when you roll out like this and you move that launch point your options are limited watch it he's going to look back to the inside look at the coverage right there they take it away so when you roll to your left you've got two options there's nobody there because of the coverage there's nowhere for him to throw the football so you've got to throw it away you Romar the big 287 pounder got murli's face late Tennessee's got to give the ball back to this Oklahoma offense now down 20 that dark and Shepherd on the sideline he makes a fair catch there at the 16 Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo on your phone online on the go Wells Fargo makes it easy to get banking done the new dollar cravings menu at Taco Bell live mas and Buick live expectation shattering models another reason to experience the new Buick rare visit from the sec the norman bob suits in his career for and for against SEC teams that's not Canada games against an M in Missouri when they are back in the big 12 63 and oh it gets Alabama and one in four install the others including of course two losses in the BCS Championship Game Sooners up 20 get the ball back at their 16 get read it slow down a bit Kirk Ryan some o'clock or is it too early for that in the third quarter gets too early and they put the fort out of the backfield and once again the young back used as a receiver reevesmaybin stopped them but after a gain of 11 yeah I think you'll see this often continue to put their foot on the accelerator nice job here I love that first and 10 call versatility of this quarterback you can do so many different things again multiple formations you can't sub on defense if the Sooners aren't changing offensive personnel but Lee has they have versatile guys they can continue to do this for a long drive playaction they take a shot downfield over the head of Shepard who was well covered there he's got too well covered by Coleman you bring up a good point about this offense and how versatile it is because it's not just tempo but they have hybrid players that could play multiple positions so not just dealing with that personnel grouping that happens to be in but they can do so many different things sterling Shepard where's number three like his father Derek did it was a great player here in the late 80s part of the 85 national championship team and then Derek was hired as a graduate assistant coach by Bob Stoops he left to go to Wyoming to be an assistant and Derek Shepherd passed away died of a heart attack when he was just 35 years old now Bob Stoops always had a feeling for Derek he spoke at his funeral he kept the remarks of the eulogy on a piece of paper in his desk for many years and after sterling signed with Oklahoma Bob presented him with that piece of paper but sterling Shepherd had always grown up around the program it's been a part of the locker room with his dad and next he kept Bob waiting 24 hours after the offer was made for a scholarship he he finally said yes and he was never going to go anywhere else I thought it's pretty touching to hear Bob tell us a story about when Derek passed away that sterling was very young and he embraced him he brought in and he wanted him in the locker room he wanted to come around the team and had no idea one day that this young sterling would end up being a football player that he would end up recruiting second down my hand at the Ford hit hard now Stoops wanted to make sure the his assistance also saw what he saw and he wasn't favoring sterling Shepherd in the recruiting process because he felt so much for his dad they also dunno Koshi this guy kept one yeah light of what once he became a sophomore in high school and they brought him in for the camp and everybody looked at it and he said what do you guys think of young sterling who they've been seeing around the football considers in the games all these years they said I'll take him on my side of the ball and the receiver coach would say no no I'll take him over here then Bob knew that he had a great player third and eight volunteers desperately in need of his top here Lake Park down at four it has time to get it off and they call timeout night a little hot but they were kind of make a late change to the call better to spend one on third and eight Oklahoma up 20 Bob suit certainly never thought he'd be a lifer and retired in December of 1998 was won a national championship in 2008 big 12 title that's five more than any other program in that span losted weather championship games besides winning the one in 2000 they've been some of the overtures Kirk over the years in Florida where he was a defensive coordinator Notre Dame drastic Cleveland Browns but he's he stuck around can't believe it's been 16 years in a head coach here he's moved he's in his third house here in Norman but he stayed in the job on third down night and wellprotected livers over the middle but he overthrew Shepherd the rare times tonight when number three has been targeted and hasn't caught it boy he had all kinds of time back there and this is this is a part of his game this is only going to improve he starts to his left he comes back because of the time that he has and Shepherds coming right through the middle there and that's a combo to be a tough catch because the middle linebacker AJ Johnson they're 20 curacy the consistent people of an accuracy standpoint is the area where again Trevor Knight making his eighth career start tonight he's going to get better and better more consistent in that area crusher Barnett gets it away it's a short kick bounces left alone by Sutton Tennessee will take over at 33 talked about hot soups against the SEC because it's been such a big storyline of a game of the ball loss to Ole Miss and 99 Arkansas who was able to get them notice three wins against Alabama during the regular season to push the Sugar Bowl Florida and LSU beating for VCF I think he and his program really needed that win not just because it was Alabama they needed a signature win in a big win for Bob and for this program because springboard them into this year with 71 underdog in New Orleans playaction fake Worley now pictures along the sidelines incomplete trying to fight back for the under thrown ball was Josh Smith but again it's trying to find a matchup that he likes Worley trying to find Josh Smith against the safety and that's the matchup you want to try to find it's not just trying to get the ball out to the receivers against the corners where that's a pretty even matchup but if you get Josh Smith or another inside slot receiver matched up mantoman against Hays or Thomas they've got to try to take humph a brush her again Worley trying to stay alive but he can't get away Stryker and Quentin Hayes were their safety and the outside linebacker combining it's the same blitz that we've seen not just for striker coming but also you're seeing Hayes coming off the edge and again you're dealing with a couple true freshman on the right side of the offensive line but tight in who's a true freshman there are three true freshmen on that play on the right side of the offensive line trying to deal with the complexity of this Oklahoma defense to the pressure that they're shown the fifth back to second for Hayes you earlier forced the fumble on third to half pressure again striker one more time hitting the quarterback after the incompletion knew Riker is a great name for a guy who loves to come off the hit and hit some but no doubt and here he is coming off the edge again Coleman Thomas that right tackle he's saying guys they didn't move this fast last year on the high school field watch how quick he get by frankeour is one of our versatile players in the country when you watch him you look at him you think he's undersized he is he's 220 pounds he drops out in the flat he blitzes offensive lineman cannot deal with his suddenness when he blitz is off to the edge the effort the energy is called the heartbeat of this defense if you say Creek much more than a pass retro though he does that very well very well here's the hype on station I Shepard a fair catch up near midfield in midway in the third quarter Sooners back to work celebrating his 10th year sponsoring the good hands field goal and that's all state makes contributions to the participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kicks since oh five all states contributed more than 3.4 million dollars in scholarship funds lonely Tennessee fan middle of all that crimson there is a Tennessee section here investor that's not it he must have missed out on that ticket you have in the end zone they don't get many visitors seats here Norman that's for sure semaj appear on the talented physical true freshman tailback is behind night you give it to him tell he is a load into Gavit has involved that controversial non fumble which the replay officials looked at ended up resulting in the touchdown for Oklahoma subsequently his first carry since that play again just continuing to rotate he's back then you wonder later in the year somebody will merge is kind of the goto guys but here early in the year all three getting equal opportunity to get their hands on the football you ran again a physical guy Velen reevesmaybin an excellent linebacker barnett together they're able to just get a hold of but if the first down you and this offensive line is a veteran group doing a great job of when they run the football and not only being able to hold their blocks at the point of attack on the defensive line but they're also getting up to those linebackers now trying to wear them down Stoops told everyone more running the second act we're getting that is this serious test this possession for the Tennessee defense down 20 tonight checks to a throw delivers over the middle plate Bell couldn't get his hand on it Cameron Sutton was coming at him quickly that one he came off a little bit too quickly to his right out to the field he had three receivers and they're on Neal cleared and he was all alone underneath the Tennessee coverage would have easily picked up a first down he actually was looking that way and just came off of it decided on Rafi predetermined he wanted to throw that football or not through into tight coverage when he had a wide open receiver Ross in motion the quarterback kicks didn't slide down short of a first down before you see the quickness very quick first couple steps 490 thought on the touchdown run extra dimension of this offense such live legs Chris when they motion to back out of the backfield and go empty like so many of these offenses from today you're going to see a quarterback who has quickness usually run the football and that time he did late Bella Force had power as a runner last year but the quickness combined with the accuracy throwing Sooners haven't had that in a while this is Ross trying to get the corner you see the speed he's able to make a game out of what look was it was going to be a loss but it's going to be fourth pound it two defenders trying to chase him down to two outside linebacker defensive inside type of players excusa Corey Vereen we've got the quickly to the defensive lineman but not quick enough to be able to chase down Alex Ross Stoops thought about it for a second they need two yards in this or down instead they're going to send that the reliable Michael Honeycutt career long is 115 Jenner this is right at 53 the Oklahoma was going to spend its second timeout of the half so see if Honeycutt could add to the lead see if Bob Stoops changes his mind yeah here comes the offense back out here on 4th and 2 so no field goal attempts would have been right at honey cuts career long agrees at his back but Supes will trust the offense here to be very deflating the suitors can move the six keep this Tennessee defense on the field they have to be beginning to wear down now Tennessee calling a timeout expecting the field goal team to come out their suits brought the offense back in Butch Jones spends the first of his timeouts of a half Heather well guys Justin Worley last play on offense was a rough one he went down hard and Butch Jones actually just came over to check on his quarterback who told him my head steps back but I'm okay teammates checked in with him but Justin didn't receive any medical attention and he is good to go on the next offensive series thank you there's a hip high striker the head hit off field whiplash a lot of times you know in this pair of concussions and the awareness of concussion a lot of times when a quarterback gets sacked it's not today hit but it's that momentum of your head coming back and hitting the surface designs there occur that I mean he knew what he was getting into tonight with that line every Tennessee knew he's going to be a challenging game for them offensively because of still trying to get some experience upfront when I said previous plated three true freshmen if you included his height in on the right side of the offensive line he got Eric striker blitzing you you know it's to be a long night on fourth down he poured the last of night and now number comes emotion what eventually we're going to run this fourth down play but this is the third time out of the sequence now no suspense is building is their last time being a thirtysecond he doesn't figure maybe to need them at this point at least by he's motivated he's frustrated with the community communication from the sidelines or whatever it might be I think what's going to happen important to the build up here I don't know they didn't get the right play or the right formation for if Tennessee is going to raise them another time out why not make it four in a row a little smile for him that's a huge smile during a game all right those would have you hooked up different looking down to the formation after the timeout Dmitri flowers the big 244 pounds pressure to the right amount now they motioned for and it's a shovel pass into traffic it's incomplete incomplete what they do run it got there Chris when Dmitri flowers comes into the game because he is such a good athlete as a fullback and he has such good hands they motioned for doubt just to try to use as a decoy once he clears out now you just got to lock in you got to you know you have a quarterback trying to stretch you horizontally he's running just with the line of scrimmage trying to bait you almost before he ditches it underneath to his fullback but Tennessee's defense saw that coming the whole time with flowers checked into the game and that play really didn't have much of a chance after all that at the timeout after all that well hits the ball Bank kinda cut into the lead here I 14:6 in the third quarter you see Defence's makes and mental mistakes he talked about the coverage bus occasionally but all in all really given a full regard to Hill who they've done a decent job we sure had to be a lot worse throw it far side it's a low throw and Heather's report they're about whirley's had hit in the ground and that just the way his eyes looked it to for his last 10 men Christmas it's not just that one hit that was that the the hit was big it's the culmination of just the entire game two and a half quarters out of getting pressured and getting hit on quite a few plays but he's good and showing a lot of toughness to know and second down pressured again backpedaling and just throws it away in dual away and mr. structor one more time in the air well striker this time is picked up because Marlin Lane comes out to help out to the right oh I'm sorry Jalen Hurd's going to come out to help out with the blip problem is you're going to leave another true freshman isolated while one now so the oneonone matchups these are going to be outside with striker or in this case sitting inside with Robertson a true freshman trying to pick up that block it's you're either going to lose to the outside you're going to lose to the inside of these 101 matchups true freshmen versus senior defensive tackle you didn't work out too well young guy third and 10 and Tennessee will spend another timeout as Oklahoma was showing more pressure in the crowd was getting all revved up right now he's talking about the play clock in it they didn't get that time as there's going to be a delay of game we don't question for Lee's toughness at all he's proven that but you wonder Kirk if the wear and tear are beginning to pile up the mental mistake there absolutely and this is a great look again at this freshman the true freshman right tackle Coleman Thomas bouncing to the outside to help with striker poorly getting hit again and a forearm up to the face the bed son if you watch Oklahoma's defense this year you're going to see them do this to a lot of quarterbacks Chris brought it up earlier we both did about Alabama and AJ McCarron AJ McCarron got hit a lot when he played this defense in the Sugar Bowl so it's not just that Wow they've got a lot of true freshmen that obviously adds to it but wait till the Sooners play the entire 2014 season jiguro tune in and watch them play you're going to see them do this to a lot of offenses they're strong in the interior with Phillips and Tapan and delay and they've got such quickness with drift on the striker on the outside and then they're creative with how they want to come after you it's just a lethal comedy wave with her arms as the Kimura crowd noise on 3rd and 10 were leased and delivers incomplete at catchable ball across midfield the pig Howard couldn't come up with it fourth down after all this kids been through he knows what's coming it's third and long are you kidding me he knows he's going to get pressure it's a son up front they're coming right closing in on it and he puts that ball right on the money right on the money good coverage by Julian Wilson gets in there with that right hand and knocked the ball loose there's a heck of a throw by Justin Worley considering everything he's been through eight punt for Matt dar too low kick bounces around dangerously near an Oklahoma flare the volunteers hoping it touched the man no signal yet at the 30yard line nowadays signal Tennessee ball dad Chris it looked like that hit an Oklahoma favorite Parker was down there yeah he did not have his eyes on the ball he was trying to block a man his shoulder it was a low kick or so the opportunity to review this but the recovery made by reevesmaybin the starting outside linebacker down there covering the fun another look watch his right shoulder looks like it hits him right on the arm right there yep balls up in the air now at the free ball at this point so after the bounce it came up off the shoulder the mental mistake Shepherds yelling Peter Peter Peter meaning get out get out of the way get out of the way marker doesn't get out and then the awareness by the Tennessee cover unit to be able to come up with a football and give early in the vols offense the pretty good field position second turnover by Oklahoma they will review it to see if there was should be pretty tough will return it but I think it did after it hit the turf come up and hit Parker on the right shoulder right there you can see the ball change direction low down no doubt about it there's a low punt those are always tricky bouncing around the guy's trying to make the blocks not aware of it returned Mensch mu C's arms not only ters arms moving he's yelling Peter Peter Peter Peter Peter meeting clear out clear out clear out names may be blended right there shoving on him very alert play by the time Parker probably heard Shepard yelling it was already too late he's engaged there now he's hearing it now he starts to try to get out of the way and it already hit it and Shepard knew it you could see him begin to move forward and try to recover it yeah definitely hits it right there so Tennessee after further review the ruling on the first down Tennessee is going to have the ball here at the 30yard line of Oklahoma 524 in the quarter down 20 desperately in need of 7 here I think you got to look to those matchups with pick Howard and marques Norris number 8 with his size at 6 4 in this area ball up in the air he is very very dangerous to try to match up with oneonone the whirly in the passing and have not been clicking in the third quarter at all pressured again dumps it off short Byrd is going to be Corral for a big loss Oklahoma felt this coming the whole way they brought of pressure with Hays strikers out there you know I think that's one of those cases there's the versatility her striker you think he's just going to brush the quarterback he shows like he's going to blitz he starts to feel that they're setting up the screen has great instinct by striker that time out of the space out of space make it a play seven yard loss on first down early pressure ball comes out he jumps in on the 40 striker is just a nightmare in there again and tapper was there as well has he ever been it every wellprotected mishap has there been pressure every single facet I think strikers trying to strike a pose here tonight I mean this guy has been all over the field and Worley has been under pressure from a back leg here if he does it Christon if he doesn't get the ball out of his hands and within two and a half seconds number 19 is going to be in the backfield a rule of his arm was coming forward incomplete pass he always walked out over Josh Smith now he's going to show now he's up to the line of scrimmage here he come come after him again it's another sex Drakkar may have gotten a facemask that time he came looping around tapper was there again maybe the penalties on the defensive end to wipe out that's a it was on tapper personal foul sipping your automatic berth down penalty's have wiped out two sexes of the total of be even higher tonight and I think with tapper who's a guide has played a lot of football I think part of that was whirling actually trying to avoid contact lowered his helmet and when he did that pampers hand was already getting ready to engage and what he thought was the midsection of Worley they ended up grabbing a facemask instead and the balls catch a break and get the first down at the 21 we get to that quick left side s made your fight inside the 10yard line so it's first and goal see what happens when they don't pressure soft coverage Worley is able to throw receiver gets a free release off the line of scrimmage that's not the mo of Oklahoma Oklahoma they walk up tight on these wide receivers and they bring pressure with Quintin Hayes the safety and Eric striker that's where they've been able to disrupt the timing in the rhythm of Justin Worley the third pitch for North is put out why now he's a very tough red zone matchup problem sits the four bottom of the string sooner show pressure up the middle bird moves forward for three and two the tempo and the pace of this game for Butch Jones his true freshman the offensive lineman that are out there we have to tied in who our true freshman the running back you just saw run the football Jalen Hurd highly touted fivestar recruits Butch Jones was able to lure into Knoxville and imagine how fast this game is moving and how much they're growing up tonight before they get ready for SEC play second ago north emotion takes it but pursued and dropped for a loss I understand what they're trying to do here with with big Howard it's just too fast the defense it's the plates of so long to develop once you see big Howard's coming in motion look how quick striker first gets his hands on it what days is there there's four other jerseys there for the Oklahoma defense they saw that before the play even started where the football is goes going on take money yeah play the boss here so it's third and goal on the back at the 13 whirling rolls out he posts the line of scrimmage throws it out of the end zone and very close to crossing the line try to get it to North in the back so forth and go trying to buy as much time as he could there Chris at that time again they the amount of time that he had you'd think that somebody would be able to break open but Mike Stoops who's been pressuring all night this time keeps his secondary and he had six defensive backs on the field they all sat back in coverage and orally eventually tried to squeeze one in but north of course didn't have any room to make the catch with the true freshman Aaron medley from 31 yards but a shot another freshman dish all over the place not what Tennessee wanted up for the turnover on the punt 17 point deficit this has been a courageous display from Whirley give a good first half of the pressure again and again and again hitting him time after done and it takes a toll on a quarterback not just physically but I think emotionally the confidence that you want to have that it Justin Worley knew the entire week what he was going to face tonight and now he's living it and I'll tell you if you're a Tennessee fan and you're watching this game you got to be incredibly proud of what you've seen from your quarterback and a guy that's still trying to establish himself as the guy I think he's taking some huge steps tonight as the leader of this office one thing that has an outfit volunteers have been able to run the ball at all obviously even you got all the speed on the edge what teams try to do in this conference against Ryker is run right at a guy like that what have you seen overall from OU's defense looking forward speed deception power versatility this is I think one of the best defenses in college football I really do I think Mike Stoops has a defense that he changed the scheme last year they're in their second year now running I think they understand it better I think they're attacking there they're very sound even though they're aggressive so there's a lot to like about this defense but they move forward get ready for big 12th left he's a short kickoff coming up the field that is Alex Ross it's his way still alive trying to fight forward wrestled out finally about this 28 yard line major league baseball coming it down to the wire joint ESPN tomorrow night the Orioles on Derek Jeter and the Yankees the catheter his final season by Taco Bell 8 o'clock Eastern also on the watch ESPN app so certainly for Tennessee three points not what they needed cut into the lead now 17 points is Oklahoma goes back office 300yard night for Trevor night beam of 29304 the one touchdown and the interception the handoff inside Ford for a short game that stone read again you know it's option football when you defend that which means discipline assignment football it's so easy to kind of start to cheat down on keep forward because he's starting to pick up some big yards and when you do just when you start to cheat too much Trevor Knight's going to pull it and pull it around the corner whores got it again and Ballou detangler in the back feelings prince to the sideline Daniel Bryan who is happening edge there boy yeah pretty good effort there by Daniel Bryan these guys are holding up their against this tempo offense and because they they're slamming so much occasionally they're slipping by hitting a creeks within that offensive line can shoot the gap on third down the Sooners just three of nine it's an incompletion over the head of Duran Neal that's one thing that soups in the offensive staff won't love about tonight's game they haven't been very efficient on third down at all 30% that's not good at all and that's something to Tennessee they talked because they have to have an ability to get Oklahoma off the field if you take away the miscues to kind of blown assignments for this defense where they've given up some big plays and touchdowns we've said it all night long you've got to give Tennessee a lot of credit for the way their defense is hung in there and given themselves at least a chance to try to get back in the game get Barnett they come after it get it away and it's Cameron Sutton calling for a fair catch at the 32 yard line second one to row they almost got stay tuned after the game except on the west coast your late local news on most of these ABC stations over on ESPN SportsCenter on the highlights of the day in sports some surprises again in college football Boston College 13 on USC in Chestnut Hill the team we saw win at Stanford last week it's amazing we've seen some teams that have struggled with Prosperity Virginia Tech going back home after beating Ohio State losing to East Carolina now UFC they go up into top ten in this week's rankings and they're down big right now in Boston College and first sounding he lit up the herd and the freshman breaks into the secondary Jalen Hurd shows the speed next shoved out until he gets to the 25yard line and now Tennessee threatening again watch the true freshman that's my name Daniel helm leading the way picks up the block on Dominique Alexander and this is what Tennessee fans are so excited about heard a 63 227 pounds true freshman now he'll mote lineup down here is a SWAT at the bottom of the screen but this guy is the future of Tennessee's book football the offensive team we've got 43 yards haven't done anything running the ball all night trying to break free their striker again not just a pass rusher flying all over the field making another tackle by being able to run the football little bit I mean that's one play they've had but obviously it's closed down striker favor your tires number next he's going to go on I need the Energizer Bunny but they don't have to respect the running game until that play so it allows them to just pin their ears back and attack early in this offensive line it's a nice run by heard maybe kid slowdown Oklahoma's defensive it they rushed for he really does have time takes a shot to the end zone goes it ended good coverage a battle for the football and that Sanchez comes up with it he won the battle against Jason crude and this guy just has a knack for making plays a risky throw by Worley but this is a very very athletic interception well there's probably take another look at this look at the focus it's the playmaker the defense back Sanchez never gives up on the football gets his foot down completes the catch all the way through that is a heck of a play keep in mind the crew missed six five what you didn't see there maybe we'll take another look at it is the way Sanchez used his body to position himself to be able to make the play he didn't let croon get to it the replay we'll take another look watch how he pins the ball with that right arm against the shoulder pad then brings the hand out of a foot still in bounds Kirk if it stands his fifth pick in the last six games he's become the playmaker as I said Chris had another guy who had a great sugar bowl just a guy that has a knack for that ability to make big plays it will stand after reviewing so a huge takeaway for Oklahoma and credit guard this lead and they'll go back to work in the final seconds of the third quarter here a short game for Ford when I was impressed with was not just the way he pinned the ball against his shoulder pad but how he kept Croom away from the football that balls basically thrown up for Croom to have a chance to be able to make a play on it because of his size and I just love how Zack Sanchez the technique that he uses watch him watch him use his body feeling slowing through him down he's not letting croon get to the football and he slows him down to beat in position for the football to come up with by far one of the greatest interceptions we've seen this year in the early season start of the fourth quarter here in Norman Sooners dusting a 17point lead and get it in their own end second and nine Knight had missed in his last five passes but a completion here in the set up third down Oh rocky calmus Humber heaviness sooner Becker griffith nominee mr. Chasen down ball carriers now he comes out of the smoke here there are the fuck's up between the third and fourth Booker n to the third quarter he was fired up and he was ready to go it hits the shoulder pad part of that championship team that can shoot bad this will Defensive Player of the Year Sooners need seven and third down nine fires over the middle incomplete try to get Kane jaeyoung no flag Knight was hit by Owen Williams after the throw Jordan Williams has done a nice job in Owen Williams comes in more athletic when they get to third down now Oklahoma just 3 of 11 on third down so they're winning this game and control this ballgame but they're going to have a lot of work to be able to show these players about being able to execute and give themself a better chance of picking up first downs if you're going to run tempo you've got to be able to convert at a higher rate on third down it's the whole idea behind that it's keeping the defense on the field to wear them down Knight is missed on six of his last seven passes he's the fun fielded and the spin away is Sutton covered at the 38 to Chris Carter for an update all right Chris times the doctor separate conference update the pac12 favorite in trouble but fighting back Cody Kessler the easy pitching catch was Nelson a galore here Trojans down six but BC has possessions but four minutes left to go in this one Chris top ten Steve in trouble on the road keep an eye on that one thank you Chris see the impact that Oklahoma pressure tonight Streicher off to the right and it's a Marlin lay new dimes for to the 45yard line that's kind of tribe Mike Stoops crazy striker is a great player but the last couple series where we've seen Tennessee have just nowhere to go frustrated you think him down twenty seven to ten but they have been able to run much at all tonight in the last two series he backs have had a little bit more room will he pitches it and it's a screen and tackle made at the first down yarn marker again by striker you think strikers going to blitz right he's going to try to get in there and here he comes all the Sun he sees the quarterbacks going to get rid of the ball he's not going to give up on the play he's going to chase down the receiver ticket the first down yeah but I just think it's his attitude he really represents his Oklahoma defense with him relentless attitude whirly fires across catch made and sleeps short of the first end as Marquess North another look at how active striker has been tonight yeah he has I mean he's been the guy that Mike Stoops has decided to turn loose wood much like he does most of most games that they play undersized at about 220 pounds he's built like a safety and yet he does a great job of being able to get around these offensive tackles being so elusive and so quick early on first down runs out of time and goes it incomplete Josh Malone took the detour on this play I don't know he didn't expect to be in the in the route quarterback as he dropped back we're looking through the clay slide to the right and nothing was there as we turned back to try to get the ball thrown out before he's going to get sacked and Malone was just kind of running down the field again another true freshman for the Tennessee offense out of the field repentantly said true freshman a night for Tennessee 111 true freshman heard breaks into the secondary flashes the speed and hammers down inside the 15 I've been doing nothing all night with the running game heard is that a couple of good runs and left tackle this time really good job of picking up his block Kirby Center and also the tidying Daniel Helms sustaining nice doubleteam there jalen hurd giving us a preview of what's to come throughout the rest of this year in a very bright future for this Tennessee offense three big runs Kirk convert is within five yards of a hundred yard side averaging almost eight yards of carry bird and Marlin Lane in the game roads got it again this time it's a 1yard loss nowhere to run as Peterson set them down just just a threat of them being able to run the football can slow down the pass rush and the other thing in that time again you're still going up against those monsters in the middle there the fence alignment but gives the threat of that running game Chris and the tempo of the offense they can also wear down the Oklahoma defense wolf both ways Sooners are rotating Dean linemen in there though whirling this time they roll the pocket he has time he escapes Worley with a stiff arm brought down inside the 5 I ordinarily by Justin Worley can think about everything he's been through he rolls left there's nothing there instead of throwing it away he sees an opening there and almost is able to get away from Evan to get into the end zone but by deciding to keep the football now look at this third down as opposed to being third 10th amazed you know those two runs by her and cyfle though use a thrust third and two whurling fit to the cross limit and the traffic and it's intercepted by Julian Wilson Wilson with a convoy gets a block and takes it end to end a 100yard sprint for a pick six but Wilson makes the play but Jordan Evans caused it the middle linebacker right in the middle read the quarterback side great job recognizing the route get his right hand on the football and that's what's ended up into the air for Wilson's able to get the interception and give Tennessee a dagger this football game nice play by Wilson to Jordan Devin set that play off he prevented to touchdown to play before and then he comes up with a deflection to cause that ball to go up into the air is going to review this did Wilson cross the plane of the goal line before he dropped the ball we going to get up it almost a honey badger replay meant for LSU did he drop the ball across the plane I think he's from that angle I think he's across but I think it's a little bit close for Bob Stoops North is giving chase in his right on the plane if he did cross it pop angles so far nothing where you could overturn the call tell me you make a play you run a hundred yards can't hold it just a split second longer before you're in the end yeah he'll get it he'll get an earful in the film session I don't think I'd see I haven't seen anything yet it's going to make them turn this thing over now that look right down the goal line difficult to see he was very close and again this big 12 replay through has to have indisputable visual evidence to overturn the call on the field that's a tough call for officials who are sprinting down the field and seal they call alive here's the linebacker right in the middle here see see they want to see his eyes he's looking around he's read the quarterback he's looking around to the routes trying to feel where that ball might be going it was an empty backfield so it's either a quarterback draw or it's a quick throw it's one or the other quarterback didn't show he's not going he's not going to run the ball so right away he gets his hand in there knocks that ball through the ruling we were looking to see if the runner from the ball prior to crossing the goal line he did not so the pic stick stands for Julian Wilson earliest threw an interception to the endzone the last couple of possessions but that will be a teaching moment because they would like them to hold the ball a little bit longer to make it such a great play know that he'll get 20 from Mike and Bob Stoops when they review this game on the film the VAD and Oklahoma's defense comes up with a huge play Julian Wilson for one goal line to the other barely with the football and Oklahoma stretches it the 3410 keep forward the sophomore running back limping to the locker room the Julian Wilson with the second 100yard interception return Oklahoma history the Quebec to all knees Kirk in 1945 he's matched by Wilson just bounces to the end zone back to Chris Connor for an update Chris UCLA taxes in a close game in Arlington Tyrone swoops this second touchdown pass the night John Harris calls this one in from Brett Huntley Exodus gave an elbow injury in the first half worn by four late very very rough night for LA football his USC goes down to Boston College Brett Huntley hurt earlier in the Bruins up against it now trailing late that is two big losses or both teams in Southern California both thinking that they had a chance for still you know thinking about trying to get to a playoff struggling a nonconference play Jim Moore senior once said playoff suck it about playoff and Sun knew that the Bruins hadn't really responded very well to the hype he wanted to play as underdogs easier said than done but you see Li is that the system heroics there for the Bruins late now Anton looks like you saw stood there go put a fork in la yet tonight second and six before your king Murli chef Barse delivers complete breaking free is north across midfield that's a great throw execrate throw again by Justin Worley a little bit late throwing back you'd love to throw this towards the sideline and Sanchez if he's in better position can make a play on the ball but because the ball is thrown on time even though it's a little bit behind his receiver makes it tough for Sanchez to get there and said she has instead a plan of the receiver he plays the ball and that's what allowed North to make the play and still get upfield for more yards Sanchez de with an acrobatic interception in the end zone late in third quarters down on the field member he fought through a shoulder injury from last week to be ready to go this week seems to be okay all that worldly has been through Kirk all the times he's been hit and harassed and a couple interceptions in the end zone still up making throws like this yeah and again what concentration by North to be able to make that catch Sanchez or what he may have hurt but he got a pretty quick and he'll be back hit puncture right back out of the field balls in sooner territory ended up inside miss shaking the tackle was Marlin Lane while running game did absolutely nothing in the first half much more effective after half done really the last last couple series they've been able to get both Jalen Hurd and Marlin Lane a little bit more room and that would be great to see for Tennessee if they did that the first half to slow down strike for this pass rush that lolis had to deal with this is her cutting it back you get a first down about the 38 yard line striker tackle him again yeah they had roomed the run into the middle but look to the outside strikers a guy to chases the play down from behind otherwise Jalen Hurd's able to get another maybe five or ten yards guys all over the peel 200 I keep saying at 220 pounds or in Lent less where with tremendous instincts with Sam felt morally fires far side north for cannot defended them but Jordan Thomas freshman for Oklahoma that time out there been seeing back pancetta out on the field he'll now check back into the game but the freshman Thomas was out there by himself against Jay sink room and held his own on an island really on second and now fires far side again into traffic looking for North it'll be third and 10 volunteers just 5 of 15 run third down tonight might suit spring pressure this time yep you know West five really get to die quickly far side but working it away very sure tackle by Sanchez his slow to get up you wonder if he is aggravated and shoulder problem II held on to the physical receiver well that time he's fighting through some pain there to be able to stay out there River North with his size is taught to bring down sixfour 225pound receiver go forth non force and thought has to see favoring that right arm will it looks left immediately fired that direction almost intercepted again and Quentin Hayes was thinking about a pick six of his own but what Oklahoma is doing a good job of is the awareness of the down and distance to where the first down marker is there breaking on the football and they understand the Tennessee they need to get three or four yards their coverages and right at three or four yards you can see both strikers out there went and Hayes is out there everybody's staying right there it's fairly really tough for Justin Worley to try to give one into that coverage Saturday Night Football presented by Wells Fargo brought to you by Pacific Life for insurance annuities and investments choose specific life the power to help you succeed for beautiful things happen when you go further and Gatorade Gatorade knows it all begins within win from within crystal ball from the 2000 VCS championship team mom Stoops very intense he tries to get there eighty nine and five at home your to want that championship this is Pierre on the physical freshman and I ripped up all out as they do earlier rain barely held on a possession but with portnow out of the game he went into the locker room now obviously Ross and Pierre on will have to carry the load the rest of the way Ross is more of a slender more explosive back number 28 and P Ryan who's in is more physical true freshman who can pound it between the tackles you use the play clock here you're on again fixes way and he could see the power of the young guy first down across the 44 Daryl McNeil met him close to the line of scrimmage he felt the brunt of it is 245 pounds lowering his shoulder he is pure muscle Neal came in there to fill and he got what's 33 fill in right here boom that snapped back they also myarray is held on there is his vision is cutting ability besides the power get good speed for a back down to size as well well they Oklahoma always seems to have backs you know he'll they've always got two or three really good backs these guys are willing to share the load you don't come to Oklahoma if you want to carry it 30 times a game maybe Adrian Peterson did but typically they like to spread it around and flag it down I mean suck the best oh you teams and Bob Stoops is 16 years and I wagering Peterson was unique but most cases it's where they've had two or three guys back there rotated first down Yonsei savage that's the first holding column as soon as tonight I think for Oklahoma to be able to have a magical season the big issue to me is can they stay healthy on the offensive line I mean they've got skill they've got a quarterback now that's making good decisions they've been depleted over the last few years upfront by the end of the year they've got to stay healthy up front here and again makes the cut lowers the boom says tacklers still running deep into Tennessee territory and you can see the reason for all the height member last time 33 McNeal had a chance to make attack when he felt it how about this time he's going to come up here he is he's not even thinking of wrapping up he just got it through his right shoulder and lowered his head and hoped I mean you've got to wrap up here well the remember the last play came up but he got buckle this time he comes up he tries to go low and instead of wrapping up he just lowered his shoulder just kind of took a knee hoping he'd go down 31 more yards we're seeing an excellent duel of hyped true freshmen tailbacks Jalen here for Tennessee and now here on imposing himself here in the fourth quarter for Oklahoma we'll wrap up coming up next an eventful night as UCLA Kirk did come back late to beat Texas in Arlington Jerry Neuheisel Rick's son with Hundley out injured engineering a gamewinning drive the braces arts yeah that's amazing Rick's got to be fired up for that not only is alma mater gets a win his son gets a chance December meeting with him a high school kid hanging out with Rick yes before he shows us college his Alex Ross the speedy young sophomore bang taking his turn inside the 30 that's a different feel when Ross gets the football he's he is a guy that could take it to the house in a hurry he's not going to necessarily run over you but he'll run around you and buy you another one of those third downs though Kirk Oklahoma we'll take a look at what they did not do well on third down tonight and study the tape of this one just three for 11 this is nice rolling out a completion made but a hammered short of the first down cam Sutton came up and lowered the boom on Neal was fourth and three seeing a lot of hit and lot of big hits here in the second half at play again it took a while it was a played it was designed right in front of Sutton he was just almost sitting there waiting for that ball to be thrown and quarterbacks have to see a flat defender out there waiting you don't want to throw it and leave your receiver out to dry and that's what that time Trevor and I did so Honeycutt he's 2 for 2 tonight both of them inside 30 yards rise from 45 and it's blocked rarely does he miss the field goal Tennessee makes the block and Oakland will just don't run down there and touch it so it can't be returned so puts John special teams come up with a play the lead is still 24 4 minutes to play let's take a look at our Pacific Life game summary and Oklahoma's defense has really done a good job of getting after Justin Worley in so many different ways with the pressure but you know not only the pressure they've also created some turnovers they've created three turnovers gotten the ball back to Trevor Knight Trevor Knights taking advantage of some misuse and mental errors from Tennessee's defense and they've come up with some big plays tonight throwing the ball now for over 300 yards but at the same time keep Tennessee credit for both 34 to 10 their defense has stepped up made plays as well Oklahoma's had the two interceptions in this half but not an overwhelming offensive display for the Sooners after halftime sure came by Marlin Lane Wyles we'll have a bye week and then a very important SEC East game against Georgia now with an extra urgency with the dogs coming off the loss in Columbia today we will be between the hedges purify week next week second down me up inside again in short game for Lane this isn't just about this game tonight or both of these teams it's about what you can do tonight to compete and in Oklahoma space you win you try to learn from it and you try to get better obviously there's plenty of room for Bob Stoops is bunts to improve especially in the offensive side of the ball and if you're Butch Jones you're looking at this again they didn't come in trying to have a when they walked away saying hey guys good try moral victory they wanted to come in and win this game so they're disappointed but at the same time I think they learned a lot about themselves and where they can continue to grow with this young football team one of the youngest you'll see in the SEC is another theory from Lane and third down he's near the marker the 38th Oklahoma meanwhile doesn't play another home game until midoctober when he and the state comes in they go to West Virginia to TCU and then had the Red River game in Dallas on the 11th so long drought between home games and they'll dive into that nine game conference schedule and it seems short of a first and the Pawnee team is out there with his good is their defense is that they're going to be really really tough to beat this year it is a reconsider Busch had the team out there now Worley and the offense are back out there in a difficult at first densities they change the call and the offense stays out there just inhouse the pay up very late yeah the 49 of the mark coming forcing the final two minutes just feeding Lane here late in the ballgame I was going to say I just take Oklahoma this team we've watched these guys pretty closely for the last 15 they're 16 years they've got a different feel about it and I think the Sugar Bowl win was really key and creating confidence but I just I just think they've done a great for recruiting guys the kind of Oklahoma type of guys pretty tough guys strikers a great example that Gruesomes a great example of that these guys are playing as a team this defense because of how consistent with lent 'less they are be fun to see how far they can take it this year well coach have Leduc and a bunch of guys in the defense and have a play making nap we've seen Sanchez and Wilson make huge interceptions in the second half here laying again tries to break for another first down up near midfield and the clock ticking down minute tend to go and on the other side I mean I Butch Jones in it last year he fined 32 recruits national letter of intent he's hard I think he has room for three or four more he's out on the trails doing very very well already with all the verbals are going to sign 25 or 26 again next year so the future is bright it's just trying to take baby steps with a young team like this when you go into this kind of environment or when they go into the SEC in tough environments and trying to continue to grow to try to Quinn this year not wait for the future now they desperately want to make a bowl game after a succession of three straight five and seven seasons they've figures to be tough in Georgia I mean who knows that if they're two and two they'll have their chances in Oklahoma meanwhile Kirk winning by 20 Florida to make a a strongenough State for the distance truly and should be considered a playoff contender yeah absolutely as long as you play defense Toyama plays defense your legitimate team I just think they get to continue to be dominant on the other side of the ball to become a complete team so fire sacks three takeaways and student defense huge tonight kappa fraud in the field yeah sure is for any and extract your stuff it reading is excitable an exciting period let's get into Heather with Coach Seuss Chris thanks so much coach Congrats on the win now you came in unbeaten but some would say unproven as well what did your team show you tonight we made some improvement where we still you know it's young we're still young in the season it's only the third game we've got a lot we can be better at and that's what we'll keep pushing for it's you try and build through the year Oklahoma seems are always pride itself on its defense what did you think about the way that your defense performed tonight I thought they were incredible you know we we let the punt hit us in the back to give him field position and then we were out of another series with the 30 we got offsides it gave him up you know another chance week but other than that we played fabulous you know they've got great pressure to the quarterback all night really eliminated the run game and did what we needed to coach up in the booth late in the game there was a lot of talk about how this Oklahoma team just feels a little bit different in your mind what makes this team special and unique well we're working on it you know I love the team their character their attitude all of it is that we got great leaders like Trevor one of our captains we got a great team as far as our attitude work ethic all of that now we got just got to keep getting better we you know we've got to keep you know improving in technique and fundamentals and and try and build to be better every week coach Congrats on it and Trevor Knight certainly showing a lot of confidence out there you are the guy this year last year split some time with Blake Bell how has that helped your confidence really knowing that this is your team you know it's been huge and you know going in the offseason kind of being that guy was big kind of getting the guys going around me and I think it shows out here you know this was a big win for us you know SEC coming into town it was it was big for us big win yesterday we talked and you told me that your goal was really to stay calm and stay relaxed out there how are you able to do that against a team that a lot of people thought might give you a bit of a challenge I think it was in the locker room beforehand you know we were all calm relaxed ready to go and then we came out and played fast again got the field goal there early but then got on them pretty quick you know that's what we try to do every week and you know approved proof strong here and how can a win like this really send a message and set the tone for what's become the rest of the season well you know a big game you know nationally televised game it was big for our program the fans came out and did an excellent job and then just the way our defense played the way we played early it was pretty good for us what's good indeed thanks Trevor thank back to you guys nine big 12 games coming up the next three are away from home yet a 308 yard game but they don't convert a third down after halftime so there's plenty to work on for that Oklahoma loss that's what Bob's Bob Stoops was telling Heather is that hey it's a solid win I mean you win 34 to 10 you feel good about it but the great news is they can get better in every phase of the game special teams and all offense especially in the defense as good as they look they'll still continue to get better so I think for Tennessee they also get back to the drawing board learn a lot from some of the mistakes and see what they can do was he getting ready for conference play every opponent up to deal with number 19 Erik striker and then Oklahoma defenses Zac Sanchez and Julian Wilson made picks in the end zone Wilson took his 100 yards 34:10 is the final Oklahoma next Saturday at on ABC we're in Tallahassee to see Clemson take on number one Florida State now it's time for the Ford wrap up let's check back in with Chris Cotter thank you
