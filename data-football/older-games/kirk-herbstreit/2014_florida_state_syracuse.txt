============================================================

welcome to ESPN's coverage of college football presented by cars.com and welcome to the ACC on ESPN we're at the Carrier Dome here in Syracuse at number one Florida State on the road to take on the orange and amidst a brand new firestorm surrounding Jameis Winston it has been reignited over the last 24 hours he will start the game today and Florida State will start with the football I'm Bob Washington the long side Matt Millen Quinn kaznyk is here in the question in the ACC did anyone catch the Noll there's only one other ranked team in the conference Florida State playing Syracuse today but of course that meeting with Notre Dame looming and they'll have to deal with yet another week of questions surrounding their quarterback and we'll talk about that with something Quinn kaznyk spoke with Jimbo Fisher about pregame you may have seen that on gameday and Matt melon he was very quick to say Jameis Winston is the starting quarterback today where it goes from here we'll take ya and to be just to be put on a spot before the game when your mindset has to be completely good Syracuse Orangemen is a distraction but I got to tell you just watching Jameis Winston he doesn't look the least distracted okay wait back east to receive the obey ticket at the short one and Wilsonville taken at about the 12 yard line break the buckle example for the quarter is brought down at the 30 yard line so here comes Jameis Winston and of course in the wake of a relatively scathing expose from the New York Times and other reports regarding Florida State's handling of legal matters not just regarding Jameis Winston but football players as a whole he has been notified by the school that a disciplinary hearing about the December 2012 sexual encounter that led to a rape accusation will he dealt with and a letter said Winston could be charged with war violations of FSU's Student Conduct code and he is already one for one as he finds Nick O'Leary on and outs of the sideline for about nine yards and according to Mark Schlabach who does great job covering college football for us at ESPN the results of that hearing could be anywhere from no penalty whatsoever to expulsion from Florida State and anything in between Mario Pender getting a start today at tailback with Carlos Williams out and Winston supersuit shot green picks up the first down after the 45 yard line as we take a look at our impact players when the Noles a ball well you guys see two too young running backs tender and cook along to save the estrogen all three of these players will have an impact on how their how their respective teams play but those two young running backs they may end up being the answer to the permanent running back being the permanent running back here at Florida State let's turn off the play action fake flips it in the flattened and their fender that's another first down picking up nine so shoes so here's the bottom line so all this stuff is swirling around Jameis Winston so what can practically what can Jameis Winston do well you already said it to four to go out there play your best football block out whatever you can and just concentrate on the game and that looks and appears to be what he's doing swing pass broken shackles and another first step let's get down to quit Bobby a little bit of an early October injury bug has hit the Florida State Seminoles you mentioned earlier Carlos Williams not playing today injured his ankle last week spent most of the week in a walking boot but he's here today with sneakers on he looks ready to go next week often barons out at the center position he broke his arm he's probably gone for a month and then back up quarterback Shawn Maguire who led his team to a win against Clemson broke his hand he's obviously treating John Franklin as Jameis Winston Sacco and Bobo Wilson was actually marked down about a foot shot at the first down so a third and short they'll run it and move the pile and pick up the first down easily handled by Mario Pender okay so if you're a Syracuse Orangemen what can you do in this game they're bigger faster stronger and so all the artisan stuff Bob that's really kind of meaningless what matters is scoring and so this is where they have to be good if they get the ball moves on them all over the place yet they come away with three that's a win so that now is where they're going to have to play their best defense for the 30 on it Travis Groudon takes a little tunnel screen and I really professor inside the 30yard line down to the 29 Marquis pods made the stop that the gain of Port Seymour you asked me earlier about you know how do we define this team and I think the answer is they're not defined yet they're the number one ranked team in the country and they are not who they're going to be and right there Rudolph he's one of the reasons they have a lot of talented freshmen and sophomores they will integrate in their game and they're going to be a better team be positive picked up a handful and a flag is throw away from the secondary communities an extra 15 against Syracuse as Winston was on the ground and he was hit late this offensive line from the Florida State Seminoles team is about across the board mannequin arms bigger on our personal foul a hate number I see Frank an statistical automatic first down that's Kelly number eight coming in right at the end I almost don't even have an opinion on late hits anymore because they they just kind of do what they do but I moved the ball down at the 12 yard line and maybe the fact that he lived with his helmet and got Winston's helmet as well but he started his most of the waiver battle that ever happened and he canceled off in the middle of their momentum so I had that argument from you Henderson back to the hole to go lock people at the Florida State Club step choose two little moves in there is why I believe Pender is going to be their longterm answer running back this guy he's got speed they all have speed but I want you to watch the reason for the touchdown there's the first one making miss in the hole and coming up right there there's the second one just that little crossover move you either have that or you don't have that tender hazard of spades and he's just getting started and it's not like carlos williams is a bad glare browser he's a good player I just think I think Pender's got something to Carlos doesn't and we'll see the true freshman Dalvin cook later in the game as well they are taking a look in the replay booth just to make sure he gets over the line who are now in his land of a touchdown is under further review seem to be the first thing that hits but you're allowed to use your hand to plant so that does not declare him down yeah it lands on top of the defender and rolls into the end zone the forearm however does that's right there when it would be stopped where's the ball where the ball is when his forearm hits not his hand so rake the foul there so here's the ball there's the line now we're at a bad angle and it was declared a touchdown on the field so the video evidence has to be indisputable to overturn that call and worse comes to worse for Florida State its first and goal at about the sixinch line seems inevitable that the ball can end up in the end zone but it was ruled a touchdown on the field so the replay booth will make sure and Jimbo Fisher if he was looking for a sign there's quarterback not one bothered by the latest round of controversy at first ever reviewing pretty clear Verona failed Santa's Hall okay so Jameis Winston five for five for 38 yards on the opening drive and Florida State is a Roberto Aguayo extra point taking to 7nothing lead ride normally we don't even mention kicker but this kid to study this kid was banging him from 55 today in the pregame and he could have made him from 65 they won the Lou Groza Award last season he's looking to win it again this season if he does it would be the second time in history that a thicker one back to back Luke Rose Awards in Sebastian Janikowski was the last to do it for Florida sing Mario bender gives an old belief Florida State marches right down the field to take a 7nothing lead as the Knowles made it look as easy as could be and in case you missed the touchdown video is now posted on the SportsCenter app available on your mobile devices and tablets whenever you're in need eight play is 70 yards Mario Pender with his fourth rushing touchdown of his career and now Roberto look Lyle will send it deep and Syracuse will have their first chance with the football Irvin Phillips Dyson gulley back deep to receive and Philip about four yards he picks a nice well the shame of this afternoon's game for Syracuse is that they lost Terrell hunt to a fractured fibula against Louisville so the normal starting quarterback for the Cuse is out for the next four to six weeks which means we'll see two quarterbacks Matt today Austin Wilson who's more of the throwing quarterback will get the start for Syracuse but true freshman AJ long who's got a little something to him according to this Syracuse coaching staff more the runner he's going to get out there as well but it will be Austin Wilson with Terrell hunt upstairs on the headset in the coach's box doing what he can to help but not getting an opportunity to play against the number one team and a hand off the gun yet I've been going picked up about five yards before he's driven back and meanings as mad as we take a look at her impact players of the big game today for Syracuse Sabatini yeah Chris Tyson golly he's got some game show he's got little he's got some good vision and he's got some ability to make plays but poquito I'm anxious for his render Featherston number 41 just a freshman I believe that's the real that's their real key to a real pass run that feather some kids got the lead and goes to the first time now for the Syracuse Orange what can they do again they're going against the team bigger faster stronger pop the key for me watching this game is make it personal you've got to if you got to get downright nasty in it and turn it into something that it's you versus me on every single play you may not be good enough but you're going to give it everything you got at the hardworking two and a half yards Terence Smith was first there to help bring gully down for Florida State interestingly so Florida State opens in a nickel so they're going three wide so they're gone they're giving you a light box what I mean by a light box is right up in here so the only have six inside so you're going to try to want to run it dang and that's what Syracuse has been doing the first content for often looking at the game to make bail well that might build the confidence of a sophomore who plays just a bit in the opener against Villanova pump was ejected for throwing a punch towards the end of the Villanova game and Austin Wilson stepped in and they want an overtime but what you see there so they caught him in his own they have been numbers to run at they sat back in his zone they gave him time to throw and he delivered a bullet now you got your safety drop down its gulley again he gets it up Eddie Goldman who's off to a great start this year at defensive tackle for the Noles made the stop Suzanne D Goldman was a guy a year ago because Kimmy Jernigan was in there they didn't really say too much about Goldman and he flashy and say hey at night he's a pretty good player but this year he's got great size he's got great movement I think he started to flex those those golden muscles because he's playing pretty well often Wilson long line Ben look another circumstance nice place smart so if you can't match up you take agent Flemming 20 through and you run them inside of you you run a rub it's not really a fit and you take the other defender out it opens it up and you get a first down this is very encouraging right down for the Orangemen at dana 15 put the orange inside the 35 yard line and only get them to about the 30 quickly let's go back to the studio our first chance to say how to reach del mono Taco Bell studio update and we'll start with the nation's leading rusher in the big pen Wisconsin against Illinois there goes Melvin Gordon averaging better than 174 yards the game his tenth rushing touchdown 47 yards so far Bucky up 7 nothing Williams got to pee but couldn't keep it out of the hands of Adrian Fleming Jun just like that the ques is in the ripa the accused is in the red zone because that was a ploy watch this throw that's a tiny tiny window he's putting it he puts it right past William and picks up that first no pressure once they've got no pressure when they throw Wilson pulls it down he wants the wheel wrap down the sideline to gully and a flag down check that the Hat alone gully must have steps out of bounds get it out of them it'll be second down in the red zone for Syracuse nicely nice balance of runs and pass here in this destroy and that speaks to the offensive coordinator of course there was a change here just this week so not even more fuel to the fire Wilson tries to get outside and now cut back we've this way and they have lost the yard now let me third down and at least 10 maybe 11 for Syracuse just inside the 20yard line Reggie Northrop stayed home and brought down Wilson North oak does a nice job having a little bit of discipline but water state is getting zero pass rush Featherston number 41 when he's in the game he's a legitimate pass rusher he's the only one Florida State has all the way out to about the 38 yard line Jalen Ramsey and just like that a promising drive for Syracuse to start ends in the red zone is Austin Wilson threw it right to Ramsey they brought pressure he gets outside so now you have to protect the but I was just a flatout awful throw I mean this is there's no excuse about the safeties right in front of them I mean the defenders right in front of them so Austin Wilson who had all kinds of momentum on the opening drive and kept AJ long on the bench we were told we were going to see both quarterbacks to begin the game but Wilson was playing so well why not stick with them until he throws it right Jalen Ramsey second career interception for Ramsey only the third interception in season for Florida State last year they were number one in the country and set a school record with 26 interceptions that's only their third this year but it's a big one and great field position now for Jameis Winston to go back to work pop under the table line defender helped out of a stop by Robert well she's let me show you something okay see this this matched up these are matched up down here so it's mantoman all the way he sees that he's going to get the pressure back inside they drop a safety down but this isn't even close this he broke her the ball before the ball was even thrown that was just a very poor decision and you can see the result a little bit of a pollution that might be a false are against the nose looked like the right tackle Bobby Park backed up Barnett is half full start number 51 offense fiveyard penalty it remains second down takeaways have not been nearly the factor this year they were last year for Florida State 24 of their last 25 games they've got at least one but last year they were dominant in terms of take away 26 interceptions last season we're approaching to the winter of this year he said that totally deserve but it's a big one anytime you get a sec away in the redzone a huge momentum changes tender but he gets swallowed up for a gain of a couple and this is where you know and can't really even overemphasize this early in the game Matt how important a spot like this is for this Syracuse defense they get Florida State third long they have to get off the field they have to be able to get off the field and so they don't necessarily have to be able to have a great pass rush what they have to be able to do is if they're going to play a zone they can't can't have any big hole none at all Lucy's going to try to get rid of the ball quickly here comes the Blitz listen to the sidelines is it scooped up right at the first down marker it depends on the spot Bobo Wilson has the reception and it looks as if the notes of the football is literally right on the first down line and without measurement they say first half they didn't even have to run the chains out he was looking straight at the change and looked like the ball was ahead of the chain you can see fit to come back and that ball will throw and he does make the catch that's a really nice catch up and the ball is delivered in a nice spot I think Scott Shafer on the near sideline is Louie when the printers will die at least of a completion and a mercy upon us under whether or not it was the first down they're going to review to see whether or not it was a catch but it was they've already picked the chains up and moved them down the field yeah hey don't pay any attention to our line the line may not be where the marker is we had this is what this is what matters right there we're that marker well that's only the marker on the far side those are the official chains of the rectum the official teams are on the far side without measurement they said first down and now they're going to check and see whether or not the pass was complete certainly looked like Bobo Wilson had his arms underneath and made a clean catch after review we're really on a fielder's confirm a completion on the first half there's a third down and long conversion for Florida State to midfield and Jameis Winston is seven for seven to start the game yeah and they did they brought they brought pressure like you mentioned with the Blitz we were not able to get to the Winston the ball still came out relatively quickly it's been back to the sideline works the same route with the same success that time it's Rashad Greene on a comeback for eight yards Julian Williams stands at the corner so you're playing a lot of types good man coverage on the outside and so your main objective in that you know you're not going to get beat deep you can't get run off and so when you play the top side of the receiver that comeback is kind of a gimmick we heard Kirk Herbstreit say on game day that Jameis Winston seems to be able to block out any controversy and perform on the football field it's another first down on the handoff for the true freshman Dalvin cook and in case you're wondering if Jameis Winston with all of us controversy again reignited seems to be bothered this is him pregame that looked like a guy that's got a lot of tension blowing through him see you the guy gets pretty loose hips face so he may be facing a disciplinary hearing back at Florida State when he returns Tallahassee but it doesn't seem to be bothering him much here in Turkey the middle goes on the tackle after a gain of four now if Florida State so chooses to just pound the football that offensive line is enjoying about a 60 pound difference against seven front seven so they are just just more they're more physical they're bigger they're bar on sweater when to the coconut Julian Wiggum sat back knocked it down that's the first incompletion of the game for Jameis Winston and here's the size differential and keep in mind Erik Croom is out today and we take another look at the incompletion that's well done by Wigan he just could be called the sinking in his own can you stepped on coming down there accuse is without crew he's a 297 pounds normal starter at nose tackle you're playing backup 65 lb and a cadet differential but under chance on third down for third needs to get a stop third and six like rockets to those more pressures and Winston off his back foot faces into the south line flag down rigor Darrell Eskridge was there in coverage as well and let's see what the call is he's going right to the sticks and come back with this pressure Wiggum feels like he was pushed off but it certainly seemed to be the contact by Wigan the true the flag two flags were thrown so there could be a difference of opinion over there going on the field it's an incomplete pass it was pass interference number three defense going places the spot of the foul 190 first half so Rashad Greene works up that's the right thing to do there's the hole that he calls all you're going to call that every time that was an incomplete pass and they did have pressure up front they brought another another blitz hit him right in the kisser he stood in there pretty well the two bit third down conversions on this drive for Florida State you're storing books again there's going man on the outside if you take it out of it you got handy breaking tackles and is down to the 16 yard line you think if you were missing a player like Carlos Williams you take a step down in terms of salad Florida State and here's the key right here he's going to run the lane and got to be inside out that angle was awful just flatout awful Darius Kelly number eight you got a you got to give that running back only one way to go and he came down way too high and allowed him to come back underneath but choose I mentioned this year earlier burial Pender I think he's going to end up being here top running back heat that kids at house get here's Dalvin cook taking a salad the 11 yard line he was the consensus number one recruit in the nation out of Miami Central and not surprising that the number one recruit the nation might come out of Miami because the football town that comes out of those high school programs here after years amazing and Dalvin cook already has two rushing touchdowns this season as a nice complement to Pender and we'll all three of the running back Williams Kendrick cook they can all fly they're on second down it's another third down coming up with about two minutes to go in the quarter as Cook has brought down outside the 10yard line so third down and about five Ryan Sloane made the tackle for Syracuse a slows got himself you know he got a little bit of anchor to him which is something they need well you have a 65pound different Superman Sloan comes in to drop that anchor net helpless to if they do here on third eleven play of the drive after the Syracuse turn over fold man for the left sowing type coverage again don't I got this man my clock was winding down so Jimbo Fisher called timeout from the Florida State sideline so we'll have to sign as well another question and when we return a timeout that's the full media ESPN college football is presented by cars.com all Drive no drama and in part by dr. pepper always oneofakind yesterday afternoon a center School of Music presented a free concert Nolan attended as his mantra that he lives by is if it's free it's for me say but I'm sing it when I say right and that obviously cleared out the free concert they performed works by Schubert Rachmaninoff Gershwin the great afternoon winds down to the field by the way disrupt the quarterback that's what Syracuse likes to do under Scott Shaffer and Chuck bola we're in Bullas office he's got over 30 blips is up on the board all funky names Fox Falcon magician and monkey they love to bring the heat watch Jameis Winston now call off the protection do with the bring on Thursday Winston Pete sit on the flat inside the sick way to the log yard line Bobo will concede not hang on and there was ruled a completion by the farside official and we have an injured Syracuse Orange defensive player on the field as well watch when he lets go the ball where he's throwing Wilson's not even close and that's a great call it's an incompletion never had control of it but you saw from our /cam because you know I know these things the television aficionado that not knowing is this is the flash can look ago flashed a way to dial it up I got that stuff down very impressive so Bobo Wilson was not able to hold on to what would have been a first down at about the 5yard line and more concern for a banged up front seven for Syracuse defensively Aric room is already out of today's game injured not able to play and he's normally the starting nose tackle the senior from Detroit so they can't afford to lose too many more bodies in the front seven that's Micah Robinson senior defensive end who's got four tackles for loss this year and it's good to see him get up able to walk it off Chuck full of the defensive coordinator he's an aggressive God gets it from his dad he comes tozzoli his dad would blitz offer anything and Chuck has the same thing there was a time where if you would have told a Florida State pickle that you have the least to worry about in the kicking game of any fan in college football they would have said of it but you know what they've got less to worry about the kicking game than any team in college football this will be a false start against Florida State where the snap false start number 85 offense by gar penalties only play fourth and Jimbo Fisher might be upset I will ballpark though that that fiveyard six Roberta love wild from 99.9% to 99.85% to hit from 30foot now this guy's got a phenomenal leg I mentioned it earlier he was he was banging him home from 55 and he was clearing by about 15 to 20 yards he's got really 10 nothing Florida State he stays perfect this season with only one miss and his MSU career off to an interesting start here at Syracuse bein college football presented by cars.com if the ACC on ESPN 10 nothing Florida State Syracuse about to get the ball for the second time this time a returnable kick from the 5yard line urban Phillips barely reaches the 20 and let's go back to real about talking the Goodyear superior performance after Texas held the ball nearly seven minutes and kicked a field goal Alex Ross of Oklahoma and the Red River Rivalry there's a new suitor second time this year Ross is taking a kickoff to the house and the old boomer doesn't have a first down yet after going three and out they do have a 73 lead on ABC arrays here on ESPN at quarterback switch for Syracuse often Wilson got Sarah Houston first down but turned it over in the red zone so here is the true frankly AJ law first down AJ long as we talked about Matt the coaching staff for Syracuse told us a little something yeah and the thing he's got a little bit of attitude got a little bit an edge to him and it can be infectious in the in the huddle and the way you can really become infectious it is the unicode feet and starts picking up some ground drop back it's out of the pocket right at the line of scrimmage by Renzi northbrook's that's a nice open field tackle by Northup you hear so much right now in all of football regardless of the level high school college in the pros is you have to be a good open field tackle and there's the perfect definition of it Northup does a nice job of my position taking something away forcing them to go one way and then bringing them down third down and long for a day long right at the first down marker he's had a completion and that looks to be good enough to move the change to Syracuse and might bring us to the end of the first quarter as Tyson gully the running back got loose and picks up without eight choose the one thing that has surprised me here is Syracuse office and blind is past protecting pretty long Florida State we watch them unsavoury watch a bunch of L but they didn't really seem to have a pass rusher there one guy they have the freshman Fedderson and arrest the urban Philip it picks up close to 7:00 and that will take us to the end of the first quarter so Florida State two for two in terms of scoring points on their opening two possessions and Syracuse with a take away by Florida State in the red zone comes up empty in the opening quarter send nothing for the numberoneranked Knowles after what a beautiful fall day here in Syracuse as we welcome you back to the ACC on ESPN we're inside the Carrier Dome I'm Susan alongside Matt Millen down on the field Quintus Nick Florida State at the end of one quarter of play with a thin nothing lead over Syracuse and there's an impact player and the guy that might be more and more involved for Florida State defense as the season goes up yeah he really needs to in this Lorenzo Featherston is a guy who has legitimate pass throw skills he's raw he's long six seven got real long arms and and good length and he knows how to use it exactly the Beatles and singing back the big gainer for search is the first down across the 15 again a 16 refused one of the things he's going to have to learn is how to defend the edge and he cannot let anybody get outside of him but this is an outstanding run because he's got great speed down that sideline watch him turn the corner and keep his feet inbounds and get some blunt out of yards that's Syracuse that's the first time out the serve excuse was called the timeout and will step aside as well as they trailed by 10 tonight on ESPN at MCC doubleheader first at 6:00 college football primetime presented by Hampton Hotel Alabama Arkansas then at 9:00 Ole Miss Texas A&amp;M both games live on watch ESPN and we'll see at defense for old myths how it holds up against Kenny Hill and the am offense at 9:00 Eastern tonight the Ole Miss has good young players on both sides of the ball most of their playmakers are just sophomore with a great crafty with treatment after the orange timeout AJ lost to the quarterback and plundered gully when you're down at the syracuse sideline but you notice maybe it's change its personnel for Florida State that might give us a window into how they're going to attack Syracuse well it's interesting coming off that last timeout they brought bigger box and they got away from the nickel they just switched back to nickel but they had seven in the box I think they've realized that this young quarterback is more than run Freddie it worked against gulley as he picked up six by Giorgio Newbery at the loss of a couple but it was Desmond Holland that really helped stop the holes for Florida State okay so the advantage that Florida State has defensively while we're talking about size is one thing but on the outside as you look at Featherston and on the outside they can match up mantoman and not get run by they are very confident they can handle the receivers with straight man coverage long that's in the cockpit to get that's first and goal for Syracuse he starts off to the left and they have a stacked receiver he goes back to the right side that's a heck of a catch by his man and he does have control as he goes out about he's so exciting stood his mouthpiece on 35th first and goal for Syracuse trying to get on the board and classified brought down by Mario Edwards okay if you got to run let's run it the Preston Tennyson he's not very big so if we go right out boy I want an effort by the client and Josh Paris almost had highlightreel touchdown catch oh that's a phenomenal catch there's the catch put is out of bounds and he come down the left foot it was six he came down with the right and it's nothing third down and goal from inside the box what about draw possible with Jared bottled up inside the bag and Syracuse will have to settle for three so that's two red zone trips for Syracuse on their first two drive and they'll only end up with three total points out of the two trips Josh Parish district right in the chest and he's thrown it over his head in an impossible catch with one hand he had been better off Tyler hunter was right there was about to bring him down so that play had no chance to get Syracuse into the end zone Cole Murphy from 21 yards away to try and get the orange on the board bigtime defenses championship defenses topranked defenses get raped on tops Florida State now has two of them and it's delete ESPN college football is brought to you by Toyota let's go places should an angle Paul State Park located just east of Syracuse and that is a picture postcard fall afternoon outside and inside the dome Florida State still with a touchdown lead and now you've seen both quarterbacks Matt you've seen AJ long you've seen Austin Wilson long produced three often Wilson through a red zone interception he is still alternate or if you're Scott Shaffer do you pick one for me I'd go long not that Wilson played poorly he made one bad decision the difference is long has feet to go with his arm the untold story so far in this first half is that the Syracuse offensive line is passed protecting very well and so both quarterbacks have had time to be able to throw and so you take the guy who has defeat to go with the arm you don't then want to kick the ball out of town yeah it's not a good idea and that's exactly what Cole Murphy just did so that will give the ball to Florida State out at their own 35yard kick out of bounds well replaces the 35 yard line first half good field position for the Noles again after we check in with rece let's go inside the head set both you by AT&amp;T big 12 offensive showcase you would expect West Virginian Texas Tech Davis left to Devon Lauderdale for 76 yards Lauderdale has two touchdown catches didn't have any coming into the day West Virginia's just answered with the score 14 10 in the second quarter in Lubbock three stacks Ahriman Jameis Winston off to a good start 8 for 10 led a touchdown drive on the opening possession a field goal drop and possession number to escape the sack here interception for Doral extras and Eskridge drop what should have been a Syracuse takeaway Eskridge does everything right he reads the quarterback he stays with good discipline in the middle of field he breaks in the ball it's a good play that could have been a great play the difference between good and great great is catching the ball you think when that balls in the air Darrell esker just thinking I can't wait to call my best friend Devonta Freeman after the game and to tell them I got a sec take away to a tunnel screen Travis Rudolph for 15 yards and a Florida State first down the midfield Eskridge grew up in the Liberty City project and one of the toughest spots to grow up in Miami and became great friends with Devonta Freeman who of course went on to start Florida State and Freeman gave him all kinds of grief last year when an old feet the orange 59 to 3 it was looking for revenge but won't get it Mario Pender picks up one will be second down and nine Julian Wiggum came up to help on the side there Julian Williams came on a corner blitz and that you know I mentioned to you chuck full of their defensive coordinator Hank bull up with his father is in the NFL for a long time and college football he's at Michigan State as well and he he is with is one of the most inventive coordinators that there's ever been he had a list of a hundred and thirty defenses very similar another strain free grain inside the pen finally comes out of the fog y'all gone Rashad Greene as the Blitz came snuck in behind it and Jameis Winston found him on the cross sir a run in Kent 244 yards yeah they came back underneath he came back watch Rashad dream he's going to come back here from the outside coming in you see this see they're blocking before that balls even thrown some people would call that illegal I call that good execution area Pender in CI back on person go to get to the edge of one it'll be second down and goal as Hajj and Asterix were there for the fuse Syracuse Turk used as this game is gone Syracuse start to find himself a little bit the gals are getting a little bit of confidence like they know they can hang with he's got that he'd given up some big plays which they couldn't afford to do and they find themselves in this all key familiar position inside the redzone last time they were able to hold it two three let's see if they can do it again when sit well protected closer to the end Mario pepper drop the coverage if you're going to get beat physically that's fine don't compete mentally don't drop of coverage there's pender down below he's gone right away and I'll tell you right from the Strada could tell you what happened the defender had his eyes in the backfield you can't be in man coverage and looked at the quarterback it just it doesn't work that way they look like guys Sean Davis was the linebacker on that too otherwise their abuse and at 17 three if you're going to pull the unlikely upset you have to make every play they've dropped an interception they've thrown in their section of the red zone and Florida State doing what number one does taking advantage of the other teams mistakes they lead by two touchdowns Jameis Winston with a touchdown pass to Mario Pender that Sean Davis made that much easier for Florida State executed right now he's starting there either in a matchup zone his eyes are back inside but here's your compass right here so when the ball is snapped this is all about eye discipline when your eyes come back inside and your coverage is leaving you're beaten you can't you have no chance you can see everybody's matched up and he loses it right outside now I can't tell their rule so I don't know if they were running some kind of a banjo down there which is an in and out coverage or a matchup zone or if it's just pure man regardless of those three it still comes down to I discipline don't look back in the backfield when your coverage is running away from the 10 yard line so about the 30 later today on ABC or espn2 depending on where you're at 3:30 Eastern unbeatens battle in the big 12 Bryce petty and number 5 Baylor taking on number 9 TCU and a top 10 showdown MC you meet 4th ranked Oklahoma last week to leap up into the top 10 of the AP poll Gary Patterson is one of the best defensive lines in college football that would not surprise me to see TC you offend Valens it's not same for Flickr guys they say long still in a quarterback again looking for the default down to so it'll be second down in ten again Austin Wilson played the first possession drove Sara cue sound in the red zone through pic AJ long got them three on their last drive but good is convert inside the 5yard line although he'll be out there now for Drive number two for drive number three one thing that saved her said he wanted to be able to do was make a decision quickly and settle into it and so I like this decision bring up third down and about six and it looks like George Morris might have a flat tire let's go down to quit head coach Scott J for very handson after that last field goal he sat down with the old why certain fear assist in his voice says we're going to do this all day the offensive line agreed he said keep encouraging the young kids behind you the old wine has the experience the skilled quarterback does not urban Phillips also a true freshman in the backfield for Syracuse so they've got young guys on the field working on that but this is what's good about them okay this is what you can teach you have the ability to use your feet and make play and that's exactly what he does plus he had the wherewithal to understand where the sticks are to pick up the first down I like this move right up the middle go far second down and eight well Tim Lester is now the new play caller replacing George MacDonald for Syracuse and he really tear down the playbook after both a day long and often you think you don't usually see guys in the sidelines it looks like an IHOP menu you know they had like 800 plays this guy came in looked like he had like you know hot dogs my friend built like five planes marek didn't holiday soon that was wide open that was well blocked on the front side they had exactly what they wanted jaren West number 88 it looked like you know he had already drawn the coverage back inside there's nothing but green out there he would have to have a first a red zone interception offensively a dropped interception defensively now a drop ball underneath adrian fleming so its fourth down and about two and a half interesting what do you do here because you can't let the game slip away you put it in your freshman tanner your young guy can't enter going to kick it they're going to be conserved Scott Shafer went for it on fourth down and three from his own side of the 50 you wonder what message that's also sending to your own diesel we have no believe that you can get a stop we're not playing field position and as a result they'll kick it away you're driving Dixon is a beautiful kid they're sets made at the stick by Green they got the change of field position but they're still down by two touchdowns Jameis Winston had the ball free pound so far in the game he has led his team on two touchdown drives in the field goal drive giving it Stephen Lucas badly he's been accurate he's been throwing the ball across the board to any receiver that gets open who's been seeing the field pretty well and he's been able to put any kind of distraction to decide he can see what he got 11 out of 14 but most importantly he's running his office flawlessly first and ten for Florida State down at their own 6yard line if they want to make a game of the different keys to get a stop starting on the ground that effectively struck how to about the 30yard line Gloria Pender would you have thought if you were Jimbo Fisher considering now that this beehive has kind of been revoked surrounding Jameis Winston and the fact that he is facing a disciplinary hearing at his own school when he goes back to Tallahassee would you considered not playing into that no I would have played them because I don't think this is anything new for this group I don't think it's anything new for Jimbo I don't think it's anything new for the administration I think they know what they're in Sarek you've turned it over in the redzone have they taken it away in the redzone the interception it dropped some passes they fumbled the football and now they finally are able to take one away robert wellstocked it out John Raymond picked it up Darrell Eskridge was there as well and now it's spot for Syracuse where they have to take advantage and they'll have it at the 16 yard line and also on the play Mario tender injured so he's being helped off remember Florida State already without Carlos Williams now they've got arguably the best freshman running back in America in Dalvin cook to go to as well and that's the blessing of your Florida State someone goes down on your depth chart that's probably someone just as talented right behind them buddy they goes three deep and they're still in pretty good shape yeah a stack he's been a great job of keeping instate talent right there in Florida State but that is disturbing to see for Mario Pender gets a chance to start today in place of Carlos Williams you can see their turnover margin that what a huge difference from a year ago there's Carlos who will hope to be back first things first though for the nose to the turnover AJ long in the redzone the government about the 10yard line license prices going he's got some power tool and he picked up five yards there on first down that's you can't beat that you're looking at second and five and this really good nice job in this offensive line they're getting movement and then going it gives you a little bit of movement himself Mario Edwards just left the field for the second time here in the first half his helmet pops off okay well Smith was in coverage he actually was beat this ball was behind him has he if he throws it out in front gully has a chance to make a real play and the to pass rushers the young pass rushers on the near side of the field middle of your screen you've got Jacob Q and Lorenzo Featherston right next to one another two freshmen gets run after the quarterback as was AJ long the Martinez crew sarin coverage on third down and it looks like another field goal for Syracuse that's a good non call and he made a nice break I don't believe he got there before the ball the ball was tip all he has always chipped anyway it was behind the good not call once the ball tip you can hit but it was ever so and takes away any flag possibilities both 27yard field goal attempt for Cole Murphy but another great job by the Florida State defense black town car prior to the snap false start number 67 vigor penalty remains fourth down Matt we spend all our time talking about Jameis Winston and Florida State has so much offensive talent that's what a really good defense does all right you were part of a defense that wins championships you deal with sudden change you go out there you get a red zone star and even if you give up a play which they did you were able to regroup and gather and take care of business and that's what they did her feet too perky but a missed opportunity for Syracuse takeaway in the red zone but they can manage only a field goal Stephen Tate for the NASCAR Sprint Cup heads to the second ring to the contender round as women move on 12 nations battle he advanced the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte tonight at 7:00 Eastern 4:00 Pacific on ABC bhavish uzum Matt Millen Quintus Nick here at the Carrier Dome and went down there on the side launch went how about the vibe on that Syracuse sideline considering the opportunities they've had and the fact that they're still down by two scores it's generally positive I don't sense any kind of frustration or you know players snapping one another or the coaching staff I think they realize they've had opportunities to make plays whether it be interceptions catches in the flat but what stands out to me is their lack of success in the red zone and that goes back to last two or three games they are just inept in terms of scoring touchdowns once again in the red zone well they're now 9 for 21 this season scoring in the red zone and almost bringing it out the scrimmage Whitfield second thought better takes a knee and let's go back to read all right guys time for a dr. Paris conference update in the big 12 Oklahoma and Texas on a third and 12 Tyrone swoop to John Harris 38 yards this the first offensive touchdown of the game Sooners did scored on defense in a kickoff return 1710 boomer on top for the Red River Rivalry off to a good start Florida State got off to a great start leading 17 three fumbling on their last possession and Mario Pender going out of the game of an injury but the Alvin cook is now in there for the left foot Jameis Winston underneath with Nick O'Leary and stays almost perfect he is now 12 for 15 to start the game Calvin cook strike pick up the first down one thing this Florida State offense has been able to do consistently through this first half is they've been able to get into second in short pretty well and so when you get to that position you can take shots you can you have this dealer's choice on that down as you just saw there they you know you pick up nine yards you get the second one to do whatever you want to do under pressure of the wide open Herrmann Whitfield out of bounds for the first down out near midfield in a gain of 13 nicely done by Whitfield to be able to sense there's trouble in the backfield there's a timing clock as a receiver that you have in your head and once you know you run your round and now your quarterbacks moving you move to him he does a nice job of knowing where he's at getting that first down Kermit Whitfield is only a sophomore I got a lot of good young players Winston looking for the bomb down the sideline just about dropped it into green and a flag down Julian Wigan was there in covered with Prashad green flag thrown at the 20 yard line it'll be past interference against Syracuse they've been going after Wiggum all day long for the start of the game silver 114 yards from the previous line of scrimmage automatic first down shoes he was running with him fine let's see what happened on the front end they're both jostling their job back and forth on puts his hand on his shoulder that's what got him and he didn't need to he was running fine with him I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that Scott Shafer disagreed with the call it's not a happy man yeah part of does her own coaching status tearing up though the good thing is he hides it really well he he was the defensive coordinator some of that coaching staff went to Buffalo and Doug Marrone took the bills job Scott Shafer stayed here at Syracuse and got the head coaching opportunity Winston Allen club territory wide open over the middle settling down in space is the freshman Dalvin cook for a gain of 8 no pressure a lot of time to see the field sets up another second in short now you're back to dealer's choice again you can run if you want you can take a shot if you want you can try right in this area you can try reverse or some kind of trick play fourman rush from Syracuse Aires O'Leary with another first down some point will they have to become more aggressive with their looks defensively in your rush for and ever hope to get the Jameis Winston well he has been bringing pressure I mean he he's been bringing different things but he's been playing different things deciding he doesn't really believe just watching him I understand what he's don't eat he doesn't really believe he can just match up man like Florida State can because you don't have that type of athlete so no zero blitzes into the most part he may do that as he gets down closer because you sort of feel they're not going to run away from it the only way you really can use your speed down here is crossing around Syracuse we'll call their second timeout on deep their twos it's a 30second timeout will step aside for just a moment as well after the Syracuse timeout ESPN college football presented by cars.com all part of the ACC on ESPN Bobbo Susan Matt Millen Quinn kaznyk here in Syracuse and Jameis Winston in position to add to the nose lead first and ten at the orange 21 yard line playaction and he's got to touch that there's not Bob there's your example if you talked about bringing pressure this time he dialed up a blitz you out with his own blitz and any time I don't care what you're doing up front if you block it in any zone there are holes and O'Leary is going to find that hole you can stand these right here they're going to bring the extra people back inside now here's where he wants to get to so you see how he ran that route the difference in that play he took Wiggum any bat and he pushed them to the right knowing he's coming back inside and because of the protection which he was able to take his time and wait for him to come open that was well executed another touchdown for Nix O'Leary number one alltime and tight end touchdown at Florida State that's number 13 for his career and the second score thrown today by Jameis Winston I'm sorry what good execution looks like so we're going to bring these first four guys and they're going to bring pressure here so that's six guys so now you have five guys he's sitting in his own there's O'Leary when he has to be able to do is manipulate that defender now once you watch the difference in a plate as he goes he's going to bend it just a tad and that takes this defender out knowing he's coming back inside with the safety rolling away that is that's as good as it gets and because there's good for testing back there Winston sees the whole thing and O'Leary comes clear into balls perfect sense how much of the design of that play is based off film study and the tendency of knowing in the redzone what kind of a blitz you might get rock a knowing that you do have the Blitz and then be understanding your route and how you work it to perfection so O'Leary as he's running he's seeing that safety kicking out of the middle he knows he's going to get back inside all he has to do is manipulate one defender it was really well done as the receiver running that route you must be licking your chops because the C's part and you're looking at a coverage that's probably tailormade to the route you know you're about to run exactly and so you you're thinking okay as long as they protect this I should get something out of it now speaking of getting something out of it 10 Syracuse get something out of the first half with Austin Wilson back at quarterback interesting that they both back to Wilson we haven't seen him since the first drive of the game if you're a Red Cloud interception here at slingback adonis amin more and he fights for about eight yards remember Sarah Q starts the third quarter with the ball this is what they could ever move the ball down and manipulate the clock here and score points before halftime who knows they need not only points they need six points to echo what Q said they've been not very good in the red zone they need seven points out of this Drive I mean more picks up the first down I mean more is is a bigger more physical guy and forget all that I love his first thing I mean you got to be an anomaly if your parents name you with the last name of me more Adonis that's kind of like you know son we gave you the name the rest is up to you exactly right nice rotten people over to get to the second level pickup 11 and a CEREC you first Nate Andrews got a tough time bringing them down yeah bummer say something about Nate Andrews Adonis is going to come through this hole untouched there's one thing he has to do no matter how you do it he's your last line of defense get him down even if you have to sacrifice your body which he did only one deep safety for Florida State Austin I don't care what and it's person go let's go on top of Darby along that sideline but here's the key perfection now watch how he gets on top get a little that little step right there is the difference in the play and then oh by the way he has a little bit of a little bit of arm bar right there and it's 41 yards in a first down and now we go back to what Chris said can you capitalize and score six in here welcome enter and complete black that I was going to be war got caught up in the loss and that should be pass interference yeah or a pick I think they're going to go against the defense it was designed to be a pick flash rub fence interference defense number 25 all replaced at the summer foul automatic first down bitter old defensive players call it a pick those of us that understand the game call them up oh yeah you finesse guys would yeah actually that was in pure hold any way you look at it announcing names the numbers that Syracuse fans might not even recognize out on the field or I like to offensively defensive tackles out there to lead the way playaction and what's the call flags thrown just as the ball was snapped further snap full start the offensive team never got set prior to the fall being snapped by guard penalty remains first down they were so excited about the change personnel yeah that's Ron Thompson the defensive Ain slash tackle and Micah Robinson a defensive ends you've got to front seven defensive players out there for Syracuse offensively to try and load up but now you're backed up to the 10yard line again they tell me that Thompson played tight end anywhere phenomenal hands and it looked like they were going to throw now that penalty and this whistle right here speak to the inexperience of the young quarterback it doesn't look like a flag was thrown know whether the flag but get your group ready get them set know with your know your cadence understand your group don't rush things and the crowd not happy with what they sense I think is a momentum disruption of the Syracuse often right by the officiating crew but now it's first and gold back at the 10 yard line again inside the 5 goes out before your long where it will be second down and goal I'm gonna start spelling a means more I mean more as different name different I'm going to start instead of am e and I'm going to change us to am II am like a mean more that guy is running a little bit angry and I like that Florida State has gotten to red zone stop actually make it three a takeaway and holding two two field goals here's the meme or 2005 barely gets back to the fiveyard line they'll mark him down at the six so now an interesting situation Syracuse desperately needs a touchdown before halftime on this possession would you wager that this is four down territory I to me you have to this is a point in the game at 24 6 this is another opportunity it's all about opportunity and timing you need to get six here in lieu of nine and we have another officials conference in Ely with no flag thrown I don't see a penalty marker down going to play a defender members helmet came off please reset the game coxswain with two minutes 29 seconds and put 40 seconds on the play clock that was Mario Edwards again that's the third time he's helmets them off and he has to leave for a flight right so that's one of it maybe not your best front 7 defender 3 times taken off the field the business helmet came off for Florida State so it's huge play here on third and goal going to bring pressure look up inside and they'll try again on fourth down for the six yard line Jew that's that's the inexperience of the young corner they showed their head they came with a blitz knowing right where they were running the ball their blink the bringing pressure they're an experienced guy gets out of that and we have an injury as well as the starting right guard Nick Robinson was slow to get up and it looks like the officials will bring the trainer's out and send Robinson off and it doesn't look like the offense is coming off the field for Syracuse so it's fourth and goal at the six and maybe this is a sign that Scott Shafer realizes how vital this possession is and this is a point right here where you really would like to have a J long speed give yourself another option don't botch yourself into one thing Florida State that's their second timeout it's a 30 second shot so Jimbo Fisher calls timeout and while we have a moment let's go back to racing all right guys coming up on the Lexus halftime report the Red River Rivalry one team as the lead but the other has completely dominated the game you'll believe what Texas has done to Oklahoma statistically in the first half no Todd Gurley and so far no problem for Georgia the Bulldogs are running roughshod over Missouri and we'll look ahead to the games in the SEC West later this afternoon and tonight including Auburn and Mississippi State's Texas A&amp;M and Ole Miss all right reef thanks very much so a sign of desperation for Syracuse before Hampton 24 6 they trailed Florida State they get the ball all the way down to the five yard line first and goal and after a penalty and a loss of a couple of yards now they're faced with fourth and goal at the 6 Papa Susan Matt Millen swing kids Nick here at the Dome and that's today even after the timeout are huddling up their offense they're going for it on fourth and goal from the 6 yeah I like this call I mean you can't let this game get away from here's another is another ah speed because if cook doesn't get tripped up he's 98 and out the gate because this guy can flatout fly they just tripped them all right there that's amazing look again for about the 21 yard line so Syracuse will start the third quarter with the football but Florida State will head to the locker room barring a turnover or some major change of momentum before halftime of the 24 to 6 lead at the very least and it looks like Florida State is content to take that lead to the locker room at halftime is they're in no rush a bird in this first half though Syracuse gained some confidence Syracuse should know that they can compete they they had every opportunity to capitalize on again close to another first down about a yard shy for those of you that are watching our broadcast that you've been experiencing some technical difficulties or apologies we had a satellite issue and see we are working as diligently as possible to try and clear up any issues and hopefully we will bring you an interruption free second half what do you know about satellite I know more than you think about that you said we what are you French my nickname with my buddies is yes cook all the way up to about the 38 yard line I wondered why you always says Strasse Richard Tavares to me I don't even know what that means holding 70 of the offense 10yard penalty remains are down penalty that in the end won't mean much Florida State's just trying to run out the first half so Jimbo Fisher brings a team in here with again that beehive surrounding Jameis Winston being restocked by a big expose in the new york times that was released last night that covers not only the issues with Jameis Winston but other members of the Florida State football program that have been apparently dealt with sympathetically and we set the accusation of the piece by law enforcement knowing that his quarterback is going to face a disciplinary hearing when he goes back to Tallahassee and through all of that once again Florida State puts it aside and performs very well on the football field and they've got a commanding lead at halftime of 24 to 6 let's go down to Quinn coach what has made the difference for your red zone defense I think we just playing we've worked on a lot of guys are really getting the leverage to the ball we need to do a better job in the field but that is key down there it keeps us in this football game offense we're scoring going great job depth for the one turnover but he's been suspended but we're playing great red zone there's a lot of heart we work on it how have you handled all the Syracuse blitzes has a play caller well I mean you got it you got to be very careful you got to run away you have cutters you got to leave with League blockers and you got to get the ball out quick out of their hands because they're doing a good job keeping things mixed up Seamus is 16 to 19 how would you best characterize his game I thought he's playing very well I didn't realize he was that but he is playing very well Thank You coach all right Quinn thanks very much 246 the lead for Jimbo Fisher's Knowles at halftime here at Syracuse time to head back to the studio reads when the guys are standing by with our Lexus halftime report Rison welcome back to ESPN's coverage of college football presented by cars.com welcome back to the ACCC on ESPN and welcome back to the Carrier Dome here at Syracuse were just about set for the start of the third quarter Florida State up twenty four six somewhat misleading babble Susan Matt Millen Quinn chesnic here Florida State did in the first half what a championship team does they didn't make mistakes they took advantage of their opportunity they got stops in the red zone but that leads up to many of the missed opportunities mr. akyüz had that this could be a much closer football game yeah football just like life is about opportunity and timing and they had plenty of opportunities that timing was perfect and they they missed both them so this was about miscue going in in the first quarter they throw the interception then dropped pass one drop pass to drop pass three they had opportunity to be able to continue drive and then pick the ball away and in the end with this fell it was in his hands Williams with a great defense the bottom line they had their opportunities they didn't take advantage of them four trips to the red zone for Syracuse they ran 15 total plays in the red zone only got themselves 11 yards threw an interception lost the possession on downs dropped two balls and as a result even the two for four that's misleading they were really over four in the red zone meaning no touchdowns only managed a couple of field goals and lost it all that they prove to themselves they can hang with the number one team in the country and so I have to tell you Florida State while they have 24 points on the board they have not been impressive they have not rush the passer very well they have not run the ball consistently very well I would expect the number one team in the country to be dominant and I'm not seeing that let's go down to quit they didn't respect us that's what Scott Shafer told us about last year's 59 23 drubbing in Tallahassee the goal for this second half turn respect he wants this Florida State team when they get on their plane tonight regardless of the score he wants them to have respect for his team well you can do that by being really physical ain't a long startin second half at quarterback for the army and on first down at the loss of sue as gulley is swallowed up by Featherston and Goldman Goldman had a great get off on the inside of that thing and he he won right off the snap when he's on when that guy when Goldman is playing tough inside when he's like this they're unstoppable then he's they need somebody on the outside to be able to do with Goldman's do it on the inside long gets to the edge low throw so as a result jarred West has to go down and make a sliding catch for a gain of about four sets up third down and at least six close to seven and you must be a pretty good team if you haven't got much of a pass rush Gavin run the ball that effectively you've made some mistakes you turn the ball over and you still find a way to lead twenty four to six yeah they and they haven't panic down the sideline stepping out of bounds was Ben Lewis so he wouldn't have even been able to have completed that catch had he come down with it and it's three downs and out to start the second half and West's hurt where checkers and Lewis desert Lewis has her rather beguiling Ramsey had great coverage great eye discipline and a great job of staying on that route the whole way forced amount of bounds with his body position that's the way you should play defense he was already well out of bounds and came down on his shoulder Rashad Greene backtracking the field opponent about the 16 yard line just across the 20 55 yard punt by Riley Dixon a 5 yard return and here comes Jameis Winston his first opportunity in the second half he's completed eight in a row it's now 19 straight games with at least one touchdown pass on his way to possibly starting off his Florida State career at 19 and OH as the starter and no matter how much controversy seems to swirl around Jameis Winston when he gets in between those white lines he performs great pretty good Mario Pender went out in the first half with an injury it can all Dalvin cook at tailback since and this will escrita Travis Troodon dodging tacklers for a gain of 13 you know when you're coming as a defender when you're coming down to make a tackle you have to have what's called leverage and you can't lose your leverage now watch these defenders they're going to be stopper right there too high he's up too high watch his angle too high it's going to allow them to come back underneath because what you have to be able to do is take away the inside and force him to go a different way that angered by the surfing defense the secondary brought that right at the line with the sure tackle by cam Lynch I enjoyed cam Lynch yesterday an opportunity to sit down and visit with him and what I what a great kid I mean smart kid he's sharp he knows what he has to be able to do I was getting on him about listen if I see you in there you start running up and starting to feel that block I'm going to talk bad about the Copa to the place you've got to be physical he just showed how he can do physical right there it followed up his idol Rennie Curran a middle linebacker foot foot high school and broke many of current records that Brooke would follow Wilson comes back to mr. catch a gain of about five Brandon reddish made the stop so it brings up third down for Florida State and so here's the down you have to win if you're Syracuse third down and six steering pressure on Jameis Winston are you trying to wake numbers I would try to play coverage on him right here because he's getting rid of the ball so quit the one thing about Jameis Winston that's really exceptional is his release he's got a he's got an outstanding release you talked about that watching him on film yesterday you brought up Dan Marino comparison that's pretty good Oh times o'leary for the first half and he breaks tackles in to Syracuse territory as the pass rush never came near Jameis Winston the protections been great for the Knowles today even when pressure comes and they did and you can see this look at this note nothing around him has a clear pocket now once you watch the difference in the throw right there once once he decides to throw the ball from cocked to gone is really fast that's a really nice a nice job of his release right there that's something you can't teach he's got it in spades play action throws it behind O'Leary who makes the onehanded catch two opportunities for Syracuse to make a play on defense and they missed them both Jameis Winston has some Ben Roethlisberger and I'm kind of John Elway he has a thing I called awkward athleticism he doesn't work this like the smoothest guy but he's able to do whatever he has to do to get away he'll make a jump cut you go at the jump cut but it's a kind of a slowmotion jump cut or like what you just saw there he's able to evade it make the throw 12 straight completion for Winston they stretch it with Dalvin cook look at the speed to the outside for the true freshman another Florida State first down when you're defending Florida State you have to defend the edge if you give up the edge they will find it quickly and Exploited Galvin cooks got great speed if you let him get that corner you're going to eat that's what he's going to do they did a nice job of blocking it nice job by Rudolph the receiver coming back inside they had already taken care of the defensive end cook about the 16yard line so this is the point right here in the game again they're down in the red zone this is the point where you got to have a little pride and this is where you've got to be physical you can't let them get the edge you have to fight to keep the edge you have to get pressure you don't have to you're not going to get run away on down here in coverage so the ball is going to come out pretty quick you got to be tighten your coverage saw Julian Wiggum there that seems to be the matchup that Jameis Winston and Florida State has tried to exploit they have gone after Julian Wiggum at least four or five times in this game so far and therefore shot green with Wiggum trying to track them where as Winston looking into the end zone and it's almost intercepted Brandon reddish jumps underneath three on coverage that time and almost picked it off it'll be third down but that's the second time in the game that Syracuse has dropped a potential interception yeah and reddish plays it perfectly the ball hangs a little bit too much and allows him to be able to undercut it he was open but the hand that ball needed to have a little bit more juice on it sets up this this third down expand rust coming they scream behind it there goes Rashad Greene making guys miss he's got the first step you know they do this very well they all you know opposing teams are going to say hey they blocking before the ball is thrown well what they do is they give you kind of a tunnel screen that's Tyrell Eskridge who's heard that's not good he's he's he's their communication center as well as a great a great head a great kid we met with him yesterday as well such a great young man to talk to talking about the difficulty of his upbringing being brought up in the projects in Central Miami and escaping and having a chance to not only become a football player here at Syracuse but he's got that six foot four safety bill but according to the Syracuse guys a lot of scouts gravitate towards because kind of that that new wave of secondary players made popular by the Seahawks those big rangy guys and he fits that mold well he has what you can't coach and he and there's some things that he does in his game that you can coach and he'll he'll continue to improve so while Eskridge comes off the field let's go back and take a look at why that last play work yeah and so what they're going to do is they're going to come inside out and they're going to set a wall in here they're going to take the outside guy and bring them back inside now I want you to watch when they start to block okay now he's blocking he's going down to block he's going down to block and they create a tunnel to come back underneath inside you use the only speed you have to use is your initial burst off the line of scrimmage coming back in once you get two yards of separation those blocks will give you the rest of the room to run cut drop down at the seventh it'll be second down and goal for Florida State John Raymond made the tackle again for Syracuse the 11th play of this Drive coming now for Florida State he talked about the missed opportunities for Syracuse would have been tough interception for Brandon reddish to make in the end zone that often times is the difference between the underdog hanging in the game and not he had a chance to make that he should him either play action Wednesday lobs it in the back of the endzone walking under it for another Florida State touchdown is Bobo Wilson 3rd passing touchdown of the game for Jameis Winston and Florida State extends their lead as usual has been the story all game long there's no pressure he's able to see the whole fielding just sold to an open spot it's not like that thing was a kind of lollipop you threw back there he'd get through it to a spot and let Wilson run under it and he basically cruised under it for the touchdown thirtyone six Florida State as Jameis Winston now has three touchdowns to go along with 242 yards passing 22 of 26 so far here at Syracuse not too bad me too beautiful day outside the Carrier Dome here at Syracuse the scoreboard though for the home team not so good 31 six number one Florida State looking like a championship team and let's take a look at our college football rankings brought to you by Allstate Florida State is in a familiar spot Matt Millen but the rest of the top ten talk about a shakeup last week when five of the top eight lost on the same day for the first time ever in the AP top ten and the big winners Arizona TCU Notre Dame Baylor we saw both Mississippi schools rocket up the board that's from the 5yard line Dyson gully on the kickoff return weave his way out for that the 13 gets tripped up close to the 35 Roberto loved Rio came down to make the stop and that you thought that Alabama was probably the big winner right of the losers I know that kind of sounds weird to say but with all of the other losing that went on around the Crimson side that probably didn't get hurt that much no they really didn't tend to the position to which they dropped is a position where they can certainly climb back in it that's that's the one that that to me in the only went down for to number seven they're going to continue to win and they're going to jump right back up into that top four slot now UCLA has a mustwin today they've got Oregon ceressus goes back to work northern Phillips a little shook and Juke got to about the 43 yard line for a gain of 9 if UCLA can find a way to be Oregon they might be able to get back at least into the conversation but that was a big drop for them and the Ducks both dropping by 10 spots yeah that's what those teams I guess because I have a month win today Oregon right here every time they cease right this is the time of season where they seem to be hurt all the time but then they can help you again at the end of the field but offensively in their offensive line they're they're not the same team but I'll tell you who is Marcus Mariota is really key out really good Veigar penalty remains second down he might get some protection help on that offensive line back today as he did not enjoy great pass protection last week no he did that even with that they had a chance to win that game and didn't but TCU that's that game today TCU Gary Patterson is really good that's a heck of a defensive minded coach Florida State the $4,000 is finally tracked down by PJ Williams 35yard game Prince Tyson gulley who talked about him early this is a good little Blair I want you to watch his vision that's that's well done using his that angle running against him he's got good vision he doesn't have great speed but he's got Cooke Street and he's got good power the average is just over 60 yards per game and he'll get another chance here finds a little cutback Lane and pull more he also averages about 6.3 yards for caring so once you get through that first level like you said he's a guy that can make you miss when he gets a little bit of space yeah he's he's got good vision and then they they bring in Amin Moore who's in right now and he's more of a power guy so he may have picked up the yard or Sue but now going to be third down at about four or five for Syracuse choose this circus offensive lines getting movement when they are getting a push up front to move this defensive line backward I I can't tell if I'm more impressed with Syracuse offensive line getting movement or not impressed with the defensive line of the Florida State not given more push zone mr. smilk is going to be pretty good long had nice protection but he still has to throw a dart but watch this nice pocket to be able to throw into and the ball is exactly where it has to be they still got on top of that coverage used his body well and the ball was exactly where it had to be for trips into the red zone in the first half no touchdown just before they get into the red zone they score from 22 yards out and Syracuse has their first touchdown of the game to make it 31 30 ESPN college football is brought to you by dr. pepper always oneofakind and Chevrolet find new roads the new house communication school offering programs and print broadcast journalism television film and photography and later on we'll feature some upandcoming photographers here at Syracuse and a piece we call through my lens and there's some beautiful pictures students that knew how to fake it will be able to feature later whenever you call a Syracuse game you always know that about twothirds of your contemporaries or colleagues are out there watching at the very least because they all went here octaves they said now you can also get to pay somebody off to get the broadcasting if you didn't go to Syracuse and when you talk to in the week before 6:00 we'll make sure you get to this place to eat it's tremendous Sherman Whitfield from the goalline bottled up and brought down about the 18 let's go back to the cues touchdown now I want to show you something that's that's really good okay this is called route discipline and this is on the outside and for a young receiver it's fantastic because he recognizes he is half the field but this sideline is his enemy so he can't be forced to the side so what he does is he forces himself back to the top and gives him some room to be able for that ball to come out on the outside and over the top that is a great job of running that route of making the defender stay on your inside shoulder and maintaining route discipline good news for Florida State fans that Mario Pender back in at tailback and they'll pick the cause on first down he'll find some Running Room the front 424 the 22 yard line for a gain of four and a half you know as I watch college football I like to watch high school football and I watch pro football the big difference that I see between this level and the next level is the ability to defend the edge and in college they don't defend the edge as well as you're looking at Eskridge and he's back in also which is good they don't defend the edge as well as we do it the next level and in a part of that experience and part of that you're just not physical but that's the way to take advantage of defense Winston underneath to O'Leary bumped out five Wiggum brings up third down okay here's an opportunity again this whole game has been about opportunities whether you're wasting them to take advantage of them Syracuse has an opportunity for gets the ball back right here this is a nice situation here at the fiveminute mark they've only gotten one third down stop so far Florida State is 4 for 5 on third down because they're going to big pressure against Cruz with the score where it is to take the pocket to the side and it's been complete galvan phil was all alone it was a blown Syracuse coverage but it looks as if it will be holding and I would think they're accused to decline the penalty decline at making putts and they get off the field Jimbo knows he wasted an opportunity to his wide open to climb foot that there's Dalvin cook you can look back inside and when he realized his blitz isn't coming now he gets into the route tree Jameis Winston gets out of the trouble but doesn't have the ability to be able to make that throw off the spin the first punt for Florida State and the orange defense gets the three an out right after the touchdown it's indeedy a kick to the sideline the forces of fair catch in about the 30yard line by richie 20 44yard months good field position for syracuse oh when we were third let's we do it every week with our crew we called through my lens we get a snapshot or two or more of the campus that we're at so through my lens through the eyes of the oven coming professional photographers here at Syracuse or thankful any Christopher Chase Gunjan Guzman di a sara Kinslow spencer bo Diaz and great shot back to the offense for Syracuse at their own 30 yard line coming off the touchdown and then a three and out gulley looking for a cutback and there's not much there Resnick Northrop ferries in after a gain of a yard Quinn kaznyk down on I don't know reenergize Syracuse I'd like you yeah for a team was two and three trailing by 18 points it's kind of bizarre this is about the most positive sign line I've seen so they've taken little moral victories here in the second half and kind of parlayed them into an overall pretty good buy but I think maybe they found a young quarterback as well well they have left a long out there off the touchdown pass he'll throw one out on the screen to gulley and gulley weaves his way to about the 36 and for those of you who might not know Quinn kensic was a twotime allamerican lacrosse player at Johns Hopkins big rivalry with Syracuse we are in lacrosse territory and q I understand that the fans especially the student section here as the Carrier Dome have been showing you the love it's definitely unique for me to come back to the dome let's just put it that way they they still love you know that's a huge rivalry Johns Hopkins in Syracuse and they let me know whatever come here yeah I think I heard aren't you quit kaznyk point responds yes I hate you I was yelled at point out of the student section as beautiful gulley at the 36 yard line and Syracuse will have to kick it away as PJ Williams came up and made the stop PJ Williams has played himself a pretty good game here he got beat in that last touchdown but his coverage was really outstanding got beat by a great throw but he has been very good in terms of coming up for the shorter routes and making plays like that all game long and the education of a young quarterback continues that's the last thing that Syracuse needed a three and out Dixon punts it away and they gave him ample space to be able to make that cat it just went right through his arms Bobo Wilson that sophomore couldn't hold on to the fair catch there's a freebie for Syracuse yes Lee they give him ample time now he gets he gets pushed back his own player gets pushed into him and that was I had to call an understanding team subsequently recovered by the kicking team it will be searching thought it looked like Sam Rogers on special teams for Florida state that allowed himself to be blocked right back into hey Suz Wilson old Sam Rogers the either state college kid all he does is snap does a good job wrestled in high school I saw yesterday we start messing with him I was like you were a lousy wrestler I'm a good snapper and yes you are and look like he was just trying to throw it away all to get it outofbounds and Nate Andrews picks it off what a turn for Florida State they drop the punt and get a take away on the very next play and I'm lamenting the throw because of the young player in all he needs to learn is you just kind of throw that into the stand I think he tried he may have coming across his body running the wrong way and getting hit as he lets go of the ball I think he was trying to throw it as far as he could just to get it out of bounds and couldn't reach the sideline yep Jameis Winston out to the edge flag down Travis Rudolph's got popped at about the 17 yard line Josh Kirkland made the tackle for Syracuse I'll have to check the penalty it looks like it's going to go against the Knowles Tyler hunter was blocking before that ball was even thrown and then continued to block them as all in a holding offense number one answer distance from the spot of the foul in the remains first down so arm and lane called for the penalty and look at the numbers cumulative Li that Jameis Winston has put up against Syracuse of course part of that a 59 to 3 win last year's dope and now here at the dome he could just as good out about the query check that that tender Marsh news Hodge major Scott no it is dumb and cook I'm so about the 10 yard line and it is kind of hard to see those numbers you know take a snapshot up these jerseys by the way they are illegal jerseys by rulebook standards and the ACC has told Florida State you can't wear these jerseys anymore because from a distance you just can't see those numbers a gold number on a white jersey and that is illegal as far as the rulebook is concerned so they have ordered new jerseys and the next time they're in the whites it will be a garnet number for the jersey numbers Lincoln as all day and now you stop the pocket the 15yard line in the secondary on opposite side of the field multiple penalty markers event if this is a flag down for a hit on Jameis Winston that's all that he was going into a slide it looked like he was a legitimate ball carrier tackled by a defender but flags were thrown in that area there was also a flag from the secondary so even if the officials opt to pick up the flag on the Winston hit most likely you're going to get a flag that's going to give Florida State an automatic first down nonetheless going to play we have live for unsportsmanlike valves against number one one of you fans to number three number 75 unsere 215 yards that's Wayne Williams against called for the 15yarder that will be enforced and an automatic first down for Florida State for what I mean once the flags blown and they make the ruling you're guilty I just want to see what the heck it is so 75 is who they had to call on again 75 defensively let's take a look at the head is he waiting will heavenly five Wayne Williams there's a hit and that's the extra that's the 15yarder that Winston was already on the ground Williams hit him after he was dead I guess that's the world the football we live in now he's waiting Williams to go over and apologize to that 30 yard line because that's what he hit and the Geneva Convention continues on both thought lines as Scott Shafer had a conference with the officials now Jimbo Fisher is having a conference with the officials sama Krrish I think literally just ran him on his workout for today is done he visited both laugh lines twice and now the ball is ready to be put back in play after a 15 yard foul and if you wanted that pick up a yard all right guys we annamund rolling Kentucky Wildcats fell behind 14 3 even they're dominating now watch this catch Mike gave us blue big blue indeed Davis one end that's all he needed in the classic now sports 42 in a row they're up 45 14 I'll Refik 31:13 Florida State over Syracuse here at the Carrier Dome and circus with their defense giving up a 15yard personal foul not able to get off the field they rushed forth here and they leave down them cut open and his speed Tipton on first down out of bounds just shy of the 40yard line that's about the third time that I've seen them be in a zone without a flat defender usually what that means is you're having some kind of three under coverage which let's see if it is yeah that's what it looks like they're trying to match they're trying to match on O'Leary and they put the defender there linebacker from the inside out you have to get to the flat that's a long way to go and that could open quite a bit today the design by Florida State to take advantage yes Winston down the block Stan Winston close it right down the chimney nice throw shot green got on top of the defender Wiggum may have been going after all day let's see what happens so he loses it right at the start so he his feet got messed up Rashad Greene got on top of him right away and that's the difference in the play and because of the time that he's afforded Liston makes nice rope and that puts Rashad Greene as you can see further up the track in Florida State history as a record holder in terms of alltime catches as Travis Rudolph is hit immediately by Brandon reddish that's the loss of a couple that'll probably pick us to the end of the third quarter but it continues to put a punctuation mark on what has been a spectacular career at Florida State for Rashad Greene he's not the most memorable wide receiver the Florida State's ever had he's not the flashiest guy just does his job averages 115 yards per game number one this year so far in the ACC in yards per game in receptions he's a terrific player and you know what's going to happen he's going to do the same thing at the next level he'll be consistent his whole career Jameis Winston get a lil earful from Jimbo Fisher as we head to the fourth quarter with Florida State in control here authority welcome back to Syracuse where it has been another day at the office for Jameis Winston 27 of 32 but Matt Millen look at the numbers underneath especially 0 to 15 yards he's been basically flawless yeah 25 of 27 underneath he's been getting rid of the ball relatively quick he keeps you honest every now and then but he's always so you only threw the ball past 50 yards five times that's it that's nine Miller's on table Susan the favored son of all Syracuse the cross fans when chesnic down on the sidelines and we start the fourth quarter with Jameis Winston in business again second and 13 but at the Serkis 30yard line heading to add to the lead so to double eagle it's seafood they may bring it try to avoid the pressure where even if that sign and goes down picks up about three but will be third down in ten and he's got to say the one of the Syracuse defenders after he goes down and the crowd reacts to that plus good coverage down the field it made him pull that ball back down a little bit of a little bit of extracurricular afterwards that happened right in front of Quintus Nick what was that I think Jameis didn't like the fact that he had his legs kind of twisted up when he stood up he took his hand to the back of the Syracuse players helmet and was tempted to do something he didn't but Jimbo saw it and coach Fisher got cutting James's face right away after that kind of a exchange after the tackle was made timeout now Syracuse will call the time take another look it's a 30second timeout that's Ron Thompson he's John with right there telling you make the tackle event he finishes up now he does roll with them and he doesn't like that it's not much there I mean that's certainly repeating like on either side if he maybe hit the 30yard line they to throw another flag maybe we should go back down to Quint and check the help of the 30yard line at the 30 yard lines okay I love it doubtful to return that's twice now the 30 yard lines been pummeled taking a look at some of the hits that Jameis Winston has taken today but no sacks and no real big negative plays on Winston by the Syracuse defense and when you're playing Florida State and you have an opportunity to hit it forget Jameis Winston if you have the opportunity to hit the quarterback you've got to beat him up third down and 10 get the Syracuse crowd credit they are still here in a 31:13 game and they're still trying to urge on their defense there comes the blips again and Winston well protected again finds O'Leary that has been all day long for Camus Winston and his Florida State on them gain of 20 you watch Nick O'Leary now look at the protection not he's going to get some there's late pressure but when you watch nickel Leary he's one of those guys who's just kind of he's kind of sneaky he doesn't run real fast he's not a real powerful guy but he's always open and he catches everything ten play the drive first and go breaking tackles is dogging it there's a touchdown for Florida State the camera nervin right there number 75 they want to get to the edge there's Irving with the block a nice cool bit of a hole Nicole Erie also is able to do his job a little beyond the previous play other trucks down is under further review yeah he's a get over the pylon don't forget that pylon is the edge of the goal line and that goes up straight up and the goal line goes around the world that's what I was told and so he has to just have any part of that ball break that it looked like he got his foot in and he forced the ball forward right there now this is that's not a great angle here but that's the you know that pylon goes straight up and this line goes around the world well again they ruled it a touchdown on the field probably a pretty crucial information boy on the field is too firm tuck down and it didn't take long and Florida State now a point after away from opening up a 38 13 lead 10 playing 92 yard touchdown drive after the interception Aglaia good again and Florida State looking like the number one team in America another trip right across that goal line for Florida State makes it 38 13 Knowles on top here at Syracuse Oh Florida State on their way to with six and Oh start a four no start in the league and celebrating its 10th year sponsoring the good hands field goal net all state makes contributions to participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kick since 2005 allstate has contributed more than 3.4 million dollars in scholarship funds Earvin Phillips on the day and let's head back to Rick all right guys get update on a couple games including George's complete beatdown of Missouri is Brendan Douglas one of his Hale bags didn't get around girlieman sized week from Brendan Douglas Nick Chubb 143 yards and a touchdown as well and Oklahoma Texas Red River Rivalry to my JP ride while cm to the end zone and the Sooners seem to have control on ABC 31:13 what a disappointing effort for Missouri Georgia finds out they've got no Todd Gurley with Austin Wilson back in at quarterback this Drive begins to 25 yard line for Syracuse you've got know Todd Gurley you go on the road that would have to be considered I would think Missouri kind of a statement game they don't play Alabama they don't play offer they don't play the Mississippi schools so they're going to find it tough to find more impressive wins and they have really dug themselves to hold at home over the middle broken up the third down and five in maty Mauk you know we had a chance to watch them earlier in the season daddy Mark's been a little bit inconsistent as you're looking at Wilson down so Austin Wilson the quarterback shaken up on that last play so that will bring AJ along right back in the game they got sandwiched and the shot to the head from Eddie Goldman seemed to be what shook them up so we'll step aside while the training staff takes a look at the sophomore austin wilson ESPN college football is presented by cars.com all Drive no drama and in part by Heineken open your world enjoy responsibly Sugar Ray Leonard Marvelous Marvin Hagler taking part in the International Boxing Hall of Fame induction long ago just outside of Syracuse is where you fund the International Boxing Hall of Fame I saw a couple of Philadelphia's own smokin Joe Frazier I love temperature I loves watching smoking Joe that was a son man to one it was the slow walk off the field for Austin Wilson we took a shot to the head so now AJ long in a quarterback third down and five they're thinking Wilson back to the locker room shovel pass resides in gully came back and picks up a first down I like Tully I got kids you can win with that kid I think he's got some he's got some strength for inside the tackles he's got enough speed to be able to get outside he's competitive he doesn't go down easy I just the first time I've seen him play and I like it screen I'm talking about black longdead the 41 yard line some extracurriculars afterwards Terrence Smith was there for Florida State they say long thought by government and he brought down for a lot ESPN would get an MVC doubleheader for you will start at six outlets football primetime presented by Hampton hotels number seven Alabama on the road big on the Razorbacks then at nine number three Ole Miss against number fourteen Texas A&amp;M both games also live on WatchESPN and about the test for both Mississippi schools today yeah I think that A&amp;M game ain't him at home that's gonna be a tough one for for Bo Wallace and his group there down the long six great closing throw by Adrian Fleming AJ long leaned into that throw and put a lot on it a third down conversion and a game of 17th that looked like an old heart monkey catch this is what he did very well and that is that's a phenomenal job of so concentration on the ball and on the back you know to stop on a dime like that hey there's art figure our monk right there Oh Washington Redskin and in New York jet that's right laid with art when I was with the skin we won the World Championship I mean more meaning more tribes this way for about nine that's a powerful kid there's some pieces to the puzzle here for Syracuse they've got some good young players they haven't quit they haven't packed it in at all which I like to see they just don't have enough bullet to the gun but there's there's some kids or who can play and that's the center John Miller down and injured and it looks like they're holding his left ankle and that's in that area where you might worry about a high ankle sprain and to the non athlete in the world high ankle sprain we don't really know what that means we're talking to you you said there are times where you'd rather have a broken leg than a high ankle sprain high ankle sprain is where the to the tibia fibia come together down in your lower lower part above your ankle actually and it's where they come together and it's wrapped in a tendon and it's splits and it doesn't swell up and you you can walk on it a little bit and I'm not saying that's what this is I don't know but I just but we here high ankle sprain sometimes I think fans are surprised how long that injure sometime age to play all painful and it's hard to heal because you don't get a lot of blood flow into that thing and and that was every time was it a high ankle yeah oh geez that's six seven weeks eight weeks Wow it's then a regular you know you get a regular lateral sprain on an ankle and you go again to three weeks you can shoot those things you can't shoot a high ankle sprain right and quinces down there you know you play the big boys and you pay the price to Syracuse staff was telling me earlier today that last last year yeah they lost fifty nine and three but it's worse than that they lost about three players for the next four or five weeks you hate to see the same thing happen here today with Austin Wilson done for the day with the head injury he had a lineman carted off they play wake farce next week it's a winnable game but how many guys would be healthy they've got it second down and one now is after a place John Miller at center here's AJ long wellprotected frozen over the man his own and he could young twirl this whole thing is made possible because he has time to throw and then long find us Mill cross the middle if this mill kids got something to them also pick another young flair for Syracuse that they can build with Cole Murphy who was a true freshman a preferred walkon was one the kicking job here for Syracuse out for the point after so ain't a long has now completed ten straight passes hebitch male with the clutch down and he used some strength to get himself in the end zone second pucks down here in the second half for AJ long through the air outside the first two touchdown passes for true freshman AJ long have both come in the second half against the number one team in America and Florida State as their lead cut to 18 by Syracuse time for our Aflac trivia question Aflac Roberto of oil went 5 for 5 last week field goal offense against Wake Forest who's the last FSU kicker to make five field goals in a game before last week we now ask kicker questions that's really trivial there's some great kicker lineage at Florida State I would think you would have an account on a house key would be an obvious guess so that you're sponsored percent raw gubin that would be an obvious gap Thank You spud Victor Herman Whitfield has to take a knee and let's go back to Reese merciful know we're going to have a little kicker talk here too after northwestern had driven 97 yards to tie the game against Minnesota Jalen Myron there is a loose gopher hundred yards for the score both of these teams unbeaten in the big a Big Ten West pardon me and his 24 17 Gophers have the lead under three minutes to play Reese thanks very much the moment reset we've got a loose gopher Matt Dillon got the chills that guy lives down the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania lose gopher is like your worst nightmare or a happy time when play get a loose one I'm going to find a way to get him Jameis Winston one left to collect enough good coverage that time on O'Leary by Cameron Lynch good coverage by Cameron Lynch you can see them on the inside out get your head turn around and as soon as the receiver when he looks you look and then you have to find his hands and that's what you defend your hand your inside arm should go to his hands as the Lynch did we had seen Mario tender back in the game good news for Florida State fans if you are unaware of his injury in the first half but it is Dalvin cook in that fell back now and boy does he have room to run perfectly blocked by the Knowles and there goes up to midfield and throw down out of bounds it will be marked out at the Florida State 48 yard line that's a gain of 23 more for Delvin hook on a show you something with Donnie Simmons number 51 okay right here see that stop right there see what ends up happening if you don't force this inside it's if you say okay I'm going to hold this you're going to get beat you got to force that down and if you don't force it it widens and it's just a massive lane to walk to run through if you thought Florida State would be in trouble without Carlos Williams stick again the middle of the cook he now has over 90 yards rushing to go along with hinders 46 yards rushing they've combined for two touchdowns and a yards per carry average at about five points too so it's nice when you're without a player like Carlos Williams and it's 16 career rushing touchdowns when you can go to the bullpen and find cook and green and Pender waiting Carlos Williams is a versatile guy I mean I just remember watching him and he was playing nickel he was playing on the set in the secondary and then they converted him to running back and he became their main guy he's a big guy has size has very good speed he's got great versatility Winston to the premarket attack for Sarah play Bobby Hart the right shackle tracks down the ball it was his man I think that got the pressure and the strip sack as Ron Thompson with great pressure on Jameis Winston but hard found the fumble they're going to watch on the outside you're going to get pressure the protection actually is pretty good then run it the pretension initially is good this is enough time to be able to make this throw but when he stumbles back ups and doubles back he strips it from the backside now right here you need to take that guy out I know he wants to get to the ball but he needs to he needed to actually get to him and allow for that ball to he may be gobbled up by one of your teammates so third down it's 21 with eight and a half minutes to go and they'll throw a screen out to the edge to travis Rudolph buried at the 40yard line brandon reddish the first man therefore sir q that's a heck of a play by Redis reddish he was getting blocked he worked off the blocker and then was still able to make the play you want to maintain the outside leverage to turn it back inside well he did that and took the receiver and threw him and then still made the tackle that's really well done okay son Beatty will punt and nice and gully is back at about the 20 yard line for Syracuse to try and get a return if he can play clock at 1:00 and they just get the snap off and it's a wobbly pick and gully hat so let it bounce and still not get off them feel football on the slide and an ugly punt turns into a big change of field position for Florida State 48 yard kick you back at Syracuse time now for the answer to our Aflac trivia question Aflac roberto a while when five four five on field goals last week against Wake Forest the last FSU kicker to make five field goals in a game before last week and Gary Sinise you against Miami sneaks in there in 2007 he did it twice Sebastian Janikowski did accomplish a he really thank you but still Matt Millen off by eight years which in my book is miserably wrong and it drops art deep concern fuse territory for the art but it starts well with AJ long right up the middle for a gain of twelve yeah that's that full make to admit the defense miserable right there using your feet that's the fastest way to frustrated defenses using the feet of that quarterback you can't account for him with your numbers I thought they should have been doing more of that earlier screen ha about the 30yard line later today on ABC or espn2 at 3:30 Eastern huge big 12 showdown and a top 10 showdown at that Bryce petty number 5 Baylor against number 9 TCU again we will have that one for you on either ABC or espn2 at 3:30 Eastern and the Baylor offense last week we saw them struggle mightily at times against Texas we'll see how they handle that defense for TCU today as Ronald Darby is injured on that last leg for Florida State to to defenses I thought that handled Bryce petty very well last year one was Oklahoma State and one was was the TCU and what they did was they took away the slot now last week we had them but we were anticipating that one of the things that Texas would be able to do it take the slots away and it turns out they they actually handled the pass game and they ran the ball out of almost 60 times but I thought I thought Gary Patterson's game plan a year ago was really really well executed and I think that's going to be a very good game so Darby helped off he's been slowed by hamstring high ankle problems had just really started to turn the corner help woz and now he gets hurt again gulley with a distinct right at the first down marker he is greeted by terraspin the nice tackle by smith gulley gulley had a little momentum going it was a very sudden stop watch it he got a drop his shoulder Smith that's a good hit he's a tackle machine he's number one in the ACC coming into today ten and a half tackles per game five more for Syracuse Nate Andrews came up and made the hit on gully as quickly we go back to Reese Bob Tech has really made a run at Oklahoma Lake Oklahoma one time up 31:13 it's 31 20 when Tyrone swoops goes in but the sooner has been able to control the ball convert first downs look at this they're going to hold off Texas 31:26 minute 12 to go read thanks very much so Oklahoma far from out of it as well a drop patch right at the first down marker brings up third down for Syracuse Josh Harris couldn't hold on and when you thought about the big 12 at the start of the season how surprised are you that things are now playing out the way that they were seemed like most thought that Oklahoma was going to be pretty prohibitive favorite in the league yeah I saw I actually liked PC you because I like their defense and Baylor and Baylor is always going to score points I think our proudest franchise find the ball and find the first down first I see Joey is a player that kid he's having a heck of a game but this kid's got a lot of game to him catch the ball well there's some juice on the fat from long good concentration on top of it that's he turned himself that kids done it he played a heck of a game here today he's caught the ball well he's run inside very well he's gotten outside with enough speed Prince Tyson gulley alright my book LaMarcus Brutus looked like he had a chance to jump the route and get an interception and now the officials may be saying that his knee was down as he turned to go up field knee down their ball in possession so it might be a first down look all about the receiver collect ball turned around and it's been hit the ground that ruling is under further review and I will take a look just to make sure that gulley indeed was down probably about 10 yards further back than where the ball is spotted now Syracuse is going to watch this game tape and they're going to say man we blew it we had an opportunity to make it a closer game now that doesn't mean that they would win the game that just means that it could have been closer but I do see that there are some guys growing up within this game and long is one of them it's a young quarterback and every every rep he gets is another dime in the bank man that's that's good for him but Prince Tyson gulley is a pretty good football player what about from a Florida State perspective have there been holes exposed today for Florida State or is this just a pretty solid overall performance on the road in the league maybe it seems like it's kind of been a workman like day for Florida State which it has been and you know they've protected very well they've run the ball when they wanted to Jameis Winston has been on defensively there that would be the writers name down at the 45 before will replace fair at the right hash please reset the game pack of 5 minutes 36 seconds and announce what got it down to this dear the location is fine will result in a first down there it is fresh set of downs for Syracuse at their own 45 but the defensive side there's a couple things one you can see that their back end they have a good cover people and they have good speed they can recover if they get beat there's good people there the linebackers they need work there and they don't have a pass rusher that's the biggest thing that you see for this Florida State defense I think Featherston is the one that they they believe and I believe just watching him he has some natural pass rushing skills to him but they don't generate much of a rush inside or outside without him Golden's a good friend longest out of the pocket you wonder how spoiled a Florida State fan is to come and look at the numbers they put up during this 21 game win streak they have scored 88 more touchdowns than their opponents they have won by an average of 32 points per game they've won 18 in a row against ACC competition they've won eight straight on the road in the league so when they have a game where they might not look like they are at their best it seems like they're at the best all the time they still throw up 40 points to 38 and that becomes a really service interception for Tyler hunter so the pressure got there and AJ long hit by Mario Edwards yeah and that's a nice job of swiping for the ball but he still had enough time to be able to make a throw what they couldn't do is they couldn't separate because the coverage was good and that's the difference in the play so it goes back over to Florida State just when you're that dominant during a 21 game win streak you wonder if your fans see you have just a little bit of a subpar performance this team sets quite a standard there goes Galvan cook cranking tackle to the 36 yard line on Monday night it's a tough divisional matchup Colin Kaepernick and the Niners but to extend their two game win streak against a tough defense that the Rams will bring forth Sunday Night Football ESPN a 15 Eastern no other night is Monday night that game also available live on WatchESPN we've got an injured Syracuse player looks like it's marques Hodge the Mike linebacker who is down back near the line of scrimmage and they're looking at his left ankle but what a day it's been for Dalvin cook over a hundred yards rushing 6.2 per carry he's got a touchdown and Mario Pender well he put up similar numbers before getting dinged in the first half well they're good in the run Department they've got they've got a good offensive line they have skilled running backs all three of them can do it and they've just be kept on feeding them and they've got a quarterback that when he plays at the top of his game as talented as anyone and obviously Jameis Winston very very efficient today you know it's funny though Matt I think of all of the people that we have analyzing college football at ESPN you're probably the only one that's been in that room in it that NFL room sitting around that conference table heading towards the draft talking about a prospect and if next year Jameis Winston comes out now how hard is it going to be for a team they'd be in the top ten to commit a draft choice so all that ability but everything else that seems to go along with them is a lot of baggage there yeah and you're going to really have to vet him out and you're going to have to you're gonna have to be very thorough get into the personality of the kid you know his decision because he has shown immaturity of a lot of different fronts and that's going to be the face of your franchise it needs to be it needs to be a professional it needs to be mature it needs to be making good decisions on and off the field all the time and he is the face of Florida State's football program he and Jimbo Fisher and there have been plenty of times where Jameis Winston has not made this Florida State football program very proud picks up a yard one thing he knows though he knows how to win yep here we go will he'll get his 19th today and so he'll be you know it's the best he's gonna time Greg McElroy for the longest win streak to begin a career and who will pick against him next week well that's probably the toughest test that they've got left I don't know that there's much other than Notre Dame that stands in the way of Florida State and an undefeated trip through the regular season a trip to the ACC championship game and a spot in the playoffs I say the one thing that though the same that's gonna be a great game it's down in Tallahassee and you know you will have it right here but the thing is what sets Jameis Winston apart this is released if he had time to have to deal Booker he'll do his cursory look to the Safety's at the vent he'll get right to where he's going to throw but once he decides to throw that ball goes from caught out of his hand in a hurry it's it's impressive could easy third down conversion or Rashad Greene and a nice throw on the run by Jameis Winston and now a 242 to go unless Turkey starts to spend their timeouts Florida State is closing in on victory formation here at the Carrier Dome so Jimbo before the game of my demo that you lost some weight I want to do his locker room eat a bunch of snacks there and of course I started to eat them but shocking look like please have some Jim Bowie goes solid sign of character they know he said he's out about 30 pounds I think he looks good I saw him in the spring and went down and watch their spring game and you can see the young players he was talking about from the spring they're coming to fruition right now he's talking about Galvan's Punk at the time and what he thought he'd be able to bring him some of these young receivers there are guys here who aren't even what they're going to be they're in the process of being developed speaking of receivers some pretty good ones going to play for Alabama when they take on Arkansas college football primetime presented by Hampton hotels and 7:00 then you saw number three Ole Miss number 14 Texas A&amp;M at nine it's a great SEC doubleheader that begins at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time and will take your right through the night on ESPN there's a name to listen for tonight laQuan Treadwell active is good all stark full start number 51 offense Vigo penalty remains second down and what's held up nicely for this Florida State offensive line today Ryan hopeful gets the started center his first career start but boy does he have a lot of experience on either side of him yeah and he's got some toughness on either side of it and when Irving just uh Josue Matthias trae Jackson Bobby Hart all of those players well over 30 starts each for their careers so that's got to be a pretty nice security blanket for a redshirt freshman getting his first start at center that Matthias that's a tough guy I like him bottled up with one minutes ago and there is beauteous big powerful man you know you quickie when you watch the tape you can see some guys that just have a little bit of an edge store guys who play with some emotions have a little bit of a mean streak I like to watch that and that's the way the games from the played I think that's what makea says he's from Jersey he's from Jersey what Eddie that makes the difference great Union City so he's right up off Route three they're not far from you I'm in New Jersey nobody's far from me now Florida State it's a 30second timeout Florida State lets the clock Wan down calls timeout before third down and 14 with 37 seconds to go and Jameis Winston in spite of what might be waiting for him when he gets back to Tallahassee and the controversy continues to swirl he played like the only thing he was thinking about today was football and every sheet of them and that's what he can control what he has his grip control he's in control when he's under center and between the line he sees the field he has a great release and can throw with touch Jameis Winston had himself an outstanding day here today didn't miss many that's for sure now almost equally as effective in the second half as he was in the first and the discipline to take all of those underneath throws that by design Syracuse not wanting to give up the big play even he didn't really make any big mistakes down the field had ones missed interception by Darrell Eskridge on a deep fall in the first half but not many other than that so he can spin it what he has to let's get in happiness to cheese a galvan cook brought down on third down and that will take us down inside of 30 seconds to go and assuming Syracuse does not call a timeout which it does not look like they will that will make it official and Jameis Winston and Jimbo Fisher will have a ride back to Tallahassee would get another win under their belt for and O in the ACC six and O to start the season and number one in America a game effort at times by Syracuse and they certainly had their opportunities in the first tab to make it a much different game but they miss those opportunities in the red zone a couple of crucial turnovers as is normally the story and it's a win for Timbo Fisher who's down there with you coach congratulations why was your red zone defense so effective in the first half I don't know they just they did a great job we prepared well down there those guys buckled down we would give them too many yards otherwise you know getting down there but they did a great job and we've worked on a lot they played well you said the goal this week to improve every week yeah where did your team improve today well we have to look at the film and save offense we were very efficient we had one turnover and we had a turnover on special teams which we don't need to have but you know defense when we gave up yard the skill play great red zone defense got a good job getting off the field and third down offense I thought we were pretty productive on the day we mixed the running Pass and we look at the film to see what we know exactly what the problems are or the good thing Jamis was 30 or 36 how do you best describe his ability kind of block out the distractions and a focus on focus he does and he understands he knows himself he knows circumstances of everything that's going on and he feels very comforted skin and what he's doing any doing and he's a much very mature guy that way to be able to at the heck of a quality congratulations so much thank you all right Quinn thanks very much so Jimbo Fisher it's been almost two calendar years since the in Florida State have had to deal with a loss 22 consecutive wins for the Seminoles 38 20 at times they made some mistakes at times they gave Syracuse some opportunities but Jameis Winston and Florida State win going away by 18 up next it's our college football scoreboard presented by honda so for Quinn castex Matt Millen and our entire crew will save so long from Syracuse New York as Florida State marches on
