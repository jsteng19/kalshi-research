============================================================

for Notre Dame a September filled with hope is fast becoming a November of discontent Charlie Weis in the Fighting Irish have three games left to write the season first up a tough Pittsburgh team that reflects the personality of a 10th coach and the city itself you are looking live at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh where Notre Dame will attempt to salvage its season beginning against the Pittsburgh team stocking a BCS bowl it is Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines well but charlie weis and a finding Irish never has so much been at stake and it will begin tonight their final three games on the road here before a recordbreaking crowd then home to Connecticut and finally onto the west coast to close the regular season not be easy here tonight welcome everybody but Kirk Herbstreit who flew in from TCU gameday had a great crowd down there I'm Brent Musburger thanks for dropping by despite all the negativity surrounding Charlie Weis in the Fighting Irish Kerby there are so many positive things starting with the quarterback Jimmy Clausen and I think Jimmy clausten's the key tonight not just his ability to make plays but his leadership when this team is facing so much adversity what great growth in the last couple years we've seen his accuracy has improved his pocket presence he's sitting in the pocket letting plays develop and again the maturity growing up on and off the field and I think tonight Jimmy Clausen has got to do a good job of leading this team getting all the distractions to the side and just putting this football team in a position to be able to execute and move the football down the field I think they have a great plan some vengeance after last week now Pitt is eight and one and heard what a lot of folks don't realize they have perhaps the best freshman running back in the country at Dion Lewis I know you and I are very excited to see a deep Dion Louis one of the top true freshmen not just running backs but any positions in the entire country and he doesn't with great vision like most backs but the thing that separates him is the combination of having great physical ability to run through tackles but also for his size once he gets through the tackles he's got to burst in that next gear to take it to the next level and be able to take it to the house Dion Lewis tonight has to establish the running game Notre Dame will crowd the line of scrimmage if Lewis can get established it sets up perfectly for what fit wants to do the Notre Dame which is planned to get the ball downfield is to oneonone match and it is a beautiful night for a football game Herbie let's bring in a bright young band from San Diego to light everybody up here is the band Switchfoot bring it on moments ago number 58 Brian Smith led the ivory shot and herby it was barking away he's out there leading this this team has had a tough week they're tired of hearing about it they want to get out of the field the receivers from Notre Dame Michael Floyd Golden Tate also involved so coming up tonight here at Heinz Field and an interesting coaching matchup tonight they actually opened their head coaching careers five years ago against each other and Charlie Weis one that night rather easily but since the beginning the first couple of years they have moved in opposite direction and here tonight coach Charlie Weis you can see that since those first two years with Brady Quinn as a signal callers 200500 now on the other side of the coin Dave Wannstedt has headed in exactly the opposite direction herby they are 17 and 5 coming off a 9 and 3 season a year ago so he has put together the kind of team you want built around a tough Pittsburgh defense he went through some growing pains as a head coach in his first couple years some some people were questioning whether or not he was the right man but he's weathered that storm you talked about the nine wins last year big bowl game and now this year sitting at 81 and still so much in front of him to have a spectacular 2009 season and the Panthers won the toss not the football David rougher soccer player who handles the kickoff for there he came out very early herby and just like a former soccer player he had his soccer shorts the long socks on is beautiful tonight folks is 58 degrees when you do that you gotta come out real early so none of your teammates see you karinsama is deep with break gram gram is the freshman and gram is the backup tailback he's behind Dion Lewis and he too is a very good talent about 30 Sadler is number five and away we go this will be the Sabbath Savio fielded around the 3rdeye and he's out around the 20yard line so what do we make a bill stole the senior quarterback I'm really impressed with Bill stole he is really put it all together his senior year he's had an upanddown career but look at the numbers this year seventeen and four after a year last year where he struggled in fact this year first series throws an interception against Youngstown State and gets booed off of the field it tells you how far he has come now completing 68 percent of his passes with 17 touchdowns and only the four interceptions so Dion Lewis number 28 he's the female behind stove and stones gonna put it up on first down fire complete to the left side and that is for a first down so right away Oh Derek Turner with the first catch of the game he's a senior from Teaneck New Jersey it gives you an idea what bill still likes to do he likes to get the football out of his hands very quickly Frank Cignetti the new offensive coordinator here with Pitt has worked so hard was stole to make quick decisions and get the football out and one of the advantages that Pitt feels they have in this game is attacking this Notre Dame secondary that has struggled most of the year 33 yard line after that 12 yard gain play fake again and stole on the roll hits him for a second completion busted tackle on the floor another they switched him back to the right side they're going to put it up early and often Irving this gives you an idea of how strong Dion Lewis is that's Kyle McCarthy the senior who leads the Notre Dame defense in tackles he's a very physical safety comes up and deep on Lewis just shakes him and gets upfield and picks up valuable yardage for the Panthers excuse me and I see how strong this young man can be second down and two and they will move number two Doran Dickerson around throughout the formation he's an hback fellow Stoke gets right back down on it so a little exchange problem there Herbie and it's still like the senior that he is run right down on the football it sets up a third down here bill still has a lot of weapons to work with Dion Lewis we've talked a lot about him the true freshman who's replaced LeSean McCoy Brett you touched on Dorn Dickerson number two and I think tonight they're going to try to exploit Notre Dame's defense in some oneonone matchups with number two and then also Jonathan Baldwin a true sophomore coaches feel that he could be eventually a firstround pick at 6'5 225 pounds his it nightmare four corners and for middle first down wide open is Jonathan Baldwin wide receiver he's a six foot five inch sophomore from Alec mapa watch bill Stahl come to his right he wanted thorne Dickerson but sits quickly he came off of him because of the coverage by McCarthy to in the background he's taken away by McCarthy it opened it up perfectly for Baldwin coming across the middle of the defense gives you an idea how far bill Stahl has come with his decision making and again decisive decisionmaking getting the ball out quick so Harvey Stoll has completed his first three for 34 yards hit marched into Irish territory at Dickerson stuffie through the formation and dropped that time so Turner who should have caught his second half so that I'd lets it slip away and it'll be second down and ten welp it being very aggressive on the attack and I need Frank Cignetti one of the top offensive coordinators in all the college football Pitt brought him in Matt Cavanaugh went back to the NFL and Cignetti came in and he has really instilled a great deal of confidence not only installed but its entire Panther offense so walls and gray are the two pointers they back away one day you see how quickly and decisively he hits the hole as gray comes up from his corner to make the stop he was my little bump and run and he quickly came over on run support quite a story this year and we're gonna see in a lot he's checking out here on this third down but wasn't highly decorated coming in not many schools offered him I think Temple may have offered him and maybe Miami of Ohio not a whole lot of offers but he is definitely shown America that he's deserving and fitting into this office who should third and six first o deflected incomplete and they will run it away that ball was deflected by curry Neal number 56 he's a junior from North Carolina heard it's a great job by Neal coming off the edge right there and he one thing is we always hear if you can't get to the quarterback make sure you can get a hand up to try to knock down a quick throw and that's exactly what the junior was able to do there so we'll get our first look at Golden Tate returning the punt Danny Hutchins back to punt it yards a punt not a great name for a Notre Dame football player Golden Tate and he's good under pressure down goes the punter as the penalty flag the punter went all the way down Hutchins Charlie not Saperstein no Charlie I'm sorry what a mistake earlier in the game when you're gonna get the ball on your 20yard line why would you try to yeah they came in you're right I mean this is where you usually go into a safe punt protection as far as what you're going to do with the return very careless there by Notre Dame bringing pressure they didn't even have a chance at setting up a return it's just a safe punt return I was Fleming number 45 Daria's for me coming through make contact with one of the protectors and down and now bill still and the Panthers have a first down herby at the 28yard I was just about to say after the way the Navy game went last week for Notre Dame what a big stop and now they give Pitt a second chance on offense and they come back with Dion Lewis picks up nine his first carry he is a five foot eight inch freshman from Albany New York nice drawl here it's set up because the play calling early was so much play action in so much pass you can see that the linebackers start to bail out it's zone pressure from John Tenuta the defensive coordinator created quite a seam there on the left side of the offensive line and Frank signifi upstairs recognizing what the Irish were going to do came with the perfect play call that time and in the second down and two and now for the first half Henry hi nosfy one of those unheralded football player and alltime Notre Dame fullback if you will you folks know exactly how I'm describing him as he picks up the first down it's so so much fun we see so many spread attempts when you get a chance to see these all benches usual fullback and a tight end they really try to utilize not just his ability to to run the football but they'll throw the ball quite a bit to him to him as well and the tight end you mentioned Doran Dickerson Nate by owner they'll be involved in his package a lot of weapons at the disposal of this quarterback as always it's right in the red zone as his dickerson and still looking and that was too far from the money back they get slippery Dion Lewis out of the backfield and he overthrew him there was a lot of confusion that time from Notre Dame's defense Brian Smith in the middle of the defense 58 you can see he starts to follow by um I think he needs to be out in the flat with the running back but there was a little bit of a different twist a different formation from Frank Cignetti and I think it created some confusion with the linebackers and Notre Dame catches a break there because bill stall couldn't find Louis would have walked into the end zone with the accurate throw far more successful Harvey on the right especially last week there's the draw play with militia he slipped and it was read well Brian Smith coming down the middle linebacker he's the junior from Overland Park Kansas for the Irish number 58 very very important part of this defense his defense is much maligned this year they have very well documented some of the struggles that they have had this year not just the game last week against Navy but it's been going on all year who's a 12 play of this Drive coming up now and it's a big one third down and stall steps away from the pressure throws in John high out of the back of the juggling as he went out of the end zone so they went back to Turner who has been a favorite target here in the early going of stove really good concentration but he's he is wobbling the ball as he goes to the back of the endzone about Sergio Brown gave a great effort to try to get over almost baiting Stahl to throw the football but there's no question despite the reaction from the fans here at Heinz Field he was definitely bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds so then he hooked ins onto attempted field goal 34 yard attempt for Hutchins certainly long enough and he has put the Panthers in the personal foul on the punt leads to three points Pittsburgh strikes first the great sports weekend this is in in Pittsburgh be penguins playing the other night here and of course tonight we've got notre tomorrow the defending world champion Pittsburgh Steelers playing the suddenly potent Cincinnati Bengals I mean you couldn't ask for a better weekend in a wonderful city that really really likes it sports teams just great fans here so here we go it'll kick it off now to Notre Dame the Irish trailing by a field goal back is ridic the freshman ridic but to step out to about the 20 heads a penalty flag I mean up behind the returned man so you know what that generally indicates Lego block in the back I don't turn team I'm at keep us uptodate on those games and here to be closer to the Irish the bad field position returnable Mongo Alan and that means a lot to the Irish ER tonight yeah no doubt seeing Armando Alan back in this lineup is very very important how about Jimmy Clausen the year that he has had for this Notre Dame offense last year he threw 17 interceptions this year 20 touchdowns and only three interceptions and two of those were on tip passes by his own players he's making consistent decisions and he's being a great leader for this Notre Dame office faces a second end form brings the end around tape looking for daylight he's got the first down when someone's hanging on to a leg like that and you're hit by the trailing the trailing man we've seen some fellows injured with that yeah it'd be interesting tonight one of their great weapons in this offense Kyle Rudolph is not playing and his sophomore out of Cincinnati we'll see how they adjust to that tonight Mike foregone will step in to play more of a physical style but also morph there's Kyle Rudolph right there for three wide receiver look with Michael Floyd eventually getting to the slide now on first in 10 against that tough front complete at the 41yard line he comes back to Golden Tate for 22 yards this is a great job of placing the football right where it has to be but the concentration by Golden Tate who I think you and I both agree is one of the top if not the top receiver in college football he and Jordan Shipley are pushing each other back and forth every single week former running back going up into the air in high pointing the football and the only reason we don't include Michael for it is because he was injured collarbone last week first down at 10:00 the game within the game if you will as far as tonight is concerned when the Irish have the ball some of your folks might want to keep an eye on the defensive front the Pittsburgh against the offensive line her bein break it down the tape I mean the Panthers defense apart bromius mistake Asst Williams sheared though so they very seldom blitz because of the pressure that these four can bring in the Irish so far but very good blocking that front there's a second down and four to set the screen against that Russia that is incomplete they dropped Alan on one way as you know every to slow that brush down is to drop in a screen time they're gonna throws screens early at this defensive line the strength of the pit defense they're also going to try to pound the football with Armando Allen try to wear them down then I think eventually you will see them get to that three receiver set where they try to expose Michael Floyd against the safeties that have struggled at times in past coverage but you're right Pitts strength is upfront they don't blitz a lot they rely on the front floor to get most of the work done with cut the pass rush erroneous break Roman right side of the defensive line he sets up an old basketball player charlie weis at Notre Dame with a third and four they burn an early time out here so while they talk it over we'll take a break and then come back with Pittsburgh leading Notre Dame but only by a field goal all Forbes Field where were you when Bill Mazeroski hit the home run and the first game was played there in 1909 against the Cubs and it comes beat the Pirates that's what a Cubs good player did you call that game I was a newspaperman I'll get you for that down Jimmy person I'll play with Allen for the first down nice rond good call he's got live legs tonight after sitting out last week with an ankle he right now is really showing that he is anxious to get back on his field and he's accelerating upfield and Charlie Weis doing a good job of mixing up his play calling nice crease their offensive line controlling things upfront I think for Notre Dame again so much negativity this is an important drive for them they had three turnovers last week they struggled in the red zone they want to get back on the field and have some a chance at success early in this game on first down they come back let's chicken down below and here's leash this office leash a nice night for you to be down there that's right I love this forever guys out but you're talking about Armando Alan that's that's an ankle that we actually broke three years ago in high school so that's why it took them a little while to get back into the action he told me that his Achilles was really bothering him during his rehab but he says it feels great right now I asked him about rust he said he just got back to the practice field on Tuesday but he says I think I'm feeling pretty good and I think I'm doing pretty well too we are sack Adana at 9:00 for custody hours down he goes getting it off as he was going down to the ground but throwing for a loss back at midfield and there is sheared number 97 Theo Riddick the freshman from New Jersey he caught the pass of all shared comes around with great I mean great speed off of the edge and that's what Notre Dame has to be able to account for tonight Brent do not both talking about the strength of this defensive line and you know interesting Dave wants that said in his first two years here at Penn he said they'd spent scholarships alone because it's so important for what system you take a look at it I'll tell what they're looking at whether or not Clausen was down before he threw the football it was close his knee the right of his knee may have been sure she was in was in on top of him definitely worth another look the ball is out there if that's when it made contact sure looks like it was close and what a great effort Clausen looked like he tried to throw it almost had to catch the ball right there I barely held on to the ball and then still this is a great look at it Wow that's a that's a tough call I don't know if you turn it over with with it being indisputable but yeah remember it was called a completion to midfield and still going to be third and long as it is it's a minus eight on the completion anyway the way they marked it junior quarterback with a decision to make when this season ends whether or not he comes back for a senior season at Notre Dame or I know Mel Kiper has moved him way up on his big board here's the call after further review the quarterbacks knee was down without a costume got the six yards on this sack so sheared is credited with a sack and a loss of 14 yards here for the Irish and that takes them way back in to the Notre Dame 44 yard you said a battle with him in a battle how about Shearer going up against Sam Young both are juniors both are from the quarter from Florida and competed against each other in high school the show nickel backers step into the gaps back out crush three draw play and that's certainly Charlie wife's got a lot of draw plays when he was the play caller for the New England Patriots they'll bring it back across midfield but it does force Notre Dame to pot anyway so that level field position here trailing only by a field goal that'd be very content to try and drive the Panthers back with Arik Mouse the senior partner from Roswell Georgia Aaron Smith is back beat number three for the Packers and signal for the fair catch at the 14 yard line so we'll take a break as we remind you you're watching Saturday Night Football from Pittsburgh on ABC first down and ten now for the Panthers who lead it and Bill stall Harvey started out perfect three of three he has missed his next four and he'll start inside the 15yard line play fake drop it off the Dickerson first catch of the night man structures for that first down toran dickerson in the way they're using him this year kind of a journeyman coming into this year but he has such tremendous athletic ability at 6:00 to 2:30 the new offensive coordinator freight Cignetti just tries to find unique ways to get him matched up against safeties and linebackers and because of his speed in size he's a very very tough matchup for safeties and linebackers to stay with him there were three players Pete Carroll came in to Pennsylvania to attempt to recruit that are playing for the Panthers tonight in Dickerson he wanted scholarship offer came from Pittsburgh and the assistant coach who spotted number 28 at Blair he kept on feei is too small we're not that interested in him but all along he wanted him this gives you an idea the vision here play is designed to go off to the right look at him recognized that the play to the right is not going to work cuts it back behind the big block by Nate by him and then accelerates again upfield good job there by this young back Theon Lewis you mentioned the second one the pink arrows initially they're made by a left tackle Jason Kingston was the third one all out there right now there's a handoff to Dion for that first down the first man bringing down even though he is only five eight he can benchpress 360 pounds folks he is a bowling ball with power when he comes edging he's got a low center of gravity and if you're gonna meet him headon you better be ready because he's not just a stat back he will run through you you mentioned his upper body strength he also has great strength in his legs allows him to go right through linebackers I think they really underestimate the power that he has strike back biased all incomplete Dickerson the intended receiver and Kyle McCarthy the free safety was chasing him this is no denial leading tackler and that's not always a good thing when your leading tackler is a safety yeah and one of the things that John Tenuta likes to do with his defense is get a safety up close to the line of scrimmage in Cowell McCarthy the senior out of Youngstown Cardinal Mooney is a guy that has not only great understanding of the defense but he's a great effort guy there's John Tenuta who's one of the top defensive coordinators of college football this year his defense really struggling second out of 10 and there's the pitch to Lewis nice to get the education not much there pretty good by Sergio Brown the senior from Maywood Illinois just outside of Chicago now this defense has we talked throughout this this broadcast so far as its it's struggled this year mainly against a pass you know they're allowing 14 yards for completion and they've given up 38 pass plays of 20 yards or more which is a hundred and fifteen thin a nation so needless to say defending the pass and not getting much of a pass rush has been a big problem this year for the Irish stole from the shotgun puts it back to the left side and Cedric McGee the captain he's a senior from Fort Lauderdale Florida and Michael Irvin is his uncle so he makes his first catch of the night that time the Notre Dame front did get pressure they brought a little bit of zone pressure which means the linebackers bring them pressure and they'll drop a defensive lineman just trying to create some confusion on the offensive line and they'd want stats punch unable to pick up the pressure his bill still had to move out of there and try to buy it a little bit extra time Danny Hutchins back to punt loosening up is back deep here's this ground there for a couple of feet sure here we have a minute in the first quarter three nothing safety in divided there is their Wildcat and that's why tape was not back to return to run the Wildcat right away ready for it his big number and 97 who came right in on him as sheered made the stuff ball cheers quickness right now a little bit too much for Sam young the right tackle him to handle keep an eye on that matchup I talked about how they played against each other in high school this Pitt defense number one in the country with 39 sacks and 10th in tackles for a loss amazing for a defense that does not wits very much but ridding the runningback to the right side of the formation the defensive line that we have been talking about in raving about here they are there are the tackles for a loss and their sacks not a weak one and the bunch folks make that all black play come to the end of the first quarter the Panthers racing to the other end that is Mickey Williams leading the way this presentation to Saturday Night Football for Jenna by South West Airlines returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations respected secular views of Pittsburgh drive up Mount Washington at night sit down one of those fine restaurants and look down on a city that transformed itself like no other in this country just beautiful views from up above and right now they're Panthers lead by a field goal and the Wildcat formation losing three yards that time and it is a third and 16 from the seven yard line Jimmy Clausen the Irish struggling with field against the Packers from the endzone now Clausen fires out to Armando Allen well short of the first down marker and they're going to be forced to punt it again as Cara Jane makes the stop that's exactly what Pitt wants to do in first and second down try to get penetration and dominate Notre Dame's offensive line with that defensive line and then get into third down and long and be able to play zone and keep everything in front of you declining the penalty fourth down bring about a punt anyway Eric Foust and here is Erin Smith ready to give the Panthers good field position here he's standing that the Panthers 39 shortcut their work would happen field on the second level of the ramp area that leads up to the upper levels and I'm up here with bill stalls parents bill and Debbie stole now why they are up here watching from this has been booed by the fans here in Pittsburgh and get this he is a Pittsburgh native so his parents have chosen because they don't like to hear on the bullying they have chosen not to sit in your seats during the game but to watch from up here and guys again it's not like biggest one mate they are eight one and they're still boiling the guy who is from Pittsburgh this is a tough town it's also tough to be a parent of a quarterback for a big time program but Lisa that's like a different County I mean that's one thing to remove yourself from the the catcalls from the fans and you might as well be at home on it watching about TV mercy that was a break Ram the ball carrier and it leaves stole and the Panthers with a second and eight and still puts it up goes deep dickerson wrong side little bit confusion between receiver and quarterback at that time and still took a buidling I didn't keeping getting out of the from underneath to Center it was a bit of a struggle that time and I think it disrupted his timing and rhythm of what he was trying to do and also Notre Dame did a good job of getting pressure on him but that's the matchup that they want Doran Dickerson matched up against the safety and at that time he had him open just not able to find him and now still will the timeout is coming over to the sidelines facing a 3rd and 8th that is their first time out the Irish burned one a little bit earlier so let us take a break beautiful I can't believe it's November and the weather is this nice in Pittsburgh the top 30 players of the last 30 years 12 trailing by 1 with 8 seconds left in in field goal range vs. top ranked Texas Texas Tech instead chose to let me see the Michael Crabtree decide the outcome follow the tough that we countdown awesome are brought to you by Buffalo Wild Wings well Texas had come from 16 points down in that classic down in Lubbock and then the Red Raiders pulled it out what a great game that was now see play number 11 revealed next Saturday at 3:30 p.m. Eastern here's a third and eight for the Panthers and install still fires for outstanding defense that time by Darren walls the senior from right here in Pittsburgh made a fine play walls does a good job of coming up late I think ketch Baldwin off guard he's just trailing him gets his eyes back and then I think he gets his left hand in there to disrupt a timing between Baldwin and his quarterback stall stall did a good job of buying time stepping up the boy how about Darren walls that time Golden Tate backed in return this hutchins Potter crowd quiets the waiting for the Lawson's to take role in here each other thank you they were pulling for South Carolina Tefila dogs against the Gators today and Columbia South Carolina and so they are still unbeaten 10 now for Jimmy Clausen the freshman running back as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary here this evening in Pittsburgh and the numbers look like that and you've not seen a lot at this point from Notre Dame's offense they've been fairly conservative and Vennela try and think wearing down trying to wear down the pit defensive line it's not working out for them I think eventually you're going to see Jimmy Clausen and this offense have to air it out and attack the Pitt safeties something that it's been a problem for him defending the pass Kirby their average starting suspended yeah they just haven't had any field position on this get him as he picks up the first down with Golden Tate looking at Pitts defense they've played well the last five or six weeks but early in the year past coverage against North Carolina State is an issue for them some other games early in the year where they struggled again with their safeties they've made some adjustments jerod Holly's on the field at former corner who's now a safety number 18 but that's the area that has it most concerned being able to deal with tape and Floyd is how they hold up on the back end watson is forced to hurry up and it is incomplete the bomb burger a senior from Cincinnati one of the tight ends filling in for Rudolph here tonight Gus loosed a kiss right in the middle of the defense has a quick first step and he gets right by the interior of the Notre Dame offensive line goes right by him Sam young the right tech was trying to step down to help Trevor Robinson but it gives you an idea of how quick mistake is is and that's one way to help out give pass coverage is good pressure her biggest steak is actually played in that game five years ago Wanstead and wife squared off he was redshirt a couple years years back with the sea near possums deep truckball two defenders intercepted the 30yard line by Jared Hawley the redshirt freshman from Easton Pennsylvania we just we just lost about how Notre Dame's going to try to test Holly in this secondary if they get time to throw four Clausen locks entwisted wind up in the air just hoping the Michael Floyd will get underneath it and a great job by Holly is tracking Floyd and the last second cutting in front of him to take the football away from Michael Troy that's exactly what Phil Bennett wants to see and that's why Jarrod Holly is in this starting lineup the skills of a cornerback playing safety pay off for a big time there so Holly makes the interception and DiCicco made sure that the receiver did not bad snaps thumb will go down on it that's twice he's had to recover problems with the senator the first one was an exchange under center this one a little bit different yeah there's been a few times you're right friend not just the the snap just do it a little bit about out of rhythm here early after the first drive this is pit offense and they become their own worst enemy makes it pretty hard to execute when you're facing a second 22 mike shanahan look wide receiver out to the light of the formation run the draw apply against it to the 20yard line Terry Neil making the stop again and Dion Lewis now has carried seven times for 32 yards against the Irish he's got a string 100yard rushing games working for him and he has 32 here in the first half now they bring said rating would be off the sidelines and let's see if they to protect her Highness key alongside stone techno but loss and complete the Dickinson did you see hai now ski knocked the helmet off the Irish defensive player he is picking it up right now and trotting back that's big Ethan Johnson 6 for 280 pounds and you want to see a textbook fullback how about high not ski you're right stepping in look at you see number 90 hello Johnson works to the outside and him i na ski comes pretty hot they've been 13 feet fence made some adjustments a man would relish that fork dominate I black to match the hit as a whole school we got an old school score working right now two three now faded there's Goodman back into come on let's get it on let's start punching it out that's it you recognize it that's Primanti Brothers you saw the potatoes and the coleslaw right under that's the way they did it the trucker's back in the thirties used to come by they didn't have enough time to sit down and eat so Joe from a nice in here let's put it all together and that's how that sandwich was born or so the legend goes its Darby wants one send one on up to the booth I would love that it might take me to the end of the game need first down and ten now for Thompson faking and gonna throw back to the swing man if Michael Floyd I believe that's the first catch of the evening for Michael Floyd and he's a bigtime receiver Bojan Chappell its chatting away floyd last week first game back after the broken collarbone 10 catches 141 yards and a touchdown and they kept him on mainly on the right side and talking to Charlie Weis this week he said you know he's been through a game he's been hit now we're gonna move him around quite a bit there's number three going over to the the Irish sideline it's got to make plays he and Golden Tate of the key tonight they've got to be able to make plays oneonone against this Pitt secondary if they have time to throw right now Pitts T line putting too much pressure on Jimmy Clausen Armando Allen started the game remember he's coming off an angry and he rushed five times for 30 yards for Coach wise he comes back into the lineup right now so on this first and 10 number five will be in Boston's backfield see Floyd now is it to slide he's not been in this slot all year trying something a little bit different with Kyle Rudolph out they put him in a slot to try to help him in the passing game too deep on the safeties and they and he picks up the first down at the 41yard his best run of the night it's a good job here on first intent of setting it up and a good job of Rennick the freshman picking up a block here on a linebacker that ends up setting Allen free but that nice job by theoretically known with his ability to run the football that time taking max cruder out of the play and allowed Allen to get upfield pick up a block open the way for a 15 yard gain and a first down and ten were honorable fake tried to buy time drops into a land underneath trying to set a screen against that front Gregg Williams the sophomore from Naples Florida makes a fine tech applause is trying to get fit and aggressive defense off balance by faking the screen to the left but he takes so long and it takes so long to develop that gives Gregg Williams plenty of time to read it and he read it so quickly he stepped right in front of Trevor Robinson alignment trying to get out in front of the back good job I'm Williams with his reaction that time but the play just took a little bit too much time Tait and Florida both off to the left side of the formation Thompson's looking left well short of the first down Reuter max brooder was all over Armando Allen this is a fine front 7 pair Harvey they are dominant in the defensive line and right now clearly winning the matchup upfront Dave Wannstedt has to be proud of what this groups been able to do because that was the big matchup you said in the beginning of the game the game within the game hit a team that doesn't want a glitz out with their front four do against an improved Notre Dame offensive line especially in pass protection and right now our quarter and a half in advantage to Pitt Elisha feels the Nickelback checks in that might before but caution comes back for a first down and Kamara Duval kymaro he was lined up on the opposite side of Tate and Floyd that time he drew single coverage this is the area that I think closet has improved the most as much as he's been hassled tonight he sits in the pocket throws the football before Kamara even has a chance to turn out that might be just one throw right there they could get Jimmy Clausen and it's offense going and get him in the rhythm a big third down conversion and a good job by crossing and sitting in that pocket and making a throw flashing from Westlake Village California the junior hands it off brought down by gun and Gruder two of the linebacker charlie weis telling us this week or a few areas that he's been really impressed with Jimmy Clausen this year pocket presents in the past he had a tendency to want to bail out and after his freshman year when they gave up over 50 cents I don't mind him thinking about bailing out but he's not forced into football downfield he's making much better decisions this year with the football and showing patience and tonight he's able to settle down it's another example of that second ma beautifully by Aaron Barry the senior from Harrisburg Pennsylvania and this is a corner that you can roll with he is a good one watch him go to work here and Brett Barry and the rest of this secondary right now is not respecting the deep ball threat from the Notre Dame wide receivers they told us this week that most of Notre Dame's big plays deployed and Kate Rudolph had been after a short catch they make a defender miss and then they get upfield I don't think they feel threatened downfield there so they're sitting on the shorter routes full receivers they spread the field on the Ronson steps up in the pocket still looking downfield now he's gonna and he is short of the first down that is going to bring up a fourth down and we'll see if Weiss goes for the time field goal here comes the kicking unit on the field Nik couch the freshman kicker from Plano Texas comes out the putter Eric Mouse is the holder for the Irish and let's check that a minute that's David rougher the kickoff man because a 42 yarder they're going to use rougher he's got the longer leg and he puts it through so rougher why is the game 540 to go here in the opening half so last week against Navy after kicking 14 consecutive field goals nicked ouch missed two against the Naval Academy in here tonight David rougher comes on and kicks his first field goal for the Irish a 42 yarder the of course has been handling kickoffs and he'll kick this one away as we are deadlocked at three coming down toward the 5:30 mark of the first half Sadler and Graham are back deep for Pitt 20 yards a battle a field goals a test of wills tonight in Pittsburgh all right it's time for herpes Aflac trivia question it's a layup who has the most rusher arch in a single game against Notre Dame the clock is ticking all right mr. Herbstreit is a lock for this one don't give it away okay I always has obviously something to do with why we're here I would think guessing in mid70s Danny's on the money the odd the other was fine freshman running back is tripped up do you think about the special teams and changing the kicker the special teams coach for Notre Dame is Brian polian and he is the son of the fine general manager of the Indianapolis Colts billfold Brian told me before the game that he won't be able to make it tomorrow to see the Indianapolis New England showdown but he said at our staff meeting on Monday if the Colts win and we win I'm showing up in Colt regalia across the 40 to the 36 yard line there's your guy the big fullback Henry hi nasty leading the way gets a big block that time on the linebacker Te'o and then all you have to do is give the young freshman Luis just a little bit of a crease there's the block and once you give him some room to run you can see what he can do in the open field and it's about time they get Dion Lewis the football to try to get this offense back and rhythm I was giving him too much it was coming out the other way to the 43 on that 21 yard game but that was a that was a fine fine run by Luis who now is 55 yards and they come back with him and he gives away a couple coming up of course on the capital one halftime report John and Jesse will have all the day's big highlights the Ohio State Buckeyes are headed to the Rose Bowl and believe it or not it will be the first Rose Bowl that Jim Tressel has ever coached the Buckeyes it now certainly has been the BCS championship game for the Buckeyes he's been to all the other polls but he has never yet coached in the Rose Bowl that is about to end and meanwhile who will he play Arizona leads Cal ten nine in the third quarter and Arizona very much alive still under pressure slips away and he is down at the 43 yard lines will be about third and ten coming up now first all and the Panthers well I tell you John Tenuta doing a great job right now mixing up the looks and getting creative with how they're trying to get pressure they're just not good enough to line up and give pressure on Pitt and bill stole they have to twist a defensive lineman they have to bring pressure by bringing linebackers and Tenuta right now dialing it up making some good adjustments and trying to bring heat to try to get bill stall and Dion Lewis out of rhythm here and they've been very successful big third down time for stole fires coming late for the first down to the 35 yard line Jonathan Baldwin number 82 out of Aliquippa which of the same high school as Mike Ditka Darrelle Revis Ty Law about the job here up hitting the ball over top of the linebacker this is something that they work very hard on is it's a fro they'd have to be able to clear the linebacker Brian Smith when you have a receiver at 6'5 who can jump like that minute makes a little bit easier to just float it across the middle of the defense big time prospects 522 yards Jonathan Baldwin takes it to the bank Hutchins on to the extra point and it's 10 336 yard touchdown bill stone Jonathan Baldwin the Panthers lead brent take it as corner isolated but too tight in here Byam gets down the middle of the field which occupies the safety and then it's just a oneonone matchup here on the outside good job of protection look at the tight end buy them take McCarthy out of the play and then it's a oneonone matchup to the outside and it's the first time tonight that hits had a chance to get Baldwin isolated oneonone with Darren walls when Stahl has had time to throw it was a perfect throw and maybe even a better catch his Baldwin lays out and we finally get a touchdown here in his den so tooted the Bears this shit's been for Berkeley Cal 15 Arizona 10 so here's the 30 okay or me give us the answer now who has the most rush yards in a single game against Notre Dame 303 between Curtis Martin and Tony Dorsett I'm gonna say Tony Dorsett has to be the answer where would you start it out obviously oh no don't go all right he broke the alltime rushing record when he was here at Pitt whose record did he break Alzheimer's is a bonus for Herbie all time austin held the alltime rushing record until that man right there broken first time in ten fossum shakin free coming in underneath and here is tape for the first day and here we are with Clawson on first down and ten the fleet again that's Robbie no Paris little bit too low I thought maybe he had it but it was incomplete come back time's up it's got to be arch parts right of course Griffin when you kind of hesitated Darren's know are you sure I've got all the Griffins I agree more MRIs we were gonna really be down on you if you didn't get the bump what a big day today for Ohio State great effort by Kirk Ferentz and Ibaka three touchdown underdog I don't think so yeah I had that too good drink coach know if it was a great job getting a job as a young man he played pretty well then he played very well in the big kickoff return by Darrell Johnson Cooley honest was big a neck here's Paris laying out think up here you thought it was a kitchen that's a nice look yeah it's definitely dad from from this angle up here I did think he was taking it down and as you can see he lost it no no totally be upheld as uh as it as an incompletion waiting for the review down the booth you know you know different games are that we do Herbie and I can't help but think about last week Cincinnati and Connecticut were going up and down the field okay it was like we were to a college game last week and Arena League game broke out here tonight oldfashioned football this is old school kind of gone back and forth last week like you're gonna get ready for college hoops season coming up then you're right different style football and everybody looks and they see scores and they just think the teams like this can't play with the big boys because they don't put up points but they put they're playing good defense tonight offenses and struggling to get it going but both defenses are playing pretty well second down for way too high for tape then take took a shot from Barry as the ball was up over his head and I think Claussen must have thought he was going a bit deeper on that pattern yeah either that or the ball may have slipped out of his hands you don't see Jimmy Clausen throwing a football and misses his receiver by that much very often but it finds himself in familiar territory again tonight third down and Klassen it's good protection this time but his receivers it covered so he has to throw it away terrific coverage in the secondary by the Panthers and they're barking down there offensive lineman and McWilliams great coverage downfield normando Allen's the outlet right there and look at the good job that max cruder doesn't taking him away and it gives Jimmy Clausen nobody can throw the football to so good coverage downfield they only rushed three dropped eight Clausen had nowhere to go with the football as Aaron Smith he'll return berrak Mouse hunt big edge on that hunting game to Pittsburgh what do you think overall her every game being played at Pittsburgh's pace keep it at lowscoring yeah this is what they want to do this was a game where you remember you got Notre Dame coming into this game on the ropes to begin with the biggest thing that Dave Wannstedt wanted to do tonight would start fast no matter what the tempo of the game is they wanted to be able to take the lead and see if they could take control of things and continue to make Notre Dame have to struggle to get their own offense and Old Continent what he going deflected off the Blitz that is an incomplete pass it was not a lateral as Harrison Smith the junior from Knoxville was coming I love Harrison Smith he's moved back and forth from safety up to Sam linebacker they've got him playing there again this year after playing safety early and I think he just said he's that kind of guy that you can really win a lot of football games with he's tremendous athletic ability at six to in about 210 pounds in that time eyeing the quarterback all the way almost came up with a big interception there's the draw play Louis works out of balance on that far side picked up six yards we've talked so much about Dion Lewis tonight the true freshman but the true freshman on the other side number five manti te'o who's that time chasing him out of bounds we've not called his number very often tonight but since he's been inserted to start for this defense coming in with his much hype as any quarterback or any tailback in the country Manti Te'o is is the real deal living up to the hype and playing very good football this year for the Fighting Irish defense still short drop right over the middle for the first time went to one of those tribes named by the senior from Franklin Pennsylvania they were double tight Maya moves in the Irish territory six for about 265 pounds you can see how they're just attacking the underneath zone trying to make those Notre Dame linebackers pick a spot and there's just too many receivers that he finds the open man at the 38 yard line Stahl again and complete through a little bit behind McGee that time he was reaching back for the pass he didn't lead him enough plenty of time here was about a minute to go and a couple timeouts to still to to be able to use for Bill Stahl bill Stahl I think is this is an area again that he's improved probably the most is the command of the offense with the first year of offensive coordinator from Frank Cignetti has a real good feel for what he wants to do in communicating with Cignetti he's become an extension out in the field like most great quarterbacks will do still short of the first anime you took what you want to see Pitt trying to do is definitely get within fuel goal range but still be willing to take a shot or two either to number two Dorn Dickerson or as we saw earlier Jonathan Baldwin 82 they get them isolated one on one eighty two and two can score in a hurry so try to get into the field goal range first and foremost and then with that time and the two timeouts don't be afraid to take a shot downfield and they're so dangerous on a third and three nothing at 55 seconds here but they've got Dion Lewis in that backfield now they split him out along with the wide receivers because again they're inside of a minute and stole will drop it to five Kenny had his receiver in underneath that was Mike Shanahan and it's a little bit too high and Manti Te'o the crowd interesting urging them to go for it here the time is 51 seconds left what fourth and three with the way your defense has been playing if you don't make it you give Notre Dame the football at the 37 yard line with a couple of cracks yeah your cluster could get one of his wide receivers deep on you so fundamentally sound football crowd never likes this fourth down they need three remember and Hutchins angles had toward the sideline and it'll be picked up on the bounce inside the five yard line by Golden Tate 39 seconds to go and first down at ten Artie yeah he was in a garage for about 90 minutes before he got back down to the track the sheetmetal guys were usually the cooker but nice pickup by you know first time in 10g Irish content to hand it off here and just bring the the final second stamp so here's a highpowered Notre Dame offense okay that's the strong part of this unit and they've had to settle for only a field goal here in the first afternoon and I think we need to give not only Dave Wannstedt with film in it and its entire defensive line all the credit they have put a lot of pressure on Jimmy Clausen and I think that's been a difference in the first half let's go to Lisa your team this week how do you think your team's responded in that person well I thought the defense played really solid I mean they gave that one home run up to the Baldwin and made a nice play on it right there but then the defense put us in a position here with a chance to win a game now what offensive adjustments do you need to make a second they're getting a lot of pressure on us right now so we got a slow slow them down you know we're running the ball we're running a ball okay but we're getting a little bit too much pressure in the past game we welcome you back to Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines the Pitt Panthers leading the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame 10 to 3 here as we get ready to start the second half everything take a look at our Southwest Airlines playbook Jimmy Clausen has not found very much time to throw the football I came into tonight engineering an offense that was number six in the country in total offense but they just did not been able to find their rhythm in the first half so the pressure but it fit defense for the story but in a big play by Jonathan Baldwin where he laid out and made a nice play to be able to give us our only touchdown a bill stole made a great throw Oh wag down the pressbox told me that Notre Dame solved its red zone problem tonight they haven't been in it yet that's one way to look at it after last week when they turn the football over three times two of six in a red zone but tonight we're gonna see the adjustments that Charlie Weis is going to be able to make here he mentioned to Lisa walking off it before they got to do something to slow down to fit defensive line shielded about a yard deep taken a knee and we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary and we're gonna compare thee two quarterbacks for you here Jimmy Clausen and Bill Stoll you can see there's the passing yard big advantage for Stoll because of the pressure on Clausen and there's the touchdowns plus the interceptions and both have been on the ground about the same number of times Jimmy Clausen is gonna have to be able to get something out of the running game from Armando Allen to be able to slow down that defensive line you have to make them respect that aspect of the game or can also try to get the ball out a lot quicker you got to do something to offset that speed up front again it's a fourman rush you can see how they sit down there defensively very seldom do they have the Blitz and here comes a running play on the first play of the second hand mando Allen and Adam Gunn the middle linebacker there along with Chappelle the cornerback just to review for people it's very unusual in this day and age in college football to see a defense relies strictly on their front four to be able to give pressure not only on a quarterback when he drops back to throw but also they try to defend the run with just a defensive line and linebackers and put their secondary phenomenally in zone coverage to avoid giving up the big play you saw romance sheer and stickers and battles for our first now good tough run so they open up with two running plays that's exactly what you want to see if you're a Notre Dame fan we just talked about it before they came out here on offense Charlie White's one of the ways to attack Pitt is to be able to get this offensive line coming off for the line of scrimmage being able to establish that running game takes some of the pressure off of Clawson in the offense alignment and pass protection and then it makes it a little bit easier to get that rhythm going for Clawson McWilliams shaken up a little bit so karinchan comes in as one of the tackles in the first pass of the second African function is deflected incomplete I was sheared again we've got a hand on it and there is the possession chart and you can see forced to punt three times not very productive not at all they have a one field goal when they had the ball for nine plays but it's just there's just out of sync and right now they're losing the battle to line of scrimmage again let's see what happens it's a different half we'll see what the adjustments do to see if they can try to be able to attack pit up front second down and ten battles for another first down here in the load right now for the Irish is the junior from Florida and could push up front by this offensive line they're moving people around a little bit of zone blocking just pushing that athletic defensive line around and allowing Armando Allen to make a good read good cutback that time he reads the flow of the defense going to his left cuts it back to the right and showing not only a little bit of speed but also some strength coming off the injury from last week that kept him out of the Navy game and now Riddick the freshman gives him a break play fake to him and Clausen throws far side and that's golden tape working the sideline does he tiptoed down it picked up a few extra yards before going out of bounds so they move the chains again and again these defensive backs are sitting up tight on Golden Tate I think they're more fearful of what Tate can do if he catches a short pass than him getting behind coverage look how tight they are they're not they're not even thinking about Tate hitting behind him they're sitting up there because they know what Golden Tate can do after he catches a short route he becomes a tailback for the football in his hands 22 yard gain and the play is being stopped let's see if they're looking at whether or not it went out of bounds so they want to see if he stepped out early but us take another look here he is working the sidelines close right foot is certainly not out of bounds as he dances off for a few more yards he was in downs all the way is that a great book or what wow that showed it perfectly our crew bill Bernal producer demob our director down there they gave you a good look and that should not take them long ten seconds and let's get this game moving but the flow of this offense you know they came out running the football trying to push that that athletic defensive line around some quick passage from Jimmy Clausen getting the ball out to Golden Tate try to review the rolling on the field is confirmed first out I think eventually they're going to have to be willing to take some shots downfield they threw the one up to Floyd that was intercepted by Jared Holley but I think they're gonna have to do something to be able to offset the way these defensive backs are sitting on the routes at about 10 to 15 yards pretty remains the money back lofts it and there's a penalty flag one of the lying judges here on the on the near side almost immediately as the split in broke off the line Floyd moved while the other receiver was actually in motion lingo shift are the offense penalties to play second down so they lose a yard and it will be second down in 11 rather than first and 15 and they once that did not hesitate and taking the down on that blood a little bit of confusion again and then huddle for Notre Dame Robby Paris was coming in now Clawson has to come over first time out there's some confusion there with the receivers he's upset with Robby Paris been that kind of a week for Coach Weis time from when I said the city had transformed itself well that's a 20 foot tall steel and fiberglass sculptor named arch the transformer that certainly symbolizes how this city transformed itself from an industrial giant to a leader in a hightech field so here we are in Pittsburgh 12:08 second down and 11 for Notre Dame they've been held to only a field goal haven't been in the red zone yet closet gets time going for it all in zone intended for Michael Floyd I just talked about how they're going to have to try to get behind this coverage Darren berry battling there with Floyd oneonone they're in zone coverage but look you see how Barry is sitting there he just gets in the way of Floyd points doing all that he can to get around him Darren Barry was a little frustrated oh yeah Barry was saying that's a little bit of all fits of passion if they're as long as Aaron Barry is doing a good job of going after the football he can position him body and if he's in the way a fluid has to get around it stop Berry's fault third and 11 Slauson has great time right and that was Floyd had a right to breadbasket for a first now Brent you said it they finally gave Clausen good enough past protection here on third down and long he's able to step right into that pocket make a good throw nice and low we're only Floyd can make the catch and that's a ball to Michael Floyd typically catches every single time Derek mouse number 43 back on to punt Aaron Smith standing back on pitch 10yard line as to pick it up on the run nobody in on top off the side of the foot and the hunting game has not been very good here tonight for Notre Dame that was good just dropped it that's only a 17yard punch great Graham checks in as the running back for Pitt and stole on first down gonna heave it back deep toward Baldwin goes in there up big time catch major league catch by Jonathan Baldwin who has scored the Knights only touchdown that's 51 yards great job a little giving go here and one thing about Baldwin because of his size and leaping ability pill stole is going to put it up in the air but he rolled because of the clock by the fall back that time Henry hadass key steps right up and takes away the anti tail who was coming on the Blitz Jamie Dixon came in to see us the fine basketball coach at Pitt he probably going to try to get Baldwin to come out he was outstanding high school basketball prospect you saw that vertical leap 1st down and 10 now for the Panthers the mentionnd on Lois number 28 head replaced great want to give a little love to the fullback here look at manti te'o he looks like he has a speck and the big fullback steps right in there and gives bill stole just enough time to play it up in the air but Boldwood had come down with a catch a lot of momentum here going for the Panthers and Jonathan Baldwin showing the country boy this guy is the real deal at six five to 20 major league prospect only a sophomore in Aliquippa he's got Sunday at his future ladies return good short that first out I cannot say enough about coming in here and seeing how Dave Wanstead has molded this team together how he knew exactly what he wanted here's a guy who had been a head coach remember for the Chicago Bears for the Miami Dolphin been a long time assistant under Jimmy Johnson of the college ranks and with the Dallas Cowboys does the man who understand the complete game not flashy not flamboyant no exciting quotes he's put together a solid football team that block they feet a little bit of a run a little bit shorter beats but he's got to like this that's because he and Williams got a pretty good push in here in the middle of this defense 95 just battling right over Rob Howells through the center in wins that battle and our big man and Oskie has nowhere to go once 10 does not hesitate here is Hutchins he's up by 7 there's a 38 yard field goal attempt well on its way and these guys Juan's tits Panthers make it a 133 leave beautiful night here in Pittsburgh the Panthers eight and one coming in five and oh and Biggie's competition you still must go to Morgantown to player West Virginia then on December 5th I believe the data is they host Cincinnati and what could be for the whole ball of wax and an underrated Big East Conference this year meanwhile the struggles continued for Notre Dame they have not even been in the red zone here tonight see what they could do with this possession fielded at the 4yard line ridic to the 32 which it goes down stanford still dreaming the dream after that big win over USC today they have not been mathematically eliminated and now those Oregon Ducks take Pasadena waited in the course the Ohio State Buckeyes so here's Clausen throw it try again he went to the running back that time and really could not without hold it it's a great number right there he has been able to throw the football against everybody they have faced but tonight against this defense we need to talk about Phil Bennett the defensive coordinator from Pitt we've talked a lot about the ones that his beliefs his philosophies Phil been at the former head coach and SMU the defensive coordinator with Dave wants that here and tonight's up to this point to hit for a child within control of things up at one time was the defensive coordinator under bill Schneider in the resurrection at Kansas State he later became the head coach at SMU and here he is right now just a wonderful wonderful man who has survived a personal tragedy involving his wife so many of you know she was struck by lightning while jogging and he was an assistant again she passed away discussions with Phil fully married again here within the year is two children our Texas Tech and you just could not find a nicer gentleman eleven Clausen now he shuttle passes it but that's well short of a first down Armando Allen was at the receiving end and there was big sheared again average of all sheared 97 the junior defensive end at a Florida has just been all over Notre Dame's offensive line and in particular Sam young the right tackle just his quickness has been too much usually sheared faces chips from tight ends and running backs but so far they've kept young oneonone and sheared is winning that battle wife too very deep like this one bounce takes a Pittsburgh box Brady Quinn lead the Browns to avert an upset when he steps back in for Derrick Anderson it's been a rough year for the Cleveland Browns organization John Buddha's name when you hear names Notre Dame in the future John Burton's name is always mentioned by folks I think that's it because he's available and it's automatic and this is ray bram now to back up breaking free the two yardline local tackle a time right a great effort here by Ray Graham and Brent we should mention Dion Lewis is a true question and so is great Graham another true freshman stepping in here great job he just never gets up develop he'll stall to come back he goes Theatre trying to pick up a book on Sergio Brown but the effort there is tremendous by the quarterback leading the way and a young running back Ray Graham gets the ball all the way down to the two yard line for the touchdown who set it up with that brilliant 53yard run scores the touchdown that extends the panther's leave great job on the right side there's the big bowl back leading the way over the whole American line back on a high school man tied tail but rented brands deserves that touchdown after that effort but context on the extra point Pittsburgh started to dominate a very tough time for that man right there he was under the gun all weekend for me I wondered how the distractions surrounding the Naval Academy coaches come in and some of his own players saying that they were out schemed last week and then other players coming to his defense I wondered tonight if there would be a lingering distraction most teams have to shake off losses they've got to get over them over the weekend and come back I'm sure that there's no the Dame team tonight has been able to shake it off and come back there could be a hangover from what happened last Saturday and throughout the week with this football team let's go down below talisha well brain totally whites wouldn't talk about questions all week about job security but because flares have had to deal with intuit but everywhere you go on campus every class to go to the people are asking what's up with your coach the Jimmy Clausen told me hey what people are saying about us they have a hundred and seventyfive yards of offense is all they have tonight that is Michael Floyd picking up the the first down they've passed for 113 is all here tonight Hobson is 13 at 24 no touchdowns obviously and one interception desperately in need of a drive here trailing by 17 Crossing steps away it comes to a Monday buddy yards before gun tackles in Murphy this kind of add to what you and Lisa are talking about these players are going to say one thing to the media but they're human beings and Charlie Weis is a human being he hears people questioning him and questioning the direction of this program he knows about it he's going to try to downplay it and try to act coy and act like he's focused on Pitt but we all know that you have to live with it there is tape and the crowd applauding the defensive effort here tonight as Barry and gun run number 23 back towards South Bend the other thing we should add to this is the team that they're playing tonight is a pretty good football team agree the Pitt Panthers I think are showing us and they get a lot of other people that this football team sitting there with an 8 and 1 record I think a lot of people say oh they haven't played anybody I think his football team up front he put the defensive line the athletic ability that they have around their quarterback they're going to come after you third down and two and finally they get the substitution on the field that they want defensive it broke very quickly on that play shoe comes off ball appears to be a little bit short of our yellow indicator for a first down and again the senior Adam Gunn stepping up into the hole we're coming down toward the 420 mark here and the fourth down coming up big call here big risk Charlie Weis has to go for this down 17 even with the ball on his own territory officially gets the way the Pitt defensive lines been planning all night too tight play action and mondo class are gonna go for it it's the first time they have been across the 20yard line Michael Floyd they come up and throw it deep great fourth down on one 444 great call here because it's quite a risk but you know what if you're Charlie Weis this is his personality Floyd gets behind the safeties everybody in the stadium is thinking that importance in one pull out your own 40 they're going to run the ball beat safe and that's exactly what Jimmy Clausen wanted to see the safeties ruff puts it up in the air and boy goes up and makes the play first down deflected it'll be suck it down in and that defensive front oh there's a push there by an offensive lineman and that was Chris Stewart lucky that he didn't get a flag moose takis was pushed away they were 2nd down and 10 that's about the third pass that that defensive front is knocked down tonight as last week against the Naval Academy this is their first trip to the red zone here tonight second down they spread the field fires right side and it is complete and there's a penalty flag thrown on the play John Goodman made the catch but it's going to come back Paul Duncan a rally killer now then they've been attacking pit here with the uptempo no huddle trying to get back into the game that is the same move that was made by the Naval Academy and through the same penalty and South Bend last week the right defensive end starts up on his man and cut inside and basically wish tackle only this time it is gregorovius who comes inside old to make it suck it down at 20 another penguin fly caught this time by Floyd again bound around the 10yard line but there is a penalty flag thrown on that far side I think he had a free play here Gus mistake has looked like he may have jumped up front of the pit the how they gonna get Notre Dame he maybe use draw that is why enrollment give you an idea of how this has gone tonight ladies and gentlemen pittsburgh has not had a single penalty not one in this football game and that was very coming off and that is a major impact if 17 stays out he is a fine defensive back and Irish ER was second 25 Matt Romine left tackle that time was lined up as a tight end and he's lined up in the backfield winner if he's a little bit out of his comfort zone by trying to line up as a tight in there with Kyle Rudolph out of this football game now if the Irish have spotted berry over here they sent two wide receivers out to the right they move Ricky Gary over to that corner on second at 25 and another penalty flight comes flying there's a couple of them here it was the umpire stepping right into the thick of things outside 95 defense fiveyard penalty check it out that's Williams five back and it'll put the ball right about the 26 yard line and against Wannstedt defense first penalty of the game for Pitt and for a game that hasn't had very many penalties he's last three or four plays we've seen a lot second down and 20 flossing to the nearside and Tate who's out of bounds around the 15 yard line and hit by Chappell you would like to think for Notre Dame the Golden Tate or Michael Floyd down in this red stone area that's been a problem for them all year not just against Navy but the entire year they have struggled to score touchdowns fiftytwo percent of the time they get in the red zone they've actually scored touchdowns its 85th in the nation that you'd like to think Taylor Floyd can make the play down here in this area so here's your third down back around the original line of scrummy and he strikes Michael Floyd with a first down pass working on Ricky Gary who replaced the injured Aaron berry they go back to work against the backup Gary is losing ground at the top of your screen going up against Floyd maybe anticipating he's going to go to the corner of the endzone see him losing Brown and it makes it pretty easy for Floyd sells the feint sells it hard off the line of scrimmage and then there's the timing between Clausen employed that time Floyd holds on to the ball Armando Allen is the running back he gets the call and it'll be second down and goal and he will be marked down as he kept going just inside it looks right around the one yard line how much do you think Notre Dame this week is heard about how they struggled in the red zone especially off of the game last week where they were two of six against Navy it's been an emphasis darling wife said it's been an emphasis all year long and you can imagine the Notre Dame players we're sick and tired of hearing about what's wrong in the red Sun see if they're able to punch it in mando slants outside reaching for the end zone no signal cheer until he spotted his Holly comes up and makes the stop holly gets penetration nobody picks him up and he's the defender that's able to make that play there outnumbering Notre Dame in this goal line defense and nobody's here to pick up the safety he just slipped right through there made the open field tackle gonna burn a timeout here we will come to the end of the quarter and take the automatic timeout so this presentation of Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations part of a huge scene here in Pittsburgh this weekend Notre Dame in Pittsburgh that leads in 22 3 tomorrow on this field the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals in a big AFC North contest now third down and goal Fossum trying to give the Irish keeps it on the quarterback sneak takes it into the end zone himself scored their first touchdown but what set it up was that gamble on fourth and one when charlie weis elected to throw the ball Herbie yep absolutely and you know one of the things that Charlie Weis has to have down there is getting a good push and Chris Stewart and Eric Olson the center in the left guard really really good job of surging making it pretty easy for Clawson to get that touchdown but that drives had to be a touchdown they needed the final result to be a touchdown as we get into the fourth quarter and it's extra point custom 210 and they took over the job missed the extra point got it too low got it too low and so Romeo was rolling in on it here's that fourth back here's the playaction fourth and ten Holley comes up to safety and that's going to allow Floyd to get behind coverage fourth and one everybody's expecting run safety gets out of position a gutsy call by Charlie Weis puts it up Floyd makes the catch and then eventually that sets up the touchdown to get him back in this game pretty good effort there by Michael Floyd and how about Charlie Weis says he makes that call Vince Worf baby come on come through make the catch make the catch but that excitement and of course the other end unhappy that the completion was made against his secondary but all that happiness on another name sideline gets diluted a bit by missing that extra point that would have made this a tenpoint game so it was low as robia s comes in and once you kick it that low against a six foot 6 inch defensive in here in jeopardy get down to the 2009 Brenna didn't help that Trevor Robinson gets blown up on a play big number 91 goes right through the left guard Trevor Robinson big long arms so a stole and the Panthers and another bigplay turned in by that defensive unit there's a play fake by still rolling second down and ten here is the freshman sensation Dion Lewis first down Pitt nice execution upfront by the offensive line again you got eight defenders up close to the line of scrimmage Joe Thomas the left guard leaves away see him 56 picks up a big block on Brian Smith the middle linebacker and this we talked so much about the Pitt defensive line but if they had to pit offensive line also found a pretty strong game as well and Lewis here tonight closing in on another 100yard game that's 81 yards and I with 15 carries for number 28 such a big question mark this year for Pitt when they came into the year losing with sean mccoy early to the NFL nobody knew how good beyond louis in a great gram as well how much they would be able to fit into this new offensive structure of frank Cecchetti we've talked all night between bill stoles resignation his ability to step up and dion Louis it's been a great combination this year Dickerson running that far side for another first down what you can really see the speed from door and Dickerson here coming underneath and just running away from manti te'o after he makes the catch gives him a little bit of a deep to the inside and then just use his speed for dickerson a mismatch against any linebacker and any safety he's faced all year first down beautiful cut in the hole here comes Lois and zone the Phenom goes 50 yards for Johnny white Notre Dame came on the Blitz on Lewis gets up field in a her sniffing I'm backer and that is what he brings to the table right there in 1 1 division 2 quickness the acceleration and the ability to take it all the way to the end zone Hutchins tacks on the extra point twenty seven to nine Pittsburgh and headed toward victory number nine we welcome you back to Pittsburgh where the fans are enjoying themselves you and I are firstrate Lisa Salters Brent Musburger rockin good time for the Pitt Panthers these three being a BCS birth and they are expressing one thing yeah they want to be done today but more than that they want to win the Big East i kickoff feel good on the six yard line 30 yard area let's go back it's rare to see a back what no matter what's the age but the ability to make a cut and not lose your acceleration this is in the middle of the play look at Sergio Brown the safety coming up to make the play a little bit of a shake meanwhile he makes him miss and he doesn't slow down to allow either walls or Smith to catch up to him a crate shake off Brown and then he just accelerates within the cut that's Reggie Bush type of stuff when he was in USC indeed very bad news though for the defense barriers out to the game with that shoulder injury so now Gary be a caffeine onslaught and it'll be second down I may have mentioned to you guys that Tony Dorsett is my cousin and I was speaking to him last night about what he thinks about Dion Lewis and the fact that he is making a run on all of Tony's freshman rushing records when Tony infected he said you know what it brings back a lot of memories for me but I'm really happy for him that he's being able to itself and when he said he likes most is the fact that the kid seems to have no ego he just runs the ball very productive Tony likes that and Dave Lee said well he should the second down and ten Clausen firing in Tate for a first down and here Claussen going down again and the are most Angus big gust moose take us out of Cooper City Florida he's a senior he goes 285 pound it's great to see after everything he's been through with his injuries throughout his career he has tremendous acceleration it's such a quick first step for a man who's 290 pounds loss at 12 yards brings up a second and 22 on the screenplay and you could see Figueroa Mia's number 91 Rita there's nothing that a defensive line anywhere in the world likes better than to know that your opponent has to pass on every down man it is TM up time and Romi is on one side in jabal sheer 97 on the other you could put that tandem on one defense up against probably any defense in the country as far as two defensive ends that can put pressure that is Gary down over there remember he's the replacement for Aaron very very can't return because of a shoulder injury and now his replacement the junior from Pahokee Florida Ricky Gary he appears to be shaken up so Antoine Reed a sophomore from Johnstown Pennsylvania number 22 has trotted out out of the field and it'll be his turn to hold up against the likes of Michael Floyd Golden Tate in this game so now they reach three deep on that cornerback spot well our Pacific Life game summary and the Hervey let's take a peek at our two quarterbacks here tonight who would you give the passing grades to well I think that Jimmy Clausen has struggled tonight because he's been under a lot of pressure you look at the passing yards from both quarterbacks it's not necessarily a huge night but the one thing that bill Stoll has going for him the caution does not and that's a heck of a running game tonight 178 yards on the ground compared to Notre Dame only having 55 yards both are O'Brien semifinalists that award goes to the quarterback of the deep talented field wasup pulls back as time can't find anybody open comes back underneath by Michael Floyd for the first down great job by Michael Floyd of working to get open and he's going up against Reed who you just talked about but see how it works back to the football he's about five yards short of the first down but he knew exactly where he needed to go and coming back to catch the ball and then he hit a crease to be able to get across the first down marker so on 3rd and 19 he picks up the 21 Fossum with a fresh first down comes right back in his direction against the young corner Antwon Reed and very close to another first down it's important for Pitt with it such a great defensive line with their ears pinned back they have to continue to be aggressive with their approach and that's what Dave once that wants to see he had Phil Bennett the defensive coordinators just because Notre Dame's had past mo doesn't mean you lose your aggression too deep both safeties back they throw to the end zone and a good job by Antoine read that time and looks like he rolled in is that is that a low heart down there took a shot I'm telling you first its Trojans got homies okay Phillies come on Billy hanging you up Billy you okay that's Bill Thomas outstanding camera man who the gamer is there is he's up all right Billy glad to see you're on your feet meanwhile the the Irish move ahead with Clausen again sneaking for the for the first down let's watch the end of it now he sits in there like Jimmy Clausen sitting in the pocket who got run over more his USC 50 more first down and 10 flossing gonna take it off brushes the 30yard line good job is stepping up there he wants to sit in that pocket as long as he can but there was nowhere to throw the football so he did the right thing there and just decided to use his speed to pick up some yardage Lawson comes back for the first down Kamara he's a junior from Hoboken New Jersey move again he's bringing it right down he knows they need to touch down and not only that they need it in a hurry so up to the line again trying to find a match up a oneonone matchup where he can find his man that can make a play it's like a timeout being called by the parents Pittsburgh the first need to regroup here that's their first timeout so we'll take a break hit 27 Notre Dame 9 the Irish attempted a rally here in the fourth quarter against Pittsburgh depleted at cornerback Aaron very gone for the game and so right now he's trying to hold here is a first down and ten in the red zone again for Jimmy Clausen in there to me coming back underneath and he's got it this time tape reaching for the end zone against the UM defensive back so the Notre Dame offense scores again and it didn't take long to pick on that spot yep soft coverage this time by the inexperienced corner read and this gives you an indication of what gold golden Taitz been able to do all year long catches a football underneath and carries defenders downfield good and recognition by Clawson to get the ball out fast and there's Golden Tate not only quick but a lot of power to be able to get that ball into the end zone rough Iran again remember what happened last time for me it's got loose on him in the middle this time true got it up a little bit quicker even though anyone was coming so Golden Tate takes it to the end zone the Irish battle back you well there's young Antoine breed moments ago and you can see ball what is fine wide receiver trying to get the youngsters head back in the game tell him to stick with it because you know just as soon as the average get the ball back they're coming after number 22 he's the third corner they've lost Aaron berry because of a shoulder injury for the night so here we go plenty of time the Irish down by two scores Sadler Sadler stretches it out of bounds around 234 so the Ducks but they'll have their hands full when they go down to Tucson mark it down the Wildcats are a different crew to deal with when you go down to their lair and then its first down in ten here for Bill Stahl and Dion Lewis Pitt last time they had to football you know they're trying to work a little bit of that clock they also were still throwing the football now you look at the clock eight and a half minutes to go Notre Dame continues to try to fight to get back into this game down 11 I think you'll still see stole back they're throwing a football and running just trying to continue to mix it up it's too early in the game to just go into the stall mode all offensively there is throwing judgment out of that formation that Byam is dying Byam doesn't get the recognition because Doran Dickerson this year has really exploded on the scene but by um his mr. consistency for this offense a dominant blocker senior who played a lot of football but he had Dickerson together in the same backfield or the same same group one lot of times Dickerson's @h baccarat tied in have two really really talented tight ends in his offense and they take advantage of their versatility lewis was still another hundred yard game he gave 134 looking at a third in two they're gonna throw for it stole incomplete through behind the white out they gambled Mike Cruz another of their tight ends and I am surprised as I'm sure you are that Dion Lewis didn't get a call on 3rd and 2 they tried to pull off a little bit of a Charlie Weis did with third down by throwing the football miscommunication at time with Phil stole who wanted Mike Cruz a freshman tight end to kind of idle it down and sit in a hole he continued across install had nowhere to go with a football now Golden Tate who is going to be some jogs out to return this punt remember down to scores down 11 the twopoint conversion the field goal irish are very much in this if they can strike fast there's tape gonna try to give the lift he beat the first man there's an alley in the middle plant explodes one man to beat please loose at the 30 hello zone the Aries you're back 87 yards on the pup return and four golden teeth the key was shaking the first man finding the alley and exploding and looks of dismay here in Pittsburgh but you need your playmakers to step up with the game on the line and you're right even without that long return Notre Dame's taking that there in this football game because of the way Jimmy Clausen in the Irish offense have been able to get down the field the last two series but it's exactly what Notre Dame needed to see and they're going to go for two here Brent get it within a field goal once that was very concerned about his special teams Stax's to talented receivers to the right shall pass incomplete incomplete pass but now they know they need another touchdown every time the fourthquarter kids are at it again Notre Dame three touchdowns in the fourth quarter already this season they've registered for comefrombehind fourthquarter victories a first in Irish history the previous record for fourth quarter comeback victories was three and that was set numerous years they had another one working against Michigan but they weren't able to hold on but there are the fourthquarter comebacks and now it is the Panthers feeling and here comes Sadler pigs go is a 31yard line Irving and Brent you touched on it Golden Tate is able to make the first man down Antoine Reid right there Oh lay him and miss him and once he does that sure he picks up a couple good blocks but really it's just building tape being golden tape with an ability to get into the open field and make people miss he got some great angles Hutchins didn't have a chance to punter and with his speed in the open field nobody had a chance to bring down Golden Tate and that gives this Notre Dame team a lot of life from his fourth quarter the fivepoint advantage and offices hit right at the line of scrimmage run down quickly by Lewis Moore Browns glad you brought up that the fact that Charlie wisest teams have had his ability to come back in the fourth quarter because so many people are so critical of Charlie Weis that's something that talks about not just Charlie Weis ability to coach but the resiliency of the type of character that he recruits in his football players so as much as people want to talk about what's wrong with Notre Dame how about talking about some of the things that's right with Notre Dame and that's an ability to come back and never give up and back they are in this 10 stone steps up it's Baldwin for a big time first down that's a catch Jonathan Baldwin is having a comingout party tonight in front of all of America four catches 123 yards and what a display here was using his hands on every single catch that he has made the ball was thrown in at six five shows you some of those old boots moves Bakula he played in high school a virgin over 20 points a game they're gonna take a look at this the only thing is after he made the catch as he started the role did the ball touch the turf the initial catch is there his hand is under he makes the catch but as he starts to turn right there that's what they're going to take a look at this is a big decision it was called a catch on the field and the ball is spotted right there at the 50yard line still six minutes to go in this game 27:22 five point game and of course just as soon as we finish most of these ABC station local news are be coming up and then over on ESPN you can turn over to Sports Center for postgame analysis and they'll have all the scores and highlights and they are taking a long look at this one as a receiver rolled over and sort of hid yeah as you would the paint weight of the ball and they have had some tough calls in the Big East last night it was one I did not want to make against West Virginia and Cincinnati the Cincinnati running back was extending the ball to break the plane ball came free rule fumble on the field and it was overruled by instant replay and a huge touchdown for the Bearcats last night who remain undefeated and are now 10 and oh and still must come up here to Pittsburgh after further review the place stands it's called so Baldwin with another big catch here tonight hundred and forty two yards Lewis has run for a hundred and thirtyfour scull has thrown for two hundred and twentynine and that is why not ski right in front of Luis comes the power law rule a couple of yards take the toss bootleg right throw it underneath the dickerson short of the first down got about a yard to go Dickerson was forced out of bounds on that far side great play by Harrison Smith first of all the play called fun I think Notre Dame a bit off guard but Harrison Smith got back out and even at Dickerson at full speed is able to catch up to him and push him out of bounds short of the first down marker so here's a third and one two seconds to get it off looseball irish go for it and Pittsburgh regains control John maliki a defensive lineman who was switched over to the offensive line a senior from Murrysville Pennsylvania comes up with the football and by hurrying up Brent there at the end play clock is going down he hurried up to get the snap off and John Maliki actually knocked the football loose with his left arm away from bill Stahl now watch the Notre Dame bench react to this on the sidelines Clawson getting the helmet he's not too sure who had recovered it at the time but he's going to get the ball back anyway pretty quickly because soap it uses its second timeout they face a fourth down now their last two possessions they have failed to convert third and 1 and let me point out neither time have they been able to put the ball in the hands of Dion Lewis remember they passed him up in the previous occasion this time they botched the snap before they can even think about getting this going so they haven't gotten the ball to their ace running back and now Dave Wannstedt faces a fourth down at the Notre Dame 42 yard line and no question what he's gonna do here comes the punter and Tate will be back deep again standing on the Irish 10yard line as Notre Dame mounts a fourthquarter comeback and you just joined us just past the top of the outer hour Notre Dame with 19 fourthquarter points trying to punch this one about two went into the end zone so it will come out of the 20 yard line first down at 10 to the 20 yard line the Irish has four touchdowns on the last two possessions they are right in the thick of things Clawson drops it over the middle complete to Armando Allen the running back to the 25yard line Bruder defenders in last two possessions the Notre Dame offensive line in the uptempo doing a much better job of protecting Jimmy Clausen that will have to continue in the first half they weren't giving Clausen enough time to throw when he has time to throw tape McCoy can make plays now Ricky Gary is going to take a shot at that corner he's back he was shaken up remember and again it's Armando Allen coming underneath for the first down gun making the tackle now here is where Charlie wifes excels calling plays in this situation he's been under the gun so many times with Tom Brady watching the clock knows what he wants to do doesn't go for it all bringing it down a lot of time left caution far side hands again stopping the clock at 242 now Clausen also brings a lot of experience to the table and having a quarterback who's been out there for three years in these kind of situations a lot this year it allows Charlie Weis to call plays knowing that cautions going to make good decisions to put this off into the position to put points up on a board second down and one three receivers to the right four closet there's a penalty fire umpire throws a penalty flag toward the offensive line the Chop washout luck has been called on the Irish parts to the file chopped off 51 second down wing on the right car right there steps up starts up high and then just shoots down underneath a Lexus and anytime you have another offensive lineman in that case it was Eric Olsen engage you cannot submarine a defensive lineman that's a good call by the official suck it down and 16 for Clawson in the Irish it as he released it incomplete it'll be third down Gregg erroneous the jr. from Coral Springs Florida big number 91 rolling in again Romy's has had a great night he gets around Paul Duncan with just great speed to the edge how about chillin on one side jamal of shirred also it's like a race to try to get pressure on Clawson third down and 16 and they know what caution is gonna do hit again loose and incomplete and that was romance again they can't handle later well at six six two hundred and seventy pounds his first step again is giving Paul Duncan fits that time he gave him a little shake and bake Italian for his size he has an amazing athletic ability very tough for any offensive lineman to be able to match up with him now we've got 210 with the play clock ticking down fourth down and 16 would you go for it do you have to go for what are you in the audience think does he have to go at 210 that with two timeouts left fall in his own territory only one Nestle do ever good thing before before he had to waste that timeout I think you have to you have to go for this he didn't want to have to burn a timeout but just to make sure he gets the right played ball here to give sauce in a chance it all comes down to this play right here further review I'm gonna see if this was a fumble around those two defensive ends getting around there tough to see from that angle intentional grounding they certainly are not looking at that aspect of it upstairs the hands coming for the arms from a court of all slips out of his hand looked like this big good angle after the contact from Mobius on the backside we whipped it forward flossin as we mentioned earlier some of you might remember I mentioned Mel Kiper I've been watching the big board I'll tell you the class has been moving way up Irby he's going to be a high firstround draft choice if he elects to go out apparently after further review the ruling on the field is a fumble agency decision insisting fall off the video that we looked at it looked like when Romans came from The Blind Side Acosta that he got contacted on Watson but it looked like Watson's arm was coming forward still with possession of the football and trying to throw the ball for them to make that call they have to determine that the ball was coming out of his hand as his arm was still coming back now 210 crowd exploding at that decision and Weiss wants an explanation he wants to know why how did the football go forward if you're saying it was a fumble pittsburg ready to go inside the 30yard line young Paul in there with him you I thought but obviously upstairs the replay group they saw something else they convinced them that it was a fumble and now they put the ball in Lewis's hands and they start to bring that clock down the average with one timeout left desperate to get it back in Jimmy Clausen's hands and the Irish you've used that final timeout here at 2:04 this one turned exciting here in the fourth quarter is Notre Dame puts 19 points on the board but the excitement was for the Irish was drained out of it with that decision that it was a fumble and it had been recovered by Pittsburgh second down and seven and now a steady diet of the freshmen first down the shy of the 10yard line one thing to have great vision it's another thing to make such quick decisions as a tailback you just don't see that from true freshman tailback and he has an ability to show patience at times and he also has an ability to find the crease almost every time in a defense sky is a special back for Dave Wannstedt you can buy he and Ray Graham together for the next three years at least within this offense he came in the nation's seventh leading rusher average in 126 yards already well over a thousand yards the average unable to stop it out of out of timeouts so the Panthers are headed for their ninth win of the season West Virginia and Cincinnati still ahead but Notre Dame put a scare into him here in the fourth quarter the Wannstedt had all they bargained for after that punt return the old victory formation the Panther players go over to the student body the left engine all offensive the students surveyed you pointed out behind a war instead in the effort here to rejuvenate the Panther football program it's a big win for Pitt to keep their momentum going late in the year any time to plan out a conference day and you wonder how it might affect you your team but Notre Dame but easy to get them fired up let's go to Lisa thanks Brett just like being down 17 going into you guys could have taken the lead on that well we you know we got we got pressed we got a legal chop block ball and when we so all of a sudden things are going now we'll decide it's a 15yard penalty now you're fighting battle they call it a fumble on the play with maybe men get the ball deep in their own territory but you know that's illegal Chop Bock in the last Drive we got to worry about UConn right there that's all we have to do I mean I'm proud of the guys fought back right here but right now that's the moral that doesn't do any good just got to worry about UConn next week so the Irish fall to six and four on the season and coach wisest struggles in November continue to mount up because over the last two years they are one and six they've once dead in the Panthers go to nine and one and over your final thought well I think it's going to start up again for Charlie white since we keep her this year right there with Lisa everybody's going to be talking about this is a game he had to win you wonder what kind of reaction he'll have this week in his press conference and more importantly forfeit a huge win they moved tonight as one they've got the backyard brawl coming up and then the huge showdown with Cincinnati at the end of the year right here in my mind after st. Cincinnati last week and bit each week and it fit it should be very excited about their next two ballgames so that is coming up here in Pittsburgh in a couple of weeks meanwhile the Panthers have to go to Morgantown next week that will not be an easy game that brawl never ever is well thank you for watching ESPN on ABC
