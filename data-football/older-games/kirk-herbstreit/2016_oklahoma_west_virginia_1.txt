============================================================

the following is a presentation of ESPN on ABC you almost heaven frozen over a wintry night in the West Virginia mountains already feisty as Oklahoma and West Virginia Cal I'm here in Morgantown welcome the ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart and the game will playoff implications Oklahoma ranked number nine West Virginia hungry for a breakout win ranked at number 14 already Oklahoma State took care of TCU in the big 12 today they had to West Virginia it's only lost they will fly with Oklahoma in two weeks in Norman that is the conference championship if Oklahoma can escape this upset trap tonight in West Virginia and welcome Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit Samantha ponder will join us on a wintry night here in Morgantown already it has been feisty Kirk you were on the field pregame this is what happened as the Sooners made their way over to that Mountaineer logo began to jump up and down and the guys in blue did not like it now there's a little bit of history here going back to even last year when Oklahoma and West Virginia got together look at this I mean it was a melee these guys are getting obviously after one another I was down the field before this and you could see some of the wide receivers from West Virginia kind of John at the Oklahoma defensive backs Baker Mayfield at the end of that trying to say hey let's let's just go out and play ball but yeah motions are high there's a lot at stake for both these teams what are they saying the biggest home game here in Morgantown and what 2023 three years yeah so it's a big time game tonight you saw Mayfield in the middle of all that he's going to be in the middle of the Oklahoma offense after the one and two start when he struggled a bit he's been playing in an extraordinary level since then I would say in the last seven weeks he's probably playing as well as any quarterback in the country and the one benefit that he has is they have such balance I mean they can run the football and it sets up a lot of office to be able to throw this is my JT run on the best backs in the country who is now healthy if you're going to play bass with two safeties you're going to get a large dose of number 32 and number 25 running the football now the great thing is when he starts to get going the safety start to get down in the bottom and that opens up playaction opportunities and here's Edie Westbrook who is playing the last seven weeks as well as any receiver in the country especially on the vertical throw downfield so Oklahoma comes in tonight they feel very good about kind of their threeheaded monster that they can run the football to try to get a very aggressive West Virginia defense up into the box and then try to give the ball to Baker made though to let him do what he does aggressive undersized defense but somehow they're in the top 20 in the country and scoring the event Mountaineers offense meanwhile this is not a typical Holgersson offense is it he he's not a patient guy but they're having to grind away with the running game had a creating play and interesting talking to him this way to keep that a couple years ago because everybody's running the air raid in the big 12 we decided to become more physical run the football and that's what they're able to do last year there over 200 yards a game that's what they're doing this year because they have a veteran offensive line look at the continuity up front look at the blocking look how they open it up for their backs they've got a trio of Acts themselves to be able to be physical and it takes some of the pressure off of their quarterback Skylar Howard when I watched this week with film it well he does it using his eyes looking off coverage to come back and throw the other way he'll have opportunities tonight against an Oklahoma defense that has struggled to defend the pass so if they get their physical running game going early especially with the weather look for Skyler Howard and what kind of monitor the way he's able to move the safety and try to hit a very talented group of wide receivers through some big plays yeah Howard kind of symbolizes West Virginia he's been told his whole life he's not good enough and he helped engineer an upset as the snowflakes flight is windy it is wintry it is wasting the Sooners and the Mountaineers place the vocal stay is almost seven to be fun tonight in Morgantown we Sandra Mac Brown and mark may is next after this message and a word from our ABC station damn fellas thank you welcome to a snow globe filled with 60,000 souls in Morgantown West Virginia Dana Holgorsen wore red bold and blood in his veins at the moment and his map mirrors have been told by the committee you don't have a woody wins yet and waiting all season for this opportunity and mighty Sooners from Oklahoma underdogs they would have it no other way one of the biggest home games in Mountaineer history only the third top ten collision here in this Stadium now they are ready the Sooners are ready we know you're ready Oklahoma and West Virginia coming up in a wintry scene here this has been a Nissan pregame rush kickoff from Snowy Morgantown is next but first a look inside Nissan pies Minh house yesterday I was almost summary I promise 76 degrees here Morgantown the rains arrive this morning winds have arrived about noon and now it is 40 degrees colder than that the snow is flying the wind is gusting this could get very interesting a bummer staff says we are built for these kinds of games we'll say Bob sistas with Samantha ponder well coach emotions were already running high in pregame so honey and hope you guys can pain that and harnesses so it doesn't hurt them on the field yeah as much as anything it's good to be emotional and excited but you still got to focus and play smart execute that's the name of the game is executed because we were just talking about in pregame how nice it was things have changed drastically does that change the game plan at all well you got embraced it ensures the way this is it's going to change things a little bit no doubt throwing the ball and handling the ball it's got to deal with guys embrace it and Holgersson seem to do in the same thing all smiles on the near sideline dupes teams the 14 straight big 12 wins and they have won 10 through road games in Rome do color for coaches tonight will be fun Kurt what to do one cost deferred so just to get the ball first you will see me field go to work Mike Molina they kick it away up the mountain ears Joe Mixon the et Westbrook are deep the short kick one of the up man it is almost out of bounds and Sooners will take over at the 24 and here is may feel terrific but how well he has been playing lately yeah the last seven weeks playing as well as anybody in the country in fact his passing efficiency is outstanding he's got to take care of the ball obviously tonight these conditions improvise keeping plays alive with his beat and also when he gets his opportunity because it's such great balance in a way they can run the ball with semaj P run and Joe Mixon Feeney Westbrook right now last seven weeks probably not a hotter wide receiver when they get some oneonone chances downfield he's got to hit number 11 male fear from Austin Texas he's played in cold weather before putting some bedlam games and it's typically pretty frosty in the state of Oklahoma here I'm the victim 235 pounder is the bat he's doing here I'm healthy miss almost wargames Kirk but he's fresh now and he rips off 12 on the first play a balance such a big part of what they do in this offense with Lincoln Riley and live charlie impact players and starts with semaj P Ryan obviously DD Westbrook Benton and Douglas Douglas be on the outside play a lot of mantoman against Westbrook if they could spear I may feel over the middle incomplete tried to get us to Westbrook on the slam but it'll be a tough night for receivers you know you just serve Bob Stoops talked to Sam about that this is that play action there's something that they have a lot of confidence in especially when six goes to number 11 and little little little push there at the end from Harper always trying to send messages early in the game for the safeties against those receivers incredible how efficient Mayfield is innate target Westbrook VP Ryan again get a monster game here a couple of years ago against the Mountaineers 242 rushing yards he is why along with Joe Mixon Stoops feels comfortable and bad weather with his offense it's 335 defense of David Gibson is very very aggressive she just have the three down lineman allows you to via Tony Gibson allows you to be able to put eight guys who can just really crowd the line of scrimmage that time David long number 11 chips able to shed his and get into the backfield before Pierre I can get going wind whipping that's still around and now Mayfield needs eight on this third down venires rush only for Mayfield backpedal flips it over the middle and it's in and out of the hands of Mixon who's a top matchup that's a linebacker Justin aren't chasing him but it's incomplete exactly what you are if you're Oklahoma on third down Baker Mayfield does a nice job just kind of patiently waiting and waiting and you see it you'll take that match up all night with Mixon against Arne he just simply dropped the football actually that wasn't the condition that's just him starting to look up looking where he might be going took his eye off the football and it cost him the first down so two drops for the Sooners and Austin cyber to handle the hunting and the placekicking boots it away at the short punt bouncing around down there now it's Malta strum a mistake as the Mountaineers tried to field the ball and Oklahoma's got it Sam grants recovered the fumble special teams obviously going to be impacted on this wintery night and the mistake by the Mountaineers sets Oklahoma up with a 34 yeah poor decision here I don't know if Jennings thought the Kyurem the ball may have touched him to Jennings reacts his 14 right there I don't know if he thought it may have hit his foot that made him go after the football he right there I think he thinks that that ball might have hit one of my guys I got to go get the ball and obviously in these conditions that's the last thing that you want to do especially early in a football game and the Sooners catch the first break of the game because of the condition so it's waving him out of the way to kyurem get out of the way I think he thought that the ball hit his foot and that's why he had to go for it it's been a day for wintry football on the tux easy the watching some of the games be plants especially the one in the big house and again tonight within 15 minutes to turn into a whiteout Joe Mixon to the left of Mayfield you've got it and Mixon it's his way in finds a 30 West Virginia's got a win 1st down Kirk in the words of 20 Gibson they did not that time these two bats are probably the best hand of a backs in the country and they both bring us something a little bit different to the table now that they're both healthy together it makes this offense along with Baker Mayfield and DD West for probably as dangerous of offense as a you have to defend because of the balance that they have in big playability second and three they handed to mix it again and he plows near as a marker at the 24 that they'll mark him just short you know Joe Mixon is in the past was known as a guy that would come in on third down catch the ball out of the backfield P Ryan was the guy that would be able to plug away and now he's really developing grown become a complete bath mayfield wanted to have been official out of the way and run did play quickly then they did invade him substitute so he was definitely trying to get that ball now go back up out of the shotgun on third and run nears crowd the middle Mixon tries to get wide and doesn't skate mixed it down the sideline barrels to a first and goal at the five here early in this game what I'm seeing is Oklahoma and the running games able to get to the edge the reason is you're seeing a lot of mantoman on the outside then you're playing at three three five if he can outrun that linebacker aren't there's nobody left on them on the perimeter good job here early in this game from Lincoln Riley being able to get the ball to the edge there's West Virginia trying to send a message again a little push there from David long into the face a mixing after a first and I never quite understand that then we're trying to catch in the month um for the courts and go now and Mixon hesitated and we'll get a yard before nobo wants you cool made the tackle the senior from Texas nailed that this 335 took with Tony Gibson it is imperative that they get penetration they've got to get some mixed in and fear I'm in the backfield if you allow these bigger backs to build up momentum especially if you get them around the edge it'll be a very very long night for what we're getting to stop this offense and especially the running game near I'm in the game now on second and goal Westbrook homes in motion they hand it soon Westbrook trying to get the edge now we're tree and skate down near the two yard line it will be third and goal pretty good job there by Jeffrey mean the receiver that was lined up to the right doing a good job of being able to sustain his lock and almost got Westbrook into the end zone so they pound in the middle they pound in the middle there to keeping it honest making you have to respect that edge run game this was Baker Mayfield in normal conditions his feet his ability to create and run can always be dangerous now he's actually going to motion out nobody is out there with it an alley move out his P line and direct snap formation you've got it big fella Farrell on downhill cannot be stopped touchdown Oklahoma as they cash in the muff pump and draw first blood talk about some leg drive here but Benton number three meets him right before the goal fee number three right there thinks he has him stopped there's that lower body strength and a leg drive that pushes him into the end zone that is that's a heck of a collision there gives you an idea again at a strength of fie Ryan he got a cross for the touchdown capitalize on that muffed punt only had to go 34 yards to come six plays all running plays and cyber in for the conversion nothing in the kicking game is going to get automatic tonight because the footing is not ideal down there the fear I know we searched early against Kansas State and missed the Texas Tech game the Kansas game in the Iowa State game getting it off field surgery and he's now back 100% is the progressive pile on campus confirmed that he got across report touching here's to be pretty clearcut okay when he felt he is a handful you know he wasn't he said earlier in the year lows first three weeks he was 7080 percent that's a high snap and Connor McGinnis the holder the good job to get it down so that cyber could not get through and the Sooners capitalized on the first mistake of this game of seven nothing the new year six and the college football playoff the crownless was so charged up the beginning here look quieter now is the mountaineers month that hunt oklahoma takes it 34 yards here on direct snap touchdown run and we'll see Skylar Howard in Mountaineers offense both over for the first time both kick bounces through the end zone Howard's interesting story ker comes from Fort Worth not heavily recruited and Becky walked on it stephen f austin and played running back there but he wanted to get quarterback a try so he transferred out to california riverside city junior college he was fined by western you really out of necessity they just needed a quarterback here and he has been a pretty darn good player the last couple years really have to admire is that story and the determination your running back you want to play quarterback you finally get your chance and Dana Holgorsen is able to find you and last couple years he's gained a lot of valuable experience and because of that experience I think he's been able to process coverage and make quicker decisions this year Alexis Knapp means what up inside to a true freshman Kennedy before is part of a III tailback rotation free Goodwin for the Mountaineers and it's already down here in the first play he had to carry the load last week with 25 carries with Crawford and shell out and here on the very first play gets to start again and goes down he's a guy with with shell and Crawford both injured against Texas and a hot day he was an excellent player in that game you may have landed on the ball here on the sidelines let's see 200 pounder of North Carolina still down as the trainers have made their way across at the Oklahoma side own took a knee to the face as well isn't he yeah Oh Bonilla after one flow your favorite guy outside linebacker make the tack you can come Oh beau if you want to call no tonight yeah okay will they attend to Kennedy McCoy moon take a break Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart Black Friday is back at Walmart chef Walmart calm all day Thanksgiving in part by chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich at Nissan premier partner of the Heisman Trophy McCoy had his first two career touchdowns last weekend Austin here to be favoring that at shoulder or collarbone areas he has helped to find athletic trainers to the locker room an injury a very first offensive play for the Mountaineers not a very good start for the home team here they do have depth of that running back position we'll see Russell shell senior and the junior Justin Crawford and talented versatile running back second and five and our looks nearside high throw hard hit incomplete heels shorts the slot receiver was hammered by Stephen Parker incompletes great reaction by Parker there and that ball is thrown a long way from the left hash all the way over to this boundary pretty good effort there by shorts to go up and make the play but this Oklahoma secondary has been challenged all week by Mike Stoops the dieta coordinator in Bob Stoops to make plays on the ball Howard steps up delivers from the pocket almost intercepted had a chance to make a play right there and that's Jordan Evans the leader of this defense the senior backer had a right in his hands i watch him do a great job of reading the eyes completely fits right where he needs to be the quarterback led him there I talked in the open about what a good job Howard does of looking off defenders and coming back to a receiver early in his game with the pressure from that o you pass rush that time he stared down his intended target and moved Evans right into his throwing land at a pick six earlier this year at a couple interceptions against Baylor top tackler on his team or Billy Kinney the West Virginia native punts his deep and that's Westbrook playing it safe making the fair catch back inside the 25 tomorrow 10:00 a.m. over on ESPN NFL insiders with all the new all the stuff you need for your fantasy team at 11:00 Sunday NFL countdown might have to kick off in on Monday Night Football the Texans and their Raiders from Mexico City I also do their Azteca Stadium 6 o'clock when in that countdown 8:15 for kickoff also on a watch ESPN some Sooners the rape field position Ashton for a touchdown starting her second session back at the 23 mix an MP Rhine both in the backfield and Peorians got it in the short game their tackle by David long Oklahoma that first drive first couple drives they've been running the football doing a good job of controlling the line of scrimmage been a combination of P Ryan and Joe Mixon one thing is not only controlling line of scrimmage getting to the edge using the speed of those receivers to outrun their linebackers and take advantage of the mantoman coverage on the perimeter from the West Virginia secondary when I last touchdown drive after the turnover with six plays all runs at Sioux you turn the fell back Lincoln Mayfield who has a long time to throw it fine looks on the sideline and it's out of the hands of Mark Andrews who was well covered the tight end the excellent target for Mayfield but the fiction catch has been a challenge so marker yeah and it's going to be these are very very challenging conditions for the quarterback to be able to handle the football especially for the receivers and that ball is coming him stealing it's not the greatest feeling in the world trying to catch a a tight spiral the ball thrown from Baker Mayfield right now quarterbacks in your line goes with five and nearly going as the Mountaineers make wholesale changes here on third and eight Mixon there in the slot empty backfield for Mayfield years bring some pressure get to that quickly complete look out Westbrook can fly this day Dede Westbrook does not lose foot races touchdown oh Lahoma 75 yards and all that aggression we've talked about Kirk's amends you pay the price out that the passing game has not been working for Baker Mayfield so Lincoln Reilly draws up a just a quick screen an easy throw an easy catch to his favorite target and Westbrook had some lineman downfield but Westbrook actually showing some toughness there running through potential tackle from the linebacker there Justin art just ran away from it now near is pretty good at not giving up big plays running and passing this year but that 75 yard play put them in a two touchdown hold the pressure is going to come from over here but you're going to see Oklahoma do a good job of getting their linemen out you know they're not worried about that pressure because the ball is going to get out so quickly and once the ball gets out you've got a lineman downfield the big tight end mark Andrews also but that's the thing that's impressive to me we're used to seeing Westbrook go by people with double moves and and just strictly the vertical passing game but this time he makes a catch he's trying to just get the first down but right there stiff arm and then to be able to just throw the line back down and then take it all the force he has a speed to take it to the house we're just more restrained reactions to a touchdown pass but Westbrook with his 15th touch done now it gets go that's what were you saying yeah there yes yeah he I don't think he can believe that he could solve Dede Westbrook throw a middle linebacker down he was in all his 15 touchdown receptions of season five singleseason school record it was the complimentary deceiver a year ago to Sterling Chapman was the main guy but now you got guys like Ryan Royals the executor saying that now Westbrook belongs among the Great's ever play the position here based on his twomonth run they thicken my Shelton Gibson eat the big play receiver for the Mountaineers free to stay alive it'll be corralled across the 20yard line and this is a tough thing for an offense group that lacks some big play punts to be down two scores the challenge right now for Dana Holgorsen is going to be patience I mean to get his team to be very very calm with this this is not ivan obviously the way they envisioned starting this game here in Morgantown with this much hype around the game and talking about the biggest home game in 23 years next thing you know we're not even forward 96 minutes into this game and you're down 14 just remain calm you don't need those big plays right now you need to execute and try to go back to what you came in with that you thought would be effective be Justin Crawford he kind of screams for a terrific story of hard work and perseverance and muscle for nine yards he had an ankle and his myths and some time didn't play at all last week against Texas but probably their most talented most gifted back can make you miss and free those from spring if the first moon saw that he went to Northwest Mississippi Community College he came here the Morgan bound worked at Taco Bell the summer came up there with his wife and his two young sons and we've got to feed the family so before camping is looking to Taco Bell and you can kind of symbolize this dedication Howard now on flash and there's a whole lot of time nobody opened Rawls and this fires along the sidelines it's complete a short game two shorts Dana Holgorsen reaction to being down 14 is he's going tempo I mean they have turned up a nut to another gear trying to get his team not to worry about having to think about execution just let's try to go a little bit faster now they slow things down here after these first three plays where they kind of had Oklahoma bit on their heels that's a good Howard settled in Browns his first completion of the game got five yards no flag right guard moved a false start start by number 62 of the office the fiveyard penalty in the steel second dad now boss the only non Ohioans starting offensive line for the Mountaineers speaking of Ohio Fleck guys and the Wolverines I'm talking more about that game next week here he is 60 to Bosh trees were here from Michigan right away Howard he's got good mobility campers around and I just fires it way over the tutor bench he had some room suit to keep running there go to Cassidy have work for an update thanks Chris Kirby dr. Carter championship drive update number six Washington Arizona State Jake browning to Chico Luke laughter who takes off with a 75 yard touchdown Washington right now up Ted nothing to fight just picked for crowning early on Chris hurt me back to you it's not the story of today have we're in the pac12 Howard on third and ten pump fakes now fire is over the head as short it was just well covered there by Steven Barker it's amazing to watch the job that Mike Stoops has done with this defense this defense has probably been hit as hard with injuries as anybody in the country and here early in this game he is simply having confidence in his in his group upfront to be able to get pressure but he is dropping seven back you've got two or three guys depending on to play back deep he's got four guys underneath and coverage he's taking away all the options that's why Howard has nobody to throw the football to so Kinney is on the punt a form of the offense that has been thrown on run on scored on times embarrassed and humiliated this year very catchy give up 854 yards the Texas second straight 732 more fantastic when by the way daily what what again Oklahoma was barreling out of the gates they catch in a month punt for a short touchdown drive run by B Rhine and then Beebe Westbrook takes off on a 75 yard long gallop after a short pass Oklahoma defense looking stout early on in Midway first quarter students get the ball back of 14 nothing the crowd is completely out of it they were booing us which in the last secret Westbrook in motion they fake it to him here goes Joe Mixon it's may be his turn to get involved now he gets 10 and the sooner is in in charge up front right now I've always felt and there's 335 because it's a bit risky and aggressive you're either going to get a lot of tackles for a loss or you're going to get crease and early in this game there get increased the offensive line is just dominating a lot of scrimmage you get increased again the defense Kirk that played more than a hundred snaps a week ago and it's Texas and the heat in Austin some of these guys individual defensive linemen late 90s snaps get a linebacker play a hundred two snaps and they maintain that the practices were good they were fresh would be no holdover effect but you wonder if the Sooners keep pounding away after you know and by the way they played well in those hundreds now yeah won the game but you know getting down 14 and depending on what happens in this drive it can affect the mindset of an entire defense especially in these condition in Iran bounces for a short game there Mountaineers in desperate need of a stop where they're often to struggled so far and I think what you'll see Tony Gibson try to get his linebackers to do even though it again you know they're going to get physical you know they're going to run the ball is the defensive line there they're trying to hold up those linemen the linebackers have got to get down hill and attack the line of scrimmage maybe a little bit faster than they normally would because the goal here is to get the P Ryan and Mixon before they build up momentum Mayfield rolling out on second down gets the space fires over the middle and wide open is Westbrook you leave them alone and Westbrook still bouncing around again for showing the toughness to go with that worldclass speed moved into the 35 well designed play you're running the ball you're running the ball you put away nobody's even thinking about Petey Westbrook clearly lay back on the backside lookouts off the coverage is there from Douglas and there he is fighting again for more yards sue catches a hundred yards are trying to rip his head off they're after the catch Westbrook is bumped up playing the Mountaineers he wears number 11 to honor Tavon Austin as the full Mountaineer great who had a a monster game against Oklahoma from that day I heard it hasn't well yeah yeah bouncing three again is mixing it pulling these guards and tackles and just pushing people around great patience by Joe Mixon letting the big fellas get around then powers Orlando Brown they could come around Orlando Brown seventy eight six eight three hundred and forty pounds pulling around it takes them a while to get around but it's very effective once it's there it's three hundred and forty pounds big fella takes a little time to get around the quarter if you don't want to meet him when he does do mixing again and lowers the head and you move the sticks one more time here's that sooner offensive line you get you get a couple sophomores and a freshman up there I think again this is the area probably that they've improved the most from where they were against Houston and Ohio State to where they are now they're more physical they've had some injuries that they've had to overcome early in the year Cody Ford who got hurt against Ohio State was the right guard that forced Samia down inside into the right guard spot and opened up Bobby Evan so they've had to maneuver for people around it you can see tonight continuity is there around the center is the only senior mixing again break the tackle barrels and the secondary twist down to the five and the Sooners are threatened to blow this wide open man it looks like a sieve right now with what Oklahoma is doing is it's West Virginia watch the offensive line great block by the fullback flowers that's actually what opened it up there for him but every time seems like he run and mix and get the football there at the second level running downhill it's hard to stop good backs when you're giving them that kind of freedom there the line of scrimmage and mixers over a thousand yards for the season now barrels a hand for a short gain already mixin was garroted 79 yards and Tim carries a much better job that time by the linebackers defensive line actually a stalemate not getting pushed off the ball and consequently they hold mix in two very short game much better job at the point of attack total yards are 200 to 24 I snap me feel pulls it down keeps it frozen the end zone touchdown wide open is Jeffrey need so you're running the counter you're running the counter you're going to pull the counter you're going to run the football this way right well that's what the defense thinks what a time for this look at the defense flying over here and all you're going to do is come to the back side right there for an easy touchdown that just sets up perfectly off the playaction look the counter the counter the inside zone and then the counter playaction with the exact same look pull in the garden the tackle linebackers fire in open hold the backside for an easy throw for Baker makes it Mayfield only the sixth catch of the season for me but it's third touchdown he's a 65 guy tall long arms skinny guy they got a big tall receiving core this year form a field of throat we got a powerful running game to get our offensive line that's dominating we had defenses pitching the shutout and they got a 21nothing lead and Morgantown on a snowy evening well the Sooners got a little feisty pregame the Mountaineers charge down the field and challenged him trying to back them off their logo this little scuffle Kirk Oklahoma came back out highly motivated and this has been a beatdown in the early going yeah I think the message so far is you probably don't want to challenge the manhood of the Oklahoma Sooners so they come out swinging when you challenge them it's about time for the Mountaineers fertile land a punch yet is Shelton Gibson is knocked down hard separated from the ball which went out of the bounds their big hit by Doucet hey Matt yeah guys what four digits coaches told us as you know this week that Tyler loss you would really the coach on the field but he's happened to be a coach on the sideline this was a dejected sideline not a word for a long stretch there even before the touchdown he started getting in everybody's face saying things that I can't repeat on TV but he's looking for a little motivation out of this team right now and questioning whether or not they care which is never good in the first quarter report Sam this is Crawford Alaska is a pure Cleveland guy the senior like a lot of centers is a he's a smart football player but also a colorful guy he's a important guy to try to settle the quarterback down because Howard can get kind of heat up and he's likely to be somewhat rattled at this point like a lot of guys out there howlers play a lot of football for your starters been around zone 2 the running game with limited success it'll set up an important third down and try to stop the bleeding here if they can again I think for people that have not seen a home of play and it's been a revolving door for this defensive line they have had so many injuries and most recently they've lost some players Charles Walker's decided that is to quit Matt diamond is no longer playing on this team Matt Romar who's a good defensive lineman hasn't been here they've been playing a lot of guys who would be typically backup defensive lineman and they're played pretty well so far Howard from the pocket takes a down field shot on third down and it's incomplete over the outstretched hands thereof Shelton Gibson few more blues from the home crowd and another front coming up and actually that's that's what's been the Achilles heel for Oklahoma playing the ball and coverage and just watching Jordan Thomas that time he actually lost the ball he had no idea where the ball was surprised that Dana Holgorsen early in this game has not decided to try to attack the weakness of Oklahoma which is playing the football in coverage especially on ball thrown downfield Kenny with the Icicle just a few miles from campus here in Morgantown once at the Westbrook who makes a fair catch at the 30yard line absolute total dominance Mountaineers have run 11 plays and gained 29 yards Sooners averaging more than nine yards per play and now that we're in the middle of the latter part of November and the playoff rankings are always a big topic and of course teams are talking about trying to win conference championship about exactly what Bob Stoops and Oklahoma wanted to see and exactly what Dana Holgorsen did not want to see if this holds up Oklahoma not only winning a game against a team that's ranked in the top 15 but also you talked about style points going on the road and winning like a game like this giving the impression you're playing great football at the end of the year yeah me Ryan cuts it back for a big guy who who can Harry's he's got a nimble he doesn't he he really does I mean that's the thing that I've always felt about him these last three years starting with the game he had here as a freshman when he went over 200 yards against the Mountaineer defense how big he is when you see him down the field especially he is a thick guy but his lateral quickness and how athletic he is and how he's able to get through with the vision that he has through those holes impressive urinal running all right men all folks is knockdown and the Mountaineers a chance to try to get off the field here as soon as we need for on this third down the whole goal tonight a West Virginia is to make Pierre ein run sideways and then chase him down with their speed because of his size at 235 pounds against an undersized defense they do want to see a lot of him with its shoulders squared running downhill and through this first quarter whether it's been mixed or appear on that's exactly what we've seen mixing this in down this third down play Westbrook motions around to the slot it's an unusual position for him the left of the quarterback may feel within the other direction dancing around escapes and he can do this he stepped out of bounds with like just short of the marker he's got good escape ability can be a dangerous runner Stoops incredulous about the spot well they're going to take obviously another look at that I think they're frustrated obviously whether he stepped out of bounds I thought he was in the air when he went out of bounds I think he was in the air I don't think he stepped out of bounds I think he was airborne take a look at this thing you're right this is what you know about Baker Mayfield he's doing a better job from the pocket but he still can scramble and make plays we could probably another look on the side to be able to see his foot here I don't think he stepped out about no he's in he's in bounds he's airborne it's where the ball is he put the ball in his right hand it's tough to tell from that angle where it was compared to the marker now we'll get a good look well they marked it like they thought he was out of bounds but it is about the ball he hasn't landed yet see still in the air still in the air and down now they've guitars are rules expert have you seen the look yet data that would indicate where the ball should be spotted to me this is a first down because of exactly what Herbie and you said he doesn't touch out of bounds and when he does touch it when it crosses the sideline all right and right now they're going to have to look and see where the ball crosses the sideline all right he's still in still in he's not out yet all right they've got a look at where crosses the sideline to me it looks like he's got a first down is he is he in bounds theoretically until his left hand touched very erratically he's in bounds but then when he goes out of bounds that's where the ball crosses the side I remember the review the ruling on the field stands evidently Richard Jordan replay official for this big 12 crew didn't see and not Bob Stoops begs to differ and the Sooners are about a yard short I thought it was the first down I thought the ball I guess he didn't have a great view to be able to 100% be able to confirm that the ball got across the mark it is where it crosses the sideline right now where he hit right okay my boys hard gently the hardest see yeah so so this so Western ten you get to stop they do Seibert on the punt for the first time very very good puncher as well as handling the play speaking duties rarely gives up a big return he's got a lot of fair catches among his 35 points two of them Jennings keeping his job as the punt returner despite the month at setup Oklahoma's first touchdown back it is 25 the snow has has stopped the field conditions certainly have improved still pretty frosty out there and the crowd is feeling a lot colder than they did about a halfhour ago as the first quarter expires reporter Devon Stoops being frosty the condition is Oklahoma out near a dominant 21 nothing first quarter back with more for more contender to this message and a word from your local ABC station we have at ready for the second quarter on ESPN Saturn in football any of you see presented by Walmart Mountaineers only give it up three first quarter touchdowns all year they give it three in the first quarter tonight finally forcing Oklahoma punt as cyber gets it away a low kick bouncing around and this time Jennings wisely just lets it go but it will bounce dead inside of the 15yard line next Saturday to get you set for the Buckeyes and the Wolverines in Columbus college game to go on the air at 7 a.m. 5 hours or is it 7 p.m. Friday Kirk I did it which is it is it I think it's 7 a.m. 7 a.m. yeah 5 hour 5 hours you get it come over for that 5 hour marathon I'll be ready to join you right here in the booth at noon Eastern Time for the collision between the Wolverines to escape another loss today they struggle for a long time against Indiana pulled it out before the blizzard arrived near West Virginia trying to mix a big play as Crawford gets loose and bolts across the 40 and you see the talent of this young running watch that's in Orlovsky does a nice job nice block also by 5 and then there's the shakin Bay there from proffer it makes a couple of people miss offer it again gets the corner flip the tackle Justin Crawford trying to get the Mountaineer as a foothold in this game is down near the 40 yard line and suddenly in two plays guys the blue house some white yeah it's almost the same flip it the other way Knight picked up a nice block by a receiver but makes another linebacker miss at that second low this is what the coaches are talking about with Crawford and what makes him different from the other two backs they have please Dixon and 39 yards now or to force down for least attempted one fires it down behind his receiver it's incomplete it was learn to rinse the slot receiver so a first down throw after those two big runs and it continues to beat tempo member we saw that the last time they had the ball I think again it's a good move by Dana Holgorsen it's something that Howard is very comfortable with this office is comfortable with tough part is trying to execute in these temperatures and second bound five receivers forced the lap power throws it back to the right complete annex plant in the run white in the first down on there against a true freshman thought they might try to attack him a little bit more tonight that's Jordan Parker nice throw that time made it very easy for wife to make the play now Crawford Barrelhead loses the ball and the Sooners fall on it just when West Virginia looked like they were getting back in the games the ball was stripped by Jordan Evans in a second West Virginia turnover I'm still a scrum down there there battle for the ball and sure looked like Oklahoma fell on Jordan Parker the freshman we were just talking about the corner looked like he got on top of the football and he in fact comes up with it but you're right Chris it was Jordan Evans the leader in the middle after a pretty significant gain and from Crawford right there he's paid tackling the football we were talking about that today on the bus on the big 12 you seen linebackers safeties tackling the football more often than trying to actually form tackle ball carrier and that time it paid off for Evans that the ball came out and Crawford fumbled early in the game against Texas similar kind of play as they kind of ripped it the ball he got the doghouse and didn't really play after that so now a guy they need him to have any chance to get back in this game but the disappointment evidences he's really got to shake it because with the injury to McCoy and shell not quite a hundred percent they need him tonight especially on that last Drive he had hit three really account that last when three really effective runs peasants continues to be just a terrific playmakers defense here I'm their backup in a golem it quickly moves the sticks again with a power run to the far side they just going on the edge again something they had a lot of success with in the in the first order we've seen inside zone and we've seen these back get to the edge along with the counter play and that's really what they've done to run the football there's nobody setting the edge to this defense it's making it pretty easy for Pierre ein and Mixon to get outside and get why again this time in the heavy traffic so break the tackle and it's about four I'm a much better job there I think David Long was the outside linebacker twenty Gibson telling us this week just kind of a freakish athlete and a Cincinnati Ohio freshman he's on one side and kinds here white on the other these are the outside linebackers in this 335 they have got to get upfield and do a good job of forcing action back inside they cannot get caught up in traffic he wheeled off the pier on new barrels for a game we will set up a third and to long whose dad David was a professional boxer the 10 there in the back row Oklahoma is so far tonight three of five on third downs the odds obviously your favorite when you're sitting there at third and two and third and for most of the night the appeal puts its appearance got some space and again at first an apply it comes in that was in the offensive line fit Harper and Maurice Fleming forced him out but this may come back Oklahoma until this moment not get penalized tonight a personal foul Allegra by number 78 of the offense the 15yard penalty in the replay third and it's a big block excellent half a difference to the goal there will wipe out that first end pass and he always hated the head coach to see a leg whip or a call like this when it had nothing to do with the play Orlando Brown the left tackle is up here he's actually going to get linebacker art after horn starts to run to the ball yes that's a leg with the bomb after the 12 that's up a third and long I need about 15 defeat your mind again gets a head of steam but it's not done well shorts and West but he does force a punt long again here on the tackle fit he right looks like he's hurt he's kind of yelling there it's like he may be in some pain where's you and I had the Baylor game last year and he had some injuries he thought he might be done and he just kept coming back took a big hit here picking up a few yards it came in it might have been David long in fact it was 11 came in and really hit him pretty good jeremy Tyler is a very aggressive run stop safe he delivered the blow and the punter is knocked down gets lump again at midfield in collecting ins Jennings but they definitely ran into cyber back there now let's see if it's a 5 or a 15yarder Marvin gross was rushing the punter as people Castleberry a personal foul roughing the kicker but number 18 of the deep end the 15yard penalty an automatic first down so the severe variety will put the Oklahoma offense back on the field Seibert is congratulated here he comes from way from the outside trying to make a play trying to make something happen nobody touches him Brian's old is good but that is that as a personal fun yeah ran into him obviously with a lot of speed that's why they call the personal foul other addiction thing about David West Virginia's defense after the turnover they they were able to get the ball back to Skyler Howard and then they end up roughing the punter to give Baker Mayfield in this sooner all offense another opportunity here Mixon breaks it free spins in the West Virginia territory and is hauled down at the 45 you hold your breath when it's got the football they're going to run a counter the center is going to pull flowers is going to come around it's giving them a lot of different looks but what you got to love is there's nothing there he's able to look here the bounces there that's something that does again these backs have tremendous quickness but it's division and the patience that make them so special say it's a mix it may feel flip to far side and the catch is made by leading or the touchdown catch now flag comes in on the sidelines where he's not got a bound and it's going to be another mental mistake on this defense but they've had a fumble they've had roughing a punter they must the punt return now a late hit here Reese Fleming after the play personal foul a late hit out of bounds on number 24 of the defense the 15yard penalty and add up those missed cues crisp with the muck started really with the muff punt but they've had four or five plays that really have cost them they were ready to get the ball back in the blink of an eye after a few a few plays and a penalty there inside the red zone inside of 20yard line now the Crawfords fumble force players really seemed to take whatever fight mountaineers had left this feels like a knockout punch here pursued us in the end zone mix it again break the tackle Joe mix and barrel down to the five yard line amantha Chris what you guys are just talking about is what have these defensive coaches at West Virginia so upset during that last Drive there we have the guys think we can still be in this but it's mental at this one you have too much emotion you were to rise up we saw that in three games and you're not handling it well they tried to tell them if you can just settle down and play smart it's going to help you and they're still struggling with that now if we win mental and also very physical mixing just into the end zone standing up and the Sooners lowering the boom in Morgantown tonight with a big assist from them messaging me defense and special teams to personal fouls but the lateral quickness in division has been on display here and a great blocking up front by that offensive line and by the pull back to me tree flowers put a onetwo punch with Mixon and P Ryan tonight 96yard eight play touchdown drive Mixon already has 116 yards jumped nine yards a carry cyber get United through the fumble Jordan Evans ripping it out of a hand and the Mountaineers had finally guys in scoring position offered Pop's it up it looked like the Masters would get the ball back they running the cyber another personal foul a hit sets up Nixon who just waltzes in gettin ugly tonight and West Virginia four different Oklahoma players have scored touchdowns and some soulsearching going on of that Mountaineer sideline mixing joining the party me Rhine and Westbrook need who scored earlier 96 yard drive it for a fumble recovery that really test the resolve of the home team as we check in with Cassidy Hubbard hey Chris Taco Bell studio update Nick Saban said he was embarrassed at halftime by his team's performance Alabama 43 over ten who's got the third until Damien Harris takes off for the 25 yard TD run tied up 21 to 3 now over on espn2 crispr me back to you Cassidy it's an annual ritual have a good at the tie get their virtual buy into the late season game against nominate arrested and Nick Saban is outraged is how they don't play hard and absolutely who do we play next week I've never seen such a before performance you embarrass our and gutty little runner keeps it get hit hard but he's the first sign up for a 12yard gain there at this point Howard's going to have to obviously finally make plays throwing the football close to 10 carries again has an ability to obviously run football here's about that time Crawford spinning free knockdown Howard just gained 406 not netted but before the sacs of 106 yards rushing out of the court about this year keep in mind first we talked earlier about Oklahoma's past he plans to meet they did their 120 first in a country and pass defense and they close to 300 yards per game playing in that explosive big 12 whether it offenses score so often but this has been an uphill battle so if you're West Virginia you're thinking guys come on let's try to put something together the last Drive they did they just turned it all over Howard looking downfield bring Gipson no chance to make a play thrown out of bounds and well covered by Jordan Thomas it defense Kirk that's head the flag is in a whole bunch of trouble tackling in space and not a typical over by number 25 in 53 of the office the 15yard penalty and replay first down we got Crawford in Colton the kibitz the tackle in the chop block anytime the lineman is already engaged see him right here once he's engaged watch the back in the backfield go submarine him and when a left tackle is engaged with the defensive lineman you cannot initiate more contact from the back it's a great call by the officials and easy call right in front of it it costs West Virginia another 15 yards bursting 25 not with this often needs proper breaks free and show the birds and so money Crawford into Oakland Tory will be run down inside a ten ultra walk with the man that he just shot blocked a second ago but the Mountaineers threatening finally whether the defense fastflowing an allows proffer to kind of sense that cutback and Beal the linebacker who had his eyes locked on him just could not react quickly enough pitch it on the edge knock that abound this Jennings short of the goal line a 61yard run Kirk and Crawford hism and an eventful first half is already rushed for 162 in this game is that last run it really gave you a feel for how quick he can be and some of the problems that you and I've been talking about with the Sooners tackling out in space and it's he's a talented back but Mike Stoops has emphasized this week gang tackling running to the football with 11 helmets 11 hats we got to pull backs in the game we Crawford and running behind them runs into heavy traffic and gets nothing there is Jordan Evans who force the fumble by Crawford earlier makes the stop and bring in that goal line package which frees up the linebackers hard for this offensive line to climb up to the second level and Jordan Evans who is kind of the ante for the leader that the captain and number one tackler on this team he's freed up to come down and just blow up that play that was one of the guys have got the seniors and the leaders and defense together after that embarrassing giving his attack and demanded much more of them in practice and games at Howard fumbles the snap and Oklahoma recovers another miscue in scoring position exactly what they did not mean they'd be going shotgun and Dana Holgorsen moving his line another turnover inside deep inside Oklahoma Territory keep it going shotgun right shotgun almost sided third down he gets under center hits under center and never gets the snap former lossky falls down Sooners jump on top of it Dumon dana rage flashing there you saw it 28 zip zooms get the ball back Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought you by Dr Pepper it's a college football tradition Pacific lights helping generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years and we go further so you can singers say what are you doing Morgan's having a Friday night cosmic bowling but there's Jack Farah throwing out their goal you go out there and throw it around not a nice meal yeah how's it going out there all the way out there with the right foot up on a followthrough you're on camera straight ahead I watched I watched a boxing fight last night real quick let's go back to the snap he's under ser watch the center snap what's the hesitation see I stopped and then ends up bringing it up that's what affected the rhythm of the snap but it could have been talking to Dave Kataya could have been a dead ball a dead ball foul which would have meant completely taken away the fumble it would have been a fiveyard penalty with a dead ball it's an illegal snap instead Holgersson you can rage with the best of them on backtoback possessions Mountaineers have fumbled the ball inside the Sooner 5yard line to go with the must upon which set up Oklahoma's first touchdown a couple of personal fouls that help the long Oklahoma's last touchdown drive jeremy Tyler by the way safety who was down now helped to the sidelines you made a good point though in offenses is predominantly shotgun snap it and that was a funky formation look like he was trying to get the ball quickly he was trying to get it quick he was trying to roll to his right he had too tight in that was slipping out get his back Crawford he was slipping out into the flat he was trying to get the ball quickly and rolls to his right but the snap just never got up and I think great job by our crew to catch that hesitation there on that snap from a veteran Center for your starter nor lofty now it's Carolina the direct snap who risk handles it that's risky for a running back back there in the snowy night he still gets it and gets the first down that direct snap to P Ryan Baker Mayfield's back there see he's lined up just literally behind the left guard so it's a direct snap that fear I'm I don't know if inside your own 10yard line is where you want to try some of this especially when gets running the football has worked all night you're up four touchdowns if you're slamming it down the field and it is short of the first down so now p.m. will just try to pick it up and does right there but maybe not to time for looking around to get tricky now that we got to finally have frustrations flags coming in there and some cuckoo whose offensive end shoving with the offensive lineman of Oklahoma City Samiha yeah he took his helmet off put his hand right up into his face got to keep your composure West Virginia boy it's been a battle the entire first half so many mental errors they lost the composure and warmup right they did and as Sam pointed out that is carried over in the game there it's straight ahead there first he initially has caught up with Bobby Evans Bobby Evans puts his hands up and then you can see he comes in and just rips his helmet off wasn't gonna be a flag until that last shove to the face after the place unfortunate like conduct 97 on the defense after the play a forceful I conduct 92 on the defense both penalties will be in for 30 are due for the price of making it I think he missed a number of his 95 who actually Kristen Brown throws an official so he was the one we showed you already was with the player watch in the middle with 95 he throw eight he shoves it official that's not a good idea always he poked him in the chest with a new next finger dad that's not appreciated either so they have completely come unglued now Mountaineers you putting on an official I thought you were thrown out at a football game kind of poked him in the chest and wasn't it real physical thing but fear I'm its midfielder way and continued loss of composure the way I was always taught if you touch an official and whether you're poking a finger or pushing I put your hands on an official that like that's usually it if I get been thrown says there's a hat in the air I don't let's take care of that you got two folks in there Kristen Brown in the game for now but on the sidelines this is the most anticipated most hyped home game here here's more pushing each other he fortunate and I get another flag there and Adams pillar number 88 you've waited a long time this team this program these fans for a game like this Kirk it's been an absolute nightmare really from the opening minute or so yeah this is still see how this game finishes but this is one of those games we're kind of your worst nightmare for Danner holder said this is a big stage and a big opportunity to take on a team that you've never beaten in the big 12 try to show the big 12 that you can play with the big boys you're down 28 and you're coming apart at the seams completely undisciplined making a lot of mistakes losing your cool soon as ticket timeout I mean frustration is understandable but the way they've acted out can't do that it's tough to see kirk the polar bear Rispoli could begin the day in the snow earlier today in Kalamazoo now here's a wintry Morgantown with her aspect Rivia question tonight for us it was enjoyable this morning Chris thank you Ray my hair come on last time for that a spectrum any question under hopefully under it bob stoops oklahoma 120 and one with scoring 40 or more points who is the only team to beat the Sooners hunter students in they've scored 40 points human demons away for a first down we'll stick on that for a second 120 and 1 it's a pretty good record when you hit 244 mark let it go meet him in shootout to say a Kansas State yeah like an L Roberson team or Darren Sproles team maybe she's going back away going back a little bit yeah not a Baylor need an idea Baylor's always in play anytime they've given up 40 be room in phrase incorrect I missed the answer we asked you under Bob Stoops Oklahoma 120 and one when scoring 40 or more who is Yellin team to beat the Sooners got to go back to that 2007 fiesta bowl where's page 43 42 tricky any shot it's 120 and 2 after tonight nah no not at this point bear we just may be that game that would a terrific member of the game Chris Peters and the minute it goes maybe the quarterback right just a little bit it all kind of the hookandladder play and charities at baranski right Statue of Liberty for the two balloon Iran it's going to be a City dose of 32 and 25 they were going to throw out some it is there's the Statue of Liberty in champion Jonathan around the corner and you know what he did of course after he's for the night of his life right yeah where's the ball away get that in 1d proposes was girlfriend well that was a shocker that storybook moon for the Broncos for Chris Peterson really started to become a household name that nationally Iran it's a great big farm barrels down the sidelines so I'm mixing them well over 100 and beer I'm headed for the century mark as well well to see how many yards after contact this the combination of P Rhine and mix it have tonight by the way they do this to a lot of teams these last seven weeks now that P Ryan is healthy my offensive line has been able to come together very very different team in my opinion and who they were at first three weeks with the health of P Ryan and DD Westbrook and that offensive line coming together and they are they run through arm tackles they can throw the ball downfield it's a heck of a package right now that Lincoln Riley offensive coordinator has you run again break some more attack great point they have now tutored in limit 33 rushing yards most of metric contact Westbrook's touchdown was after some contact he broke free for 75 yard reception yeah I mean it's been a remarkable they've had some arm tackles that they've had to run through the offensive line doing a pretty good job of getting a pretty good push obviously to give into that second level but these two guys together you see it the NFL the time a combination of a couple backs checking to make sure he was down before the ball came out you know like there's a stop action which I can see elbow down you and the ball came out after his elbow hit if your time would you could you concur with that I would he's got control here still control still control ball comes out he controlled it till his arm hit elbow hits he's down ranks right away right he's down there's no independent ball movement that I see before that elbow hits we need to look at that any independent ball moon for that elbow hits I don't see any till it doesn't like the ball bounced as soon as that arm hit it looks like he had it pretty solid exactly to the left on the left arm hit there was a clear and immediate recovery by West Virginia's Oh so this were ruled up under further reviews would be the root of the pill is confirmed this keeps the ball we were talking there about how P Ryan and mix it together how it's a nice onetwo punch and you don't see two backs in the same backfield in the college ranks that are just physical they're this big 510 235 pounds with P Ryne 6 1 to 26 would mix them and both able to run between the tackles and catch the ball I mean if they do so many things similarly it's more of an NFL style than what you would see in the college run they'll both be there pretty soon in the pistol formation fear ein behind me he's got it again here I'm bagging into the end zone standing up in Oklahoma Bill's the lead the five touchdowns get more yards after contact linebacker Benton got in there but you'll see him run through watch three trying to shoot a gap he gets his right arm on him to try to slow him down he's trying to in deep there was a big fullback there in flowers safety came over also with some speed but he didn't wrap up he just throws him off never be a steady diet of 32 of it a 97 yard drive was the conversion as we missed 97 yard right after the fumble via Ryan P right the entire drive here I'm including the touchdown the only mistake sometimes Nathan I was bizarre some cyber to the t80 we're both bad golfer so we've taken the club and hit the ground about 5 inches in front of the ball before you have it's kinda what he did oh yeah big chunk extra line drive just coming right past your hair check the awful Gophers cam he's still a 60 at 62 on the season no reason to panic Seibert said booted away takes his frustration and drives a deep kickoffs through the end zone well the explosive reveal the latest count football playoff top 25 rankings presented by PlayStation over on ESPN 7:00 Eastern on Tuesday also streaming live on the watch ESPN app number one Alabama continues to methodically grind away against Chattanooga Clemson taking care of wake tonight Ohio State today one set up their showdown with Michigan struggled bigtime before finally putting away Indiana so no losses in the top four you see any any change in the top four we'll see I didn't go high o state just winning on the road see how the command to handle that it was an unfortunate like conduct or number 28 of the receiving game the penalty pass the distance to the goal it's his first of the game so reminds you Wellman okay they not corrected it now Welman samba 28 an Oklahoma she and Silvie and the Oklahoma coaches are talking to the true freshman Sylvie see here just I don't know maybe it was after the whistle but a little bit surprising had to be a late hit I think by reflex he said it was on West Virginia's you've had so many personal finals I'm writing tonight put it this one's on Oklahoma so the Mountaineers from their 40 going to get Crawford loose on the edge and he breaks free and it's an Oklahoma Territory to productive drives the last time they've had it both ending in fumbles inside the thigh which the Sooners in marks back to long touchdown drives Crawford now let go hundred and seventyfive yards running the football would feel very good no no I mean Oklahoma their issue has been this year defending the past and now West Virginia attacks very very differently compared to most the team's the Sooners defense have seen but if you're a sooner fan you're sitting at home it's a little bit different seeing them struggle to slow down the running game it's been really more about the path of it there they only give up 132 rushing yards per game of course it's the conference were so many highpowered passing attacks have gone out there Oklahoma and again in their defense because of how that defensive line has been so banged up I mean they have guys learning on the fly and the linebackers also had a lot of youth in that area now Orton third down stepped up in delivers over the minutes short who makes the catch in the dakhil shorts down inside the 25yard line going back to that tempo that they've had success with other than turning the football over just the fourth completion tonight for Howard and now fires far side again a short completion nearly there one white makes it down to the 20 trying to get the ball out there on the edge is Joe Mixon and Baker Mayfield that's the thing with Oklahoma 34 nothing only in the second quarter you you want to fight for 60 minutes Howard looking for the end zone and touchdown Javon Durant almost lost it kind of juggled it but held on and the Mountaineers finally drank the scoring column the Tramp makes the play but that's been that's been the Achilles heel for Oklahoma struggling in coverage this time it's Stephen Parker who's beaten on the play and never locates the football and the ball thrown to Durant but Parker who's a safety out there by himself against a pretty fleetfooted wide receiver in and Durant Durant a sophomore from Miami his second touchdown catch of the season like Molina for the extra point in the mountaineers after a very slow start offensively actually put together three consecutive long drives only seven points of choke work as the turnover Parker comes over late and he's a safety and it's just a it's just a post corner but watch how Parker who's going to be isolated there oneonone it's just that's not necessarily and he can cover but you see how he never found the football by the time he does see the ball it's good concentration there actually by Durant to hold on to it by by the time he does see the ball it's already over his head good concentration you're generous he went through his hands hit his knee to suit whatever it can have to drive a they got on the board good concentration yeah after he let go through this yeah looking like a quarterback there's do you appreciate the effort with you but you don't appreciate though if you're West Virginia fan was a team that that came out and as their coaches have admitted just did not handle the emotion to the occasion very well all hyped up got carried away pushing and shoving with Oklahoma may have instigated it during the warmup but then they came out and they left the punt right away Sooners scored and they kind of lost their cool and a combination of turnovers and personal fouls and the inability to tackle Oklahoma's gifted skill players 34 7 with the minute 13 to go before halftime the Mountaineers came in feeling very disrespected they were down there ranked at number 14 which is behind six teams that have two losses and behind a three loss USC team Oklahoma meanwhile Kirk has really benefited from they chaos ahead of it in the rankings and as you suggest a showing like this tonight yeah with the committee watching could put them back in contention well absolutely Louisville's loss on Thursday night and some of the craziness from the previous week and all of a sudden you think Ohio State in Michigan or both in the top floor one of them's going to win one of them's going to lose whoever loses their out so now you're essentially saying a team from the top four and number five are gone now you start to look at six and seven and eight and all of a sudden Oklahoma even after a slow start one and two now the sudden they're back into this in Washington who still may win the pac12 championship terrible nonconference schedule Portland State in Idaho let's talk more about that we'll have time we'll have times talk about the way I think the big big might have some time some low kicks scoots along the ground and in his field is at the 25yard line this week's council ball playoff rankings brought to you by chickfila I get another scuffle here and a flag has yet to come out on this one they're trying to separate the teams Louisville you mentioned knock down 11 sacks Jackson and then Thursday night game and so they'll fall out babe we blew it was the quote from Bobby Petrino and it's a pretty accurate quote here but now let's check it out is is you got four Big Ten teams ranked ahead of Oklahoma so they need some some chaos they need some some losses by teams like Wisconsin Penn State perhaps in Michigan yeah maybe I mean it's a very least if Oklahoma wins tonight and they win bedlam and they're sitting there as big 12 chance were there only two losses against teams that are pretty darn good at Ohio State in Houston at least there's a willingness there to play these teams in a nonconference something that the committee likes so they're in the discussion even with the two losses if they're able to win these last two games and win the big 12 he's mixing now and I say it a lot by Michigan because even if Oklahoma wins out even if Ohio State loses to Michigan maybe a two loss scene with a pretty convincing Road victory over Oklahoma I'll forget early in the season but it'd be trouble if they overlooked I don't think the debate would be between Ohio State and Oklahoma I think the debate would still be more if Ohio State were to win out I don't think it's a high o state Oklahoma at four I think it's more about Oklahoma versus a Washington right Oklahoma versus a Big Ten Champion I'm saying that the loss by Michigan for example would take the Wolverines out of the equation yep you have to see a Penn State screw and that flag comes in here for one halftime report coming up here San Mac mark and look that you what's going on the other night games and highlights from today so they have some highlights from what went on in Folsom feel Sam and I don't mean to hold it but number 75 of the operator defend yard penalty and it still second down and I don't mean to leave Oklahoma State out of this discussion because they should be right in the middle of this they're sitting there still think about that one loss they had on a Hail Mary to Central Michigan and play that shouldn't have even happened they should be sitting there at ten and one they still have Oklahoma in bedlam and so the Cowboys are still hovering out there as well and the committee you'd think would take into consideration the nature of that loss I don't know I don't know many would say they shouldn't even close the right name right or on his home field of course five you know how games sometimes in September bill but there there was an admitted misapplication of if they the conference admitted that so Oklahoma rolls up 358 yards of offense Mountaineers had 259 want to say if I'm the lead official in this game there's so much chip eNOS I'm going to go to both head coaches and basically tell them if you have any more personal fouls we're going to start throwing guys out of this game enough is enough the Green said you finally a conversation right they were mixing thirty four seven suitors halftime in Morgantown the capital one Hampton reports coming up right after these messages welcome to the Capital One halftime report Joe Mixon and the Sooners had the ball for 22 minutes in the first half Oklahoma looking for 15 straight big 12 conference win then organs team with a lot to do in the second half he's just said plug so much emotion in a lot of different ways in this one how do you get your guys to just settle down and play ball well yeah obviously you know we didn't handle the conditions early we turned the ball over a good bet there's a lot of emotion down here our guys God just relax a little bit make sure that they just worry about playing ball that's up I know you're upset with penalties for your own guys but what was going on right there you seem really upset with coaches about I'm not going to get into the officiating all that they're doing a good job there's a lot of emotion I think both guys are having something to do it was last thing for offensively you finally got some momentum going there on that last Drive what's the key to keeping it going well we drove the field four times and turned it over inside the five you know so I think what we're doing right now is working just got to hang out of the ball appreciate you time thanks big fella pair on downhill Oklahoma look out Westbrook and fly tonight Virginia yes it is welcome back to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC gonna buy Walmart before we even had to kick off we had a near scuffle we had a blizzard and then afterwards we had Oklahoma handling the tough conditions a whole lot better welcome back Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit the Sooners a 34 nothing lead Mountaineer fumbles inside the Oklahoma 5yard line really killed any chance of going to get back in this thing in the first half they did score Lee ass is really a combination of Oklahoma completely controlling the line of scrimmage and being able to run the football and then West Virginia selfdestructing making making a lot of mistakes mental airs turn the football over when they did finally have a little bit of a life driving the ball as you said inside the 10yard line a couple times but they really came unglued I mean they've come unglued and they've hurt themselves as much as Oklahoma's open he's interesting the second half to see how this plays out 30 minutes of football here right sir yes indeed Pacific Life game summary well we talked about semaj P Ryan and how affected he can be but it starts with the defense being able to get the ball back to this offense and let them do what they need to do this another missed you by West Virginia deep in Oklahoma Territory and then the next one Mixon and P Ryan got going here on 122 yards go mix in 116 yards Mixon actually averaging eight yards of carried Mountaineers meanwhile Kirkley they ran for 194 at 2:59 yard the total offense a lot of it behind that man right there Crawford but those two fumbles down inside the five that's why I really think obviously West Virginia you've got 30 minutes of football on you and you're down big you want to keep fighting and keep trying to come up and make plays and not give up but if you're Oklahoma with the way this year has gone defensively for you even though you're up thirty forty seven if I'm Bob and Mike Stoops and the defensive staff it's zero zero going into this second half try to keep playing with an edge try to keep playing with an attitude and send a message to the committee about how serious and how much you've improved as a team don't lose your edge now one the thickest shot downtown or getting complete over the middle I saw Mike suits in the hallway behind this year coming back to the booth for the second half he didn't seem overly thrilled he he liked some of the things they were doing but again they've given up a lot of big running plays and a bunch of yards they've taken the ball away but if not not a complete defensive performance no no I mean it's you can see the intensity that he has I mean he's not gonna let up that's just Mike far right he's intense and you know when you're up 34 7 you're not going to give up how many often if you watched you and I've done Nick Saban games so many times over the board of staff Oklahoma called their first time out of the hat and he's use our second timeout more violent on the sidelines talking about Nick Saban when they're up by 30 or 40 plays you wanna get out of his way you don't want to make eye contact with him on the sidelines well you know that Mike Stoops defense especially after that game against Texas second game and they gave up 854 yards they allowed 20 at a 25 third down conversions you know a lot of criticism and there was some taunt that it he wasn't the the brother of the head coach that his job of being the line and Bob said that's nonsense this defense was among the top in the conference of all the categories last year it's the same defense they played if what's the ton of guys is he's not going to abandon his brother or the defensive schemes he visits and bad games know and think about what they lost coming into this year striker Charles tapper Dominique Alexander at Frank Shannon Zach Sanchez the Monta bond I mean those guys were six studs and leaders and then they had of course this year they've lost the defensive lineman oh boy keep an eye on him here five on third down the Crawford breaks free that will not improve Mike Stoops news proper with a stiff arm still running down inside the 35 and just fight that deflating fumble Crawford still one and harden having a huge night well Crawford's again he's been able to get into that second and third level this Oklahoma defense and that's the thing that's probably when you're talking with Mike that's the thing that's got to drive him crazy Howard looking for Gibson in the endzone underthrown and incomplete his battles on the edge it was Jordan Thomas and coverage but that was a catchable ball catchable ball and his the best corner on his team just completely lost in coverage he didn't he was unable look at his head has no idea where the football is and he's very fortunate that Gibson did not work his way back earlier to be able to adjust to the football and either get past interference or come up with a catch that's that that's been the area that Oklahoma has really struggled just in coverage and playing the football now the pop pass here Durant coming around the corner knocked down after about a 7 yard gain another third down coming up it's really more of who West Virginia has been this year when you get Justin Crawford running has been able to run it will means 219 yards and then you get your your jet sweeps going it affects the eyes of the safety he start throwing the ball downfield our backpedaling asked to throw it away a fourth down play coming up and you believe there'd be little hesitation for Overson here it was a much better job of getting pressure on Howard Austin Roberts taste in the quarterback down they lost diamond Matt diamond charles walker but they filled it with Robertson in Gallimore and Lampkin that they've got some athletes up front on that defensive line that can get pressure just to matter them growing up a lot of real young players and haven't played a lot of football now we're on fourth down has a lot of time for the pocket picked off intercepted by Jordan Evans the former high school running back got skills with the football and he's got a clear pass in the end zone can they catch him no another pick six for the defensive leader for Oklahoma eighty yards and yet another Mountaineer miscue well watch him just read this he wrote he reads the route first Co he reads the route he's looking his eyes all the sudden he's got his eyes on the quarterback the quarterback as we saw in the first pass brought him exactly where he needed to be to make a play on the football but that was great route recognition saw the backflip out to the flat anticipated a route coming back inside towards him had his head on a swivel jumped the route because of the eyes of the quarterback great play but a senior linebacker he's one of the guys who said look you got to look in the mirror you got to start with yourself if you don't prove this defense look in the mirror and now he's forced a fumble tonight he's made a pick six he's got three picks in the last two games that will improve the mood of Mike Stoops upstairs go go go go guy in the left Phil hold on air is left out getting beat by five touchdowns cold windy now we would again do why are you but you're going to stay they'd snuggle okay you're not even watching the game but they're still there unlike most of the folks who can edit for the exits here durant from the goal line and knock down at the 15yard line so we can begin to speak about the future game at noon eastern time next week chris we saw Wilton's fate and i was did he get hit hard there in that left shoulder it's a it's a collarbone break no definitive information out of sim back football it's tough to get that about him being out for next week but you'd expect him to be out and again John a corn the the lefty who began his career at Houston comes in this somebody did today against Indiana was it was tough conditions enough to get the win but about to play a lot better to get the win in Columbus would you agree yeah but I think they obviously will play a lot better I mean it's the is game Michigan game and both teams will play their best to be emotions to be flying next Saturday in Columbus I thought oh corn considering he hasn't really taken a meaningful snap since 2013 in Houston but he played on had a heck of a scramble they've probably turned the game the complexion of that football game completely around noon Eastern Time game day comes on the air at 7:00 a.m. Eastern so I don't like so 4 o'clock on the west coast if you want to watch it there include the five hours a game day in the two hours of game day you and I are about to do right now that's actually seven hours of game day that we're going to be doing for the Ohio State Michigan game look the NFL look for the bonus chicken Howard Oh keep it breaks free and is knocked down after a first down game for uncle with a hard hit on the quarterback there although this Mountaineer offense continue to battle right in a way Sallah says with a they've been productive they found creases in the Sooner defense oh yeah they made really big plays especially Crawford there's a nice play Nevile Gallimore the guided Mike Stoops a freshman said that he is coming on and coming on and he has the chance to really be a superstar up at the top it's off the ball does a good job of using his hands throwing away the freshman McKidd it makes a play in the backfield Canadian yeah big future they say Howard on second and 11 once the launching downfield does take a shot but overshoots wait brother of Kevin white was such a different West Virginia offense when you had Kevin white Mario Alford talked about Stedman Bailey tavon office Austin a couple years before those guys was the bubble screen bubble screen deep shot neat shot an occasional run yep they don't they don't quite have obviously that you're talking about some dynamic talent you can go back a little further when they advance them and Bailey and Tavon Austin I mean they've had some great receiver play over the years here these guys me right now white is a junior a little bit more of a possession guy Gibson can get vertical on you and shorts is more your option route guy underneath another nice play by that Oklahoma defense upfront that's a loss for Crawford and third down shot the linebacker here Parker cleaned it up then shot a linebacker and also the safety hunter does a nice job Stephen Parker guided played a lot of football a year ago and with the loss of those six leaders we talked about a little earlier he's kind of become one of the guys Mike Stoops told us that this week that Parker and Ahmad Thomas and Jordan Evans they're their studs have got to play their best football here down the stretch Westbrook back to receive the punt a cold night and easily kicked that ball it's not a very good one it will bounce out about sideways at the 40yard line Oklahoma back to work Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart won't you buy dr. pepper it's a college football tradition Kay Jewelers for 100 years every kiss begins with Kay and GMC we are professional grade overall Joris is when you don't see alive unfortunately without shirt also you throw that again poochy Anderson perhaps we'll have a comment on that tonight after the USC UCLA game over on ESPN throw on the watch ESPN app alright that here we go well Oklahoma's run the ball 18 consecutive plays so let's see if they keep that string going it's not the kind of night that will maintain the Heisman momentum that may feel brought into this game and Mixon makes it 19 straight running plays it expected so keep doing this kirpan Mayfield on the tear that you detailed earlier has really bolted back into contention with the loss by Louisville to Marge action sack 11 times on Thursday night Mayfield all of a sudden has a real shot absol everything to have a shot I mean III know I vote and I have no idea with what two weeks left to football to be played I have no idea what I'm going to do with my vote no idea I mean I've been thinking Laura Jackson the whole time and he's had a great year but I think all of a sudden you you have to look and try to see if anybody else has a chance nobody else has even been in the discussion for me nobody well the Sun Watson you see in the page there Watson had about two hundred two passing hours ran for a couple of touchdowns as Clemson took care of business against Wake Forest but it is you pointed out that the extremely high standard that he said a year ago yeah it hasn't quite met that Clemson still very much in the national championship fixture but I think you're right you're not alone a lot of folks are going to have to contemplate that Heisman Valley hasn't been one of those years where you know you had a candidate other than Lamar Jackson who had the Florida State game that had the Heisman moment yeah everybody that you're trying to state a case for you're trying to bring up well Jarell Peppers he plays 12 different positions very true very valuable hasn't put up any numbers deshaun Watson boy he's a great player we know what he's capable of doing and then there's Lamar Jackson who's kind of separated himself with the numbers he's put up and you know you wonder if people because of an overreaction to the laws where they offense a line I don't know if they showed up officially did they show up to that game in Houston or not but you get Saks was at ten times the eleven eleven my best class one I don't know if people are going to say hey let's open it up because of that one loss or if it's a Vista foregone conclusion he's been so dominant all year Eric ran the Senior Center and we senior an offensive line out of the game the moment this third down and five playing for the Sooners maybe they'll actually throw a forward pass here we'll see No barely a forward masa mix it makes his first catch of the night is really effective weapon out of the backfield as a receiver and they move to stick a nice little kind of a robber pick by Andrews who hits mantoman linebacker trying to get out and take Mixon and coverage had no chance because he hit directly in to the 65 250 pound tied in they move Jonathan Alvarez there's a backup guard over to the center position filling in for Wren now direct snap mixins turn to try to make something happen as a wildcat quarterbacks footing is dropped for a loss over their surprise date you know it down in the red zone they they have that Wildcat package they can be effective but they have completely pushed West Virginia's defense back on their heels with the inside zone play in the counter play in the edge play were they able to get out to the to the edge on the perimeter of the defense literally it will surprise they continue to kind of go back to that a direct snap to mixing a little bit slower developing play now may feel over the middle incomplete or slant into heavy traffic and Mead took a shot couldn't hold on he touched on this early and I agree with you last year Oklahoma's receivers kind of like the Smurfs I love sterling Shepherd I love him watching him now in the NFL but he was undersized and he and Westbrook both were undersized you look at their droop now that would mean it's six five and you have Andrews who's at six five the other freshmen we've seen that 62 was Smallwood I mean it's a different group different set of wide receivers that they have to try to get the football to Gina Lewis then takes exactly a big guy he has not gotten a catch yet tonight and they fake it and it's a mixin in his Hall down for a short gain Darian Howard knows tackle their makes the stop and it's for fountain so you wonder if Heisman voters will consider this just one of those games and where Mayfield wasn't going to get involved or one in kind of game we got out to an early lead and not downgrading to that he's 41 to 7 and if you didn't see this game you think wow Mayfield must have gone crazy again and he just has it needed to know it's not anything that he did bad is it they've been able to run the football all night fibers the way it bounced around and rolled dead and about the 16 yard line little hug huddle together in the upper deck Curtis has brought the allsafe bugs with us and that occurred time is the most anticipated street cred of this season it sure is we've been doing it all year with Allstate myself handing out street cred on Twitter spotlighting the best performance to the day in college football and there they are Oh the Colorado boss knock it off number $22 Colorado huge home win they are legit bro you should be proud offense is playing well the defense has been chippy all year long and did it again today for Jim Levin Crawford knock down ask one more game they covered the wazoo receivers well they hit hard it tackled well welcome Randa they threw it down and they played yeah they played smart and in a big emotional home game by the way that was a really good offense that they went up against today and all of a sudden there's a the first hole yeah if they beat Utah at home next week the Colorado will win the Washington State wins the Apple Cup next Friday Kareem they match for the Rose Bowl huh yeah play that again real select let's say that again Washington State and Colorado could play for a chance at the Rose Bowl the big Rose Bowl I wouldn't pass the dated yeah yeah yeah those those mean nothing those cards by the way they give a shout out in a Birkenstocks there and then different stuff to keep the players loot it means nothing it helps the skyler howard figure out where Dana Holgorsen is standing I feel with the Jennifer Garner play person it can only invent something there's makin please patsy rage it just helps him find it what helps him look at over in Africa Parker the car overhead awesome locate aina he likes to you know didn't stand out there in the white he stands back in the bench and I got you know what I'm saying I guess just because there's no Herbstreit play on that car you get a little yeah that's not cool at all well it's been one of those nights you can see Dana shaking the head did you get your team ready for this and they come in now all hyped up after a great week of practice he felt they were completely ready mentally and physically for this and he got off to a bad start and it got ugly pretty early in TT inside access suza maker Mayfield's other town he might be better at halo that he is a quarterback halo is kind of a shooter futuristic military kind of game he claims to be one of the best in the world at halo where you could make money doing this we can roll in with your own headphones like that with Halo I don't know there's a lot of serious player you're pretty much a baller ya take that pretty serious he thinks he's by far the best on campus he challenged every other if he's putting multi time with Halo then a lot of quality time I think some Mark Andrews his tight end might be the secondbest on campus with Wow he's got it barely enough time to master a very challenging video game of goals going to school and playing quarterbacks at a high level they fake it to Mixon actually he has the ball and is not down after a four yard gain Baker Mayfield has improved so much this year he always has brought that energy going back to last year this offense but Lincoln Riley telling us what an emphasis they put on this this year with him in the pocket making plays from the pocket seeing coverage and if you compare him to last year we often scrambling and creating and still can do that but it's a totally different feel now with him in that pocket fire is over there far side and you can catch is made by Geno Lewis you mentioned him the Penn State graduate transfer lien and we moved for six see his numbers are somewhat similar completion percentage a little bit higher but what does it show up there is like I said he I think just threw reps and experience knowledge seized coverage more comfortable in the pocket but still has that play making ability try that X Factor when everybody's covered he's going to pull it down and create number one completion percentage in Oklahoma history one of the most efficient season is a pastor who ever seen the NCAA has a chance to break the record if he stays on pace you Mixon cannot get the exists on his wrestled down right at the marketer by more recent winning early in the year I thought listening to his coach is going to confirm this when they were playing Houston and Ohio State he had injuries to T Ryan and Westbrook they were still playing but just not quite the same as they are now and I think he sensed that he had the press he had to try to force the issue try to make plays and I think from the bye week after Ohio State in the last seven games I think you've seen totally different guided trust the players around him and kind of letting the game come to him now as opposed to trying to force the issue here on takes off he's got another year of eligibility left against the faculty arrest and they call voted in June to give him back that year and Lincoln Riley till this Thanks Baker's going to come back Baker wasn't too eager to get into that question with me but but the coaches are very hopeful he'll come back and use that last year I would think he would come back we need he's 6 1 and 210 pounds and I'm not prototypical size in other words no not necessarily and they go to Columbus next year as young as this team is it's another chance for the Sooners to have an outstanding football team and why not come back for your senior year he could turn fro though and go in the Halos circuit is you can burn each other yeah Sam that's good point fair Mayfield fires over the middle into traffic a juggled interception Rasul Douglas with his seventh pick of the season the rest of the team has four combined a terrific play Mayfield running smile that one off you know he is six to 208 pounds really long arms this time he's in great position see the link they're able to get around Westbrook without interfering with him knocked the ball in the air and it doesn't give up on it ends up intercepting the footballs you said his 7th of the year just has natural ball skills and a guy that's really worked hard to get to the point where he is now junior college guy now then in senior year College in Long Island and here's a guy that any battle with grades he had to work hard just to get academically eligible here and he told me he was ready for the matchup with desk whether he has really had materialized has prospered again to take top and both in the open field and gusting profit rumbling down one more time into the red zone an absolutely monstrous night in defeat for Crawford is he's gonna get 300 yards of this rate just look at these linebackers just completely take themselves out of the play you had hunter and Beal and is almost like they had a blindfold on they didn't they didn't find the ballcarrier dollars an easy play for Crawford and get 45 yards now they pitch it to Gibson on the near side and yes he did fumble down inside the 5 but 274 rushing yards with the quarter and 4 minutes to play give it to him again he bolts forward down inside the 10 what I love to see from the kids is here they are down 41 to 7 it's not been their night but he's not given up he's out there fighting and competing that's what you love to see if you're Dana Holgorsen and you're on this staff and you're looking out there not only you're trying to make sure that you guys try to give you every chance to come back obviously can be pretty challenging to do that but it's a very least who wants to compete who has the heart if you learn as much right now as if you're up in a game like this I think he was certainly mad at himself for giving up that fumble early on and now on a third and 1 this time they've been basically an exchange and execute the sneak for the first down so he's mad at himself for for giving up that bumble and comes back and runs with real determination EPS and shows why this guy could have a future playing this game yeah absolutely like I said I I love to watch guys when they're in these kind of games to see who wants to kind of continue to compete who wants to shut it down if you learn a lot about a guy's character about his competitive spirit in a game like this who's the guys again came here with his wife whom he says is his inspiration is driving for us and too young kids nice nap Howard keeps it and he'll score the Mountaineers and of a 57yard touchdown drive on the board for the second time tonight so they take advantage at the interception by Douglas put six points up on the board for just a minute 37 put a frustrating night for the quarterback the Mountaineers you find the endzone on six yard run 13 3 rushing touchdown for Howard so Douglas quarterback a very athletic interception and he's making a case for allamerican status you get seven picks as a corner you're in the conversation juggling catch sets up the touchdown drive Howard picks it himself 41 14 carefully office with your studio update number 13 USC taking on UCLA at the Rose Bowl force drive of the game Mike faithful to Jordan lastly for the 56 yards for Bruins on the board first 7 nothing on the SPN Chris hurry back to you Cassidy thank you big 12 country the Sooners in control talk about the race in the big 10 East momentarily which will come down to two ballgames on the final weekend one of course in Columbus where we'll be at noon at a time and one in Happy Valley where the Lions will host the Spartans the high pickoff take in I want to be up man and the center is running across to the 37 yard line so Penn State's got a twenty five nothing lead at the moment over Rutgers as they begin the fourth quarter in Jersey they'll go to 7 and 1 and they will host Michigan State which incredibly today lost its seventh conference game so Kirk the Lions by virtue of that headtohead win over Ohio State would have the tie break if Ohio State beats Michigan at home if Michigan beats Ohio State they control the destiny by the headtohead win over Penn State but be careful is assuming anything always the college football but careful Penn State is an assumption they'll beat Michigan State I think it depends on if the Spartans show up and play with with some energy if they play the way they did against Ohio State today at Michigan a few weeks ago they'll they'll be in that football game with Penn State but you make a good point after really selling out at home today and there's a Swiss conversion in the lead right Dantonio gamble tried to take the lead there late in the game the pass was intercepted on the twopoint try and they never got close after that so now they got to go on the road that's my Willie shut it down that's one point how much gas do they have left in the tank not only the law today but the kind of feeds in that they have had to endure right in a way they lost yeah near on the other step so if you stopped short of the marker the interesting thing is you know Ohio State Michigan kicks off three and a half hours before that game at Penn State so you know let's say Ohio State wins they will not know was they win the division until the result of that game in East Lansing excuse me in Happy Valley but Ohio State fans let's say they do beat Michigan may have mixed emotions do you want to win the division you want to go to Indian play for a conference championship or do you just take your playoff bid sitting there as a non divisional winner not have to play right Asin or somebody yeah third one this is a tackle and that has been a real rarity as pi z ER white got in the backfield and stopped iran it'll be fourth that but that he has come so close tonight on the back side of chasing down P Rhine on some of these slower developing plays in this time he got a great jump off the ball and was able to get to him this time short of the first down it must be one of the only times we've seen an Oklahoma ball failure stop by the line David chasing him from the backside all night and they just have been just a step or two slower a little bit delayed and this time he just times it up perfectly driver goes up high to get the snap it's a line drive kick away and we're Jennings makes the first a chance for 20 you ready going to borrow some of us sustain the horses Red Bull therefore college Gambian Columbus a fivehour show 7:00 a.m. if you pick from will you have a bigger desk here they're all kind of mystery guest I don't have you formatted that thing out save a little something for me will you at noon Eastern from the booth for this one yeah we do I don't think why not guys that's fine fans in the rivalry or no well I don't know if people nationalize how dominant Ohio State has been headtohead 10 of 11 10 of 11 yeah my kids have a real warped perception of that rivalry ours with a downtown shout and Gibson collects it inside of 20 still fighting three yards and finally west virginia makes a down field point in the final seconds of the third quarter I know what we I thought again we would see tonight instead of attacking downfield an area that's been a pro much Gordon Thomas okay it happened all year he's the best cover man but Gibson goes by him and he his eyes get lost and he doesn't make a play 61 year again and proffered hammers ahead and there's a 10 yard line that will be the final play of the third quarter after three quarters the Mountaineers have a a 62yard edge in total yards in this game the meaningless stats Department as Crawford is down into three back after this and it worked for your local ABC station so Cranford is run for 284 yards dealing with some cramps on a cold evening he was drinking some Gatorade they're getting stretched out he's helped off not in the backfield at the moment the Mountaineers begin the final quarter with a second and four in scoring position and keeper without the goto running back in there and they lost Kennedy McCoy remember on the first carry of the game so they're very feared that position Russell shell we have not seen tonight he's one of their physical backs he's not quite healthy yet nice play there by Caleb Kelly who was a highly touted fivestar linebacker out of California so again following the fullback in scoring his second touchdown tonight this Skyler how Mr Pett fidus step now as the Mountaineers begin to make this a lot more respectable the linebackers here again are one of them two occupied here by the guard he takes himself out and there's nobody left to make a play here he's Java cut a nice cutback there by Howard again he was enough with his feet and make you have to respect that hasn't had a great night throwing the football but made a few plays at his feet the second touchdown of the night on the ground interesting Holgersson tell me that although howard is a quiet guy is a lot churning inside and the way that they get energy added he says i'll fight was about to start arguing with him before the game and it helps me get some energy out I get his energy out it somehow it works powered his second rushing touchdown and West Virginia has now gained 467 yards so Mike Stoops they've got the lead but he still can't be thrilled that at least the New Year six and the college football playoff say about 75% of West Virginia's fans bailed out for the ones who are still here we're on their feet cheering the effort of this team they've gotten a couple of touchdowns closer after halftime here 14 7 inch second half for West Virginia the 20point game more bizarre things have happened oh yeah kickoff is taken by mixing the up man hear me Myrtle spray and is snuck down at near the 40 we're talking a lot about the Buckeyes and old reigns next weekend of course both teams were upset on the road Penn State for that pass rush and that field goal returned for a touchdown got them 24 21 and then Michigan last week beaten on a walkoff field goal in Iowa Buckeyes surviving by one today in East Lansing Wolverines that have lizard in the second African locking up the Hoosiers and they will collide yo for food the banks of the Olentangy at high noon Eastern Time next week we'll have it for you proudly Oh you've gotten stale on offense lately Kirk let's see if they can get the rhythm back here it's beer on on a reverse to Westbrook evades one tackler in battles trying to get near the line of scrimmage if he swung down there by white no gain you talked about how the crowd is reacting the fans that are still here to the effort by this one's for Kenya team and I think you and I would agree with it I mean this is a team that was completely down and out and not looking good at all and all of a sudden with a couple quick scores they're down by 20 and with the way Oklahoma's defense is playing and the way Howard's gaining some momentum now it's really about the Mountaineer defense trying to get the ball back to put Skylar Howard they feel rolls out to the peak downfield nobody there now he'll run for his life and take a bigot ball comes out goes out of bounds again that shot was delivered by white sinners lucky to avoid a turnover that ball in that ball stays in bounds obviously it's potentially a turnover in the ball going the other way for West Virginia he's still in bounds white right there hits and the ball goes up in the air and just happens to bounce out of Bounce there's nothing but Navy jerseys down there waiting to jump on top of that football but nonetheless got a little bit of juice little energy right now for the West Virginia defense the Sooners facing a third and 10 white still playing hard that's for sure it feels from the pocket puts it over the middle and Peter I makes the catch in lost the ball I'm going to say going to spot him down I'm going to spawn them down back near the marker it's going to be I think a little bit short Iran just nearly got away for a huge gain watch Walters right here try to stay with Pierre I'm coming out of the backfield balls thrown out in front that's the little thing but the accuracy and how important that is to get the ball out in front but on third down with Walters playing man does a good job clearly down right call down on the field now it's a fourth down buddy I thought he leaned across him it did not get him down where they spotted it so it's 14 they need a full yard and the Oklahoma offense was lobbying hard to stay out there they wanted to go for it and the coaches said on a punt team wow I thought he may have to hurry here they may just spend a timeout cuz the playbyplay they might want to look at at this spot I thought he extended himself this his knee touched maybe they had the knee touched right there well I do think that they he got a lot farther than they were they spotted it see right there the left knee is down he really looks like he's about the forty seven and a half yard line quickly about a half yard sure it was slighted about a half yard where he actually had the ball they took it they took a delay of the game anyway here on on this to set this punt up at the West Virginia defense does their job to get it back to Howard and that offers Jennings is back deep and you're right there there's some juice in the West Virginia defense there's actually some light for this team Seibert gets it away Jennings is backpedaling and he'll make the catch on his knee at the 15yard line back within 20 and they get the ball back Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart Black Friday is back at Walmart shop Walmart calm all day Thanksgiving in part by dr. pepper it's a college football tradition and viewing it's Black Friday all month long as your Buick dealer Huff homes only touchdown after halftime was this big six by Jordan Evans soup here to pull up a bit as he's headed to the end zone yeah he has not been back on the field since then clearly something bothering him is his defense and what we've seen is Rueben hunter in for him it's totally different look at his defense against the run with Hunter in there Howard looks at short juggled held on by Durant and gets out across the 25 yard line he's a leader is obviously when you're a middle linebacker you make a lot of the calls and you're in an important part of the group oh my gosh I mean he gets two calls and gets everybody lined up he's the outfit he's the leader and you take him out of there and you're taking away your playmaker you saw Crawford be treated for cramps in the last possession he's back the game and it do used to churn away short gain there but he's within 13 yards of a 300 yard rushing night our took a peek and now I'll just take off and slide he did slide short of the marker about a couple of yards it'll be third down now the Sooners are trying to keep everything in front of them they don't want to give up an easy one give up a big play it's been an issue for them see what happens here on this third down and if they can get pressure on Howard it again takes off and again with his legs makes the play and keeps the drive going wedding tip trick is incredible with one guy Jordan Evans being taken out of the lineup and what that does to your run defense and how you feel and how aggressively or lack thereof you fill on the run fist it does not stay the same energy from this defense without Evans out to white on the edge and if your whole verse and you notice that you keep trying to run on the ball let's go against what well conventional wisdom would say we're down to 20 points we got to take shots I think yeah I think you got to keep throwing the football and mixing in occasional run here and there just to let them know that you you still have it but this defense has just not been the same you wonder if it's because they have the big lead they're losing their edges because Jordan's Evans about it but this feet watch these linebackers it's almost like they have blinders on they can't find the ball carrier Crawford's gone Bynum they're over pursuing it they're not filling the gaps Mike Stoops talked about gap integrity your scholar Howard just patiently waiting for the blog new linebacker hunter his man handled that time by Kyle Bosch so Jordan Evans going on to this game has definitely had a negative impact on the Sooners defense sooner defense it's been unbelievably riddled by injuries we talked about Charles Walker's retirement from college football to get ready for the draft concerns about concussions Matt diamonds had some personal issues he's not in there the loss micaiah quick one of the better corners against Texas he was out in numerous other injuries to other reserve players Evans is not a guy they can afford to have at him and just being helped off the field there is a Quran quote so and he's been a key guy in this to him so he continues to get thinner and thinner and this was kind of a young defense as far as leadership was concerned coming into this year they lost most of their alphas and guys were around for two or three years his starters they lost six guys so and then you the guys had had returned have been beat up and fueled them it has been removed from the team Howard has 20 of time whoops it downfield for Gibson and applied for interference Jordan Thomas running with him got there a little too early not only early he his left hand got it got engaged with the the shoulder pad and just kept gibson from getting to the football watch his left hand come over top pass it off Eric but number seven is ears their travel to do signed autonomy right there comes right over the top of him definitely interferes in West Virginia moving into Oklahoma Territory here you made it you made a good point though the number of big shots to pass plays the problems the secondary they've had you know no lead node is a guarantee no they got the ball to start to drive I'm thinking if they can score by about the nineminute mark that's about marriage that's a pretty good goal for them maybe they get in even before that Howard again takes off that time they're ready for it and you drag down by a manual Beal within your linebacker especially with Evans down Beals got to make plays he'll come from our right this chases chases Howard down from behind range e athletic actually grew up in Columbus went to junior college route and now make employers in his defense and with Evans down needs to be even we'll have more of it more of an impact factor tonight with eight Howard from the pocket again launches down field White's open touchdown Mountaineers this is getting real interesting now good look did he control the ball terrific layout good catch definitely a catch great effort to layout and make the play and it really welldesigned play for West Virginia the Howard has that ability he can make that throw downfield keep talking about it against this Oklahoma secondary keep taking your shot that was against the true freshman Jordan Parker big brother Kevin of course is from a mountaineer firstround draft pick of the bears no doubt looking in proud of that play got two younger brothers you get to run and you got kazeer as the linebackers been making impact plays on defense tonight yeah absolutely watch this welldesigned play it really opens up the post they're going to work to the middle here and then here's the post here behind it watch how this opens up the inside receiver short takes the safety with him opens up the middle of the field he lays it out and away from the freshman Parker for only white can extend to make the play a touchdown after halftime here at the Oklahoma possession punt interception hunt on their only points came on that Jordan Evans pick six the Mountaineers meanwhile have scored touchdowns of the last three possessions in turquoise with about 18 minutes to football up loose 417 with about 10 minutes to play now the 13 point game they get a stop here and think to get really interesting now some hesitation as Mixon eventually receives the kickoff and after a little confusion makes a nice return at the 35 yard line our Pacific Life game summary showing you this score line in the Mountaineers given up for dead abandoned by almost all of their fans here only a seeming like 10,000 maybe in the ballpark with Crawford running Howard a couple touchdown runs and long touchdown pass just a moment ago Allawi point game how does Lincoln Riley start to attack these two backs that were so dominant the first half 20 yards in this second half that's it he's mixing diving forward for about four you know the first half they were controlling the line of scrimmage they were running just a couple different plays there was a counter run which he just saw kind of a counter there also some inside zone and they did a really good job of being able to get on the perimeter with P Ryan and mix it haven't seen that at all in the second half may feel fools it takes a shot over the Hanover's Bregan almost intercepted it was at the feet of jeremy Tyler third town Justin aren't a linebacker closing in on Baker Mayfield may have caused him to throw this ball high you could see him kind of falling off of the throw as he was delivering the football the route was great he sat in the open spots and sown nice soft spot wide open we credit the rush of the linebacker aren't that time with maybe affecting the accuracy the throw from Baker Mayfield now nearest just get the football back right here now just 13 they come after Mayfield who backpedals and delivers into traffic it's a first down strike it finally involved Mark Andrews the fine sophomore tight end we talked about Baker Mayfield's growth as a quarterback in the pocket third down crucial moment to game makes the throw from right there in the pocket now they run tempo that was a huge play the way this game is gone 10 minutes not to mention how he missed a wide open receiver on second down Lincoln Rowley goes right back to his guy trust him to make the right read and to make an accurate throw and he delivers there on a pick third down Andrews is often an important part of this passing game a big tall tight end his first reception tonight he ran and mix in the backfield together Nixon breaks a tackle stiff arms and the Sooners finally at the running game going again down near the 30yard line what I love about that is there no tendencies they can run right they could run left this time they run it to the left he Ryan this time is a lead blocker on the counter play but they can run that just as easily to the left sometimes when there's just a one bag there's some tendon change based on with it he's lined up to the right of the quarterback or to the left with both of them back there they're calling their play based more on the formation of the defense and where they're their strength of defense in the weakness I may feel keeps it if the block them is and slides down if the 30 takes a shot after he was sliding no flag and may have been a broken play looked like it he put the ball out there to pee Ryan and nobody was there he decided to keep it himself and take off pretty good effort there by Walters to layoff he started to come in and then looks like he tried to pull back instead of coming in hard Mayfield wanted to fly but didn't appear to warrant it Mixon is the lone back now spins back and out of state don't be dropped for a loss just in arms linebacker it was a fine high school quarterback in these parts made to tackle aren't makes the play but Schuler 88 right here watch him work they're slanting and angling his effort against Brown right there is what caused him to have to give up on the play and try to bounce it to the outside where Mark was able to make the play so art gets to tackle but the big defensive lineman who's a freshman out of Florida his visibility of slant and take on the big tackle Orlando Brown was the difference of the flood saw arms Arabic pursuers guided freshman he played 102 snaps in Austin hundred and two snaps as the redshirt freshman last week Mayfield I'm gonna take a shot downfield has all day to throw this delivered underneath an attempt is made by Geno Lewis and he fights down inside the 15 yard line this gives you a great look at an experienced receiver just sitting right where he needs to and not panicking look out to your left right out here look how he just waits and waits and just kind of sits there in the hole and eventually because of the protection up front Baker Mayfield is able to locate the transfer from Penn State for a big first down another conversion Luis is a guy that has 90 career catches for the Lions so a welcome addition to this receiving for ease region of emerges the number two guy behind Westbrook here I'm in the game he barrels ahead talked about the suit ale Baxter has been very democratic tonight via and young I had 27 carries mixings had 24 carries 135 and 147 respectively yeah that's the beauty though having these two together healthy and taking some of the wear and tear off of one another this drive right now talk about trying to answer not only get points but they're close early who already worked over four minutes off the clock after not picking up many first downs at all here in his second half Mayfield on the Blitz goes endzone jump ball incomplete than was Meade and now flight comes out he was battling Fleming there Fleming who transferred from Iowa was a nickel back to the Hawkeye's last year that time we keep talking about defensive backs not finding the ball Fleming did not get his head turned around and have a chance to make a play on the ball and he was engaged with the receiver they hear about number 24 of the defense the ball would be placed at the 2 yard line first down he's pushing and shoving and if he had his head turned around he's ok but look at his head he does not get his head turned around it's pass interference good plug at the jersey air progressive pylon Ken gives you another angle of it there's the beauty of having a bigger receiver at 6'5 I mean he threw that ball almost up to the lights knowing that the big guy can go up and make a play at 6'5 first and goal at the 2 now Westbrook in motion but it's Pierre on Sutter steppin trying to crawl and extend the ball almost bottom just short he tried to cross knee was down before he did get in there a lot of action in that backfield with the jet sweep knees down right there kind of scoot and scrunch across aha Levens playing this drive coming up see if they feed P Ryan again looking for the touchdown hattrick tonight Mayfield on his sneak let me get a shove he sure didn't get there the third down flowers the fullback come and shove them across but it's just too much traffic yeah I know now they give it to it huh right is the latest touchdown signal in history they finally unpiloted yeah now they're talking they want they want Baker Mayfield to stay out there take another look at this this is the most delayed that was a 6 l have ever seen but Dave lookit I ran down there and maybe to make a call for quick forever I mean I guess there's a lot of guys to untile I get to get at number 6 though they did about four blue jerseys to peel away I mean I don't think the Vols in the end zone that you can't see where it's extended I think that last pushed there I'm surprised it wasn't it was it a whistle before I applied like finding the ball I don't know what what you could see Dave they would overturn the call in the field of touchdown they'll try to find something the ruling on the field was a touchdown the previous play is under further review buddy this is all you buddy okay when they have a pile up like that and they can't find the ball what the officials are going to do is dig to the bottom of the pile see which team has possession and he's going to look at it and dig the found and also you can't see if the runners actually down or when he's on bodies I guess my question would be wasn't there for progress or wasn't there whistles blown to indicate that the play was over they were looked like they were in a pile for seven or eight seconds if we hear a whistle and then he goes down after the whistles I mean I mean yes he might have been embodies but about eight seconds later he finally lunges across the logo line it was what when the whistle blew he wasn't he wasn't anywhere in the spirited to the goal line so they could do they could do a replay review Dave involving the audio and the timing of the whistle as well they get pretty which will get everything but they've got to find the ball okay and if that whistle did blow and it's clear that the ball is short it's not going to be a touchdown because that means they rule forward progress on the field now Fort progress is only reviewable on a first down or score and this is a score so they can't look at it from that but I don't know where they're going to find the ball that's that's what they have to find is be very interesting well the snows returned Kirk believe this game began blizzard and now the snow has has returned along with the stiff breeze what the of course it's always about the ball breaking the planet and we don't really don't have any looks to show anything that we can ATT the plane nor the ball so we're over a two and right there's no way that they'll be able to reverse this the problem is you're right you hear the whistle blows and it appears that the ball may be sharp when we can't see the ball that's the problem we've got a big pileup like that like I say they've got to dig the ball out see us position and where does the player have possession if they do to see something to overturn it it would be third and goal the ball you'd figure just inches away here's Castleberry with the verdict to further review their ruling on the field stay in it that's down so not confirm but stands I guess they couldn't see anything completing the football more of the story for the kids at home just whenever you get into the goal line just keep wiggling the way Pete Ryan was into that end zone who knows maybe they'll give you a touchdown absolutely so Mayfield caps to drive that covered 65 yards in 11 plays and as you said importantly took five and a half minutes off the clock so he's out there to go for two so to get it back to 21 and they did sort of get back as you suggested they got back on that drive but was working earlier the bread and butter place yep Westbrook in motion Mayfield keeps it fires end zone and Andrews collects the twopoint conversion as he comes across and beats Avery to safety and it is back to a 21point lead with four 37 to play as a sooner stretch finally finally salt this one away the Mountaineers putting up a fight there's a twopoint play again Cassidy Hubbert's with your studio update USC in UCLA after pick set up a shore field Mike maple connects with Jordan lastly for the second time tonight Bruins up 147 in the second on ESPN Chris Harvey back to you interesting Kirk of what does the UCLA victory mean it means the Colorado buffs are headed to the pac12 championship yeah incredible stat here check that out talk about that Oklahoma has obviously well over the 30 point mark tonight as Gibson tries to make the return and is knocked down across the 30 do you think about how difficult it is sometimes to go in the road and operate offensively and and have a field catch this is no foot you know 16 straight now true road games 30plus points they're going to win their 11th straight true road game and their 15th straight big 12 game that's impressive stuff it is it isn't and I'm anxious to see how the committee after this weekend's games with the Louisville loss with some of the things that happened the rest of the weekend what this win tonight will mean is the Oklahoma is sitting at nine and everybody things if they wanted to see an impressive win on their resume what will this win do that Romar struggling there that's the last thing they need another injury to a defensive um he's already been battling an injury and missed four games this year here's your rankings Kirk and again not much carnage above them today to add to Louisville loss on Thursday but but Oakland was still very much in the mix absolutely and you know you look at Louisville out Washington still has Washington State Friday day after Thanksgiving Wisconsin and Penn State potentially could play each other in the Big Ten championship game and there's Oklahoma is sitting right there at number nine more than likely will move up into the top eight this week coming up on Tuesday night they have a bye week as the Cowboys do before bedlam in Norman and a couple of weeks that'll be a shootout Howard fires far side incompletes oklahoma has never had a chance to play for a big 12 championship on its own field they won the big 8 many times over the years those collisions with Nebraska but of course the big 12 championship game was a neutral site and the Sooners will have a chance to do something I haven't done before which is when a conference on their home field at least in the big 12 hour run down and you tackled across the 35 yard line Oklahoma State's playing at a very high level e they went to Fort Worth they took care of business sure defensive performance Mason Rudolph having to having a really good year has changed Washington a lot of weapons on the outside they will challenge Bob Stoops secondary maybe more than anybody has all year they'll go for their 10th big 12 title I would be more than all the other current members have combined and how are effects great coverage downfield and that will turn Iraq over go back you know I'm real quick my thought on how it potentially turns out if Ohio State wins Saturday against Michigan where they're playing at home and Clemson wins out and Alabama wins out those three teams potentially in the playoff the argument becomes potentially if Washington won the backpack 12 championship if Penn State and Wisconsin play in the big 10 championship the winner of that game and then whether it's Oklahoma or Oklahoma State it whoever ends up winning the big 12 those three teams will be who the committee will be discussing and probably arguing over who potentially gets that four spot because there's a lot of hypotheticals and there's time I won't put your feet to the fire right now to say who you take because there's a lot of things to be still be sorted out yes but but if it is Oklahoma we're not we're not presuming they're going to beat the Cowboys so if you're calm down old state fans I get it as be Ryan takes off and tries to add another touchdown to his big night hauled down inside the 10 yard line but if they get the Cowboys that'll be another highquality win this oh you put this one with that one it would be a very strong closing statement a strong closing statement for a team that got off to a slow start with some some injuries and some youth and didn't quite have you know the big guns Westbrook and Pierre ended 100 percent early and they felt the consequences they were 1 &amp; 2 but to their credit after the bye week they've now won eight in a row and are trending and playing much better football especially offensively with this firepower they have they can they can play with a lot of teams they can score a field didn't handle it cleanly hands it up to Pierre on those note taking of the knee here as the Sooners try for another touchdown talked about that reveal of the playoffs top 25 rankings presented by PlayStation for an ASP and then 7:00 Eastern Time and besides the reveal of the top four which is not likely to change frankly there'll be a discussion of the kind of issues you're bringing up but the whatifs and looking ahead is and what will the arguments be if this happens and that happens right which is that's part of the fun yeah it's been a crazy night it again there was a near halt midfield on the warm up it was a very snowy start of the game it's going to get snowy finish inside of two minutes as Pierre I'm sort of picks his way and is knocked down at the 3 yard line a bunch of first coach on judgment which you had a lot of here my opinion suspend chip he's really more in the first half in the second half and I also going to say about Dana Holgorsen it that first half got embarrassing at times with how they were losing their cool and making some mental becoming frustrated to their credit after halftime when this game had it looked like it might just completely get away from them they fought back they really have kept their their competitive spirit and intact and done a good job of staying in this game as P Ryan goes over to the sideline and Mixon also so with the top to tail back out Abdul Adams the true freshmen get to carry and he gets knocked down at the oneyard line they'll look at the stats after this game is oak oklahoma seems like they've got it in the hand as we check out the run again and but they also see the west virginia teen 534 yards of that that's where the other one was a still to touch today that's the touchdown I'm confused I mean there was no evidence Mayfield had gotten to the end zone before and they gave him a touchdown that time Adams clearly you know what a blood to have his first career touchdown give him another chance guys never scored touchdowns careers this was Catholic not gonna get when their Christmas pulls in to watch did the poor yet give the young guy let him get in the scoring column I mean you know did you really need another one for you anyway he'll he'll he'll tell us for a nice day I scored they should have given me why I should have been my first career touchdown yeah I think we could count that one for him so now cyber and daddy ask you have birth awaiting the board wrap up show the baker stats curtain ends up being just 9 for 1569 two touchdowns the interception and as a runner he scored twice including this one actually not a call for Baker Mayfield just his own reading bread that in collapsing eight the outside linebacker came down he made the right read he probably wanted to give it to the freshman more than anybody but it was a walk in with the read that he had and he gets an easy score and Oklahoma after we showed that graphic there for first their first four drives in the second half were an interception and three punts and since then backtoback touchdowns to close the door here in Morgantown and it's going to be before touchdown margin it was for much of this game before the Mountaineers climb back within 13 Viper's twist down inside the pen Gibson then take the long way home knock down at the 25yard line and hear from Baker Mayfield momentarily with Samantha after the final 18 seconds tick away and the Sooners will get to nine and to eight knowing the conference they haven't even started with five straight conference wins in quite a few years they were sitting there one in two after losing the huge losing at home to Ohio State how many people gave him a chance of reeling off you know eight Cosmodrome being back in the playoff picture I almost know when I would somebody meanwhile a monster night for this guy Crawford breaking free still running still running still running way over 300 rushing yards for Justin Crawford tonight finally run out with six seconds to go at the 28 does a flag down as well very late in the play you'll see the entire run stands and Crawford despite his fumble inside the five to play credible evening unnecessary roughness on number 90 of the defense the penalties half the distance to the goal and it's first down I got Gallimore so the rush will stand and Crawford as carried it 24 times for 331 yards almost 14 yards of carry if nothing else you take away from this game is you know you have a guy you can is a catalyst for West Virginia guy you can really build around not just because of his his numbers that he put up but because of the attitude that Crawford runs with and the way this game got away from them he did not give up if anything he played harder when they were in that big hole now we're spinning away what's going to be the final play of the game he fires it over the end zone third most rushing yards ever by the way for Mountaineer Tavon Austin has the record did it against Oklahoma Sooners start fast to furious against the mistakeprone Weston View team and they close strong 56:28 let's go to Samantha with Baker Mayfield well Baker this one started really feisty so describe to me why this one was so emotionally charged even before it started it's always tricky when you play them and press because it's just a physical type of game their physical team though there was a lot of chatter through social media stuff pregame and during the week so it kind of got everybody riled up and then pregame when both teams met in the middle pushing and shoving so it was just kind of that game and we came out with that intensity and we were able to execute early on so obviously early the weather kind of dictated that you had to run the ball but you were able to run the ball so well what enabled the running game to perform that way great offensive line there you're executing and they're playing well right now and then obviously our running back to them looks down with the guys in the country so when you have them might as well utilize them hand it off to them so I'm just here to win games and if I'm handing off that's the fun of me Baker as you know a lot of people wrote y'all out back to those two early LA now people are talking playoff you head into bedlam this week in your mind is this team playing for a playoff spot we absolutely are I think just about the game we're playing right now we're playing well defense coming along let's bring this good team and we came into their stadium and won in a good way so we're playing well yeah we need to keep on making statements and just win the big 12 and see what happens in there last thing for you I know you're a technical you ever played the weather like this absolutely not maybe it reads this or when they cancel school but that's it well you did well congratulations on the way a big breaker yeah Mayfield the team guy obviously a Heisman contender didn't have the kind of passing numbers you'd expect would help this case doesn't care about that because it's going to be the Sooners and the Cowboys in the bedlam series in a couple of weeks for the big 12 championship and playoff consideration in that game is always so much fun every year and especially when there's that much at stake and for fans in that state I know they always hope that it comes down to bedlam and this year they get their wish all right now none of the top for loss but do you reach any of yours and no III think I still have Alabama obviously at 1 and Ohio State in Michigan we'll work that out this Saturday in Columbus and Clemson sitting there for me you know they'll move up if Clemson keeps winning they're going to be in the playoff if they win the ACC and they get a game with South Carolina rivalry game but yeah that's my for right now as we get ready for this first team out is visit the Huskies if the Sooners get consideration is another big 10 so there's get consideration you know I would say that Wisconsin is there you also have to put Washington there we'll see if Washington survives Friday when they take on Washington State in the Apple Cup final take away we knew Oklahoma was it was at a huge offense there's still some defensive concerns though heading into the last game off what they did tonight here that very least you'd expect that to be issued a lot of points both those quarterbacks both those offenses at least going into the game you would think that have a big game for Mayfield said that and the social media that set the stage for the Bison hazard blaming something else on social media when they got to football it was less continued not able to handle the conditions or the emotions as well as Oklahoma and the Sooners go on the road and take care of business 56 28 tonight here in snowy Morgantown game was produced by Bill but now directed by Derrick mumbly a salute to our crew who battled these tough conditions tonight we thank you for watching from Morgantown but you to watch college handy from Columbus at 7:00 a.m. Eastern and then Wolverines and the Buckeyes on ABC at noon Eastern next Saturday the four wrapup show right now and the Cassady hover
