============================================================

late night from Lauren K USA here's the in college football a day before the first BCS standings are released the undefeated number three ranked Oklahoma Sooners are in town to take on the Kansas Jayhawks in a big 12 matchup at the end of a long day of college football the updated big 12 standings Oklahoma State winners in Austin today to go to three and OH and big 12 competition Oklahoma looks to keep pace Kansas windless so far in the big 12 in 2000 I'm Carter Blackburn with former All pac10 quarterback at the University of Washington Brock Huard there's a reason why there's a number three next to Oklahoma's named an excellent football team and we will likely see a major NCAA record broken by one of the Sooners best tonight that's Ryan Broyles a wide receiver just for reception shy tonight of you watching a national record go down and a lot of times you hear instinct for a player well what does that mean Ryan's going to show you for 60 minutes exactly what that looks like it's understanding the space around you it's having a feel for man or zone it's playing for a year starter and being so productive it's also been benefited by having a couple good quarterbacks as well so with four catches tonight Ryan Broyles will move past the former Purdue wide receiver Taylor Stubblefield for the alltime Football Bowl Subdivision NCAA record and Brock mentioned a couple of excellent quarterback to throw the football there was sand Radford and now there's Landry Jones and they're starting to be some understandings that those guys belonging to things that's exactly right I think they're for a few years when Landry was young and fill it in for Sam everyone didn't want to rush to judgment not another different guys Sam's a cut above the number one pick in the draft I'm here to say that Landry Jones is right there at Sam Bradford's level he has really matured this season and had the success on the road that he's had throughout his career at home that to me is what stands out when you can handle adverse situations on the road the way Landry has will you become number one picks in the NFL Draft so those are the laurels of some of the Oklahoma sooner play mayor makers on offense now there's the Kansas defend statistically the worst in major college football so the question is how did the Jayhawks hang with Oklahoma tonight we got to do two things offensively you have to play keepaway Turner deal wants to run it 65 percent of the time this evening they must possess the ball and then defensively they've got to hold Oklahoma took field goals last week in Stillwater they couldn't do anything to slow down the Cowboys eight consecutive touchdown and dry.the Turner Gill and the Jayhawks to have a nice chance tonight they've got to hold these Sooners the field goes down in the red zone okay you would love to get some Rock Chalk Jayhawk magic tonight against Oklahoma like a sneak peek at the BCS standings you champions college football primetime brought to you by King the new business card from Chase make your mark within American Airlines traveled over 250 cities in 40 countries on American Airlines and sprint all football No Limits only from Sprint Campanile towers standing proudly here on the campus of Cayo as it's known University of Kansas 100 college towns around the country but a beautiful day turn into a lovely fall evening and with the BCS standings coming out tomorrow we take a look at the projected BCS standings brought to you by Discover card so this is from ESPN Brad Edwards this was going into action today and rock I guess if you're one of those fans of Alabama LSU Oklahoma State anybody on that list what are you looking for from Oklahoma tonight as far as evaluation is the who's going to move up and down Alabama LSU or number one and two on that list because they've won the national championship at SEC conference five times they've done it defensively in my opinion with front sevens that are bigger and faster and stronger than the competition and I'm here to tell you you just took a look at Travis Lewis there's Frank Alexander this front seven for Oklahoma is SEC s they're big in their front for 300 plus and these linebackers can fly sideline to sideline to me that's what Bob Stoops team has differently and I think the rest of the big 12 and if you're an SEC fan I think this is going to be some competition when you get to national title games senators had won 10 straight SEC ability I liked it too the scene so this is wearing a frock 4:35 is a 37 excellent field position to start our impact players we know you have all this system in Oklahoma starts with the quarterback and Landry's playing so fast what will stand out to you that evening is how sound he is fundamentally he also has some tremendous weapons outside including Ryan Broyles we highlighted his feel and his instincts in the open he also has tremendous hands to open open the captain defensive Russian for Kansas he's by far their most dynamic playmaker a converted running back dr. Haas leading Russian two years ago Ryan groans to the top of your screen lined up in trouble complete the pills on first down looks like he slips saves my bad second in town keep an eye on the Jayhawk big Swilley the defensive coordinator realizes their weaknesses and wants to keep everything in front of him that can be a lot in competition they're willing to give up those quick ditches to avoid explosive play John's throw indicating still so third and pin coming up and for a Kansas defense statistically last in all the major categories in college football seventy points given up but we could go to Oklahoma State exactly where they want to be or thing Oklahoma the third and pinned on five out there to pay you people renowned or way to defend fell through a long way Jones incomplete the broom and three and out just as we talked about Brock here's oh you with all the weapons Jones Royals in the rest decay you Ethan the numbers they worth in the country but a three and out the star I recovered their bike in ago against Oklahoma State this defense gave up eight completed drives for touchdown that's the way you want to start your day the directing dancing along the bow line manages to slip out of a tackle and get back to the ten chickfila impact players now Jordan planted quarterbacks undersides they've been very efficient this season top ten in the FDA told us yesterday he's got to weather the storm he knows the Russians coming from Oklahoma led by Frank Alexander for a big man watched the get off at the line of scrimmage why he had five and a half sacks of Jesus has a burn off multiply the foolish realizes do everything he does both on and off the field I know you deep in a sack three to 50 cents on the week ago at the Cotton Bowl Dean sim reading on a first down thanks John so what are we expect out of Kansas offensively than a lot of that they know that they can't run sideline to sideline with the Sooners they also know that if I rob this line that by their center here my hatch has 40 career starts the strength going to be running right at Oklahoma Jordan went to sophomore to the true freshman security Shepherd who is wrestled down the laundry vertically make it third down and short for the Jayhawks fine line the Chuck lon offensive coordinators walking and 15 and he's a guy that likes up tempo remember he coached at Oklahoma goats a team to a national championship he also knows this defense has got to stay off the field to watch the mix of tempo and pain also control department trying to speed up that time of possession on Thursday three crackers what we're talking would scramble your numbers down by about a yard Ronelle lewis the junior defensive end makes the stop to force fourth down and at least one alexander 84 lewis 56 those two guys those are for Russia and they combine for 9,000 on bass Network that's more than 34 FBS teams in the heat I'm sick Boyle it's an entire defensive unit authority to punt Ryan Broyles both of them the return game as well too complicated too that downfield walking into Kansas Territory five so the curtain big play for Ryan Broyles comes not in the pass game but in the punt return game always a 35 for Tanner gibbous finally makes stop the challenge is the Turner Gill has in rebuilding this Kansas team is they're limited defensively the stats show that we get into these special teams you've got even backups two defensive players in there and you just don't see the dynamic athleticism may want to take away from my boil but block from Trey Franks 33 yards return for oil walk on if jr. from Lawton Oklahoma has wrestled down by Darius Willis one of the most incredible stories in all in college football the detail by Sports Illustrated his past weeks on his odd career path through NAIA Langston University to the Subway restaurant down the street from Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Dallas 30 in complete the family Andrea Gomes has started an overseas company lately nice job defensively if presenting some different looks to Landry Jones moving in and out of coverage 50 Li si defensive coordinator was very frank with us said hey we can't get a lineup against Oklahoma we've got to blur the image for Landry Jones off to a good start so far look at the move of the guidelines around still moving the change than you see why not just Ryan boiled the great group of receivers brilliant Jimmy field is pretty gifted outside watch the speed moves inside know what I really like so he keeps that round splat so many receivers will drift in that in cut allow that state to cut up underneath but Kenny still keep the flat this is a recyclable homing inside they go to the Jayhawks here goes rather than cut down cut down Oklahoma Jenny Mills makes the grab so after Landry Gillian going over for backtoback impatient to the Kitty filled for a first down and Allen oh you touchdown so it makes containing Oklahoma so very difficult you see Broyles they have tied in Hannah inside and Kenny Stills missed the first couple games won a suspension one an injury and all he's done since he's been back the last three is catch touchdown passes continue to highlight that Mohawk and get inside of those DBS to get Landry Jones at ideal target to hit Michael Honeycutt for the PAP seven nothing start for Oklahoma so after a three and out for Landry Jones in the O you often boomer sooner shows up in Lawrence touchdown Oklahoma Kansas defense the ranks at the bottom all the major defensive categories three and out to begin against though you and then throw those quick strike touchdown rod Turner Jo behavior analysis major back in the day said my offense and special teams are seen enough positive images we can build on defensively we've got to start putting some things together I was an interesting discussion after he talked about we've got those guys are going to see in season five extremism five of five years around the corner at the twenty which we check in with Wendy net ruler pushing the other direction no problem Carter thank you very much a look at what's going on around our ESPN networks over on ESPN over and in Florida a onepoint game at the end of the third quarter and on ESPNU Maryland has surprised undefeated Clemson they leave 38 to 33 3 minutes left in the third quarter as well Maryland leading Clemson way they Rock allen key a few upsets today Michigan goes down Georgia Tech goes down constant find all the way up to show Brad Edwards projected ranking surprised to see that was offered for Maryland genes been picked in our thighs that could hear from he dipped it on first down goes across the 35 that's the package for this median talented Tony Pierce into the strange business group up front that's where all their experience comes from they like to pull and kick guys around a Pierson by far the fastest Jayhawk just a true freshman Chuck long so I've got a package of about five plays to utilize that see first down give goes badarian Miller the true freshman from Blue Springs Missouri spikes the left tackle redshirt senior 28r attacks the Center for T starts Maren jelly left guard 11 consecutive very biblical experience group has got to give Webb some time and get some pushing their own run game play I can wet ended up to the right side completely Corey Shepherd and stays in bounds in a nice play by Erin Holden strong safety who wears number 12 tonight for Oklahoma this is now the Oklahoma defensive tradition memory of Austin box where every game a different member the oud fence will wear his number 12 Austin blocks the linebacker who passed away last man so Erin Coleman sophomore strong safety wears number 12 tonight he is usually 14 Vangie facing third down and five red inside give for a dangers first down is the Jayhawks get creative on third and five Racine Sims Miller Pearson a whole stable of very young backs it's the one thing the Turner Gill feels very good about his team I said he earlier there's some positive images to take off in Philly this is a top 20 run game in the FBS and he likes his stable of very diverse running back web and pay you to that Jayhawk at centerfield completed on first end smart plate you run a couple bubble screens what's the play that comes off of it the fake bubble screen and pump problem is Bob Stoops teams defensively are so sound they see this scheme a lot of these principles to chuck long ran at Oklahoma Brent Venables very familiar with the other thing that will jump out to you with Oklahoma the amount of speed on the back end they sacrifice eyes that safety a linebacker to be an even faster group defensively then back in his running back the second down and ten at the coffee bean in Missouri rolling on second round Iran and Webb will scramble out about the year the 50 Tom work forces him out of bounds and Webb walking it slowly back towards beer keep an eye on Jordan Branagh lovely community did zippy walk it back third down and seven get throwing incomplete and that's unfortunate that offensive line that I told you is very experienced if you remember watching the Red River Rivalry a week ago Texas just got pounded their quarterbacks taking the beating with 8 sacks little line game there from the front for that group up front picked it all up that's the pitch ever got a call a boil those kind of 33yard attorneys first one to turn opportunity of the night this one inside the 20 no opportunity for Broyles to run that one back Landry Jones in the Oklahoma offense get the football we come back to Laura ESPN college football primetime is presented by triple hops brewed Miller Lite taste greatness and in part by Chrysler imported from Detroit yes indeed basketball is around the corner around here in Lawrence Kansas and few folks are paying attention to basketball in Lawrence Karen campuses always that sight saw Taylor and Thomas Robinson would have to step up played big roles this year the big Phelps Jayhawks if they go for an 8th Street Conference championship but they'd like to add the fiber trophy athletic 2008 Landry to Hawaiian birds in the Oklahoma office back on the field and Dominique Whaley goes spinning across the 24 a know you first down makes college football special is when you can have a walkon like this kid come in so gifted athletically just watch his burst this evening third second in short coming let's check in with Wendy Carter thank you very much mister Taco Bell video update as we head west Stanford in Washington State Stanford was a 107 lead near Andrew Luck Levine Toyota and it's a 177 ballgame five to play in the third quarter personal and all the other games throughout that I hear in Lawrence Kansas ranked Oklahoma the BCS standings coming out tomorrow where will the Sooners be in that first BCS ranking offside defense number 97 the penalty will be 5 yards and results in a first down when you're undersized and out man you've got to use slant twist Dunlop a movement I talked to you about the movement they're trying to create in the secondary to confuse Landry Jones it's the same philosophy within your front devil and you can't just line up and take people on Turner Gill says we've gotta get movement and gotta anticipate and sometimes that believes offside penalty giving all you first intent going a rare scramble from Landry Jones usually sticks to the pocket but Dillon scrambling for a fiveyard gain that's why he's been sacked just three times this year I think of any statistic I've seen not only is maturation and handling Road adversity understanding that clock in your head which is so critical to quarterbacks especially when Landry takes snaps at the next level to be sacked just three times within this scheme and as much as they throw it that's impressive Brian Boyle is lined up at the bonding between the second five or 85 for Oklahoma Jones looks that way Royals make the first catch of the night across the 50 going down three catches away a career in CA a month like Brandon Weeden a week ago for Kansas when you blitz Oklahoma you leave oneonone situations and Whedon exactly like Landry Jones will get that ball out of the hands to all of these playmakers when I have a slot and a flanker and a split end that can all do damage makes it awfully difficult to try to call signals offensively Oklahoma thought instakill 50 then it's a lie on first down there's over the poram in the player for the Kansas Jayhawks on the stop along with Richard Johnson junior game amazingly who pointed out Brock as a running back led the team in rushing yards two years ago as a freshman over 500 rushing yards and now he's one of the key players for Kansas defensible complete boils couldn't get the football secured Lubbock Smith they're in coverage and here's third nine coming up again for Oklahoma well credit Kansas right there you found Landry Jones you want to go to his quick hitter they took his number one option away if you're going to have a chance to get Bob Duke team and Landry Jones who holds 12 school records you better make him reach that a couple times better make them move his beat better not allow him to get into complete rhythm Ganges in fact Oklahoma into another third long Dillon stands in the pocket to the right inside the cans is plenty this where the kids are really really good both of them both Brian Broyles understanding how to leverage his body within the scene this is just your two deep coverage your nickel defender trying to run with Ryan Broyles we saw Andrew Jones twice last season at home and how many times did we see those kid points being passes he is at his best between the hashes boy again to the left of lanes ago popular screen picked it was intended for drape brain Steven Johnson senior former walkon from media Pennsylvania nearly got a big pick in the red zone yes many open out of Kansas he's this close we must hold Oklahoma the field goes something they didn't do the first trip to the red zone something that Oklahoma's only scored 59 percent of the time this year in the red zone plays like that and forced those people behind the line of scrimmage by Bradley mcdougal a strong safety makes me third down and long again and for the psyche of your football team this third down is so very critical a little bit more want to tonight from the Jayhawks maybe a little bit of confidence that they can actually make some plays against Oklahoma MacDougall the most talented athlete on the back in what game can just make the play on third and long young through dances forth to the field goal attempt looks like they were trying to set up the screen pass Josh hi Paul and Bob Stoops thinking they were going to get that soft zone coverage that's exactly what they got the credit Kansas is group up front D line linebackers felt that screen snipped it out did exactly what they had to do or the Sooners two field goal opportunity touchdown first time in the red zone for Oklahoma now a 36yard field goal attempt coming Michael money 136 yarder is good so 10 points on the board for Oklahoma but the Kansas defense checks it on mission accomplished Bob Stoops team three points rather than stuff in Lawrence Kansas the Oklahoma Sooners are in town and number three next to Oklahoma's name right now but the big question is when the first BCS standings are released less than 24 hours from now on ESPN where will Oklahoma be BCS countdown presented by Discovery Espeon Sunday 8:15 Eastern continuing on ESPNU 9 Eastern and this is where it gets a little bit tricky because there's a number 3 next Oklahoma that's the AP poll and AP does not go into the BCS menu USA Today coaches poll eres interactive average of the 6 computer rankings and then we go from there but but how without the numbers tomorrow night we will have them ESPN hours away knocked out of the 19 you check in with Lindy Carter thank you a dr. pepper conference 10 update Kansas State exhausted last five meetings with Texas Tech Colin Klein here on the carry a truck for two on a touchdown game state takes a 34:31 lead fourth quarter just under way back to line so I can't distain last week against Missouri how dangerous do you think the Wildcats onto the club that's a huge game for Bill Snyder stands of state team they get that one down in Lubbock they host in just next week and then guess who comes to Manhattan let's blow on the team in a couple weeks the big one the little apple web growing incomplete I'm just a reminder that there is no big 12 championship game this year so when years past we'd be talking about big 12 North versus big 12 South 10 teams right now in the big 12 no championship game building tricks quarterback at Nebraska with a 35 effort offensive coordinator Chuck Long's a note that came just needed to do again feel you deep in have you noticed in this run game when they've had success it's really been between those a gaps right at Oklahoma you can't run laterally against these guys yeah you may mix it up at times but if you're going to have success that you mean more than likely with a big physical veteran group it's going to be pushing that pile right between tackle 16yard pickup there for Miller first intent here contain short gain Travis Lewis senior linebacker from San Antonio make this table you said he's just about your favorite guy in college football when you are a team's leading tackler for three consecutive years and did it the freshman and took away and beat up Brian Bosworth record the fact that he broke his toe still playing through that injury was to be a six to eight week injury he missed one game playing through that with an orthotic just a vocal leader and I loved what Aaron Colvin said about Travis Lewis if he's the guy that was criticized when no one else will and you can do that or you've been as productive as you been in your career Miller on the carry making it third and about six coming up for Kansas that's preventable said you know there's a lot of good numbers out there for Travis Lewis and a lot of honors for him but the fact that he's wearing orthotic and battling the injury and just still rolling right through it and leading the Oklahoma defense Miller and running back on 36 get up around come on Miriam put your free safety from lot on the land makes it cool if that about er and when you've got the 120th ranked defense in America and I know it's early in the game in the first half in first quarter and everything else at your own 43 but fourth and one with some of the strengths that you've got between your guards and center wouldn't surprise me at all if Turner Gill goes for this injured Jayhawk on the field is the Senior Center Jeremiah hatch the redshirt senior captain with 40 career starts under his belt ESPN's Monday night football matches the Miami Dolphins in the New York Jets lost three in a row needing another one of those Jets come back this year kickoff 830 coverage begins 7 o'clock with NFL countdown served by Apple vhm that tells you that the two teams need a win on Monday night and you had Buffalo right we talked about that before the year you thought for sure they were on the rise I told you build to the team build for Super Bowl well unfortunately here in Lawrence Kansas Jeremiah hatch the senior center from Dallas Carter high school still down on the field a veteran leader of the Kansas offensive line and what you never want to see no one unfortunately when you see all the personnel around the veteran captain hatch now actually the gurney coming on the field you know it's a head or neck injury not to speculate but when they take this much care and you see it is immobilized as he's been you're going to be very very careful with those kinds of injuries and if we get any update throughout the night on Jeremiah hatch we will pass that along to you a little incidental contact perhaps with the running back Darien Miller and so a scary moment here at Memorial Stadium and Lawrence and Jeremiah has really been the ringleader of that crew up front he's made starts in his career right tackle and left tackle you look at Turner's team right now coach Gill said to move guys all over the place the number of receivers that are playing defense we talked about a poram already this team's leading rusher two years ago now he's there rush and Turner Gill is trying to do this from within and with youngsters he's not gone the junior college route he's trying to do it with young kids that he's recruiting and freshmen and sophomores really building this program up certainly taking their lumps right now and this would be a significant loss as we've already seen some really good push in that interior run game a lot of it right behind big Jeremiah hatch and while the training staff continues to tend to Jeremiah hatch we check in with Wendy next okay Carter thank you very much Clemson having all kinds of trouble with Maryland tonight the Tigers trail by 18 on two different occasions the Tajh Boyd here two deer on brown and Clemson taking its first lead 40 to 38 in the fourth quarter Stanford and Washington State Andrew Luck complete again Delevigne boy low low their second connection of the night and the cardinal leading Washington State 247 at the end of the third quarter two undefeated teams on the comeback trail here it's 10 nothing Oklahoma on Kansas but the game has come to a stop as the Senior Center for the Jayhawks Jeremiah hatch is still down on the field here at Memorial Stadium and we get any update at all about Jeremiah hatch health status we will pass that along to you Trevor Marin jelly the junior left guard will move to Center when Kansas retakes the field and Chuck long with us yesterday was really praising this group up front the redshirt juniors and seniors that have all been together all five of these linemen have started every game this year frankly that's why they're a top 20 running game right now and now with the loss of hatch it's really going to create some movement for chuck long they're going to slide their left guard marin jelly over to center there's going to be some moving pieces so really for the first time this season that Kansas group up fronts going to have to deal with some new roles and some instability and that's not what you're looking for when you're facing this Oklahoma group in this Oklahoma front seven let's check long on the left side of your screen there Chuck long who had a great run as offensive coordinator at Oklahoma then head coach at San Diego State and the college teammate of Bob Stoops so he's been catching up on the field he knows hawkeye's former hawkeye's in both chuck and turner like the progress this offensive group has made they didn't hide and hide any of that in fact he said we're probably ahead of schedule to be honest with you with where we thought we would be with as many freshman running backs and and freshman receivers and playmakers that we brought in here and really trying to install our system in the last like this of one of your key veterans one of your captains can be a real challenge now for Chuck and his young offensive group to overcome and up until this point it's been one of the bright spots for Kansas was that they didn't have to deal with any shuffling on the offensive line and yet Jeremiah hatch the senior center or legs at this game and the way that you don't want to exit the game you know having suffered a few concussions in my life by no means am i a doctor or an expert but anytime you get that contact from the side of your head that's where you have such little protection and you can take some vicious shots under your chin the back of your head hitting the ground but anytime you see the side shot as you see there from hatch delivered on to hatch and really the immobilization that we have seen from the very beginning of this injury this training staff has been very very careful if they're getting ready to get patch on the cart and certainly for the hospital for evaluation and again if we have any update at all on Jeremiah hatch at any point tonight we're going to pass that along to you immediately now the question becomes at fourth and one Carter does this dictate maybe punting the football after you've been sitting here for a significant amount of time you lose your Center maybe the thought of that interior run game and the quarterback sneak with a coach that's trying to find the spark some positive to build around and and in a group that he knows defensively is taking some severe baby steps and taking a beating this season last in college football decision time here on a 4th in one situation without your leader without your captain without your center now in the ball game so a very scary moment here is Jeremiah hats the senior center for Kansas is carted off the field Rock you've dealt with it every football players dealt with it and you have a major injury and you're on that sideline concerned about your teammate and yet now the game is going and this brings the offensive unit back out or fourth and one I think the right decision here but down run for James ends on fourth down and one and that's exactly how it was drawn up or maybe not so new Skinner mayor and jelly and he bobbled back step on the first play the old Ball Coach told me one time back my father adapt overcome and improvise that play is completely dead Jordan let's kept it cool found his playmaker since Veilleux energy into the stadium we've said before this game kicked off it was going to take a little Rock Chalk Jayhawk magic in the air and Lawrence there it is on fourth and one James Sims previous long garage and his career was 30 yards that scamper goes for 56 how many times do you see on punt returns kickoff cover where the play gets botched in the timing and look at the Oklahoma Sooners just got a little flatfooted there everybody's standing around wondering what in the world is going on really credit Jordan Webb there for not panicking many times quarterbacks who close their eyes try to run up there and fourth one right in the back to the lineman he realized he had an open outlet there and did show some of his playmaking to Venables disgust talk about an emotional swing one of the senior leaders of this Kansas being down on the field the pan momentum swinging and Lawrence's we check in with windy day Carter thank you so much we check in with Kansas State and Texas Tech 34 31 here Collin Klein's Russia's it in for the oneyard touchdown it's now a 10point game 41:31 here in Lawrence Kansas ten seven Oklahoma on kayuu that is the Kansas Center Jeremiah hatch who is just now being lifted into the ambulance on the track here at Memorial Stadium and repeat again if we get any update whatsoever tonight on the status of Jeremiah hatch we will pass it along to you Oklahoma City football Landry killed under Center you have to take a timeout as the play clock was winding down on first down the timeout will begin Jayhawks capitalized on a momentum swing in a little bit of luck against third ranked undefeated Oklahoma when you're playing a team that's more athletic than you that's stronger and bigger and faster dominated all the statistics and your conference sometimes it takes a little luck takes a little flute play there to energize the crowd I guarantee you with some of those upsets through the years stop plays or maybe not quite to the extent that we just witness on fourth and one plenty of times where you got to capitalize on your opportunity oh and they remember that eighty poor win around here big Tom amazingly the last time that these two teams got together in Lawrence 2009 they was unranked Oklahoma winning over Kansas this few years ago a long time ago a big hall football thing would fit get the carry on spin away near a first down before mcdougal finally make the stop and I like that call get back to your strength if you're Oklahoma run right at them that's Roy Finch at 165 pounds running right through middle linebacker Darius will to make it second before let's go in the back field behind go hands off the fence it seems another car trunk for a pinch to the 32 sophomore from Florida who a year ago appeared to be the next great Oklahoma back well Dominique Whaley the walkon ends up as the Oklahoma running back now it's how does Roy Finch and the rest of those other Oklahoma backs respond that's tough running from Finch their time out Kansas before that play called by Kansas in the first half this time I will be for 30 seconds Oklahoma tries to regain the momentum in Lawrence with Landry Jones and the Sooners not often Landry Jones started this game over for passing four oh you right now just 4 of 11 on the knife and hit can just a little bit of credit for taking away his first breed in Landry uncharacteristically inaccurate tonight Jayhawks presenting some problem to the Heisman hopeful out of the Kansas timeout Jayhawk great pressure and a good job in tackling in space there against jazz Reynolds Anthony Davis on the stop in a second by fighting the millions across the 40yard line will its Johnson there on the stop when you play a threefour scheme which is what Jesus employs you got to count on those three down linemen to try to hold on to those blockers and these linebackers got to do a much better job of strafing and make attack plan on first down Phil's got one hand on it couldn't get the second Anthony Davis again in coverage that's just the list we looked at where a foot off a yard off uncharacteristic for Landry completing 69 percent of his passes he stills may have had the opportunity to lay out with two hands there he's trying to catch that little catch and run accident Bailey back in at tailback for second to think don't pump it really out of the backfield knocked out to make it third down even Johnson a weak side linebacker there on the stop now there's something to be said with human nature as well and you watch the game film from last week for Oklahoma State just had their way eight consecutive touchdown drive pitching cats 7 on 7 holding on the road incomplete and google had a bead on that one too is Landry Gilliam staring down a little bit alternative was looking for positive images to replay to his defenders said earlier behavior analysis major there in college really believes in visualization and showing his group play after play after play when they do well when they make the play he's not had many of those looks through the first five games this year defensive over this first quarter he's got something to work with that's plays on fear that inside the 15 Bostic Google who's wrestled down after a short return to the 19 so the Jayhawks had touchdown last offensive possession for Jordan Webb and the offense defense has done its job against Oklahoma only one touchdown in this first quarter after being trampled last week by the Oklahoma State Cowboys if you're jordan web at nat huddle everyone just take a breath take a look at the scoreboard we got a minute to go in this first quarter it into seven Momentum's on our side just the detail appear first and Darien Miller the true freshman from Blue Springs Missouri the positive en over 6,500 rushing yards in his high school career missouri big high school record the iterate Player of the Year on the state of Missouri uranus away second down and short the third like five seconds remaining in this first quarter Harrogate first down it's a 49 by Rennell Lewis I tell you who's not bringing it right now this Oklahoma front for defensively dominated the Longhorns a week ago and if there's any group on any side of the ball that has to bring the energy it's those defensive linemen and right now they are not getting off their blocks that Kansas offensive line is having their way with the front for 15 seconds 14 seconds left in the first quarter flag on the play wet throw intercepted by Harris Oklahoma football there is a flag on the play with six seconds left in the first quarter offside number seven of the defect the penalty would be five yards from the previous spot remains percent negating the interception and Jordan Webb dodged a major bullet I said the when you come out of that huddle just execute the little details very fortunate its Oklahoma in the neutral zone when it is cloudy and you've got a defender like Frank Alexander in your face that ball has got to be sailed out of bounds especially on first down instead of the 10th interception of the year by the oud pen and just keep the football right at the Jayhawk at midfield with six seconds left in the first another guy prior to the snap false start number 70 for the offense five yard penalty remains first giveth and taketh away take a look at what Oklahoma's done defensively OB curious to see if Bret Venable stays in this three down front very effective a week ago with their four down linemen because of what Kansas likes to do in this spread and the shotgun a lot of this three down today Corey Nelson out there on the edge force people kind of adjustment Oklahoma makes to this run game Miller short gain on the last play of the first quarter so a week ago it was Oklahoma State all over Kansas at this point third ranked Oklahoma locked in a tight one for now that's Kansas basketball coach Bill Self Barry Hinson there in the glasses the director of basketball operations did a nice job coaching Missouri State a few years back Bill Self rode the motorcycle in the late night at the fog last night with the rocky I think I'm will leave it up to you to describe the outfit yourself or he had to explain I'm not a wannabe member of the Village People all black leather right men on a customer kayuu Jayhawk Harley I'm not going to say it's been all K you through the first 15 minutes this is about as good as Turner deal could have expected they've run it it's some success fourth and one yeah maybe got a little lucky on a broken play they've had some stops defensively Landry Jones is a little bit out of sorts for Oklahoma Jordan Webb here with a big third down conversion to keep this momentum moving forward low snap again web control fouled away and incomplete Frank Alexander applying some pressure there on Jordan web it was hard Jean Washington who appeared to get a hand on I think he is a little generous with Jordan meeting him yesterday listened them at 6foot he's probably about 511 I don't know if there's a team and college football better than Oklahoma getting their hands actly woodchuck long was fearful of any number they allow those play makers to create 15 takeaways as the Sooners have done this season Alexander and Washington both get a hand on that and get down to punt inside the 20 sunday NFL countdown is now just hours away fitted by IBM Sunday 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on ESPN surprisingly big 49ers Lions matchup tomorrow on the NFL docket boomer and the guys will be getting a second comp out Philadelphia is the dream team sitting there on in for going to Washington you've actually found a one in five of all that found deal the deal football Philippine game it's not just about assembly in the Dutch town Andruw Jones goodness Dominique Bailey how about this Kansas defense I mean Brock and his team punchline is pretty much how you would describe the Kansas defense I mean even Kate you fans just the plain heart tonight and you would expect that at home after being embarrassed a week ago there's pride in this group and Turner said hey we still have hope because I see fighting my guys day in and day out of practice Bailey gets it again on a second down waiting for a signal jump the third takeaway of the season by the Kansas defense Victor Simmons comes away with the football and the eternally optimistic Turner Gill has a reason to praise the kayuu defense with their effort in the first half against Oklahoma Victor Simmons rips it away and recovers so through the first five games of the season only two takeaways fewest in the nation and as it stands right now takeaway by Simmons in the Kansas defense you want to get takeaways you better get helmets around the football and you better teach the fundamentals and when a guy is up in a skill position player you rip that football out that's just great technique you've got three Jayhawks and I think Simmons clearly rips that ball out before Whaley's on the ground and any part of Whaley's on the ground and that's the key phrase rock as you said most often time they're looking for a need but the rule book says when any part of the ball carriers body except his hand or foot touches the ground who and that is awfully actually that's a good look at it there is that left knee down the challenge here is Whaley's really hiding what's happening in the action whether although the place a is s whole first blade stands is called which is different from confirmed so basically they took a look and said we can't tell from that video evidence so therefore the play stands is called in it is a big one for Kansas just the third takeaway by the Kansas defense now can the Jayhawks get it in the endzone to take it improbable first half lead again third ranked undefeated Oklahoma went from the shotgun its begin in for the 21 and I like that first down call Chuck long said it's amazing when you look at the tape of Oklahoma how many times they're second and extra long shows up on film three times more than second and medium or or second in short because teams try to throw and get greedy on first down just take what's there put yourself in a much more manageable second and third down situation undefeated Oklahoma getting the first hat pen from Kansas ten stood up making it third down and six a Kansas team who a week ago gave up 70 points to Oklahoma State and the Cowboys had pulled most of the starters in the first half so that game was over really before halftime and yet here this one is in ten seven for the clock rolling in the early second quarter Lewis get the handoff on third and seven trying to fight for his many yards as you can but fourth down coming in about a 35 yard attempt coming from the freshman kicker Alex Muller which would be a career long right now just 2 of 5 on the season makes the 27 and 28 he's actually missed from 36 42 and 49 so this would set a new benchmark for the true freshman officialy 36yard at 10:00 Alex Miller 36yard field goal is good and with eleven 47:46 remaining in the second quarter in Laurens third ranked undefeated Oklahoma ten Kansas oh and two in the big 12 hi in the second quarter in Lawrence Kansas undefeated third ranked Oklahoma locked in a tight one with the Jayhawk Tenten if we continued dr. peppers road to the championship as the book games going on around the country and the going in Lawrence Kansas even Tenten as we check in with Wendy dick Carter thank you very much should we check in with Clemson and Marilyn and the scoring just won't stop once the trail by 18 on two separate occasions on great Ellen's and Noah career night over 200 yards 44 yards for the touchdown this game over on ESPNU and Clemson is stormed back to take the lead 56:45 and it's a final over and over Florida 17 to 6 harder so clips in one of those undefeated teams in trouble late Saturday night 3rd ranked Oklahoma a long way to go here in Lawrence Whaley again I mean on one first down gain of five Patman on the stop undefeated no more Michigan Georgia Tech in Illinois now on that list now wind really wreak havoc upon Michigan in Illinois offensively gives real credit to Mike London there at Virginia building his program much like Turner Gill second year you win later Jones enable you often consecutive live villain case take the Papa Z slides about a yard short Darius Willis the sophomore middle linebacker from Houston with the pop on Landry Jones so third down and one coming for the students Oklahoma up tempo to line Brown handing off Whaley moved the chance for you rolling to the 49 before Willis again makes the stop a lot of creative terms around the country for tempos Oklahoma says we go fast regular and close to Lipton be back simple Josh Heupel at the superb nadir Oklahoma the coordinators Brian Royals make the stop that the third ties the NCAA career marks exactly what you do to reestablish some of that tempo some of that momentum when you have a veteran quarterback who knows this system inside and out way back zones off second down ass complete that's Hannah who makes the grab inside the 40 such an advantage for a team that lives in the nohuddle because you hear all the time offense is struggling what do you do well you pick up your pace when you live in that play in and play out all you got to do is switch gears for Oklahoma it can be advantageous for a system the corner and another over Simmons forces the mound but Dominique whaler the junior walkon running back from Lawton Oklahoma thanks to person 10 oh you inside the 25 and we've seen enough run now you can anticipate some of that playaction pass some really good movement though zone runs are creating hypothetical back boils lined up in the fly first down inside the cane Kenny Stills wrestled down its first and goal Oklahoma third trip to the red zone for oh you first with the touchdown second was a field goal so now the kud pimp will try and make it three on the board that's the goal for Kansas with Oklahoma's the red zone we happen coming on at corner blitz nearly got the Landry going yeah big feel he's been very aggressive here in this first half trying to make Landry drones uncomfortable exactly what you've got to do and you see the shot to the back of the head there to Jones I got a kid of this caliber that Landry is when he gets himself into rhythm as we've seen on this Drive he can carve you up I like the different looks the Jayhawks grown I could've gone Oklahoma and his Sooners quickly regain the lead play To Your Strengths we've got a venturing quarterback what do you do you go up tempo on CAD and Kansas and then secondly look at the offensive line the wonderful block there by Stevenson and left tackle to cut down that backside pursuit and there you see some of that for four juiced at 11 one broad jump some of that power that the walkon Whaley possesses I got PhD make the 17 visitors back on top ESPN's college football primetime fronted by Volvo pay nothing to repair or maintain your new Volvo for the first

James Naismith that is Naismith Drive here the inventor of the game of basketball became the director of athletics here at Kansas five national championships 2000 alltime victories last seven big 12 titles will try and make it eight straight we learned on this trip to Lauren that dr. Naismith is credited with inventing the football knew about dr. Naismith in the game of football Tony Pearson there with a short gain on first down so Brock at 17 to 10 Oklahoma's regained the lead after a little bit of Jayhawk magic what does Kansas need to stick to then it kept him in this game you got to find a way especially on this Drive to get the first down conversion here early and put yourself exactly what Chuck Long's wanted to do he's been patient this evening we've seen a lot of early down run does not want to give its Oklahoma front the third in America with 19 sacks any chance to tee off on his quarterback well now you put yourself in a manageable situation better find a way to move the chains keep that defense on the sidelines as much as you can stuff along on the left side of your screen the coordinator of Kansas then often the offensive coordinator at Oklahoma left rolling on surrogates or throwing incomplete just short on the one hop to Matthews and Webb is furious with himself well that's two third down conversions this evening it's the right call that's an easy pitch and catch Jordan Webb's frustrated with himself he throws that pass 10 times in practice that's completed 10 times it's really not an easier throw in a little rollout hitch to your arm you knew how big that third down conversion could have been and just goes 3 and out giving it right back to the Oklahoma off at Dougherty will punt it away to ryan Broyles girl printing across the 40 tackled near the 45 oh you football the touchdown lead Brian boiled 80 Norman High School alum now playing for Oklahoma he has tied alltime NCAA career receptions mark so our Edward Jones FaceTime profile of mr. Broyles and went to Haiti with a group of Oklahoma football players that past May with women basketball assistant coach Jan Ross very meaningful trip it's now been Ross had led with basketball team Whitney hand games to every ailment basketball so angry football to me last May we feel complete and walking into the end zone is Ryan Broyles admit that catch Ryan Broyles that the alltime NCAA career receptions mark and what a way to do it with a 56 yard touchdown reception the book Oklahoma income and I don't think we could have planned that face time any better and if you're going to set the new FBS records for career receptions 58yard touchdown not a bad way to do it he's made so many plays in the slot that time he split outside is the flanker and it's pure speed running right behind the Jayhawk defense and what awarded congratulations on the sidelines there from Bob Stoops as Royals is now the career NCAA FBS at the Bowl Subdivision receptions leader that's pretty sweet a lot of times receivers will dillydally and try to set up a route not Ryan Broyles pure speed get from point A to point B T as fast as you can and I can't tell you what the Kansas Jayhawks are trying to do defensively that's safety when you settle like that you're noman's land and that's easy picking Pickens for Landry Jones well add another record to ryan Broyles collection the big 12 record for receiving touchdowns he already owns all of the owe you marks now the alltime receptions leader in the major division of college football the big 12 touchdown reception leader and oh by the way Oklahoma is up by two touchdowns thanks to two quick strike drive that went in on eight second one play touchdown drive a quote unquote for Landry Jones Brian Royals and the Sooners fortunately for Ryan Broyles the NFL game it's so much about slot receivers now what's better is showing the strength of a quat receiver to an offense here is on the return brought down at the 23 embroiled for catches tonight so this is among active receivers and he has all those big numbers including punt return yards something to be said for staying in school didn't leave early to the NFL he wanted to come back if he said in a preseason to the one day he can come back to Norman Oklahoma hit get the accomplishments work for me I did it the right way I've stayed in school I worked hard and I continued to develop during in year out compression we check in with Wendy Carter thank you very much that showdown and Eugene is underway we take you to Oregon hosting Arizona State LaMichael James is not playing in this game Brock Osweiler here complete the jerel Robinson 20 yards in the touchdown and it's Arizona State is strike first up 7 nothing here in Lawrence Kansas Oklahoma's regain command 24 210 málaga scammers brought his lot for the drop here at our ESPN proof for Memorial Stadium in Lawrence Kansas and a new wrinkle for Kansas offensively as Christian Matthews is taking the direct snap Jordan Lebanon sidelines after you ground a couple third down easy conversion passes Chuck long says well let's get this run game going a little Wildcat presence here with Christian Matthews receiver turned quarterback Miller joins him in the backfield so Quebec half of Matthews and there the flag prior to the snap false start number 74 the office fiveyard penalty remains third down and because of the injury to Jeremiah hats we still don't have an update that offensive line is shuffled there and jelly goes Center spikes the left guard Riley Spencer now in at left tackle and since we've seen ax lead the game there been a couple of false start penalties with a reshuffled offensive line now you see a third and extralong situation and Webb comes back in better be wearing some very active Oklahoma front four defenders are they telling when he's alone to grab by Jay this year the junior from Texas Ryan high school and web make the biggest throw of the night or can't but another seemed to be said for getting benched in Jordan web look into the couple plays the receiver in there at quarterback after a couple four throws can't throw that one any better did a wonderful job so their whole wall keeping in the bounds for procedures to go make the play 36 yard complete signal and when completing again to the tight end timbira the senior from omaha nebraska favorite target academic allbig 12 was a marketing major in political science minor Jordan went back on the field for ke I'm going to keep it on second down moving inside the 30 he did a nice job getting down at the right Belsen in Ward copy feller first down when look Cicero everybody's covered busted play taking Zack loss of about three Frank Alexander will be credited with the yet another sack six and a half on the year now for the senior from Baton Rouge we're invisible says closer he's in a different place man he is everything the NFL is looking for from a Russian 64 to 60 playing with tremendous effort and misses final season seconded 13 turn over you maybe it's a couple but third and long coming here Travis Lewis there on the stop last on and just a third down the 36 yard strike scrambling out of the pocket trying to run away from the ground and another busty play turns into a big Gator for Kansas 26 yards with somehow keep that play alive I'll give Jordan credit for one thing he is a highly entertaining quarterback he's out on the 4th down 57 yard run improvising the DAP Dean doing his best for him targeted and all the while keeping his eyes down the field it prevents the improvisation has been the key to his success in this first half and rel Lewis who ends up making that grab to take it inside the five is being helped off the field for Kansas right now that's Lewis being helped off when he made the play and I'm not positive that that football was designed to go to Ray Lewis Tim berry was trying to sit there in the zone if you come my way but in the end Webb got pulled at the beginning of this Drive remember and now three for three the farm workers union Missouri says he learned a lot from the way podracing dealt with the diversity a couple years ago for Kansas can't be put down here in May into the end zone and the Jayhawk counterpunch a lot of talk in town here the last two days since we've been here listening to talk radio wondering about the amount of fight the Turner Gil's Jayhawks have and some embarrassing losses the Georgia Tech last week in Stillwater could fold up the tent down 24 to 10 instead put together a fantastic drive to build a little momentum going into halftime PAP is good from euler so Kansas back within a touchdown so Brock Huard a lot of folks didn't think this is going to be a close game whatsoever between Oklahoma and Kansas he told us before we started this game what you thought Kansas needed to do to stay in the game with Oklahoma well there's a one touchdown game right now so maybe a little luck a little bit of that Rock Chalk Jayhawk magic in the air tonight Forte you I can't particularly say that I saw the fourth one to come play coming and I don't think I saw that third down throw in to the tight end where the running back dashes in front but whatever it takes right that's what you've got to do when you're building your program for Turner deal the eternal optimist you said that earlier and he's got a message to tell this kids is that hard work that practice that perseverance can pay off for you I don't think any of us saw a 7 point game which is three minutes to go the Quran now for Oklahoma pump throat test you know the Oklahoma coaching staff told us this week Tom Stinson Brent Venables and we we didn't really like the way our team came back after the big win against Florida State a week of preparation crediting Missouri for playing a top team in Norman we didn't handle that right big win a week ago in Dallas against Texas hoping to get a better response and practice this week get on the field but a tight game here in Lawrence because we check in with windy net Carter thank you look at what's going on across our networks on ABC the NASCAR Sprint Cup Bank of America 500 it's Charlotte about 38 laps to go and Oregon has since answered Arizona State the Ducks now tied it up seven all six minutes to play in the first quarter on ESPN the canna perseverance you realize no teams got into you deans of Washington state in 2008 and one very zone escape is going to do it they will have to persevere for for hoarders Landry Jones under Center on first and then play action going to the air completed near midfield for another big Oklahoma gainer it's Ryan Broyles again now three straight possessions where we see a little more the fundamentals from Landry Jones that I think set him apart so sound back there in the pocket when he sets his feet 18 yard pickup back to go Darrius willeth the middle linebacker there on the stop six catches on the night now for Broyles now the NCAA's major division career reception leader what I mean by that watch his base he's been a little flustered that led to Simeon accuracy in this first half typically Landry does such a nice job even when he resets of keeping that strong base Willis Creek underneath them skills for those you've heard down that is just textbook a quarterback coaches heard them say you want to be like a boxer you really want to be light on your feet you want to make sure that you have your balance you can just snap that ball that's across the field come back that's an NFL throw that Landry Jones makes the pretty college was huge kid across the middle by Steven Johnson at least making Ryan Royals pay for another grad no one else Ryan Brogan you don't make 40 career start but his size and I'm having a level of toughness to your game and get it right back to him Homa first down how about some boils all right take a hit now he's going to get a little break as he's moved the chains inside the 15 really impaired it's been our message this entire first half the note I'm bigger than right now for this group defensively Akins is to try to keep these Sooners to a field goal you go in 27 to 17 very different and if you watch the inserting for federal team having given up three consecutive touchdowns on ahead inside the pins inside the five Dominique Whaley right up the gun a better job tonight of establishing the run will see many sprite teams in football struggle scoring touchdowns in the red zone mostly because they get to sign up and run it Oklahoma gone for the shotgun with Steven Johnson who comes flying in and make the stop on Whaley forcing third down and very short now big a third down and short is this critical but I wouldn't be surprised if this is two down territory for the Sooners now less than a minute to go before the half I'm out campus I'm out here suggesting when we come back third down and one inside the five for Oklahoma I'm Wendy next here on our college football videos coming up on the Outback Steakhouse halftime report a shootout in the ACC when Clemson emerged undefeated Texas tries to bounce back against Oklahoma State and time exchange Robert Smith are here with their Saturday's good it's our Hospital former car a week ago where the people's will Turner Gill Kansas deepen built their ground here thesaurus advocate Oklahoma out of the pond all that you third down in the room you inside the cans of five hands off pulling down coming up the sophomore middle linebacker Darius Willis late for Turner Gill at Buffalo as a true freshman comes up to make the stop most Lahoma is going to take some time out here to think through this decision I honestly think on 3rd and 1 on that last play and I've got Ryan Broyles and all that room outside that have been my time to maybe take a shot out there with Landry Jones your statement time as well a group that's not done particularly well in the red zone as we just illustrated statistically you just run it you get hit right in the mouth no one gets onto those linebackers I'm reading the body language that says in that huddle we're going for this and making a statement if you're number three Oklahoma was a 10 game winning streak the number 5a no record on the year against the Kansas defense that coming into tonight was last in college football fourth and one inside the five that has to be something that the Sooners get that's right and you better get to the linebackers it's one thing where you've got that physical advantage and you can just look at the size and the strength of the overall movement of Oklahoma Joline but if you don't get anybody to that second level and you allow Willis or Johnson to get a clean shot are you going to get stuffed as you did there so I think a point of emphasis to that big line that movements not just enough here you've got to get a helmet under those second level players I like the strong Oklahoma often things on the field fourth down and one inside the came to five Whaley of the tailback Miller the fullback well to the bottom of your screen John the Whaley first down oh you it is first and goal for the Sooners and now keep an eye on the clock not temporarily and that's why I need to see a little bit more urgency here from Landrieu Jones you have the timeout now here's the pushback person go mister third and final timeout of the first half called by campus I'm out will be for 30 seconds then Jayhawks appeared to have 12 men on the field so that timeout was necessary Miller does just enough they're at fullback to get a body on the scrambling there Bradley mcdougal coming from his safety spot Millard the fullback eight hybrid eights back tight end that meet team down that time out based on personnel may be given this booth a little extra time to take a look oh call from the replay official yet but we will give you another look the question here so this is on fourth down and one as to where Whaley was when he was down on yellow lines unofficial but it's very close either way that's very cool first and goal came upon Oklahoma has one remaining Oklahoma 10game winning pink and undefeated record this year on the line Jones to the air by whaling near the pole on seconded goal 13 seconds left in the half but nada drawn that play up any better they mostly out he just takes his eye off the ball doesn't finish looking it in it at the end zone instead of tucking that one away really welldesigned concepts and dipole thirteen seconds Oklahoma an Oklahoma field goal here is a win for Kansas Jones under center on second down and goal play active incomplete intended for Ryan rolls third and goal from the Kansas to nine seconds all just a little bit high understand what Landry's thinking my guy or nobody with those underneath linebackers doesn't miss that high very awesome and once again with a compound with the remaining thing in the book Landry goes to throw again on backdoor incomplete fourth and goal coming with six seconds remaining in the half Miller the intended target on truth they have been the biggest advantage here another well conceived concept open receiver that's Miller just rip it up the paint in the endzone Oklahoma is going to take the lead into the half but Ganges is going to have the momentum after holding Oklahoma through a field goal attempt when the mighty Sooners had it first and goal inside the five first and goal from the two Honeycutt field goal is good so ten point lead 27 to 17 Oklahoma came to three seconds left but it takes some magic take someone take the willpower to stay in this game after Oklahoma State Ronald Kansas a week ago mine Andruw Jones the laidback guy from all accounts of his coaching staff that you sense a little body language air coming off the field those are two misses you unlike Kansas who has a fourth than one fumbled snap totally discombobulated play that turns into a 57yard touchdown unlike Jordan Webb and I think you and I agree wasn't even throwing to the running back looking to his tight end running back flashes gets the ball to one yard line those are exactly the opposite for Landry in the offense those are wellconceived plays those are wide open receivers in the red zone and those are two misses three misses really one drop one failed slant route and Miller they're tripping over the paint in the endzone that's an opportunity lost for Oklahoma a week ago in Stillwater 56 to 7 at the half Oklahoma State on Kansas in Lawrence ten point lead for Oklahoma on kayuu the six and agree to return at the end of the half and so at halftime its third ranked Oklahoma 500 on the season a 10point lead a lot of moments of returner Gil's Jayhawks they're in the game at the half as we send you to windy day late night from Lawrence Kansas ESPN college football presented by Miller Lite as we begin the start of the third quarter third ranked undefeated Oklahoma with a 10point lead on campus Carter Blackford with Brock Huard not many times there's a home team trailing by 10 at the half claimed the momentum of this game but considering the last week in Stillwater Kansas was down 56 to 7 at the half to Oklahoma State there's some momentum for the Jayhawks right now 168 rushing yards he made some big plays on third down to keep drives alive and he also held Oklahoma the most critical time to some field goals in that first half and that's why frankly this is a 10point game so now in the third quarter this has been a big differential quarter for both Oklahoma and for Kansas there have been some big separation like Georgia Tech and Texas Tech against Kansas in the third quarter what does Turner Gil's team need to do in this third quarter to reverse those numbers hang in this game with Oklahoma into the fourth you don't change from what you've done in this first half you've got to continue to establish that run right at Oklahoma find a way to make some explosive plays as they did in that first half and then defensively it's going to be Ben Ben Ben and try to hold Oklahoma to three points that except Darien Miller 14 on first look at the nice gain track brought to you by John Hancock Ryan Broyles that the oldtime career reception record in viola fashion 57yard td8 receptions in that first half a workman like effort how about that play on fourth and one completely broken play Webb at the awareness to pitch it to sins and he had the speed to take it the distance 100 second meeting between Kansas in Oklahoma on the football field last time that unranked Kansas team beat a ranked Oklahoma team 1984 they used last win in the series was in 1997 third down coming up here for the Jayhawks opening drive of the second half home before going on the field increase giving up 110 yards per game I referenced there yes the big play the 50plus yard run on fourth down helped now up over 170 yards on the ground or the Jayhawks Jordan Webb the sophomore quarterback out of the shotgun on third and three heavy pressure coming loses the football comes flying out near the 20 Harris forces the fumble can disappears to get back on top to make it third and extremely long so this will be a three and out and Brent Venables Bob Stoops have to be pleased that response from the deep end that's about as textbook if you get from the safety position we talked about the speed of that sooner back seven a bit undersized Harris just 200 pounds at 5 foot 11 you can't put your helmet on the football any better than that authority to punt to Ryan Broyles Boyle called for the fair catch at the 45 so Landry Jones and the Oklahoma offense have excellent field position at the 45 well Landry Jones started this game over for missed some throws didn't get the ball in the end zone at the end of the first half and yet again there's 27 points on the board for Oklahoma that's right you sit there 223 yards six times in his career is Landry Jones thrown for over 400 yards he's on pace right he's avoided the naked it plays the interceptions it's got to be a little bit more crisp along with his receivers running back tight in executing a little better here in the second half junior from Artesia New Mexico red 79 career touchdown passes young Walton nearly intercepted and that that is a play you must make that's Michael Reynolds true freshman defensive end that's a gimmick Landry Jones does not give you many of those opportunities you have to take advantage of them back to the ground on second down and ten Dominique and Whaley takes up four maybe five to make it third down on the opening drive for Oklahoma the second when near 120th in college football and you would force just two turnovers through your first five games they got to fumble earlier from the true freshman you've got to find a way to look that interception in and now defensively that plays behind you you also have to find a way to get Oklahoma off the field and push third down in the second half Jones down the seam on third and six incomplete brick Brown the junior corner knocks it away on the third down seam route away from Brian Broyles that's a couple three announced tonight Turner Gill was hoping desperately Bix Cooley the defensive coordinator to find some little battles that you could win and there's been enough evidence here this is a different group for all of the fanfare over the radio airwaves the last couple days that I've heard about Turner Gill and this wolf believe Ben and these kids in freshman have been lying around playing differently than what I've seen on film through the first five games their get from the years inside the 15 three and out for a vote of the often do and start the third back in Lawrence Kansas to the best runningback to play the game John Riggins and Gale Sayers both Kansas Jayhawks visit with Gale Sayers a little bit last night I count his name dropping right Phog Allen Fieldhouse about the importance of Kansas football Gale Sayers says yeah I love Kansas basketball celebrate the championship celebrate Allen Fieldhouse we've got to get football rolling hard to believe it was just a few short years ago Kansas was winning the Orange Bowl namedrop like that don't like bring emphasis do it now okay lots of celebs are than I was last night not only Brock who were there doing Fieldhouse Rob Riggle was in the house Xavier Henry and all the Memphis Grizzlies coming back rolling on put it down Corey Shepherd make the grab for campus Will Forte were there how it filled out last night and all of those folks stuck around to watch Kansas football and there is a big fear around here Brock and this was going to be as ugly as Oklahoma State a week ago as Georgia Tech was blowout big blowout losses coolers got a tie ballgame rag on this play as Pearson here is the first down flag down and it's going to be a holding outside trying to get to that is the one difference between those games you're referencing those blowouts those were on the road there's always something to be said about coming home Bob Stoops said that as well talking about this game in particular the Turner Gill team and especially against Texas Tech it was this third quarter that devastated them if they could have avoided a very negative third quarter on that Texas Tech game could have been very differently coming down the stretch holding number seven of the offense the penalty would be from the previous pot half the distance to the goal remains first down direction right second Attica you know if scale picked the converted quarterback started the first game a season ago for these Jayhawks that almost could have been a block in the back to hold gonna do whatever he can but now he said his offense back to the minus seven second in long I'm serious if he slips inside the five so this is third down and really long from inside Kansas own five give Frank Alexander credit for another TfL and this is very dangerous territory now for Kansas Chuck long has done a nice job of controlling second and medium third and Nydia now your third and extra long for one of the first times I can really remember tonight Carter this Oklahoma D line that's so adept of rushing the passer has a real chance of hitting their ears back Oh complete well the way the brakes have gone for Kansas you were just thinking maybe maybe Basheer's is going to come down with that one for another wacky conversion but it'll be another three now and I love that call mysterious does a nice job at setting that go route up that ball is right in his hands on two occasions and that really would have done something to reignite this crowd sitting on their hands now you almost get the sense they're waiting for Oklahoma to awaken Doherty will punt from the back of his endzone to line boils low tick hits at the 35 takes a late Kansas role to get back out to the 45 Mirek Landry Jones if the Sooners will have a very short field trying to thin their lead ESPN's college football primetime brought to you by the US Postal Service it's all in the mail and age the new business card from Chase make your mark with it not officially segment luring the farm and without Massachusetts Avenue here and Lawrence Oklahoma football leading by 10 plus 44 this is the area to feel that I would love to take a shot with playaction pass running that zone run I'd love for one piece really behind me before flag on the play ball start prior to the snap false start 69 of the offense five yard penalty remains first and watch Oklahoma real closely pregame warmup and I'll tell you there was a sense of intensity I did not get any feel that they were flat that they were not ready for this game they got after in warmups they had just not been sharp on multiple levels in their execution first and 15 after the penalties lady to the plaque to her face still loyal for the block out there for him to get the penalty yards back Lovick Smith forces amount Oklahoma with a 10 game winning streak second only to Stanford in the FBS on the line here in Kansas the BCS standings come out tomorrow night it's been 24 hours away from the first BCS standings of the year Jones on second down to fill three losses on the line tensions watching tonight oh no and that is a very bad news Kenny still was still down on the ground and what's already turning into a long season for Kenny Stills missed the opener because of suspension mr. Mizzou Dean because of concussion symptoms and now he goes down on the turf here in the third in in Lawrence Kenny Stills walking back to the Oklahoma pylon which is very good news for the Sooners and the kid until coming to that right name so here third down for Oklahoma Kenny Phil's on a thought lon Landry Jones over the middle complete Ryan Broyles has it again it's on to the twenty nine nine catch of the night for Ryan Broyles how many times is Ryan Broyles done that in his career little option route first first down of the second half there's a flag down incomplete pass that's how that was called as Oklahoma went quick hurry up for first down the ruling on the field was a backward pass however there was an illegal substitution violation against the defense that's the fiveyear penalty from the previous spot remains first down when the real challenge is when you play that Oklahoma team and Landry Jones gets the sense he can see those defenders coming on and off of the field that's an obvious call for side judge 12 on the field that's unfortunate that's a that would have been another negative play with the lateral there from Oklahoma another of the reasons why Oklahoma has that temple at the gate near substitution when they don't execute first and Bob is an incomplete for Whaley the job of the Kansas defense covering everybody up so second and five that's about as animated as you're ever going to see Landry Jones the conversation there with Dominique Whaley wanted him to do a little bit more on the check down Kansas plays coverage there there's that shot play pass that I was looking for Kansas has two deep safeties Landry wants more from his running back on his check down to separate and give him an outlet don't throw it again second five boil it again but he never wrapped up and drop by Tyler Patton sophomore from Round Rock Texas to make it third and short some Turner deal talked about in college football he felt an epidemic of for tackling here to go hurry up once again quick hitter Royals in the flat wide open his eyes upon inside the five he has marked down at the two marked down at the two though no fumble on the play Lovick Smith makes the stop 19 yards Nick so again he's ruled down at the to further reduce replay booth we'll take a closer look so Broyles ruled down at the two and all this would be a huge momentum swing if that call is reversed don't see any knees that right knee is awfully close when the ball is driven into the ground of course the other part of that equation is does the ground that right knee down ball is fumbled with the ground from Ryan Broyles an excellent block you see 16 jazz Reynolds outside they're just the extra effort on his part let's take a look here I think the only thing in question the elbow is not it's going to be that right knee what do you think can baseball they call that a bangbang play almost a simultaneous look it has the ball coming out before Broyles for the football touch of the ground do you see an indisputable picture there a frame that clearly shows going against and I think what's critical here to understand the call on the field is he beam down remember this goes one of three ways by rule they can reverse this call all can be stand it's called or it can be inclusive confirmed I don't think by any stretch that's going to be confirmed the call was Broyles down at the two this would be monumental for Canada that they can force another turnover how amazing if this is reverse and again we're going to get the ruling at some point there would be a touchback in the ball will go all the way out to the 20yard line I just have yet to see we have a very similar play a week ago down the road in Manhattan Kansas where I did not see a picture frame that told me indisputable something so clear and then reversed it last week with Kansas State taking this much time you know this replay booth exactly to our right here is watching that very very closely seeing that there's any evidence any one particular shot and remember by rule that ball goes on the back of the endzone that will be a touchback in Kansas with Dodge and enormous pull up here midway through the third quarter well they're waiting for this regardless 10point lead rope Lahoma right now on Kansas if you are an Alabama fan or an LSU fan and your team have won today they're undefeated BCS standings come out tomorrow Oklahoma has a three next to its name what are you thinking right now watching this Oklahoma team struggle on the road at a Kansas team who's lost his last three a couple those blowout bash you'd be thinking we're deserving if you're LSU and Alabama knows exactly where you are one and two in that ap vote remember the Harris Poll is one third of those dcs rankings that will come out tomorrow night and that's a human poll well this would be a huge momentum swing if Kansas this is a candidate team if they're taking boy if they're taking this much time a week ago I was wrong a week ago I thought that there was just not that indisputable visual evidence a long look at this because if they say this is the fumble by Broyles if it made it out the back of the endzone it's going to be a touchback if the call is reverse correct at the further review the ball was loose before the player was out it goes out of bounds in the end zone resulting in a touchback the ball will belong to campus at the 20yard line first half games and head for two turnovers the first five games of the year last in college football and now two turnovers by the Oklahoma offense tonight that would have been Oklahoma football at the two staring 34 17 in the face instead the ball all the way back to the 20 down 10 halfway through the third quarter I will tell you the one thing that stands out to me was Ryan Broyles reactions you saw him lay on that field immediately it was almost as if he knew he didn't want to put that play in the videoreview hands Kansas must take advantage of this opportunity Jordan Webb and the Kansas offense back on the field Sims short gain and get it at the 20 because it's a touch back there it is Brock oils reaction to that play this disappointment that's right you can't fool players right you can often read by their body language I think he is very disappointed it's even close on a very close call it goes to Jayhawks way incomplete intended purpose here so third already third down and long already for Jordan Webb in the Kansas offense Jordan Webb is the eighth rated passer passed efficiency in the FBS and I'll tell you if they're going to have a chance here in the second half he has got to be sharper that is now three occasions where he's had clear windows that offensive line is protecting him he's not getting battered as is the Sooners did to the Longhorns a week ago he's having his opportunities he's got to get those open shots beginning here on third and long yeah crackers Elise's incomplete Kansas goes 3 and out so after the take away by the Kansas defense the offense does nothing will with it Corey Nelson applying the pressure they're on Jordan Webb so three and out again for K you that is three three announced by the Kansas offense into the conversation there you referenced earlier how good a quarterback Turner deal was never lost a conference game in three years two losses were in bowl games and he's saying just settle down the plays are there to be made Gordon these guys are good but there's still opportunities for us that's second down this and back to bite them oh you football on offense after we check in with windy Nix Carter thank you we go back to Eugene Oregon riding a 19 game home win streak they are playing without LaMichael James but here we go they're in Thomas 12 yards and a touchdown to David Paulson and Oregon 21 17 over Arizona State at the half and it is official the Rangers are headed back to the World Series for the second consecutive season beating the tiger 15 to 5 in games dick Carter picks on Rangers headed to the World Series secondyear Orono lined with wins at whatever he does Dominique Whaley diving there for about an eightyard Jean first down so Oklahoma in the second half a three and out and in the Broyles fumbled now Ken Landry Jones and the sinners get back on track quick tip Oh on second down and short way Lee juck does pick up the first down before Stephen Johnson forces him out really disappointing that Kansas after that second takeaway of the evening like a breath of fresh air involved the 20 yard line you see the excitement from the bands and a three and out against a really good ball club boys veteran experiences the Sooners are those are the ones they're really watching film tomorrow are going to be terrible frustrating plays to look at Landry Jones rolling out of the pocket on first down he's going to talk to the sideline incomplete smart play on first down I'll tell you I've been really impressed by Kansas won't fulfill a week ago oklahoma state doing whatever they want to Brandon Weeden very rarely even had to come off his first read or second read this has taken away some the Landry's first second progression it moved his feet a little bit why he just did 50% for the evening function and Iker the play call for second down and 10 or it took above opponent comes in to make the stop on Whaley your impact player former running back more of their pass rusher for effort by Oklahoma out on that edge looking for other defenders to block before makes them pay and put the Sooners in the third of the next rolanse situation Oh third law Landry Jones looking complete jazz Reynolds makes the grab just beyond the sticks to move the chains and that's just devastating just sucks the life right out of you defensively you make twofoot plays third and 15 you drop eight my entry finds the open man Jones to a dragging jazz Reynolds began inside the 25 Reynolds a sophomore from Houston Eisenhower High School who was suspended his freshman year for some inappropriate comments on Twitter he has come back in an explosive playmaker when he gets rolling in the Oklahoma offense averaging 20 yards the cats coming into tonight Kenny Stills on the screen positive gain on first down his hogs good to see the playmaker back on the fill field stills were an ugly little hyperextension of the knee was able to walk that off he's such a nice compliment on the other side you want to roll coverage to Broyles and leave Kenny Stills oneonone you know he actually set the freshman records a year ago at Oklahoma without Ryan broiled with his efforts with 60plus reception dry season there a touchdown versus Texas last week in Dallas don't pass complete gain Hanna near that first down Martha Jones over the 10,000 mark in his career good look with those three announce to see the hands on the hips the Bobbsey to put the hands of the hip of those Kansas Jayhawks defenders as well that's the other problem when you're on and off that field on offense and you don't move the chains Seahawks defense been on here a lot laughter for the red zone for Oklahoma Whaley fighting inside or Mandy Colin Garret through gressman weak side linebacker there on the stop second down and ten and guess who's the live signal I guess all punch sign in there somewhere going the flat minimal game making its third down Lubbock Smith on the stop third and four for Oklahoma look at them spread out the offensive linemen screen look at the ten the Kansas defense holds on third and four it's the former walkon senior linebacker Steven Johnson who makes the tackle on stills field goal unit out for Oklahoma it's no credit to these Jayhawks these bubble screens he's outside quick hitters quick hitch it's all about effort defensively he got to leverage those plays keep him inside out this group is tackled probably the best effort I have seen this season on tape from the Kansas Jayhawks defensively Michael Honeycutt from 47 yards he's got it Oklahoma up 32 17 now but Kansas again keeps Oklahoma out of the end zone less than 24 hours from now the first BCS standings will be released VPS countdown presented by discover Sunday 8:15 Eastern continuing on ESPNU at 9:00 Eastern so there is a three right now next Oklahoma's name is AP poll number three that doesn't factor into the BCS standings entering today Brad Edwards did project that's the Oklahoma would be number three and now we go to the blind resumes top three teams in the eight people so matchup reads LSU lose Alabama and who's Oklahoma the one giveaway here you see that schedule strength and you know that LSU has had a brutal road part of the reason why those ap voters have them number one the PD margit's big for Oklahoma thanks in large part to the the route last week turnover March that was a factor to take away to get to Texas new defensive touchdowns last week in Dallas we'll see how the official BCS hold the S standings I should say it almost stopped any squirtle a VPS standing tomorrow night on the SDM this year's to the 17 on the return so Kansas doesn't have a first down here in the third quarter if we would have told Chuck long Turner Gill extremely the defensive coordinator for Kansas yesterday that you'd be sitting here four minutes ago in the third quarter down 32:17 that you held Oklahoma three out of five times two field goals in the red zone that you've yet to gain a first down in the second half and you're within 13 points they take that yesterday now can shorten web the sophomore quarterback Reno ello psychosis in beer that senior from Omaha Nebraska Westside high screw homeless loud Kansas to stay in defeat couple uncharacteristic turnovers once again above the booth for them this year less than 60% scoring touchdowns down in that red zone you haven't seen the killer take away or the facts or the negative plays that Oklahoma's generated so often this year defensively Jayhawks very much still alive then stood up no game third and six coming while even with web and the offense struggles here in the third quarter the 17 on the board for Kansas that's as many a Texas scored all game benefit of a kickoff return for a touchdown a week ago in Dallas Miller next is Jordan Webb on third down and six angeleka near the James inside here no nothing jadynn bird in there on the stop on miller so Kansas is going to go three and out again well it was the muchmaligned Kansas defense that stiffened tonight against Oklahoma kept him in the ball game and now at Kansas offense that's been rolling pretty good how much of that is Kansas offense here in the second half how much of that is oud pit well oh you defensively has been very very sound here in the second half they've not allow those explosive plays they did in the first half they made Kansas earn everything and right now is the collective group Kansas offensively isn't good enough flag on the plane that is going to make it even tougher for Doherty all right so the snap false start number 31 in the offense five yard penalty remains fourth down loyal the active leader in punt return yards waits near the full body with a terrible pitch about near the third $5 field position coming for Oklahoma Monday night Dolphins Jets kickoff 830 coverage begins 7 o'clock but if L countdown certify Applebee's nest of lost three in a row heading into Monday night but he get it turned around against the Dolphins these Jayhawks have lost three in a row and many of those games you could point to a defensive effort over 700 yards by Georgia Tech 600 on the ground a week ago 600 yards 499 passing this jaehak defense is given the offense opportunities but for three announces left them on the field way too long in the second half I think eventually we'll make them become after a 19 yard punt 19 yards Roy Finch gets the first down carry Anthony Davis lays a big lick on Roy Finch quickly second down on the campus defense convicted to the pen and that fires up the Oklahoma offense a 21yard gain but Finch down at the end of the play one of the challenges at five seven listed in 166 pounds he's so explosive remember last season when we were in Norman they raved about this young kid from Niceville Florida really adding that extra dimension the Marco Murray was so productive they felt like this kid had the speed we saw it on the touchdown run earlier from him with the jump cut very similar technique here just the speed in the power owe to run through tackles when here 160 pounds you take some of that punishment see some of the frustration there from Bob Stoops he wants to generate a little bit more run you asked me earlier what does LSU where does Alabama when you play against those teams and if Oklahoma can get to that point if they get by Oklahoma State and bedlam and they face one of those powerhouses one of those SEC foes you've got to do more of this you got to be able to establish that run game Bob Stoops knows it so Roy Finch will exit the game Kenny Stills left the game earlier for Oklahoma came right back and now Roy Finch heads to the Oklahoma sideline so now can the Sooner often put it in the end zone without Roy Finch Dominique Whaley back into the game he is Oklahoma's starting running back he's in the back field behind Landry Jones first and goal just inside the ten really straight ahead running on the left side they're off inside the bond Agostino makes the stop when the two touchdown five possessions in the red zone now for Oklahoma field goal last time in the red zone Royals fumble just before halftime and just again holding Oklahoma to a field goal now is one of the big goals for the Kansas defense Oklahoma gets inside the 20 come out to the run look at the one on one side Whaley gets it again Whaley drop to make it third down in gold sorry on the stop there we had Stanford earlier this season and remember the Stanford coach is saying hey we sometimes we just want to bloody our knuckles we know that we're outnumbered at the line of scrimmage and all these occasions when Kansas puts that many defenders around the tackle box and leaves one on one outside you're outgunned but Oklahoma still says we're bigger were stronger were faster and we're going to try to enforce our will they're going to try to do it here to start the fourth quarter take a look at our expert breakdown brought to you by Farmers Insurance brought to it is our expert in Oklahoma jizz 2:05 in the redzone scoring touchdowns missed opportunity two times been the extra effort of canvas more than anything the Jayhawks outnumbering Oklahoma at the line of scrimmage almost daring them to throw outside of the oneonone coverage first play of the fourth quarter Dominick way lien and running back on third down in goal for Oklahoma Sooners looking to reverse that red zone print Landry Jones throwing away the pretzel dude and drop by Darius Willis fourth and goal coming for Oklahoma field goal unit is on that's another win for Kansas on the night where they knew coming into this game that Oklahoma was going to move the ball between the 20s and they had to play really sound defensively and fly around in the red zone they've done that holding now Oklahoma four field goals out of six red zone opportunities pretty go home on kansas jayhawks haven't scored Jayhawks don't have a first down in the second half the only game that Kansas is wanted conference competition the past two years against Colorado now remember the pac12 in a big second half comeback huge secondhalf comeback for Kansas a 42 points secondhalf comeback against Colorado so if Kansas is going to pull off the upset they're going to need a similar effort here in the fourth quarter and when you're in building your program mode as Turner Gill is right now here in Lawrence you're just trying to find things in which you can build upon and through the first five games this season there was lots of things offensively to feel good about the mix of run and passing a top 20 run team in it top 10 in pass efficiency and tonight unfortunately outside of a couple almost busted plays this offense is contributed very little and it's been the defense and in particularly that red felon defense that kept this game interesting into the fourth quarter paint this only 5 yards of offense in the third quarter didn't have a first down of the third quarter we take back the tears near the tent engage experience across the 45 brought 30 or the canvas often time for the big 12 update brought to you by Dr Pepper ten the incredible offensive numbers put up around this conference just look at largely the quarterbacks in those situations to Whedon thrown it all over the yard Robert Griffin the third so dynamic Oklahoma multiple weapons Texas Tech you know they're just almost born to throw it down there in Louisville first in ten for Kansas and the sophomore QB Jordan went from Union Missouri throwing this area got positive yards out of the backfield till it just the first down right right now that's all you're thinking offensively and almost sidelines coming into this Drive okay put the third quarter behind you for miserable possessions and now the defense gives you some rice just find a way first and foremost to move these chains then you get maybe another yard or two to make it third down and short five yards of offense for Kansas in the third so easy to get the third down and three that's more I'll bet deep reduction in the four and the tackling has been so much more sound here in the second half by Oklahoma they've tightened the gaps have gotten off blocks on the defensive line a very different effort here in the second half with dropping on third and three in a drop ball over the middle and Christian Matthews the sophomore got to make that one link web can give him just a little bit easier pass as well got a wide open little shallow cross he's trying to pick up that first down as a quarterback a little more touch on that pass but when you go now 53 announced you start to squeeze that ball even tighter to be disappointing because schematically they've been put in position to make some plays unable to do it in the second half Dority look off a building up a 19 yard punt the last time down Oklahoma football trying to close it out and Lauren fourthquarter late night in Laurens third ranked Oklahoma trying to pull away from Kansas 3317 as we continue dr. peppers brood to the championship the Blackrock Rock the homealong meant to be from New Mexico turn walk on starting running back Rocklahoma Dominic Whaley and if you're Bob Stoops and Landry Jones right now you want nothing more than to possess this ball for six seven minutes run it right at Kansas easy completions not been clean there's going to be lots to correct here this week after mostly experts from Green half quarters but some of that behind you have a mutant assisted hold investment laughing we've seen uptempo hurry up from Oklahoma a lot of passes through the air you think this is the point where it's from the football in the bottle I would think so your defense is force five three and outs from the Kansas Jayhawks and I know that's part of your system and being uptempo is the identity in the nature of what you do but I also think there comes a time when you've seen your defense just dominate an opponent and you know limit their opportunities and possessions come out of here with the wind sort of you've met some of the clock early morning laptop Dakota has the first down as a sideline and a touchdown saving tackle made by Lubbock Smith after a 24 yard game when a few times gotten to see some of that for for speed we heard so much about and so much for ball possession if you can get that big explosive play to also put the nail in the coffin Kansas doesn't have a first down so the defense has been out there after five straight three and out and was here in the second half that has to be a factor at this point to time on the pulse to beat them right okay Whaley has 131 yards giving right back Coon that ball comes out but Whaley was ruled down play was over a little bit like Oklahoma State Texas today right you just waiting for Oklahoma State to get going and they make some big plays and yet Texas kind of weathered the storm and hung in there looks like Kansas is down through this game that's awfully close wait Lee's got to tighten up his ball security but most importantly for the Cowboys the Sooners when you go on the road in any conference any major conference especially the bottom line no matter how ugly can be a dime survive and get that win they fit don't throw in on second down the third down coming after the incompletion battery Oklahoma Bob Stoops teams undefeated the week following the Red River game against Texas in Dallas background sex teams are on the feet of the week after until today's loss to Oklahoma State at home question Bob suits Brent Venables wanted to see excellent effort I love being the fresh geography thing I've gotten out in a second the office trying to convert on third and five 4135 when you need a big play Russian royal second touchdown grab of the night this one goes for 43 and on the night when Ryan broiled the senior from Norman becomes a career in PA a record holder for receptions he had the pair of touchdowns we go with it everyone adjectives you've watched some man play we watch the number of times last year when adjectives inscribe Ryan broiled game shifty how about you 15 smooths at the same time right I get it shifty beating man coverage was option route put this bit he has seen them also two times huge plays tonight Carter with the go round and that the deep corner out and also shows you he can kick it into another gear well a fumble for Ryan Broyles earlier when he was trying to stretch for the end zone no stretch and needed on this one a new careerhigh 217 yards 13 catches in now to big TD mr. Boies you ESPN college football primetime is presented by triple hops brewed Miller Lite taste greatness and in part by Hyundai if it's fuel efficient affordable stylish and say it's probably a

Broyles with a recordsetting night in a careerhigh night 217 receiving yards ere a touchdown redeeming himself from a fumble inside the five but here's takes it to the 30 less than 24 hours from now the first BCS standings are revealed on ESPN Sunday 8:15 Eastern Time our coverage continues on ESPNU at 9:00 Eastern rece Davis Kirk Herbstreit Craig James will be PF countdown someday Brock you brought it out there's computers but the Harris Poll that's that's judgment that's as you said to human whole we're going to judge an effort tonight that if they stuck around and watch this game that infield Lahoma swing peppered in its ad at Kansas again the last few weeks his expectation is you're going to swim in here and Jim Ronal this Dean the Turner gills group respond and made it a much uglier effort now having said that still look at the bottom line Oklahoma has 550 yards of offense Brian Broyles as you said over 200 yards Landry Jones says this in 50 yards three touchdowns zero int but you know that Oklahoma's not going to be pleased with a lot of things that happened here tonight no matter what happens in the laps amenities at football games Hugh goes flying is Miller makes a third and short shoe has found its home on the left foot of James Hird not a good thing for Oklahoma schedule wise and you look down that schedule you go to Baylor late the year you still have a nm at home Kansas State Bill Snyder doing his thing remarkably in Manhattan now six to no on the season you have Oklahoma State bedlam I think that's going to be the defining game mark without a 612 Championship being almost as de facto possibility semifinalist incision tim's stood up he was down coming and canvas still has not moved it changed at the second half so the Oklahoma defense which was so stiff against Texas a week ago mate back three defensive touchdowns shut it off and it showed up in the tech now you people trying to get a stop near on fourth down and two for a false start on the offense on fourth and short prior to the snap false start number seven of the offense five yard penalty remains for sale Turner Gill wanted to go for it on fourth and short look at that 20 yards of offense to the second half the campus very different mindset from Oklahoma they committed a few more defenders around the line of scrimmage they asked Kansas to win oneonone Jordan Webb unable to do that on third down occasions timeout Kansas 8:28 to go Bob Stoops and the Oklahoma Sooners have a 4217 lead here on Kansas in the book 8:28 to go so closing in on six and O 3 you know in the big 12 you're going to go timeout Turner Gill says even after the ball start to look down and thinking with the whole boys in the back you good relief is bottled in nearly intercepted all sorts of oh you defenders around that play as Webb took a big pop Travis Lewis applied the pressure on Jordan Webb so I know you deep in stiffens and still no first down you feel that one tomorrow you wake up and you wonder why your neck is a little stiff can't quite look right and left and then you'll watch the film and go at 28 it made me real sore you sound like speaking from experience there Brock Huard good thing is at least with a steel turf you don't have that oldschool turf firm and you wake up to stuck to the sheets as well Mike Rock here is going to break you folks Whaley picks up a couple on first so here are some of the games and we came up with BCS impact game lower right the bedlam game turns into a defacto BCS Championship pick 12 championship by city state plant yes 612 championship there's potentially between Oklahoma and Oklahoma City really Wisconsin bigger just last weekend the Michigan State the second down even Johnson picked it off for takeaways by the Kansas defense in this game against Oklahoma than they had in the previous five Duke Johnson hasn't quit he was a neat kid that sit down and talk with yesterday a former walkon really had only two offers to Division one doublea schools he said Kansas was initially interested he got heard in prep school and said well I don't want to say I beg but I pretty much beg to come to Lawrence and walkon he's earned a scholarship become a captain said this groups not quitting but defensively as bad as they had been through the first five games mystically the worst in college football there was still some walkthrough with sack by Cory Nelson there's someone on the defense but there's a lot less to the desired offense over here for Kansas in the second half and I'm sitting here watching trying to figure out is this Oklahoma playing that much better in the second half for Kansas just selfdestructing here in the second I think it's a little bit of both to be honest and you've seen a different effort to see more vicious violent fits by Oklahoma defensively and continued to just unfortunately for Jordan web just to see some misfires whenever he's had someone in his face that a really hard time trying to connect on the other end and you can see I think that body language maybe Turner Gill maybe the most eternally optimistic coach in the FBS secondyear well he did the Buffalo that Buffalo program first when he even in 12 years within like Mac Idol Jordan 15 can commence port down coming up Jordan Webb is upset with his play in the second half because Kansas had their chance to get back into this game it's the defense held o you time and time again held him out of the end zone other than the Broyles touchdown only one touchdown for Oklahoma in the second half and yet few Kansas inability to move the football though first down still in the second half for Kansas throughout Oklahoma to pull away we pump the boils again now pull in the pump return game again chant for another explosive one inside the 40 Dority helps make the stop 35 yard return well when you talk about the top quarterback wide receiver duo's in college football Landry Jones Ryan Broyles Stillwater wheat Blackmon Robert Griffin and Kendall Wright hawk Case Keenum and Patrick Edwards in a terrific comeback story from injury for Patrick Edwards and Barkley in woods at USC I think that about covers it you can win with those five game yeah no doubt about it probably the right decision see Ryan Broyles out of the game after that punt return a surprise if we're going to see Landry Jones for the two much more risk of contact if I'm coaching I've seen enough if Dean's in hand I run the ball he even looked to get my backup quarterback from opportunity early on down makes it another first down to the 25 Dominique Whaley now with 148 rushing yards in the game on 27 carries both of those are career highs his first year playing for Oklahoma and akin he would not always an NAIA Langston University he was a backup at Langston University which a lot of people scratch their heads with that but lightly recruited out of high school 27 first downs in the game now for Oakland eight for Kansas none in the second half Whalen's going to get it again and found it inside the twenty spark what's the biggest difference you think's home on Oklahoma first half oklahoma second half oh it was those big plays that Kansas was able to find the fourth and 157 yarder there was a busted play was the scramble on third down hit the guy you're not even throwing to so for Oklahoma just continuing to tighten down those fundamentals defensively say okay we're going to play sound we're not going to blip yeah we're better than you and they certainly have been in seven consecutive possessions offensively and you're offensively an opportunity now once again in this red zone to come out of one of the pieces around when you're playing a em down the stretch here and you're going to Baylor and you play in Oklahoma State to a six scoring touchdowns isn't going to be good enough something's not going to be good enough this season Brent Venables likes his defensive effort a lot to build on there in this second half of complete dominance if I'm Josh I'm Landry Jones and I'm on this offense I feel a lot better on this trip home if we can find a way to get this ball into the endzone again three turnovers by the Oklahoma offense tonight didn't appear to get that one off delay game delay again offense fiveyard penalty remains third down we have a second on Landry Jones last year we talked to Bob Stoops about Artesia New Mexico Bob Stoops told us one of the best practices he's ever seen by artesian high school head coach Cooper Henderson there in southeastern New Mexico I just bring that up because that is an amazing when he breathed statement from a guy who's been around an awful lot of good football practices and seen a lot of elite high school programs all around the country now our student colleague Michael Adi was with us last year said the same thing flying in there and watching their operation to me the technique some fundamental stayed off the language police sprint battery the former wangan from Weatherford Oklahoma take that inside of ten so Oklahoma will get some late practice on put it in the red zone as you said Brock just one of those areas of concern we are talking about a number three next to your name for Oklahoma you're talking about your 11 straight wind going to six and O on the year so these are just things that the Sooners need to work on to be a championship calories and these are valuable revenue these are better than anything you're going to get in practice I don't see Oklahoma losing at home this season they've won 39 straight they're in Norman don't throw on the sticker it's going to beat them but these are absolutely and that opportunities for a touchdown could very much benefit you as you go on the road Manhattan to Waco or to bedlam in the season Dominique Whaley into the end zone 165 yards now and a touchdown for the junior from Walker Oklahoma pulling away in the second half from Kansas Michael Honeycutt freshman paper on to the PhD 47 217 Oklahoma and now with 353 to go in the fourth but you know Bob Stoops the championship in 2000 they played for the national championship three other times is when you get to that level playing the national championship there are things in the season you say okay this is where we need to work this is where we have to get better it's not a perfectly formed team right out of the chute very often anywhere in college football so it's identifying those types of things brought to try and get Oklahoma back to the championship loving that's exactly right it's a building process and Dominique Whaley is going to be an important piece here down the stretch as he's been this season is the Sooners leading rusher they're not terribly complicated especially in their run game as a stretch zone play where they get those big athletes up front moving and get you running back to plant that foot go down hill don't come away from this game tonight yeah I may be a little disappointed and in the execution for Oklahoma the three turn over some of the red zone struggles I still think Oklahoma and Oklahoma State very much the class of this big 12 conference great kick return to about 35 by Edie pink Belleville Illinois nine hours away from sunday NFL countdown presented by IBM so just put a pot of coffee on and spend your morning with boomer and the guys metal in between the bills and Giants is being Sunday NFL countdown 10 a.m. Eastern Time 1 a.m. Eastern Time right now Kansas trying to get a first down in the second half Jordan Webb and the Kansas offense have yet to move the chain back down in fact by Corey Mills if it's some bigger Oklahoma team is Chuck long said watching the film and watching these guys live and especially the disposition in the second half this may be one of the fastest defenses that Oklahoma's ever had and it rivals there is some of those SVT defense this is not in the class I don't think of an Alabama and LSU which are truly special and they're to go first first down to the second half the people the Tigers and the Crimson Tide they're not going to be running away from Oklahoma if they can find themselves back in that championship game visit with Bob Stoops this week after his brother Mike Stoops let go is the head coach at Arizona we spent a lot of time around Mike think the last couple of years fully elevated that Arizona program put them back on a winning path in trading take the sack there's growing melted after him again excellent these couple weeks ago about the Stokes with the Dukes coaching family from Youngstown Ohio and how close and how intense and how passionate the scoops family is when it comes to coaching that's tough when you see oh I'm Simon Arizona in like that absolutely but they know the nature of the business unfortunately with the injuries and the schedule and everything was the perfect storm unfortunately for Arizona we have seen them and I will tell you Mike left it in a better place and he found it his boss said to what free game and he feels good about that knowing he invested everything he could didn't work out ultimately they couldn't take that next step there's a lot more pieces in place for the next Wildcat coach on Nelson after that big back comes away neck you had the conversation there just a minute ago offensively you took Ryan Broyles out of the game you really asked Landry Jones just to hand the ball off and you still see Travis Lewis Corey Nelson one of the vital contributors and I'll tell you it's almost a trend that we're finding in college football right Chip Kelly's unapologetic about it he doesn't care if you can't keep up I'm going to get my players the reps I'm going to give them the opportunities and this is the risk you take well I mean what about the risk of injury late in a game that the 30 point game right now it's WillowTree to go well it's absolutely a risk you know Bob Stoops willing to take it in that situation and you know he's going to pay the price unfortunately if this is a serious injury to Cory Nelson I wouldn't do it i mean i think there's how you to get your backups into the game to give them these reps and these opportunities Bob knows his players much better than I do he has a definitive plan and he's willing to take that risk it would be more than I would be willing to take as a head coach they're down in very long that again this time it's RJ Washington the junior from Fort Worth who gets to him five sacks now with his Oklahoma defense that 13 sacks in the last two weeks by the oud third in America coming in I'm going to hurt themselves in that ranking so Oklahoma will have a chance to run the football run out the clock and get away from Lawrence second half that's amazing 11 yards off it in the second half or can't even remember coming into the game granted off it very hard to hold on it inside the 20 we even looked at the half time staff 168 rushing yards against Bob Stoops Sooners and I'm sure there was a fairly stern conversation at halftime with that Oklahoma defense tighten screws and they did they what stands out is obviously the speed the contact but it was just a commitment to tackle as a commitment to not give up those big plays for Turner Gill they just could not stop that negative momentum offensively just unable many of those third downs to make the play that you thought wow maybe that could give us a little boost give us a little energy just could not get anything going in the second half throughout on the backup quarterback down out there for the final snap this is Brandon Williams sprinting across 35 a fumble versus Texas Bob Stoops that his carries are going to go down but sadly for Kansas a valiant effort from any series defensively stop them in the red zone did what you had to do are you're going to give up 47 points again over 600 yards of offense from the Sooners now well as they say in the paper tomorrow this will look like Oklahoma dominance in Lawrence the first half tight one there this was a 10 point game at the half in Kansas at slowed Oklahoma but the Sooners explode in the second half a stellar defensive effort in the second half of Oklahoma and the Sooners win their 11th straight going to 6 and OH on the season 3 and OH in big 12 play Kansas now om 3 and the real tip of the cap to Ryan Broyles you witnessed history tonight always a special thing Ryan sets the alltime record for receptions and shatters at the dozen convincing a turn and a careerhigh 217 receiving yards Oh Ryan Broyles Oklahoma winded in Lawrence 47:17 over again coming up next in HR a Arizona Nationals qualifying vibrato and our entire crew on charter blacker the presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports oklahoma runs this winning streak to 11 straight games pulling away in life you
