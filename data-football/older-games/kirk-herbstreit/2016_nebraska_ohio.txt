============================================================

the following is a presentation of ESPN on ABC a flawless fall afternoon gives way to a frosty evening in the heart of Ohio welcome to Ohio Stadium in this crucial collision between the Buckeyes and the court Huskers ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart both Nebraska and Ohio State come in in contention to : their destiny in their respective divisions of the Big Ten Conference both ranked in the top 10 of the first playoffs committee rankings this week and welcome to Columbus Chris Fowler for curb Street Samantha ponder will join us any visit to this place is special not to tell you that but this game tonight with both Nebraska and Ohio State in control of their divisional destinies renessa has got no favours from Wisconsin keeps the pressure on by winning this afternoon I think that's the thing this week did maybe got a little bit overlooked everybody's talking about the rankings at Ohio State and what's at stake for them but for Nebraska right now with one loss in conference play if they can win tonight a major obstacle they put themselves in a great position to get to Indianapolis over Wisconsin and the other for Ohio State let's face it this is a team that's kind of been searching for an identity searching to kind of find that nucleus and find the rhythm that's been missing especially in the often to sign the ball for the last three weeks they're going to try to find it tonight might hurt the Michigan comes here in three weeks Urban Meyer wants to focus right now on this game two quarterbacks tonight are both veterans both Texans they have similar skill sets very different personalities konnichi Barrett get it going tonight well JD Barrett I think you're going to see him obviously have to use his feet and do what he does best which is create you and I called the Penn State Wisconsin game many times he was improvising trying to create to make things happen it's last week against Northwestern this is what I think the Ohio State will do in time is they're going to have to run it so what round picks up two big blocks here and on the perimeter picks up the corner then he picks up the safety and those two blocks really sealed the victory for Ohio State late in that game as they were able to run out the clock then on third down tonight can they protect him can they give him time something that is been a problem against some of the teams have been state and Wisconsin because when they do give in time he's able to evaluate the secondary and make very accurate throws but can they do that on third down against the Nebraska defense it is determined to try to continue to give this Ohio State offense pits and try to continue to affect the rhythm that they've been searching for there are somewhat frustrated over the last couple of weeks no power five quarterback has taken fewer downfield shots than JT Nebraska's secondary was awful last year much better this year now to Tommy Armstrong a quarterback who's making his 42nd career start when he's good he's good when he's bad he throws interceptions well when he's good he's good as a combo thread and it's really he comes in as a background as an athlete a guy who can run the option and get Mike Riley now in his second year who's more of a West Coast guy but they've done a good job of blending the two you're going to still see the dual threat you're going to still see option zone read with him getting on the edge and he has tremendous speed and very good power for a quarterback he'll have to be effective running the ball but to me if they're going to win tonight they've got to be able to throw the ball downfield the vertical threat it's probably the best throw the Tommy Armstrong makes he's going to have to be able to look for someone on opportunities to the Ohio State play these are mantoman or quarters coverage which means their corners are on islands he will have a chance to make plays look for early downs with Armstrong going downfield to try to hit those big plays he'll like what Penn State did over in Happy Valley and the Husker is by taking Wisconsin to overtime on the road last week amilia lost they gained confidence here we shall say who's going to survive and both teams got to start slowly but you get to the fourth quarter these are two teams that have worn opponents down to the best fourth quarter teams in the country hopefully get a nice close one the state of Ohi oh there's no higher honor than dotting the I senior sousaphone player play mercy from Upper Arlington a welding engineering manner as the honor said I gotta love that core not series and the Buckeyes alumnus coming up at its best your approach through the banks to the Olentangy the Nissan pregame rush with Stan Barret Mack Brown and mark may is next after this message and a word from our ABC stations welcome to the Nissan pregame rush nissan premier partner of the Heisman Trophy welcome an upstander and along with mark May and Mack Brown we've already had one shakeup in the top 10 already today number four Texas A&amp;M in trouble against Mississippi State for every night out with a shoulder Jake Cuba that comes in but throws it away story the game was Mississippi State ran for 365 yards on the ground second loss for the Aggies so they could be out of the playoffs he's Syracuse taking on number two Clemson deshaun Watson to Deon Cain for the touchdown Clemson's got great speed what they did today just what they needed to they dominated the theme they should and got Nick's looser the backup quarterback a lot of work watching with a bruised shoulder something to cool keep your eye on Louisville taking on Boston College that means Lamar Jackson and he did big things again that young man is quick as a hiccup we had seven touchdowns on the day that gives me 45 50 Louisville 52 to 7 over boss account number eight with constant ticket on northwestern Wisconsin head wood in there since 1999 jazz Peavy going to change that Wisconsin with 21 7 they should move up in the rankings that'll take your running game on the road 190 to 39 before an Ohio State win tonight and then Michigan take it on Maryland Wilson State big day for him he's Ju Chesson for the touchdown so Michigan remains unbeaten they got a trip to Iowa and Indiana left in Ann Arbor and of course Ohio State at the end of the season Ohio State Nebraska tonight who wins Ohio State wins 10th game of the year you got to be tired Nebraska had to go to Wisconsin play a topranked team and going to Columbus mark couple weeks ago I picked against the Buckeyes when Wisconsin took them to overtime Nebraska takes it to overtime and wind Wow a very specific pick there all right we'll see you at halftime about to Chris Fowler in Columbus then thank you the old of the new the Buckeyes were those throwback unis with a vertical gray stripes and ring through a laser show in their tunnel a new wrinkle this year and they take the field for their first marquee home game of the season on my case I have won 13 out of the last 14 ever admire in November is one 15 out of 16 a great environment here as the Cornhuskers collide with the Buckeyes in a beautiful fall evening here in Columbus this has been the Nissan pregame rush kickoff from Columbus is coming up next the first to look inside the signs Heisman House and welcome back to this presentation of the Big Ten on ESPN just about set for kickoff when this beautiful evening in Columbus Nebraska and Ohio State second season guide in the Cornhuskers for Mike Riley is Miss Samantha ponder coach I know it's your first time here believe it or not after all these years so what do you make of the challenge your team is up against tonight you well I think first of all this the team the other team is pretty good there that's a good football team their environment is awesome so we'll have to handle the noise all the crowd all that and not be overwhelmed by it and then play against the good team really looking forward to seeing my seems like it sure seems like your team is gaining confidence every week so how would you describe where your team is most confident tonight you know I think that they gain confidence through the fact that we've won games late you know we haven't always been very pretty but we played our best ball down the stretch giving ourselves a chance to win and won most of them so I think they respond to that and they feel they can do that they're very very competitive we're looking forward to it thanks Jerry time great thank you Wiley consider go relax at this moment his counterpart Obermeyer Curtis Edgar yeah urban I think get it covered this opening kickoff on the other side but guys one the thought give birth and the brass kid will get the ball first and Tyler Durbin a food away and brave right the true freshman I said at the point of sister for position not stand at the 25 and here comes Tommy Armstrong kerfing talked about this experience guy who's won 29 games for the courtyard at earlier Chris forty second career star look at his size 6 1 to 20 came in is an athletic quarterback tonight accuracy so important for him he's struggled in that area to last few games need to use his feet on third down and as we said in the open the deep ball taking some shots downfield to its very talented and deep through the wide receivers who will be isolated one on one quite a bit tonight against Amandla man comforts of Ohio State Jordan Westerkamp record of exroommate the receiver comes in motion Terrell Newby is the one back and the senior from Los Angeles the short game sometimes is Buster Brown game it's a long time before they going to get momentum yeah they're going to need to be able to take some of the pressure off that passing game of the pitar impact players at chickfila impact players they've Jordan Westerkamp Chris on the outside he's battling through some injuries keep in quarter number 11 a tight in his back he is key for be able to make plays in the passing game Taekwon Lewis tremendous speed off the edge and carry on Connie Warner who moves to the nickel tonight some will play oneonone against Westerkamp second seven maybe tries from the middle and redefines will set up his third down and three getting at the third free on the road first possession key for Tommy Armstrong because this really puts Danni legs going through the play ball bearing life Riley in a much better position where the quarterback run friend gets still in play the zone read game is still in play or they have the option to throw it so that they really can expand the play zone here thirty short offensive line did a pretty good job against the noise and Camp Randall they face it again tonight it's loud I'm strong that play we messed up from the circus picked off David Webb got it wet for the end zone press it back and lose Armstrong and a picnic that is the fifth pick six for now state this season and a disastrous start for the Cornhuskers and I think this is a tight window will give you a lot of different looks at this but third down and three a risky throw by Tommy Armstrong here early in the game not just the corner but the linebacker rake for Macmillan also may have gotten a hand on that football Durbin for the conversion in a minute 34 into this day and the corn Huskers are behind by a touchdown this is tight coverage mention third and three you got a chance you got to get the ball out with Ohio State Pavla to Raekwon McQuillan right there he gets his right hand up he may have influenced it as well as hard Marshawn Lattimore the corner and force web is there to find the football and he's opportunistic watch Raekwon McMillan here watch him get his hand on this to D touch the ball he sure does that obviously impacted it didn't allow the receiver to come up with it ball goes straight the air in the middle of the field with the ball goes up into the air that snowman's planted the defense was going to jump on it or had really never had a chance to make a play on the football because of the tip there by Raekwon McMillan is the progressive pile on cam Armstrong whipping on the tackle whether tremendous Heslington who jibsen Armstrong hearth now 44 career interception that's a huge number he served a lot of games since richard freshman year but nobody in the power five who's active as more fixed than tommy dose now and again you gotta remember he came in is more of his own read a dual threat guide and been asked to really kind of pick up for west coast principal for the path to game and still has to kind of settle into this game for nebraska well the real test of poise you go on the road and in a minute and a half you given up a pick six you've done exactly what you don't want to do yeah and you get you get really to where you want to be considering that how loud the environment is your third and three and because of his his variety of plays because he can attack you in so many different ways and because it's a birth possession that's a high percentage throw it's a heck of a play by Raekwon macmillan to get a hand on that if he doesn't get a hand on that the bullet probably just either completion or balls knocked down by the coroner but it's not going to be intercepted macmillan forced that interception do be forced and run I'm strong mr. generally listed at six one not the tallest guy when a pocket like that seems like Wisconsin for example last week were able to get their hands on an acid and frequently influence them no doubt about it saw that last week against Wisconsin a kind of a game within a game Chris is the right side of the offensive line you have two backups fiftyeight Cory Whitaker is in the game at Cole Conrad who is in for David Neville in the game on the right side I'm from likes to roll out pretty good thrower on the run but this one is incomplete ooh try to get through Alonzo Moore no chance they're chased by Denzel Ward third and seven smart to try to move him kind of move the launch point get away from the Ohio State pressure but now this is visit where you want to avoid being all night in third and obvious passing situation Tommy Armstrong has got to be smart Ohio State frankly the defense made me when they get you to third down how they applied pressure just with rushing for the they don't have to flick to gimpy watch out for Taekwon Lewis at the bottom 59 in the pocket Armstrong take the shot downfield Westar can't try to come up with a terrific catch here comes apply for interference is a battle on the edge there with Darien come with defects number eight $15 for trivia spot automatic first time we just talked about that matchup Gary Connolly is a corner but they've moved him to Nickelback to create this matchup 101 and you see the head of Conley that's the key you've seen the battling going back and forth with the hands a receiver in the corner of both battling not just the arm grab there it's the jostling back and forth and the placement of the head by Connelly if hit head and turned he's entitled to fight for the football but his head is not turned they're going to make that call and the ball to the 43 first down I'm strong pieces the bounce of the outside he's not a very quick guy thickly built those you know scramble and scamper for a first down but they've seen quick report about glasses yeah and you'll find this dissolve read game is something that Ohio State had to practice because the respect they have for Tommy Armstrong they want to spring it out and that time that's exactly what they were able to do coming Armstrong has such quickness but he also has power so he needs to put his foot in the ground and get upfield hard to get wide against the speed in the Ohio State they played home at night show some pressure and bring it up the middle the screen into traffic and Newby with well covered that wasn't going anywhere Jerome Baker was right on the timings it never had a chance when you're throwing a straight it's a smart call against the team the pressure and good watch it what's up quickly they're in there nobody's not even turned around and if he is there's a linebacker Chris Worley waiting for him so Ohio State's linebackers do a good job sniffing it out but the pressure captive arms before that clave had a chance to develop for fit bring in Nick close to the town of true freshman has four sacks already we call this the rush big package you get four defensive ends in there I'm strong fires off his back foot laughter can't test it in it's caused by Stanley Morgan teammates at imitated somehow creates issues play out of the Ohio State 30 well sometimes you've got to be able to be lucky to be able to make things happen this time german influence that officials are actually going to come together one official called it a completion the umpires waving it off saying an incompletion they're actually going to spot the ball and for now they're going to give him the completion now they're going to move it back it's just a little disagreement down there between the officials so we'll in fact set up third down just trying to put the ball away when hooker got the hand in there if it wasn't catch it was a fumble in the Ohio State recovery as it didn't complete third and five on a slant Westerkamp they watch catching a first down in the redzone trust this guy Kirk so it's a good thing the ankles good to go tonight for Nebraska and cause despite the injuries Chris he's such a great route runner I mean he's battled through the back injury told me on the field before the game he got rolled up on early in the game last week in Madison and yet so consistent and I think Tommy trusts him on those routes that's a major conversion here early in this game on third down keeper tries to get wide is a little bit better success before hooker forced him out it's a nice job of making the right read on the zone read defensive end took the running back and gives you an indication of how quickly he can accelerate and get around the corner the tenth play coming up on this Drive born abroad instead of earlier so kids I'm just getting something he's first half heathered account before again upwardfacing and armstrong and a muscles back and then have a third and make over here just outside the temp that's kind of a win for Tommy Armstrong in Nebraska he's going to have to carry the load on he's going to carry the ball a lot because it's tough sledding right down the interior not just tonight but the last few weeks the brass has had more success running on the edge there's been new be getting out there or it's been by Armstrong running what the best go because of step on that point I was in there back to that 33 where he can run the football fairly similar distance with of interception Oh in the first series rape line at the true freshman at the back to the left of Armstrong plant catch first down and that's Steven Carter the senior tight end news coming back from an injury and a key part of this offense and that's a mismatch going to the slant matched up against the safety because of his thighs 64 240 pounds this is exactly what this offense is missed surprised that Malik hooker was so soft and coverage on third down and three throws it and rhythm balls a little bit behind but then harder they've missed him because of his the way he could create mismatches flexed out is almost like another receives you that's right from the elbow that's been the problem in recent weight sports and go newbee immediate beneficent he stopped behind the line of scrimmage Sam Hubbard involved and well at Baker about Tommy Armstrong making his forty second start opens the game on the road with so much at stake with a pick six they come right back the very next possession the luxury of having a better record her back they put the ball right in his hands and here he is throwing the ball six more times three at six 42 yards moving the ball downfield 13 play showed you even in this environment how much they trust Tommy Armstrong shorter very stingy up to school on down in this area fired back to the end zone just nobody there they are difficult to beat in coverage in this area and softer honored it on whether the best the second best defense in the country and how few touchdowns they allow in the red zone second become you think about that and how few times that they've allowed what eight touchdowns in twenty four cents down inside here so they do great job with coverage nice man coverage Tommy Armstrong ability to create or the matchup of the big pie dick Carter who's often to the right side here would be king diverted free throw downs on the drive with that direction cuts it over the head of Carter was well covered by Damon Webb but you spotted the match if they tried to create before down on 6th floor tied in going up against the safety who's 510 even those you know what's coming little out and up give him a chance you see the pressure Holmes got in there hit him right as he released it probably affected the accuracy of it with just a little bit too high you like the idea of Armstrong putting it up in the air to get the six board nine in a chance if you can just mix it a little bit huh you're sure Brown very reliable kicker junior from Texas the chip shot so Nebraska Nettie's himself after that pick 16 15 play 72 yard drive but couldn't punch it in settle for 315 see inside access takes you inside the Woody Hayes Center where Urban Meyer has put red paper over all the other games on the schedule except for this one last week same thing with Northwestern next up Maryland Michigan State and then of course Michigan comes in here in the past urban was one of the more big picture type coaches he would talk to his team about the playoff situation you're not out of it please take her for this kind of young team he didn't want that he wants only one game at a time focus he has won a senior that plays on offense doesn't really play much on defense it's one of the youngest teams in the country the rankings came out all the talk from the world and the outside in woody his facility for any the teams in the top ten is about that let's not worry about the playoff rankings or the Big Ten championship let's worry about trying to play I guess they very good Nebraska team now make sense but in the past did you talk about those things oh yeah we have better and seen a couple years ago try to make them very aware always try to push their buttons the challenge yeah this year's a different a different animal Erick's Campbell's the nursing an injury backing to kick off return looks pretty healthy there as he bounces up a blocker heads for the sidelines and we'll set up a house set offense in good field position and we'll finally see JT Barrett Nebraska has run 17 offensive plays but because of the pick6 given scene take Tia Midway 1st quarter Saturday Night Football presents a Walmart save money live better and in part by chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich at Mesa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy see the sousaphone again with Cheetos there a penny yeah there comes JT JT Barrett the leader the veteran also big six 222 pounds got to find his rhythm early his accuracy his only quarterback design running to be big and just be the xfactor he's trying to get Ohio State and it stuck trying to find that that rhythm we talked about tonight they've got to be able to run the ball between the tackles and try to hit the ball throws downfield something they've really struggled with as you see here in the last month back to throw in the first play delivers a strike Curtis Samuel dances free gets near the marker though mark in just short Chris Jones on the stop last week against Northwestern no touchdown passes or runs first time in his career he wasn't responsible for a touchdown he's the alltime record holder did you kind of get spoiled and kind of get used to that at that time capitalizing on first and ten a good throw high percentage throws soft coverage he throws in rhythm puts it right on the money now let me give this to Samuel on the end around and from Brooklyn dances down near the 30yard line plays and two touches for the most versatile guy in this offense funny we're going to talk here early in the broadcast about some of the keys that Ohio State has to do to try to get that rhythm going and one of the things that I talked about was maybe up to 20 touches tonight whether it's running the ball or catching the ball this is Mike Weber following blocks around the right end samuel by the way the only player in FPS that has 500 yards plus in rushing and receiving averaging nine and a half yards per touch yet per touch so what do you do to try to get this thing going pro high o state control the line of scrimmage the vertical pass game Kurtis Samuel trying to get him 20 touches when to turnover margin which they are to get off to a big scarf whoever after some confusion motions out to the laps and there's a short gain just across the first down marker is Marcus bought there's a flag Oh at the line of scrimmage there is no file for the legal shift in the previous play suck it down well if they call to catch the balls of the 21 and it's a first animal it's the most aggressive I've seen Ohio State in the last few weeks I think it has a lot to do with where they started their field position on their own 43 they played with content in Penn State and Northwestern a lot of times they're inside their own 20 Samuel Traut and drop in for a 1yard loss good job of the Husker defense they're flying it down they do a great job of stretching this see them white white jerseys flying to that football for theirs inside linebacker Josh Banderas will be incredibly active when a high o state runs the ball tonight oh they offense number 65 10 yards for previous five great first up it's a rarity found help on the center is ended it for the Remington award ins the best of that position yeah he pulled around and see him off to the right he's pulling around the big center locks up with a Nickelback Aaron Williams this brings him down to the ground pulls him down to the ground it's a big man pulling around you don't see sinners pulling that off and he's athletic enough to pull it off used to be a guard the body slam there it sure go ahead Thurston's wanting empty backfield for Barrett and rooks left has a lot of time delivers back to the white and FRA athletic side n selects it for a short gain back to the 26 covered by the safety Aaron Williams pretty good example there of JT Barrett working through his progression he started left came back to the middle Curtis Samuel that eventually came all the way back to ball to the right and the offensive line for a quarterback to be able to do that did a heck of a job that time of protecting him and creating that pocket second and 15 Huskers bring the pressure Paris escapes now he's got room fires into traffic in it squad who makes the catch out is they incomplete at the 11yard hard hit by Josh Kalu the corner but somehow JC avoided the sack Monroe's IV came and surprised Ohio State they didn't have anybody they're going to bring it the pressure right here balls going to work across but how about JT Barrett nobody picks him up he's able to get underneath them by the time then dangerous throw but tried to slip it in there and play by Josh Kalu to knock that ball away first third down player for awhile safety needs 15 gotta hurry and think anybody sideline notice neither babe I'm lyrically wouldn't step any call a time hood we're still trying to get set when the play clock ran out surprising you have JT Barrett who's almost because of his experience like an off it's a coordinator on the field and you have coaches who can make that call from the sidelines nobody aware of the play clock running down costal high o state five yards and could ultimately affect a potential field goal every Warner and Kim back share the play called responsibility Warner's the primary one Becca's horse was at Nebraska is just a believer for nine years so JT seemed to want that call little quicker to come in from upstairs and now we'll take a break here in third and 20 is Oscars been one to Cassidy Hobart for a studio update Harvey Taco Bell studio update number 12 Penn State has a rather looking for their third straight win over Iowa make one Berkeley 57 yard touchdown run the impact on another TD Penn State up 21 nothing in the second Chris are we back to you like that blocked field goal for a touchdown to beat Ohio State they took Penn State to another level which they United them bad week last week they pulled away from the Boilermakers and now that's a that's a pretty good Iowa team 21 nothing Midway second we'll post of the map biggest Penn State is still very much in the chase of the in the Big Ten East there's a possibility of a threeway tie there's the all save playoff rankings Penn State's just out of there at number 12 Ohio State and Nebraska sitting at 6 and 10 respectively with the Lions it could take care I awoke at Michigan State at the end Penn State wants a headtohead pie with Ohio State where they wouldn't win but if it's a threeway tie they're going to be left on the outside and it would come down to Ohio State and Michigan headtohead well we'll go down to the fifth tie break though to knock off one of those teams if it's a threeway we'll explain more later but Penn State taking care of business early in Happy Valley and sure but guys back out now meetings 20 they got to get all the way to the 11th the newest things Eric pressures in delivers wide open kick made by dontre Wilson it's a first and goal that is a heck of a job on the offensive line watch JP Barrett you talking about quarterback movement the pocket watch it right there big step up in the pocket and get the ball thrown over top one named Gary the safety who is back in coverage back of a job of executing there on third and law guys playing uptempo Barrett keeps it but he is smacked immediately by Nate Gary the captain the senior four year starting safety Gary is very active and runs support that previous played back there he's such a good job of reading quarterback thighs has come up with four interceptions on the year he had two two picks last week against Wisconsin Sioux Falls South Dakota all sports star in high school sort of symbolic of that grow for this Nebraska defense red song has been an area of concern for hyoe State against the tonton Penn State Northwestern in the last three games Samuel in the backfield Barrett rolls out and he's going to be dropped for a chicken wash he shows his muscle and escapes but still stuffed at the seven by Rose IV the Michael Jordan the left guard is pulling around here he actually is trying to troll this defender to try to dump the ball underneath so he's going to go horizontal to the line of scrimmage but watch this you don't have a chance to dump it right here so he just gives up on it and ends up trying to go to the outside what I'd be finding out how tough JP communit Akal but Rose hyvee has places such aggression a great speed does a good job of keeping to contain they're on on the JT Barrett third and goal empty backfield there as it takes bombing time now put the end zone back down Terry the Corrin so huge third down conversions putting a third and twenty the touchdown coming on the third down play and the Buckeyes stretched the lead 57 yard drive after Paris Campbell's kickoff return put him in good position instead have been a pretty slow starting offense to now each of the last two games turf has scored touchdowns in the first offensive possession look out all the way out to the far left you'll see McClure and 183 work into the middle to the post now JT Barrett's in trouble now this is improvising the drill you work on in practice he eventually finds them great concentration by McClure they'll hold on to the football despite being hit and good focus downfield by JT Barrett for the touchdown tomorrow run ESPN NFL insider said a.m. Eastern times been 11 o'clock sunday NFL countdown right up to kick off Monday Night Football bills Tyrod Taylor coming sake on Russell Wilson and Seahawks beverage at 6:00 Eastern with Monday night countdown then the game at 8:15 also on the watched ESPN app GT Barrett 506 start on that drawing of 49 yards in the touchdown pass in the foreign from the florins it's his second touchdown reception of the season urban boot CD and tray flying the true freshman is going to bring it out from the yard inside the end zone and get at the 16 another look at the at the 16 another look at the touchdown Chris JT Barrett is so good at improvising here's the design play when you have the receiver going to the out and then you have the receiver going to the post with Lauren actually ends up making the play but what you want to see is how difficult this convenient I'm look at the pocket nice job now we started to improvise now macgowran who went to the post sees that his quarterback is in trouble but what he decides to do is go back this way work back to that open space and then have a chance to be able to give his quarterback a chance to make the throw great fishing downfield JT Barrett does with he provides to make plays now I'm strong and Oscar's will have to once again try to answer a feed Terrell Newby on fourth down Hubbard slams into the ground Samantha ponder the brand offense approaches really intense with their wide receivers laughter they didn't make it into the end zone on that last Drive saying look I know they're grabbing you every time don't let them grab you but if the reps are going to let them grab them back this is a rough runners game they knew they were going to see a lot of man they say you've got to be decisive keep your eyes up this is your chance to make a statement it's tough family allowance age coverage guys are pretty sticky but apparently Nebraskans feel they're grabbing the jerseys too on a second date Armstrong takes it downfield Westerkamp goes up it makes the crap at midfield over Damon Webb Jordan Westerkamp in the slot I thought we'd see more garyun Conley there but instead it's Damien Webb one on one we had trouble defending Austin Carr a week ago when they were matched up in this slot that's why they considered moving Connelly how about western camps adjustment to the ball again a great route runner goes up locates the ball in high points in and how about the body control as well why he's up in the air good throw by Armstrong as well the terrific slot receiver at 65 get to the year ago production down this year because he's been nicked up and now McHale will Vaughn one of the four tailback we might see tonight and Kirk with that completion Tommy Armstrong adds another record to his resume the Nebraska career total offense record he passes Taylor Martinez the quarterback that he succeeded also got the completion yards and touchdown career records and I think you see Taylor Martinez and Tommy Armstrong kind of in this era of football that we live in both these guys that have had a chance to play a lot of football they both happen to run and pro that's why those numbers are so high newbee backup you lose the yard I'm second down so that's an hour of third and six another one of those third medians that are so crucial in this game yards have really tough to come by in the interior for this Nebraska Hall not getting much of a push at all even with their double teams now as he said 36 about the pass rush and about trying to give Tommy Armstrong a chance you got to think about two guys beeping Carter 11 and also the success we've seen deny from Horton West and goes off to the right unstrung cast on again looking down feel a nice throw broken up at the last minute there Marshawn Lattimore was defending try to get it to Stanley Morgan good flow in the corner going back to San threeport may play challenge these receivers Stanley Morgan really close to coming up with a play but how about the effort it be in by Lattimore to go up and get his hand in there to knock that ball away Morgan very close to coming down with a big catch so here's Kaleb Lightbourne the true freshman punter big shoes to fill many you may know the story samples were to tell that later with the first brass to punt some of the Ohio State students putting number 27 there was the number of Sam folks and my board knocks it dead regain there was this ceremony all throughout the country especially in the big ten the story of folks is deaf in a car accident July is touching specialists the demonization twinkle luckily was ending that twenty seven o'clock eyes on the helmets Gerald and Jill folks Sam's parents who made the trip for the first time when they keep chartered have been going all the road games this year but the show of support and emotional specials all over this conference has been wonderful to see similar to last week it was down to every single week and I had a chance to go down and meet those parents very special people both with a special player as well Yahoo would have been voted captain on this team at a walkon so symbolic of Nebraska's yeah success over the years such a talented team to have a punter and as a captain tells you a lot about what he meant that he said the teammates of his direct snap for Samuel cannot get the blocks on the edge he needs a quarterback out there trying to help him out JT couldn't quite take care of his man so nice gain of first now great a great game considering this play is designed to go to the right he comes all the way back to the left and JT Barrett tries to come up with a whip with the other was there you give him in a quarterback come on I mean all the blocks they throw for him on his running plays he tries but he minutes rustling in a minute incomplete on the attempted what I carry boy good trial he's gonna get crushed in the bellroad you're too generous I get of it end of the first quarter closes out guys on the march here already 14 3 and early pink 6 and then a touchdown drive and set a building that leaving the second quarter begins back after this word for your local ABC stations beginning of the second quarter welcome back at ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart on state their second offensive possession comes to an early lead it was a big six I'm Shawn picked up by Damon Webb off the deflection by Raekwon McMillan Husker has made a long drive down inside the five at total to three it answered with the touchdown drive and I'm trying to add to the lead was found in cement the ponder and a beautiful fall evening here in Columbus and I say running just 12 plays in the opening quarter that fell including at 14 points Curtis Samuel already has four touches Mike Webber only one carry here as we start the second quarter that's Weber in the pistol motion out now Oscar show pressure off the edge they pick it up and Barrett try the down field shot with Samuel in the seam but Gary was tracking him he didn't have his head turned a miscommunication between Curtis Samuel is China he's actually going downfield and I think BT Barrett saw something in the coverage hold the ball out and try to split the difference between the safety in the corner would haven't really been a tight fit that's why he puts so much on that exam you'll never even had his head turn what is the brass the defense has been so much better this year second year mark banker the defensive coordinator last year it seems like they gave up so many big plays 290 yards a game through the air this year boy much more discipline on the back end then second and 10 Samuel makes the catch so they do tackle them short of the marker they give up a ton of huge plays last year only had 10 interception so already 15 this season they were one of the worst in the country giving up pass plays with over 20 yards 120 fifth in the country this year totally different story as they a button hangs up and I think the corner play with how tight they're able to play so much confidence that Jones and Kalu have and then the way they carry wave to play through wherever muscle and he does get the first town rose Ivy's had a tough time tackling Buckeye ball carriers today he had a behind the line couldn't hold him yeah he sure did and he 230 pounds going up against Mike Weber he hits him about a yard and a half short right there he's done he's got an eye Estates going to have to punt UC Davis coming over but gives you an idea the leg driving his strength from the freshman from Detroit Mike Weber trying to fill the big shoes of Zeke Elliott he gives up on that play Ohio State is well short Rose I be the senior out of Kansas City and is being looked at by the athletic trainers it kind of came in a little bit dinged up coming into this game like so many of these Nebraska players that was a big stop though Kurt they you could force a punt get the ball back as it is Ohio State's marching now near midfield aerial coverage provided by Goodyear committed to honoring blimp or the athletes who demonstrate hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff IO state although the coach doesn't want to acknowledge it very much in playoff contention of the loss by Texas AM which was ranked number four today certainly helps the cause go Iowa State and Louisville among others whose Weber barrel straight up the middle again break tackles and shows his force getting into Nebraska territory he is a really known for his physicality did a good job dropping some weight coming into this year to try to get quicker my estate has been so spoiled in that position with Carlos Hyde and V Kelly over the last three years Mike Weber has that kind of talent to be able to fill fit in with those kind of names this is a young Irish this is Wilson on the edge in an honest escape it's done inside the 45 Chiron Williams just a few grabbed it but it's the first down again dontre Wilson is kind of in the mold of Kurtis Samuel guy you want to try to get the ball out in space because he can make people miss has great quickness I say still trying to kind of find that vertical threat who can help stretch a defense down the field and when you hit those kind of plays it opens up other aspects of the offense whether it's the running game of the short pass playaction 15 looks downfield does take its Samuel down there deflected incomplete here comes a flag Chris Jones was in coverage so Kirk case they give it to their their playmaker they try to get it to them but they draw the penalty yeah and because the ball is underthrown that their Samuel actually has to rein on the ball if they are that is why Jones interfered with there he is ISIL oneonone with Chris Jones is a great color guy scare the ball brought him actually fast to jump jump if he didn't see where the ball is he runs into him and that's why though it's the pass interference until he hard to claim him the corner of managed is he was hurt by a fourth row he's also got to look up try to find the football but if JT Barrett puts that ball more to the right that's a touchdown the Sandia was pulling away from Jones long moves inside the 30 they faked it so Webber and Barrett pump fake still got the ball now takes off in bangs down for about a four yard game not many design runs so far for JT ever seem to see how they formulate the game plan the Urban Meyer working with Ed Warner and Tim Beckett we've seen a lot of variety a lot of different looks different identities week to week everyone again and I think there's still searching for remember this is an offense after the first four weeks bit about how quickly they were scoring their trip to Norman they took on the Oklahoma sooner event they were making big plays and they've been kind of searching in these last three or four weeks whoever on his own we cut free whoever headed for the end zone touchdown Ohio State this is what they're looking for Ohio State has the running game go on watch pat helpline lead the way and they do a good job with the formation into the boundary there's nobody left to the outside they put all the defenders into the into the boundary with the receivers in the tight ends is left only the corner in the safety there and with Ohio State falling around a couple linemen he kind of had a convoy there so credit to the look from Ohio State with creating that touchdown seven brushing touchdown for Mike Weber he's on track for a thousandyard season as a redshirt freshman he was just too physical for the Nebraska tackers throughout this Drive they had a chance to wrap him up put a forced to punt didn't get him there and they pay the price as he takes it to the house Buckeyes rule 121 three there's a game with high impact in the playoff over on ESPN tonight of Washington visits the Bears in Berkeley 10:30 on ESPN duskie is in position to move up to number four and their playoff committee rankings with am following the Mississippi State today Jake browning on the road into the Bears report form for the real gamers out here stay up stay up for that watch Washington if you haven't seen him because that's the potentially be a challenge Calkins four points with Davis Webb especially at home they beaten some fifa teams and holmes and i don't think that will be an easy win for Washington let's give Jeff seid coming in on the Apple Cup could be enormous Cooper's undefeated conference in Pullman there's great Bryant just right a tight rope on the sidelines if you take the kickoff Buckeyes always came to the left Tucker it well quiet comes in very late from a long way away here's to be on the returning a team here during the return there we go block in the back over 33 every Thursday why I was really close when he filled a bit kick let's just check the progressive pylon camp see if he tipped out into the paint Oh close Tommy and they said here's the replay official I said look at this let's go back and look at the formation they put two receivers into the boundary look what it does to the defense look at all the defenders over here so you're going to get a block here the center is going to come around to pick up the corner and there's nobody left so the formation into the boundary gets to Nebraska defense out of position pick up the block by the receiver Parris Campbell the center point around nobody left well designed there by Urban Meyer and Ed Warner you think they pulled up us to defend for the mid look there yeah absolutely awful field position for Armstrong hit in the backfield is divine Oh zip Oh quick penetration there by Chris Worley and Michael Hill then we talked about that right side of an offensive line Cole Conrad watched in here on this right side watch how quickly Ohio State gets around of there's Hill in there there's whirling you also see Devon Hamilton Ohio State coming after Nebraska right now with them back inside their own fiveyard line those that defensive line the athletic ability that they have ilma 300pounder it's it's tough to stop Zico who goes to 30 get any practice strong experience 40 second start they got to be smart in this area I'm strong notes this day on the field for Morgan a jump ball Marshawn Lattimore in close coverage there they're down a low risk throw Tommy Armstrong's probably his bet throw that he makes is that vertical throw he when you watch him all year I think he is most comfortable when he gets back one hitch put the ball up in the air and let his talented receivers go make a play on it that time Morgan almost went up and made a play over the corner remember there's isolated one on one there that's how it was Lattimore in coverage Berg they voted thinking four shots from beyond 15 yards neither one Supporter though Katie Katie Katie a rookie down a team or as well run for the get it out quick it's incomplete noise seep in Carter too tight in backpedaling was short of the marker anyway and not the point out of their endzone one of the things about accuracy is your feet your feet and this is something Tommy Armstrong's worked so hard on what should fall off this row as he throws he falls back on it the problem with his actors like the ball is affected by it might warn the freshmen they've had to punt block this year as white up against the end on they're a terrible team in that finding this is going to trouble spot guys don't get near on one step and foots it but it's not good now it just spins and goes backwards an Ohio State will have awesome field position trying to build on this 18 point lead he'll take over at the 31 yard line when you and I called a Penn State game over in State College with Ohio State a few weeks ago and I said that Urban Meyer throughout his career as a head coach does such a good job of feeling the vibe of a game the momentum of a game and I think he might know that but when you have one of the youngest teams in a country they're learning week by week and I think right now of 21 to 3 11 minutes to go here in the second quarter it's a big opportunity for Urban Meyer for the Ohio State offense but this call is pretty much work but guys haven't run many plays but they're averaging about seven and a half yards per play so far three in the backfield Samuel shows his quickness but there wasn't much room there Nebraska is going to kind of stay in contact and this is by far their biggest deficit of the season they trailed Oregon at home by 13 of a second quarter came back to win that one by a dozen the whole different animal here tonight on the road this defense is being challenged with his field position but it's got to bow up here and try to make a play man but amongst us there Ross deserves the defensive entity only fingerstyle Barrett on playaction looked at down the middle over that hand of Campbell who had a step but because it's the palace that Ohio State's been running because you see you have to worry about the quick throw you have to worry about the run games and Ohio State's taken a few more shots downfield so it's keeping the Braska safety at bay their eyes are being impact at that time could see Williams 26 he bought up on the play action bacon it opened up a clear path for Farris Campbell behind him and that time is JT Barrett just puts too much on the throne but a lot more freedom and a lot more aggression in the place what do you eat cooked a different feel tonight Barrett again from the pocket delivers Samuel juggled it makes the catch in his knockdown should be a first down of the 21 yard line bobbled it didn't get it clean how about the circus catch and then to stop and then the jump for the first sound what watch it watch and make this catch the juggle Paul goes in here he stops and then leap right there he pins himself for the first down great offices that special helmet that that sleep gray thing with no Buckeye leaves on it you approve with the look you know yeah looks good they get to ever there it now looks back to the left and has the line back wide open for a touchdown but he overshot him the third time we've seen Ohio State have a receiver in this case of running back open behind coverage and JT Barrett just unable to throw the ball with accuracy he's going to sneak out right here he's just going to come down kind of gets lost the linebackers do not do a good job of keeping their eye on him see late there's an effort there by young he's wide open I think Jesse Barrett just hurried the throw he so desperately wants to make the throws that I think isn't affecting his his rib bones a good point back your statement but he missed that by a lot yeah they go back to that later and hand it so ever who bangs down inside the 20 that's one though you saved for the right time and you think okay they're giving us this look this might be a new wrinkle we haven't shown it we've been running it a lot in practice but not not running it in games let's save it we get to a certain spot on the field and you call it thinking you're going to hit a home run and they did they just weren't able to execute it could be big if they can force a field goal of Terry you're going to stay within contact but but you're right that was an example of aggressive play calling maybe going for the first half knockout exactly right not executed there on third down hit as he throws underneath the completion to Campbell playas s now another one in coverage whoever was in the pattern there he got locked up with the DB Maclaurin got tackled running his route he was mantoman coverage with Chris Jones holding he fed some rate metal give Alon state another first down there for four for converting the Nebraska has had some chances to get off the field another one there with the penalty and that says it all for Mike Riley and they had them short of the first down knowing Urban Meyer and where we are he probably ends up going for it but off to the left here right here locks him up there easy call to different officials made it just outside ten yard line first down on estate and to really put Nebraska on the ropes whiskers have kind of a methodical offensive style to go down here 28:3 would be really tough whoever hit right at the line of scrimmage its job there in the middle keeper different plant her tonight and sure is miss Reid actually by JT Barrett reading the defensive in on the zone read time he should have pulled it out as the end claps down Dedrick young boy when you bring his name up mark banker that he get excited about young and he wants to talk about what what a bright future that the young has it's the true sophomore they're rollin out and just Chuck's it away yeah young you saw playing with that that race and his elbow hurt himself late in the Wisconsin game you just go down the line offensively and defensively there's so many guys the wear and tear of this season really showing itself in Nebraska's roster yeah sometimes you have those years and you ask your players to try to fight through it and Young's case trying to play through that time some years you're lucky you don't stay healthy the keeper just throws it away of way up into the Crown's going to make a catch oh you got it you got to secure it off there's so much shame there to strive let me now show him on national television if you're third down then he can hear or it's been very sharp they just get the play off looks for the end zone battle for it and if caught touchdown obviously out of bounds it was Benjamin Victor one of the talented true freshmen they said this guy's ready to emerge he's improving the practice field but he and Josh glue or one on one the true freshman coaches feel that he has the body of an AJ Green because he choked Wow we'll have to take a look at that I thought it was a touchdown live and I'm sure they'll review it ball goes up in the air but then right right over the right foot is still down the other field the complete path that ruling is under further review they've guitars are rules expert here in the booth pylon cam will show it to you Dave what do you think control well he's got that he's got that back foot down there the question is does he have control while having that back foot down remember it doesn't take an attorney just a second let's see we have here got a foot down alright he's still moving still moving I think they're going to stand on this personally Marissa Pilon can gives you a great look I would agree that maybe control was achieved just after his foot came off the ground yeah third is balls in the air okay they'll be stuck in after you keep going he doesn't quite have to see the ball still goes I hope it doesn't yeah but yeah I'm with you dude it's gonna stay up I was a really good look at it that last very much so yeah you could see the ball didn't caught he didn't quite buy the way as a true freshman big opportunity here to try to have his first touchdown but we'll see what they would they see upstairs like I said he got a Fort Lauderdale 64 185 pounds more look here the only one catch on the season and you're right a chance in a big game to collect the touchdown and announced his arrival because he's come in here with my expectations and just hasn't been able to blossom yet but but this week they said look out he's going to make it empowered with Ohio State's offense sputtering the last three weeks especially the vertical pass game they're looking down to find out who could help out and they saw Benjamin Victor 64 185 as a guy that they can try to get the ball thrown to but they said a plane received there's more than just running routes kind of laughs and you got to know all the assignments got to be able to read coverage like any freshman he's just learning no holidays here would they say no block no rock read further ado the ruling on the field of a simply passed stance in other words if you know one gaming block like Noah Brown and these receivers do don't expect to see the ball yeah yeah he'll have plenty more opportunities throughout his career but obviously frustrated not getting his first one soon Tyler Durbin Beyond and fourth down play to try a field goal pigs on by the way from Nebraska brought up that if they hold on to a field goal and it would have been devastating to give up a touchdown no doubt Durbin and we missed the season was that block returned for a touchdown at Penn State the one game to the lion so he sends the 28 yard earth through Midway 2nd quarter the lead is up to 21 Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart won't you by dr. pepper it's a college football tradition Pacific Life helping generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years and Buick proud partner of the NCAA night of evidence sets with American football to play a role football over there next to a hypothetical thinking soccer ball around none not many in the tennis courts and it's been a chilly night though Curtin now this one port full in the Nexus big beautiful stadium built for 1.3 million way back in 95 years ago and then of course great renovation they down here clinic on two thousand five or six they kind of into the horseshoe era filled it in lowered the field Oscar to the deep hole now down three touchdowns Trey Bryant refreshments deep in need of some kind of a spark they need really an explosive play from somebody to chip away at this lead short pick off and find it's going to have a chance at the nine bounces off chase and it's going to be packed by Durbin the kicker there at the 23 yard line being an athlete speaking of athletes Kirk we get the bear Chris FeliCa there a flick trivia question for this evening you'll entry technique what do you have balance center center with the Cavs thank you gentlemen as you know the coach has a rally this week to win there Walter the first time in 108 years the brothers going to have to rally tonight the stretch stepping streak of their own one with the last time the Huskers want a road game against the top ten opponent and what did they beat I'll despair you know this to do was raining in Miami this weeks I stayed indoors and hooked up stuff like this you're waiting for the bear to ask you this I'll give you a minute I do know that one I remember to get very well let me do Colorado here's the L on the end around doesn't get anything pharmacist Polly can illuminate my friend because was way back to the Tom Osborne era I will add to that a plug trivia question for you it was 1997 that game at Washington when Thomas for clustering I remember that day in Boston when I was win share the national title that year was that the game where one of the washing of Washington quarterback went up and spiked the ball remember there was a quarterback that went up in the air after he scored he spiked the ball know the penalty kick gave cat I made that call in that game too I was Jake fire incomplete on the far side trying to get it Stanley Morgan his Armstrong desperately needs to get drive going Denzel warden coverage they dip it I was not responsible for this call that a jig Locker that oh okay I baked the different you thank you played all the good songs and whatever the point is Callahan so rich Oh Nene this is the first top ten road game attempt for Mike Riley they have not won one championship team for outdoor in a situation like this and they need 11 yards just to keep this drive alive press man across the board from Ohio State on the pocket Armstrong looking for his roommate Westerkamp just too tight of coverage gary and connolly breaks it up here comes another punt remember when they were throwing the ball they had Damon Webb locked on him in the slide now on third down you know they're going to try to probably get the ball to the slot to Westerkamp Gary and Conley stride for stride and as we talked about the scouting report shows Nebraska went in doubt they're going to throw it downfield because again that's that's the best ball that Armstrong throws so far he is 4 of 15 on the night Lightborn who shanked it earlier kicks the low one Wilson muffs it and it's recovered by the Braska he has had problems returning punts all year it's an adventure I talked to her but Meyer about it yesterday he said he just holds his breath when number two is back there so why is he back there I'm saying that it didn't have a lot of guys who can catch it's been a it's been a challenge for him all year long to try to secure the ball I think this time he discharged it to peek to try to look to where he might want to run with the ball but I just because of some of the issues and challenges he's had all year long it's not as if it's worth taking the risk because he's going to have that big return he hasn't had a lot of big returns this year it's about really more about securing the ball at a time he looked up field and took his eyes off the ball McNiff the fullback made the recovery and now a muchneeded spark with this Nebraska offense and McHale will bond takes off for about an 8 yard first down and will bomb was one of the first positive carries that he'd fired up here getting eight yards there on first down in between the tackles boy if Nebraska can get that going you're going to start to see Tommy Armstrong be able to run the football himself off of some playaction looks and then he can the edge also throw the ball as they said on the playaction now they pitch it on the edge here dick Poe goes nowhere first Worley showing his speed is the line but it's hard to get wide with any back let alone your power back surprise they try to catch Ohio State out of position but you can see there's five or six scarlet jerseys chasing down the more powerful the big boat and he's more of a thumper between the tackle short yardage guy not a guy that's going to try to get to the perimeter and outrun the Ohio State defense they lose big yard there perhaps two plays to get to seven yards here down by 21 I'm strong takes a look takes off and gets around the edge gets the first down at the 25yard line so one of the scrambles and I'm songs down if we're getting knocked down by hooker oh boy I was not moving there must have been wood his when he got hit didn't have a chance because the way he's holding the ball to brace himself leap cooker took the feet out from under his he could see oh the balls in his right hand he doesn't get a chance really to get his head protect his head there it's like his head may hit the ground definitely good we see the ball on the right hand it doesn't have a chance to brace himself boy just an awful scene he is still laying motionless and prayers now for Tommy Armstrong well step aside as the trainer's the doctors take a look at him concern for the Nebraska quarterback Tommy Armstrong they rolled him over from his stomach through his back they'd cut off his Jersey and used scissors to also cut off his shoulder pads and I would put the breastplate Sam ponder is on the sideline Sam sand what can you see from your vantage point yeah he's kept his eyes closed most of this time we saw his moving his left hand very slightly but his hands have mostly been clinched as you said they did cut off part of his Jersey just trying to be able to take some of this off safely they cut off his chinstrap extreme concern from the people around him JT Barrett came over here number of different coaches and players to play pray around him obviously a very scary situation they do have the board out there to take him over but right now just being so gentle trying not to do anything that would disrupt anything further I did talk to some people who thought we were right here where it happened and they believe he came down on the ball of theirs ever since urn obviously that he had his head but from eyewitnesses who were right here they said they think he came down on the ball so obviously a lot of unknowns or right now a lot of thoughts and prayers out for Tommy see they put embrace in his neck they've got the board the cart is right there this is on the Ohio State sidelines and the Buckeyes have been gathered looking with concern and support just a few yards away talked about Armstrong has been a constant presence with this program in the last four years starter from his redshirt freshman year told that his father has been escorted to the field by the police kneeling down there black jacket on the left side his girlfriend is over there you see her in the blonde hair crying being comforted by teammate Trey Foster it's a rough game and this is your worst nightmares no doubt about it and very careful to strap him on that board before they lift him on the cart actually see both his staffs working diligently together to try to make sure they're doing everything as trainers and doctors medical staff you practice these things just in case something horrific happens hoping that it never does but then it happens and all that work that you put in you got to come together is and do everything taking every precaution when it happens it doesn't matter whether you're an Ohio state of Nebraska doctor or trainer anybody trying to pitch in it was Jalen Odom and then his Tommy's fiancé left side his father right there in the Nebraska cap I'm stored comes from the San Antonio area he talked about his toughness and his durability throughout his career Mike Riley and I offered comfort and say they're probably one of the more competitive guys that I've seen over the last few years and a leader for this game I'm strong be taken an area hospital will pass along information as we get it well the obvious concern is for him Armstrong departure leaves quite a void for this football team leadership nice that he's speaking is aware now of his surroundings and his teammates father right there with a warning Pearson Ellen receiver noon 15cm holding his hands nice show of support from the Ohio State fans clapping chanting say mommy giving his thumbs up to the crowd too late to see that isn't it there's in the neckbrace players looking at this card as it pulls their their guy away and leader away Josh Kalu coming over ambulance has been brought out on the playing surface area just beyond the end zone the run created first down and we'll fill you in on Armstrong's replacement as his dad gives a thumbs up as well Rams on both sides chanting Tommy yeah gusano taken to the Ohio State Medical Center or to the Riverside Hospital but great hospitals and care that he'll receive here in the area remember when the Penn State defensive back and a neck injury here received such great care for maybe up to a week until he was able to fly home under Adam telecare align manage right here conversation with his father I'm not commenting his son in the back of that ambulance apparently he's giving a ride in the front yeah trying to fill the void Kirk as we resume football in Nebraska will have a first out of the 24 yard line this is a senior Ryker five who really has almost no experience just two for five this year he's played in three games hasn't played or thrown a pass since midseptember against Oregon just 2 of 5 on the year has played throughout his career being a senior he's played some football this is this has been Tommy Holmes Armstrong's position and and he's their guy as we said they're leaders so Riker has been more in support from the sideline and trying to offer support to Tommy when he comes off the field throughout this season now he'll he'll get the call not easy to execute as a quarterback or a team when you just watch this scene here really for both teams obviously for Nebraska they're concerned but I think people watching at home people in this stadium everybody right now their thoughts are with Tommy Armstrong the first hand for client will good start one game last year and on run was out with a foot injury handle it off in the backfield with a globe on not for a loss Sam Hubbard got there Sam Hubbard Chris has really stepped in this year and tried to be the kind of the dominant player up front with Joey Bosa moving on to the pros and fight drops back deeply and delivers a completion there is Ethan Carter the tight end just short of a first down at the 16 boy that time yeah they kept Carter in to block and then he just kind of snuck out at the end of that play almost like a slip screen watch him off to the left here he's almost a pass protection they lose him in coverage and take in five Baha fight a lot of credit for being able to locate him and offensive line for giving him time to be able to throw that football but play took a while mr. Snead to and the dog inside muscling down the zig bo is going to be a bit short so Riley has a decision maybe it's pretty easy one guy had one yeah he's going to have to go for that right now with the score at twenty four to three remember late in the first half Ohio State deferred so they get the ball to start the second half Mike Riley understand it's a big opportunity for his team and his office he do lose the quarterback run Tommy Armstrong no longer in there I snap and a whistle now the timeout was taken by our state timeout allow state so the Husker is facing a fourth and one trying to cut into this 21point lead we'll take a timeout 347 before halftime Tommy Armstrong that ambulance pulling up to my estates Medical Center Keith man sports information director for Nebraska informing us that Armstrong was briefly unconscious but the good news is that he's been able to move all of his extremities certainly encouraging she was taken off in the neck brace we'll pass along any additional information that we have and while Riker v was senior this played sparingly in his career didn't come in a couple of years ago and spelled Armstrong when he was knocked out of some games kind of find a way to get a yard here to keep Nebraska in this thing after the timeout they go I formation they it just out of it and by rolling out backpedaling this has to jump it down the pressure was immediate thereby Taekwon Lewis and the Buckeyes defense holes on fourth bound pike want Lewis does a great job of fighting off the block he's right here he's going to do a good job of keeping contained and without Armstrong Fife just doesn't quite have that same ability to get wide it's a little bit surprised by the call to be honest I thought they might try to power just right up the middle with the power back with zigge bow but instead they try to catch Ohio State napping a little bit of a play fake roll him out and he just didn't have much of a chance because of how quickly Taekwon Lewis got in there you'd call it a tough watching as Simon as Igbo trying to block Taekwon Lewis did not do much of a job with it no so 342 before halftime the Buckeyes to add to the lead if they can as you said they'll get it to start the third quarter whoever is knocked out of the line of scrimmage we're coming into this Drive Ohio State's average starting field position has been their own 43 yard line I mean it's been such a for the last three or four weeks they've managed the game as a play caller tonight they've been more aggressive more attacking I think it has everything to do with where the ball has been when they've started some of these drives Eric rolls out delivers over the head of Samuel yet you're right the last few weeks awful field position by and large tonight whether it's Campbell's kick returners shanked punt yes better field imaging ed Warner and Urban Meyer when you're a play call or even though you want your stats to be impressive and everybody look how many points you're scoring and how many yards you're throwing for him running for the end of the day you're trying to win the game trying to manage the game you've got a great defense solid in special teams and that's that's how they've kind of been very conservative at times and very predictable with some of their play calling the last few weeks guys need nine and Barrett takes off there's a huge crease and JC is going to get a first down still running out across the 35 yard line always a reliable playing third to hound is Aris take himself out of the play completely the defensive end picks up a nice block at the beginning of that play left guard there the freshman Michael Jordan Nebraska sees this kind of scheme a lot in practice on their own offense they were not 24 at that time a 20 yard gain now Barrett home fakes why did it take a downfield shots nobody opened this throws it away I think because of that big run Ohio State always said their mode and their mentality changes and you get a big run instead of being pinned back keeping your own territory not only said you're out to the 36 yard line to 40 and get the ball to start the second half Urban Meyer now is thinking about points whether it's a field goal or a touchdown still a couple timeouts left you notice how stale the offense got here last week there were five consecutive punts they had a fast start against Northwestern and the great finish but in the middle empty possessions samuel across the 40s the third down and five run Williams tackled him a nice block here by Terry mcore and 83 off to the left right there and it sets the edge there but the rest of that Nebraska defense does a very good job you can see Josh Banderas the block to the top trying to set the edge watch Ben Darras try to try to chase that down that Nebraska despite that nice block there cracked lock they still do a good job of being able to keep him to a short game empty backfield a lot of times this dictates a quarterback run prepare for the Sun he rolls and throws to Samuel who makes a nice catch back peddling tried to hold the ball out and it is a first down very agile move of the H back well he's their most explosive playmaker and the guy that I think JD Barrett feels very good about we can see he look in town where's the sideline he knew is somewhere got his foot down and picked up the first down and stopped the clock good awareness so Samuel is one in five times caught it four times 72 yards from scrimmage tonight a good first out they're at Moses now fires across the middle and the catch is made by Samuel again and he's inside the Nebraska 40 watch the play fake going here watch what it does to the linebacker play safe right here linebacker moves for a writeback knifethrowing laying there minute 30 and Counting in the first half Barrett again on play action if it checks it down to AJ Alexander over the backup tight end and Dara stopped him just short of the marker and JT bear doing a good job preserving the timeouts still has the two timeouts and already in field goal range on the pocket gamble knocked down and just got tangled up in coverage there with balloon apply your feet got caught up there with no call the mock those first no one they take a shot in the end zone Kurt yep good time to do that it's kind of an Urban Meyer staple over the years most coaches especially with the tear the vault position of all territory right now it's definitely a chance you want to take and we'll run over there have the hamstrings stretch from the sideline after that play it's a blitz off to the left berrak trying to follow whoever is dragged down but it's going to be a first down Aaron Williams couldn't collect him before the first down so now inside of a minute to go on our state still with those two timeouts Capital One halftime report Stan mark and Mack coming up Phil update you what's going on a pitcher's duel nilnil and Baton Rouge between the tide and tigers by the way into the third quarter parrot mom fake punt thanks again still got it still got it and that just prefers it alright then a 41 second and professionally got knocked down look at the routes here for Ohio State even zebra coming here you get a receiver coming here backs out of the backfield look with JT Barrett's looking into I mean look look at the coverage and you wondering why these last few weeks have been times where he's being and kind of hitching and hitching and hitching because a lot of times and receivers are just not hitting separation he's looking at a lot a lot of coverage in eyes down field Samuels got it inside the 15 that's another first down 32 seconds to go see if they spend the time out here and another good job of improvising by JT Barrett seems like when they've been most effective tonight throwing the ball it's when he's buying time and creating an Urban Meyer's going to use it second time out the clock would have restarted pretty quickly after they've moved to stick so urban says let's just take a deep breath let's under this play call and you punch it in here get into 31:3 get the ball to start the second half and this is what Ohio State fans have waited for all season this is their first real marquise home game and primetime showcase game the Buckeyes are kind of busted out tonight absolutely absolutely go back to this last play Nebraska actually brought pressure it's going to force JT Barrett to step up but watch in the background what Curtis Samuel does watch Curtis Sam you'll realize he's back here watch how he works to stay open he sees his quarterbacks improvising instead of taking off he's just looking around trying to nestle into that soft spot in the zone exactly was it what he was able to do there JT Barrett again finds him when he takes off to scramble he's he's looking up number four there's 12 of 22 tonight 114 yards and a touchdown also run for 29 yards good year providing aerial coverage watching over the hard work and determination and blimp for the athletes for more than 60 years Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoffs we're down in this area Noah Brown who's had a quiet night becomes a factor they fired short and that right on cue mr. Humphrey is Noah Brown his first catch to the fore they got to spend the timeout if they want to stop the clock it's ticking now 20 and Counting to try to get a playoff here he wants to go kind of stayed that timeout in second ensue high snap wherever dad's is free and now lunges down near the goal line he stopped the 7 seconds it is a first down but urban takes the safe road and calls the timeout right here they don't have anymore so if you're tackled in bounds it's going to be it of course doesn't feel like a huge gamble when you're up three touchdowns Nebraska will have to use its backup quarterback if you're going to get the ball to start the second half circling back to the when I was making Kirk you know this has been a season where there were a lot of new faces in Ohio State but they went down to Norman and blasted the Sooners all of a sudden you thought well maybe Ohio State's ready for the playoff again this year then they started to get back to that since then and tonight maybe he's the night well they look a little bit more like themselves but I think that because of where they've been with with the football it's allowed them to be more aggressive and their defenses played lights out tonight so they've done a very nice job on both sides of the ball what they do here ultimately could be a big factor in the vibe in the field as they get ready for the second half because again they start the second half with the football but opened Meyer without a timeout he's going to try to take a shot into the end zone he's got Noah brown isolated at the bottom oneonone to the punch up there brownsville to the right four receivers now three is ball motions back JP will just pass the Samuel who's got it for another Ohio State touchdown gage of Urban Meyer with the Gators in sin Tebow people see the jump pass the name I think people get it kind of excited to see boys a jump pass like Tim Tebow but it's actually really effective because what it does to the defense they think quarterback run and they lose their mitt their man and coverage I thought a gimmick play right yes back to go very effective on estate with a marathon March after the fourth down stop 15 plays 85 yards three touchdowns and a field goal tonight in there for possession here Samuel right here and he's going to work across you see the cushion but watch the linebackers when they see run up into the line of scrimmage and now it's right there it's wide open jump pass linebackers come up to take away the quarterback run and because of how soft the coverage was I'm not really sure why the defensive back was seven or eight yards deep there's a good look at him hi Ron Williams I don't know why he's defending the back of the end zone when as soon as you cross the goal line at the touchdown he's a leper martyr smile in season they've been very few smiles last few weeks that's like memories also been a little bit against the grain this week because a lot of the media is asking what's wrong with the offense what's wrong with the team what's going on and we've kind of been optimistic which is surprised some people this week almost like he knew something that nobody else do despite some of their recent struggles against Wisconsin and Penn State and in northwestern offensively the last few weeks you heard it there were some boos here by the home fans a week ago against Northwestern for the play calling now tonight in for touchdown lead into halftime it was taken my McNish a full bathroom recovered them up on earlier the Buckeyes in total control here and the first half that has featured an injury Tommy Armstrong who was taken to the hospital here in Columbus carted off in a neck brace that obviously the most serious concern at this point I'll state good first half and JP Barrett in charge in the horseshoe limiting the basket is 123 yards of total offense family coach first things first what do you know about Tommy's injury well we we think that everything checked out okay but that is exactly why they took them to the hospital to just make sure of all that stuff and that's all I really know from their coach when you're in a situation like this where the adversity off the field is big and the adversity on the field is big how do you handle that with your team in the locker room I think right now they have to be assured everything is OK with Tommy I think if they knew that and then the next thing is is that we just got to play better football I think they feel a lot better if we just made some plays made some Pacal's we're having a hard time getting them off the field so I think I think we just got to pull it together and play pinball how do you help break her through this obviously a tough environment and difficult situation to jump in there well I mean I've got some confidence in Riker I think that he can make some plays and do a good job for us and then guys are going to have to help all around him you know there's going to have to be some guys make some plays as receivers we got to win some oneonone coverage thanks coach appreciate it appreciate the class of Mike Riley they're certainly encouraging news will be passed along about the condition of Tommy Armstrong Nebraska is a wonderful second half game a great fourth quarter team they have their work cut out for them tonight however in Columbus the Capital One halftime report is coming up next after months of campaigning November is finally here every week every game every vote counts around the nation they hail all promising to make the postseason great they see who rocks the boat for the college football playoff I also making a statement tonight as we say welcome back the ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart this presentation that they ten on ESPN Ohio say number six in those playoff committee first rankings and leading by four touchdowns at half time Chris found it back with Kirk Herbstreit you know Buckeyes go up to the best possible start minute and a half in Damon Webb has a pick six there were a couple of chances to brass the preps to get back in and Kirk but their first possession stalled head to kick a field goal and then on that fourth and one after Armstrong was knocked out of the game couldn't get that yard yeah he picked up a big first down to keep that drive alive and obviously we was taken out of the football game Nebraska in Mike Riley this second half is about fighting and continuing to show where this program is you do not want to get this game away from you Ohio State takes the ball to start this second half and you're going to see Urban Meyer he's not going to be pleased even either even though he's up by 28 they're going to keep pressing as well it's good a samantha ponder for an update on Armstrong's condition yeah Chris I caught up with Mike Riley coming out of the locker room and asked what he'd been told he said that the medical doctors on the team staff told him that fortunately there has not been anything related to the spine and that was the biggest concern after you see what was basically him immediately going unconscious what which created all that concern they still are saying that he's able to move his extremities which is great news as we see him given thumbs up there I asked Mike if he was going to be able to go home with the team or he had to stay in the hospital he said he doesn't know yet I would describe him right now is cautiously optimistic soon think of it is somewhat reassuring first down Barrett looks for Samuel downfield and he's got it in the Buckeyes build the lead 75 yards you everybody at Ohio State mostly the players and coaches have been waiting for the big play explosion the downfield shot to connect and tonight that one did they have been waiting for weeks or VIN Meyer for his quarterback and receivers to hit a deep one first play the second half they go back to Samuel and give JT Barrett another chance you pointed it out Kirk as we take another look at the playaction fake is going to pros folks yeah he's out here the playaction will freeze here now it's just oneonone and Curtis Samuel who can get separation does in a hurry oneonone with a safety samuel is going to win that battle every single time pulls away from Williams the ball actually pulled him back but then that's where his athletic ability his running back background comes into play not only can he get downfield he can do this he's able to pull away and come up with a big touchdown you know hiyo state I don't think they've completed a pass over 20 yards in maybe three weeks three or four weeks I have tonight and consecutive Ohio State plays produce Barrett the Samuel touchdown passes little jump pass at the end of the half of them that the 75 yarder and pretty Samuel continues to be one of the most dynamic players in the country when you give it the ball to him his average per touch now is going to be way up over 10 yards after what he's done tonight again the only guy in FBS 500 rushing and receiving coming in he's added especially those receiving totals tonight I thought they might try to get him 20 touches tonight and so far he's up to 13 some big yards urban drives a once again towards the corner Brian have to go online and get that across the 20 here's our Pacific Life game summary and look at some of the players that shaped that first half right from the start you talked about that interception off a tipped pass by Raekwon McMillan kind of set the tone for Ohio State playing at home ball goes up in the air the safety web is there to come up with it use the speed a little move there to get into the end zone the Ohio State a seven nothing lead and it is really JT very improvising here a nine throw in the jump pass in the last one first play the second half safeties come up and runs the pork creates a oneonone opportunity the JT bird gets samuel chance for the big play so right there fire began throws over the middle it's almost intercepted diving attempt there by Chris Worley again fired forced into duties because of Armstrong's injuries had very little experience the last couple of years watch Chris Worley right here really I think surprised fight because I think he was expecting him to go out into the flat but instead thinks with Westerkamp and almost comes up with a great interception great athletic ability for outside linebacker Willie's thick and you should add that one a little bit his first pick of the year now they've ended up inside new trees Birds forward and it'll be third down and about four Nebraska has been such a good second half and fourth quarter team because they've been able to methodically grind out drives dominate time of possession you can't do that in a hole like this clearly four of ten and third down tonight faisal locks it down field incomplete coming over to break the play up there was Denzel Ward because Stanley Morgan thought he had a catch again they're going to put their three best cover guys Lanham or Ward and Connelly oneonone isolated little shake kind of a stutter and go that's all Denzel Ward the ball was thrown pretty well and you look at Morgan he's got his hands on the ball but the fleetfooted didn't award knocks em all away they're on third down Morgan made the one deep edge group that he's had a couple other chances to make place than it has not been able to come up with the catch life worn boots it aways a change a punt returner that's Curtis Samuel back there replacing Wilson and Samuel trying to make something electric Kaplan retreats and now's his decides to duck down at the 13 yard line secured the ball in the bouncy did that importantly another game at play of impact coming up later tonight on ESPN 10:30 Eastern Time 7:30 on the west coast in Berkeley Jake browning and Washington certainly in position to move up with number four Texas A&amp;M stumbling today at a Mississippi State Huskies preppie felt slighted not to be in the top four anyway undefeated sitting there behind a one loss SEC team a chance to make a statement tonight but you think Cal is going to be able tricky form I Cal things for their defense is a sieve so they'll give up a ton of points but they can they can score points the first and throw as the Buckeyes look for more here Noah Brown was bracketed though the passing game has been such a struggle the execution there's been little things a lot of times it's the receivers right look at aspro do you think they maybe want to work on that even more in the second half be perfectly sure I think they have to because a lot of their successful passes tonight have been when JT Barrett's improvised this is KJ Hill and his first touch of the night and salad as young guy gets out across the 25 yard line a good run pass option when they had three receivers at the bottom and only two defenders so it's been a running for Mike Webber good recognition there by JT Barrett to throw it out there where they have two blockers on the two defenders PJ Hilton shows that he got some quickness after he makes the catch there in the slide we're first down throw and look inside Titan ball picks up about seven yeah and I think our Urban Meyer much like Nick saving really don't get caught up with twelve fifty to go in the third quarter they're not looking at the scoreboard it's about executing and trying to put a drive together trying to put points up on the board whether it's run throw whatever whatever you would do early in the game when the game is closed you're going to continue to do here looks like I said 12:30 to go in the third quarter despite the 38 to three score second and 3 ferret takes off dives and years of marker at the 35 and ERK ERK this is encouraging is a motorcade of bringing Tommy Armstrong back to the stadium our news editor Michael Allen reporting that he's left the hospital quickly it wasn't there very long more encouraging news writing short drive back to Ohio Stadium and his teammates will certainly be relieved to hear that earlier heard Sam ponder relay which Mike Riley had told her the belief that there was no spinal damage at all were very cautious as you would expect them to be news he used to be encouraging he's a first down for Ohio State but guys visit in Maryland then go to East Lansing triumph or payback against the Spartans who came in here and beat him last year and then of course Michigan Sparty lost to Illinois today is a shocker Barrett the long fertile Weber who is wide open on the front line and the running backs scooped out near midfield another little wrinkle from the Buckeyes tonight just kind of a check down but with instead of just checking it down like you would normally see just right in front of the quarterback they take Mike Weber all the way to the right and it's about again how they stretch a deep end horizontally from sideline to sideline whether it's a jet sweep a throw like that perimeter run make the defense respect that part of the offense opens up again other areas rubber plows ahead for a short gain you can keep the the hang player the safeties out wide it really can open up the inside running in this is just wonderful I sprayed live picture of Tommy Armstrong walking back into Ohio Stadium look his fiancee there quick hug got the scrubs on but that is wonderful news if you think about what the what the scene was here Kirk about a half hour ago late in the second quarter he's walking fast to you get back out here he do his his teammate Barrett from the pocket delivered that's a strike to fall again as they move it to the Nebraska 30 let's give you an indication of what JT Barrett can do watch his head a little play big little shoulder what you take working left all the way back to the right keeps his feet moving puts the ball right on the money great job by that offensive line it's given up some pressure in the last few weeks but a great job of holding out the Nebraska defensive line and pass rush to give Barrett time to work from his left all the way back through his progression to his right whoever in our time tackling my quiver tonight he's Lewis again inside the ten Nebraska would be disappointed about lots of things in this game but tackling is on the list as whoever is well to get up there dealing with a powerful back who's gaining confidence each week watch him work off that double team had help line the center up trying to get to Ben Darras the linebacker Ted is a freshman Mike Webber every single week learning a little bit more about him tough to bring down bang down hard on the shoulder he is out of the game with Samuels in there it is hard to bring down but I think from from the Nebraska perspective they will be very disappointed in this tackling effort tonight 38 to 3 the first thing to go is usually the effort and tackling there it still got the football fires for the quarter the end zone touchdown and it fall excuse me Noah Brown getting involved not not to pay but working back toward the pylon and Meyer throws a dart the exact throw they threw and overtime against Wisconsin kind of it a fade pump back and gets across the goal line for a touchdown and the progressive pylon cam all is thrown right there on the money breaks the plane touchdown and JC who did not have a touchdown throwing or running last week now has a four touchdown passes tonight another long march for Ohio State 87 yards and nine players but for Nebraska the really encouraged news is that Tommy Armstrong is striding back out into the stadium relief certainly won't like what he sees on the scoreboard Saturday night football season by woman don't you boy viewer from partner of the NCAA don't for property restoration restoring more than property de l fo waka and Carmack's drew what's possible that's the best picture of the night Tommy homicide a moment ago jogging jogging back to go down the line of teammates that's Jordan Westerkamp his buddy his roommate with a hug and he went down to almost every Cornhusker teammate there piersonel his receiver just tremendous to see I have to say it it was pretty stunning everything went back out here like that very cool and very cool to see the reception he received here from the video hi O state crowd Brian from the five and is trying to get back against the green all night on a return it's so tough to escape that left corner the Buckeyes coverage unit those get out to the 25yard line rich with how quickly he was getting out of there the car and into the locker room you could just feel that he wanted to get back to his team and not to play but just to be here for his guys talk to him and be there for true leader we didn't want to say it Kirk but it was hard not to think that Armstrong as a senior you see him taken off like that you wonder if it's the last time they'll be in the Nebraska uniform but it doesn't certainly appear to be that way why of his replacement there was a dart through Westerkamp Sam I mean the guy is a competitor it's incredible to see down here he's already coaches he makes up when he sees the score he knows what the situation is but he's down here trying to help not to get more points on the board it is just incredible what we have witnessed Sammy he's talking right now Zach Darlington a sophomore quarterback who looks like may get a chance to play tonight as well he's just making sure if you've got everything covered if he gets in there fire from the pocket lofts it over the head of Sipan Carter there he is going down the line that the different teammates there they're just bobby also stunned and obviously clearly pleased to see him oh yeah take Gary Graham third down and five again takes a down field shot no quiet now late flag does come in as Damon Arnett was blanketing Westerkamp the official nearest the play didn't throw it but it was thrown from deep and one official right there did not make the call now they're going to talk about what they both saw I kind of like that when the officials come together and work together back judge and sadhya is having a conversation so far for defensive back there at 7:30 boy just kind of him out of it you think a fourth 900k honestly bring a Dave Kataya with when officials come together like that and there's the EC there's his head turn and looking for the football which you look for but do you like to see that the officials come together what did you see this is what I saw absolutely it's all angles as bad judges an insideout look and they had to get together talk there's a slight edge were responsible for that man who was a good nocall and Dave so the Mario McCall is back to the turf on sees the third Giffen Buckeye to do that after Wilson month the earlier one on the policy auditioning for the job he kind of makes a nice must escape there and then gets dragged down by a horse collar by Mick knit and then led 15 more on the return maybe maybe McCall is the answer maybe McCall it's going to be the guy it's been an adventure all year there's the horse collar at the end of the play the Pacal not only secures the baldies this capability then pulling away first the file horsecollar tackle kicking team number 41 15 yards way under the rug automatic first out my guys will continue to have great field position as they try to add to a night in offense that has not included a single punt for the Buckeyes 45 three Cassidy huh bursting Dr Pepper championship Drive update after a scoreless game through the first three quarter Jalen Hurd's bust out a beautiful 21 yard TD run he actually has the FPS best fourth quarter qvr this season Bama on the board first seven nothing in the fourth crisper me back to you that has been a grinding defensive game there thanks Cassidy 100 8750 in the horseshoe second biggest crowd ever the Buckeyes go back to work that's Mario McComb Kirk the six possessions for Ohio State Joel came after the pick six by Webb 57 in touch 83 and a touchdown after the shank punt fair with 20 for a field goal then drives of 8575 and 87 yards and you're looking at four tribes over 75 yards the one big play to start the second half when they hit Curtis Samuel but that's about it's impressive as you can ask for is your Urban Meyer guess if the shoe there it's got a lot of time now just takes off and scoots in the Cornhusker territory will be third down and I think more than anything you get into the month of November it's a month in Urban Meyer's always his stressed with his great teams and even though they kind of limped into this month it's so important for their growth as a young team the adversity that they've been through will really allow them to grow and and I think develop in ways that maybe they were lacking before they went through games like Penn State and Wisconsin and all of a sudden you start to mature a little bit and those guys were firsttime starters have a different feel to him as the season progresses here in this month Marit unheard by finds Wilson before a percent inside the 40 the loss about this time last year here to Michigan State that's the one blemish on Myers November record at Ohio State so it clearly knows how to get teams peaking at the right time and the questions I think we'll begin to exert focus on whether he likes it or not the visit by Michigan and will this offensive performance with a encouraged span that he can be free and call plays like this against the Wolverines in a much even figure tighter closer game they give a pump fake and now just ducks down it really I think that's that's what it's about whether you're Jim Harbaugh in Ann Arbor or your Urban Meyer in Columbus people since August before the ball was snapped before it was the opening kickoff everybody knew that the Ohio State Michigan game was going to be significant potentially both teams undefeated Big Ten championship champion chance to go into the playoff possibly all that on the line so when you know that it's about building and growing and developing until you get to November 26 thing you hope you play your best ball on that day Barun still firing completing in as they continue to sign hill their Katti to work in the passing game despite the 42 point margin I think the other thing here tonight even though this game has kind of gotten out of hand with JT Barrett still trying to get comfortable with his rhythm as a passer with all these new receivers and receivers from last year all in the NFL I still feel like when I watch him he's still getting comfortable outside of Noah Brown he's still feeling a lot of these new guys whether it's hill or Maclaurin or if Victor's going to get a chance to come out their parents handle so I think each opportunity you have and every rep you have in game action is important not so much for JT Barrett but definitely for the receivers wherever on third and one tries to bounce it and he's going to be hit for a loss Nebraska's defense is make a stand here and be fourth down and short and the offensive core stays on the field you know when you talk to guys who analyze DB skillset Barrett doesn't have the quickest release so it makes it important that he has the timing the trust with the receivers are talking about and I think a big part of his game when he's really on is anticipating and to be a quarterback and with an ability to anticipate you've got to trust your receivers and have your timing down got a figure quarterback run here but they break the tendon sig and he drops back straight and throws it and the catch is made underneath for a first down as a Jay Alexander who had one catch coming in as a second tonight I was surprised myself Chris like you said he could have been taken off here to his left it probably picks up the first down that is a tight window in a heck of a catch but a big freshman tied in out of Virginia was one would have much easier than a and he took off to his left 510 yards down feelin as a passer and I can still remember we talked about still working this on the passing its McCall getting a touch spinning away right back into a tackler again just just to follow up on that the confidence with the receivers the timing getting it all going and I think this plays into it we're talking about their vertical passing game you know the opening the second half the one big one other net that's the only completion downfield everything else you can see a lot in the middle off to his right a lot of a lot of that has been improvised and kind of moving around but I think that's why you're seeing Urban Meyer still his foot on the gas here but the McCall look over the middle and they tried to find that arranged the freshman victor who came close to a touchdown earlier get him his first career touchdown but soul shot nice of JT Barrett that tried to go back to him they have a lot of confidence in this young man as far as his future JT Barrett waits and waits for him to try to clear from Chris Jones to get does a good job of getting inside now he tries to separate River Jones has good size too it is ranging himself a quarter Erik even after that any completion 12 of his last 14 178 and three touchdowns need eight on this third down from the pocket juggling catch made by Wilson and see where they spot it he almost put that went through his chest that ball was took a lot in his birthday rippen going here from half 100 before the third quarter ends Nebraska defense that has been pushed back where it hasn't been able to force a single punt tonight that the will greening away playbyplay here if the play clock down and end of timeouts just before it expires JT Barrett has shown a little bit of everything tonight working through his progressions the offensive line giving him time to be able to work from his left all the way back through his right about the pocket presence with that offensive line doing a better job stepping up climbing that pocket giving him a chance there and we see quite a bit of this especially in the first half ability to improvise the key plays alive and this is first play the second half watch Curtis Samuel get some separation finally Ohio State it's a big Pro down field pretty goodlooking sad line even though again you could have been more I'm sure JT being the perfectionist will people be happy with the victory but you look back at some of those overthrows as misses the could've even produced a bigger night oh yeah probably close to 350 375 yards if he hits some of those balls that were overthrown for a couple more touchdowns this has to feel pretty good it's been a while since Ohio safe offensive plays with this much freedom as much explosion yipping around here Lauren Smith it makes a rare appearance group well he has been hampered by injury all year he has not played since the Rutgers game all the way back to the 2014 year when Ohio State won the national championship hit twenty receptions that year and they really thought with so much youth on the edge that he would be a guy that they could count on this year but he's been slow to get back double take when I saw number five with the football I know that a touch in a wild week comes in motion and fake it to him give it to McCall and worms his way down inside the five it will be third and short a lot of guys getting a chance to touch the football that don't usually for Ohio State pretty smart enacted work Mike Weber in this kind of situation let Curtis Simha have a breather this thing in hand getting pressure for the stretch around actually when Weber came down on that shoulder after one of his longer runs the call I think is another one of these true freshmen that they feel very very good about what he'll be able to do in the future five nine about 182 pounds I only had 20 carries coming incurred but he's averaging over seven yards to carry now they pop it to Smith against he didn't get in the touchdown but he is down behind the line of scrimmage there Joan the corner still selling out of course Charlie says a good job of setting that edge these corners all year have been very physical velu on the other side 10 Jones that time coming up not afraid to be involved and run support keeps I keep saying this freshman and that freshman you look at Ohio State's too deep on the offensive side of the ball other than Pat elf line in the open you're not going to find very many seniors or any seniors that are contributing this entire team is back next year on the offensive side and most of the defense play clock just winding down here inside of committed 45 in the third quarter and Ohio State you know take a timeout their fourth and four coming up took the delay a game I did they okay check the field notice assuming who's going to go for it here they're going to tack on three here the Tyler Durbin enchanted so I feel going and steak won big at home it's Iowa very impressive start for the lines and they blasted the Hawkeye's who will now limp home to host Michigan next week penn state space open to 29 to pursue tonight Ohio State makes it 48 3 of Tuesday there is a fairly important event going on in this country which you may have heard of then there's the reveal of the playoff rankings Tuesday night if you want to change the pace you know flip over there and will be whatever whatever way you're leaning on Tuesday you may want to walk you may want to hook give yourself an hour you may want to hang out with us to break down the ranking I know I'll be happy to be there maybe those change your face you know in 2014 Ohio State the 16th in the initial rankings and of course got up to the 4 seed and won the national championship three of the four came out of the initial rankings last year was Oklahoma which was 15 feet Baylor in that game we saw in Waco eventually shut up the number for Clemson went wiretowire first before losing to Bama in the championship game bundles they then defeated a beatdown today at home so they're very much in the mix you'd bigger Alabama if they could hold the 7nothing lead they have in Baton Rouge midway fourth quarter configure the tide would stay at the top comes into yeah Michigan Bellary yeah that's what I would think if Washington wins without it Berkeley then they would be sitting there at 4:00 Terry Bryant the freshman returned is he busy tonight we get another shot from that corner in the left side time he tries to stay to the right takes off a hit and gets out here's the 30yard line you look at these rankings and because of the results tonight one thing that stands out to me is the Allstate playoff rankings number eight if you're in Madison and you're watching this game you're the winner tonight because with the Braska losing wisconsin now controls its own deputy to get to Indianapolis and theoretically if they keep winning and if they win in Indy they could control their own death day to get to the playoff so tonight a big win for Ohio State and the big winner because Ohio State is Wisconsin's put a cast up in the studio thanks Chris dr. pepper championship drive update number five Washington taking on cow Huskies down three until Jake browning finds John Ross for a 60 yard touchdown pass it 73 Washington right now in the first this game over on ESPN Chris Harvey back to you that is a dynamic fasting game that Chris Peterson has five Alexa stamp and dismiss fires here the Washington Huskies who were placed it v by the committee did win against Stanford to look better at the time better win it Utah late yeah don't be fooled by the seven into seventeen that's what they were ranked when they play them Utah win was impressive that's probably the only wind it's impressive for Washington at this point but next week may be one of the hottest teams in the pac12 by the hottest team in fact 12 USC they play next week and it end with Washington State on the road I'll be very surprised personally if Washington runs the table as seen pumping Oregon today and they throw it up and it is intercepted on the far side hooker weaving his way moly cooker Solomon blocks like a running back what an effort hit six number two tonight Rohan say and number six for the season six cows call for this defense after interceptions nets hookers second there is actually a flag down I don't know if it's a block in the black back or a celebration left to see it's over by the Nebraska sideline there's a scuffle I think closer was getting into with next day I was over there offsetting unsportsmanlike conduct file defense seven 907 sixtyeight I was forced I'll drop step touchdown stands ooh those are too feisty cats yeah Nick gates for Nebraska's they're their best and feistiest offensive lineman and young buck Posehn getting into it after the Pick six yeah let's wrote a run by a hooker oh you think he could do everything as let me know he's a great basketball player I'm gonna pay you and I had a chance to sit down with him a couple weeks ago talking to him about hoops and he kind of looked like a guard weaving his way up for something before kicker except there are a lot more guys than a basketball player is a terrific instinctive run though great feel the sophomore has got more football to play at Ohio State but after he's done here you're going to see him on Sunday this guy's at Trump in what's now watched in pill Ward right there the tip that gave him the opportunity so it's hookers it gets the pick great job by Ward watch this effort right here by then look how long Lord is sky he got up in the air and they owe presence and awareness there by Maloof hoof or who takes it back and such a good feel that runner in the open field great job by Ward 510 185 pounds but hooker now his decade interception return clear touchdown on the year how about it Kirk both take six and have assists McMillan tipped it to web and that time Ward tipping it to the hooker they're in some serious oops killed of this guy he can keep it in a tremendous complex basketball player you want nasty dunk and now it's like Michael Jordan's number he looks like it looks like king of errors when we brought up basketball his face kind of lit up he's very confident his skills he says there's a few guys on the team but they can they can get out there and play the game a little bit let me shake his hand he just it's lousy you get three XL gloves anywhere he says those barely fit so I could fall that fall throw it down Iko tre Brian just worn out and returning picks on its gonna let that one go he's had enough right there now late tonight on ESPN after that Huskies Bears game workcenter at night town Gucci grass and Kevin Connors went down today in college football for CMDA NHL latest NFL news sports that are at night also on the watch ESPN app speaking of the NHL I flipped on my little ESPN app last bucket blue jacket I said this has to be a glitch the final score cannot be Columbus 10 Montreal nothing yet yeah they have lost a game all year Canadiens yeah you know you're no wine till they came to Columbus bill because there has to be a can't be 10 nothing 10 I was sitting there thinking can change just a few perfectly I think they lost tonight t1 and over gotta be a French has record though gave me you Montreal has played a lot of hockey games and more than anybody going back I don't know how many times they've given up doubledigit goals and then walk bike then go you take it over the arena last night are you enjoying dinner I didn't have it I told you I was having a beautiful dinner and I checked the app afterward saw the hockey score I was kind of kind of glad that I didn't go but in the other hand you see in something historic if you get it you're going to see that very often jack is hitting 10 well what guys would like to see this more often in 55 double nickel after 3 quarters here back after this message and a word from your local ABC station I think Panthers all dressed up the Buckeye band uniform they just entertained the crowd here hang on Sloopy traditional into third quarter favorite I think the other big fella you get rid of the Cheetos bag hook throughout the first half it work hard they're allowed to have fun all day a bratwurst here endlessly right told you you got what the band is up there with some of the elite in the history of ohio state sacred fight go fight in there it's Adam Morgan makes a couple guys mess and dives into Ohio State territory at the 46 that many the Brassica foyer is where we're here armstrong him thankfully you come back to the sideline he was a true freshman kind of signaling plays in they came here for their last visit 2012 but for Nebraska fans it's beginning to look you're really similar except they have a lot fewer points on the board Newby gets the corner and rumbles down inside the 30 just ran right around the true freshman Jordan fuller home yep be spoken to about that they've got entire new group of linebackers in defensive backs right now with Jordan Poehler in there as a backup safety and Eric Smith for fuller is actually a true freshman to the linebackers burger and vada getting a chance to play as well his Armstrong and earlier ran back out after a brief examination at the hospital on seems to be just fine his replacement five incomplete couldn't come up with it the tough situation their burger defending on seep and Carter good job tonight in coverage and breaking up has is getting their arms in there denying that abrasca receivers the ball fights swings he began off the hands of Carters he felt some pressure and the blindside yeah Inuk coming into the game Nebraska knew that there was some concern upfront with the offensive line we mentioned earlier the Corey Whitaker was in it right bar as a backup Colt Conrad is played tonight on the right side as well so starting two backups on the right side to be candid even with their starters on the road at night in this environment because this front from Ohio State it would have been a tough night but it is not able to run the football much at all tonight it's quick then they got down to put a lot on this pass again third temper price swings at complete Morgan makes the catch down near the 10yard line Tekamah throw there by five he had to go over top with a linebacker this time to make that throw over fada heck of a throw here third and long timing is there for a backup quarterback you don't always get as many reps as the starter the nice job guys only thrown five passes all season coming in and none since September new team dances back inside and earns about two yards inside the 10 Nebraska if nothing else would like to find the end zone here for the first time tonight I thought it was he a you say okay if it's a fifty two point game at the mismatch but early on a big bit of answered by out States pick six for the touchdown on the next possession who knows anybody got a foothold in this game as they got stopped out in here close it's been it's good talk for them and I'll go whoa once you digging yourself a hole copy it back fight fires it over the hand of more net here's an L dense award XM porcelain coverage now I'll say last year Kirk at two corners who played more than a thousand snaps so there's an effort this year to really keep guys fresh for the stretch right there rotate a bunch of guys in there and now the service have played far less than that so should be pressure yeah and just in the head I really think the development of war to go along with Lauren Conley who you do had a chance to be starter hit three guys that they have a lot of confidence in wife almost intercepted that was Ward who jumped it there five kind of back pedaling as he threw that lucky to avoid a pick he backpedal because of the pass rush that he felt actually Robert Landers over the left guard watch his move but he is he is a handful to deal with an interior of the young freshman that's why he kind of comes off that probe and Denzel Ward Nebraska's had some success on the slant this time he jumped it almost stepped in part of it and he would have got about 95 yards to the end zone another perk stick nobody there could a catch him he could fly more than a can make a force down near the by looking when the plan Westerkamp battling muscling I don't think you got first down yardage you're going to spot them outside the one despite an effort to kick up a couple of three Buckeyes to get there I think there's going to be just short that's clearly short of the yellow line where they're spotting it they're just hoping it could break one tackle but either to break about three to get the first down this'll held up a fist for four down and believe that was my partner he spent 38 whose theta he avoids him almost pulled away there from our net and then you see both the Safety's coming in to keep him short looks like of the first down maybe got it heylia stress that chain out there I say players no and now is now the caller for town is may initially they were holding up this but that was a fourth down play so what to cam battled hard but not quite enough a long nightin Sambas for the guys from linkedin take a break fakir providing aerial coverage committed to honoring blip were the athletes who demonstrate a hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff is a final in Baton Rouge a flanking on the Bayou by David in the Crimson Tide 10 zip over LSU so number one escapes the potential upset trap that Lee Corso and Lil Wayne set for a duo both called Forbes man college gameday Joe burrow has replaced JT fair Eric's night is apparently done a 290 yard for touchdown passing effort after tomorrow we'll call bursts out over the 10 you all safe us Georgia's Wilson cruising into Columbus force and now it's time for your Allstate street cred yep street cred had fun on this all year long with Allstate you can check it out give me your opinion to go to hashtag street cred let me know your team that you think deserves it Mississippi State the winner this week their fourth win against the top ten the AP top ten in like what the last three last three years you have to go back about 28 years if you are looking for their way through the ball ran the ball well the bear Chris FeliCa picked Mississippi State to win outright today on College GameDay so tip our cap to him but look at the defense holding Texas A&amp;M offense to only 117 yards rushing so that's a big win for Dan McMullen and the Bulldogs at home and goodbye to Texas A&amp;M sitting there number four no more argument I was sitting there for now they're down the road terms of playoff yeah yeah Thoreau keeps it and it's Russell down ask your yard law so here malinka pick Mississippi state that makes up for the misses in the Breeders Cup but on this week yeah here to give a rough day at the Breeders Cup he's you know he had a rough couple days I think you know I know you're Mike son I'm Chris just tell me this is a rough day okay he's a competitor he'll just keep swinging you got a lot of second place where he says they did second third and fourth but the only best could hit that number one he's not making place bets apparently today third and five for Joe borough in his first series and relief in Borough on a slant completion to KJ Hill and they moved to six years and 30 nice toys by borough busted both the linebackers and Newby actually got to him just as he was about to throw the ball it affected its followthrough much Newby three he'll come in clean right into the face but he recognizes deployed because of those two linebackers and gets the ball to KJ Hill nice job catching it with his hands and he say he'll quietly having a nice night this is McCall cuts it back in Miami call eager to make the most of his chances tonight in relief of Weber he's out for the evening and a Cassidy for an update all right Chris so Florida seemed to lose its grasp on the SEC East with their loss to Arkansas this may affect that tight of 24 Roderigo Blankenship would be 25yard field goal to win it georgia beast Kentucky 27 24 Chris Erbe back to you into third SEC loss for cats Mark Stoops I can't figure out if anybody he's going to show up in Atlanta for the SEC East they might want to cancel the SEC championship game I don't know if anybody's going to want to play Alabama I don't think that that that's going to happen SEC East is all for this year this bad course that will be if Alabama keeps rolling get that iron bowl game against Auburn which is playing excellent football don't put Alabama quite there yet but I think you're safe and put personally but it's okay burrow AJ dancing free knock down at the 50 and if you're Joe burrow redshirt freshman you'd like to look sharp here for the coaches yeah and he's going that means till he's distributing the ball and like I said KJ Hill is showing some ninth hands this time in traffic where Aaron Williams had him defended pretty well but a great throw by Jill bro and another nice catch there by by KJ Hill Paul picks his way go on to see the Miami fall when it hard again trying to impress folks Gary mackleton JT Barrett is satisfying evening Kirk 26 of 38 290 yards four touchdowns did not throw an interception and also ran third for 39 yards off Pacific Life game summary and great a great night throwing the ball started early where he had to improvise had the big throw to Curtis Samuel didn't have to carry the ball that much I know that was something that Urban Meyer wants to continue to strive to do to get Samuel and Webber more involved only eight carries tonight the opposite Hill on me in the red on KJ he'll break it three still spinning and fighting cuts it back and we knocked down in the red zone the ball came out recovered by selling the house it anyway for an offense it's still looking for other playmakers beside Mike Weber and especially part of Samuel KJ Hill is developing and he's resting right now and what he's showing the and what they'll see on film they're going to see a young guy that is eager to make plays and I'm going to not be surprised to see 14 getting more more meaningful reps as they get ready for their stretch here in November he looks good only four catches coming in but he's splashed tonight you're right thaw has suppressed the two he's running against a pretty deflated defense to be fair he is his low center of gravity physical back highlytouted when he came in it's just a true freshman who ever obviously shoulder pads off had that shoulder that they put some ice on didn't appear to concern which is reassuring you see a guy slammed down hard on the shoulder you do do get concerned Earl takes out guards up the battle for standing out Joe Perot finds the endzone ferretlike they're on the first and the but guys have gone over 60 now they move McCall out with a motion watch the linebacker go with him he goes with him he's a little bit unsure and that boy did that open up with the linebacker moving out for chopper Oh him kind of moving out Chris Webber number 49 and then he comes over late Joe ever showing some speed there 63 218 pounds by guy's point a minute and then some halfway through the final quarter Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart save money live better and in point by AT&amp;T mobilizing your world and the only 2017 Ford Super Duty this is the next level when shout here named kibrik it's that some of the suits they stuck around going to end mass jumping around here apparently no plans for this Saturday night just stick around much the Buckeyes finish off this impressive performance way back at horse sing the alma mater then we head out on a high street many have already headed in that direction Atika Blancos as to stay that's part of their assignment exams over he okay what happens if you sneak out of a fifty nine point game you probably lose your spot for the Michigan game what happens if you sneak out of here in the fifty nine point nine as you lose a spot go down so highway today right anybody dressed carefully help us with your studio update great play in the Washington Cal game Jake browning launches one to John Ross and look at this he presses the pause button and then throws a couple get off me and gets the 77yard touchdown to take the 216 lead this game in the first over on ESPN Prince Harry thank you necklace Ross what a flair and cows trying to threaten to chip away at the raid final minute of the first quarter to go third and goal there has an effective mood Farrell Noomi the starting running back to still in there grinding away up the Cornhuskers this wasn't able to get the running and going here a shock to the system a minute nap in that the big six they've recovered and and drove down but couldn't get a tying touchdown settle for three and then defenses could not get Ohio State on the field at all tonight quite overshoots Morgan our images of the day focus on what happens in this conference here Wisconsin's defense was was suffocating against a good northwestern team on the road and now in the driver's seat after tonight's results to get the Indianapolis minimal resistance from Maryland against a maize and blue of course stay undefeated really impressive Penn State jump in a Miss 21 nothing in a hurry and they blew out the Hawkeye that is impressive I know it's at home but I was improving and that was a patek win Alabama in the big showdown takes care coach oh and the LSU Tigers wife is completion short of the first down yeah Jalen Hurd's had a scramble for a touchdown they added a late field goal unless his offense just didn't do much at all tonight now he kind of had a feeling it's what stalkers there was about LSU having this new spirit under coach Oh at the end of the day Nick Saban had two weeks to get his defense ready and that's a game at the battle the line of scrimmage and if you can't throw the ball I don't care how good Leonard fournette is you're just not going to be able to run the ball and that's that's exactly what happened again tonight to that LSU offense yeah just like last year hey just like the year before that six straight they averaged less than three yards a carry against Bama the last five years now six years Marya McCall retreats at the quit punt for my for new role bed inside 20 a little bit more about the national team you know but guys scored a minute and half into this game busted out a lot of the folks sitting across the bridge they're there Saturday evening festivities till six sixteen play and what guys is 62 is a point short of what they scored the last time and the brats get visited here home teams won every game all five now in this series Nebraska's one win was 2011 at home Luke Vika was the head coach we call again ducking to the 25 the Wolverines looming Kirk I mean as much as Urban Meyer doesn't want to get talked about it because they got road games against Maryland and Michigan State coming up Wolverines visiting Iowa will have that game next Saturday night I will limp in there and you wonder what the hawk eyes have left I mean it's it's a tricky test I guess in most years for Michigan to go to Iowa you see any trouble next week they got Indiana a home game and then of course come here for the finale yeah I think with Michigan State being down Iowa not having a great year we're really not going to know how good a Michigan team they have this year until they come here that's the year you find that's the game I think everybody was looking at at the beginning of the year you thought a trip to East Lansing a rivalry game in a trip to Iowa City could be tricky but there just aren't great teams this year so I think Michigan's big test is going to be their last game of the year against the Buckeyes and Ohio State it's a matter of Urban Meyer keeping his young team focused is all the hype and a buildup is going to be about November 26 he's got to get them ready to go to Maryland and then go to Michigan State and then they could lock in for a week and get ready for that big battle against Michigan where it's winner take all on the white side of there you saw the the west division scenario is Nebraska with their second conference loss will drop down there with time with Wisconsin at four and two of course the batch of the overtime victory last week but would have that head to head they would have to lose the game for Nebraska to have a chance to to get to Indy yeah and again we keep bringing it up but I know there's a big celebration right now even though it's a long way to go Wisconsin still is Illinois Purdue and Minnesota and a rivalry game but it is in Madison but then sitting there where they are right now because of its lost in Nebraska they now control because of the headtohead win last week against the Cornhuskers they control their own destiny and they're already sitting at number eight in this week's ranking expecting they may be to go up to seven with the loss to Texas A&amp;M again often around the corner that's Cory Smith's on make plays and will be hidden drop for lost the job that Paul Chryst has done this year has been remarkable that they were an afterthought until that opening weekend victory is Lambeau against LSU who lose or beagle was out for Al he's back City leading tackler bounce of the hit by the injury but and they still keep plowing on and let's be candid their offense it's still working progress with their young line quarterback situations and both of them again today they've been doing it with a tenacious defense and bone made the play card in biddeford you notice them III did not see this 15 minutes or about up most places but he's still on the front plate start here how is throwing the ball very well Austin Mac another true freshman makes his second catch of the season burro's dad is a college coach himself so he he pits a coordinator down at Ohio University with Frank Solich so he's grown up in a football house and being around a coach you could tell he plays the game with tremendous poise and they feel that once JD Barrett moves on he's caused another year to play that you have Joe burrow and also Dwayne Haskins who's a freshman this year you choose to fill whenever the next quarter package I chosen burro slant is made never bull traveler said of their by ng Alexander every throw that he has had has hit the receiver right and the chest and I know it's mop up dude even your Joe burrows you get a chance to get it out on too much as you practice a chance to get out here and play in front of this Stadium pretty nice for him to come out here six and six and not only six and six like I said they put putting it right on the numbers we going to quarterback some numbers give you a look at the Heisman ology old SEMO by Joe tessitura another first down there Kerry McCauley you know Lamar Jackson is that a pretty clear lead 91% of the first place votes this is among gspn staffers and he had another monster game that is a mesmerizing performance over the little 41 percent that's shocking to me hopefully the nine percent get it some of the video clips today from his game against Boston College who actually not have had defense to 31 through the air 185 on the ground davin touchdowns and you got pole he's putting exactly play for borders it's absurd Electrify on a player Oh knock down to go peppers certainly get some support as a guy who's played young DB linebacker offense Turner I think I think that it's that's the hook it's a story he's a great player probably the most versatile player in the country and he is fun to watch when he has the ball in his hands and he's a great player on defense but when you look at the numbers Lamar Jackson and the team success it's a direct correlation to his play I mean to me that if it's Lamar Jackson there's at this point there's everybody else in the country the sigmund goodbye have done that an hour and a half ago maybe they only listen up they occur did this see what we sucked than I did just the pure fear and concern I'm Sean knock down his head so hard as samantha report he was knocked unconscious trainers from the doctors cutting off his jersey of his shoulder pads after a lengthy period of time he was put on the board taken to an ambulance just to a hospital and then a short time later in the third quarter he comes running back out on the field almost miraculously hugging his teammates as the crowd chants Tommy both Ohio State in Nebraska fans a great it's made famous news that I see him come back into this stadium and to see how energetic he was to get back to his team he knew we would play he just wanted to be there for his guys he was certainly a bright spot it was a nightmarish night for Nebraska on the scoreboard here 62 6 the Buckeyes actually got their winning points in a big fix of it in a half into the game big night for JT Barrett you get the bats and more highlights on the board wrap up after the game with Cassidy Hubbard ad Barrett racing Tommy Armstrong a lot of the Ohio State players coming over happy to see that he built a couple of Texans there Nebraska will now need some help to get the Indian which was their preseason goal the result of this game aside it's still a positive season in Lincoln they'll try to regroup and hope that Wisconsin does stumble down the stretch samuel was brilliant again touching the ball frequently and with almost electric results every time leaking a Heisman he's probably a guy that's going to start to gain some momentum and get into the into the race okay I said to the end zone the Barnes is swayed for the alma mater but guys puffed out tonight and beat down the Cornhusker is sixty two to three nice game produced by Bell Burnell directed by Derek mildly for our entire crew from Mike black marker mezzo Darren brown our folks in the booth thanks for watching Michigan an Iowa big pin battle coming up on Saturday into the fall a week from tonight time now the port wrapup show then stir up back in the studio the Cassidy half and so on from Columbus
