Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines Roundy's ready folks as we welcome you a curb straight up here from Baton Rouge where game day was earlier today I'm Brent Musburger a couple of questions now Wisconsin the number 5 team lost the Illinois so what about the number four team Ohio State are they that good well I think tonight we find out a lot about Ohio State they moved up to number four obviously in the rankings this week by four this will be their biggest challenge at this point to season they have a young team on offense they're not used to playing in this kind of climate how do they handle the adverse conditions will be a big team and I same especially the quarterback and Kirk by far this is the toughest s Purdue his head it is a very tough test but I think produce been waiting for this opportunity after they lost it was Taunton all the way back in 2004 this program has been suffering they've been waiting for this kind of game to send a message that the Boilermakers of Wrath will see as you know there have been any number of matchups today of teams in the top 20 but this is the only one that matches two unbeaten team to the top corner and when it's all said and done who will celebrate the move when you're going is the best now you're being put to the test Arizona now your regulation you wasn't he appeared on ABC here fan on ABC is the Battle of Tyson against the big they're both on pieces Ohio State and Purdue it is Saturday football and it is coming up next John Saunders Craig James and Doug Flutie we have plenty to get to including talking about that game but as Brent mentioned earlier there was already an upset today and it involved a Big Ten team Wisconsin loses to Illinois anybody goes in from five yards of 31:26 and Oklahoma against Texas Sam Bradford made the difference 35 yards of Malcolm Kelly as Texas versus Oklahoma and of 18 first half came out hit 10 of his first 11 to start third quarter the young and registered person did a heck of a job and as you can see it not the only teams with numbers next to them that are struggling or having problems going down look at number 12 Georgia it's absolutely blown out by Tennessee and Virginia Tech although they arrive higher than plums and they are still knocking out a team in the top 25 brutally no chance to sing that in this game I don't think yeah no I don't think so I think this is a game where you got to really come out you got to see a great ground grain effort Beatty wells have to get after on the ground get after them run hard and keep the ball away from Curtis Painter yeah Curtis Painter is the man on the other side for Purdue 18 touchdown passes this year a passing team only allowed four sacks great job up front they're explosive all right we're going to find out who is the best in the big ten right now let's join Brent Musburger all right John a week you don't know they will come out and see what now state buckeyes the crowd is ready here in West Lafayette how about you fellow in folks at ESPN on ABC this telecast available on ABC HD presented by PLP HD TV hot I mean real hot for October in Midwest we're happy we're playing a night game even if that is 84 degrees and clear skies ahead the third member of our team Lisa Salters down below let's check in the Lisa well brand after yesterday's walkthroughs overhauled his team to the middle of the buildings that look guys this game is going to be about persevering not telling so much but about how we finish the game and he told us the same thing when we spoke to me said well obviously Ohio state of horsepowers as we are but I'd like to think that the fact that we have so many seniors on the field that that will go a long way in fact it is the most experienced team that goes Miller had ever had 21 seniors on the deck start defaulting players early in the week this game will define who you are individually as players and us collectively everything hopefully you are on the right way right and Lisa Perdue has won the toss no deferring for Montana gorilla the old Bobcat said we want the football and he's got Brian and Kurt evac deep inside the 10yard line with Andrew good kicking it off here for the book guys and we're about to get started battle of the ND interesting Purdue wins the toss and watch the football here if it's Ohio State defense it's the matchup that we want to see under way a beautiful booming kick off in the Quran on the point not correct let me ask you about Curtis Peters the Boilermaker quarterback what do you make of this laughs well I think he's off to a great start in his senior year and the one thing about Curtis Painter is he has a lot of experience he's a hard worker last year we threw a lot of interceptions he had 19 this year he's off to a great start making much making more of his opportunity to much fewer fewer mistakes because of only having greater centers at this point go kill her with three wide receivers a very talented cut in almost intercepted let's meet the rest of this offensive if they're fine wide receiver Dorian Bryan starting off with our starting quarterback number 12 Curtis Painter hands the ball off to Corey sheets are supposed to be running back moving out thought the guy outside of me at wide receiver Greg Gordon the Moss master onto our offensive line brought down the middles paving the way for all of us little guys are in the red and all those those guys run around behind a peppery offensive lines I can down in the pen after the incompletion inside handoff our Kakori sheets his first carry and Laurinaitis he's in defensively now it produces to their defense let's bring up the Buckeyes outstanding playbyplay announcer who's going to that state's broadcasting Hall of Fame here Paul keels on the book I defend for Anna Golson playing again like an old conference performer allamerican linebacker James Laurinaitis following up the great fusion of a year ago and a secondary that played by lock Bevin corner Malcolm Jenkins Thank You Paulin all right Madison his first stop of the night therefore girl on third down to the first down working on the nearside to Greg Orton the junior from Dayton Ohio for the timing between Curtis Painter and talked about his experience and his group of wide receivers his top seven receivers from a year ago comeback coaches tell me that the timing in this offensive rhythm of this office is essential he's a split second lane it's an interception there by chief Lobo to get there off on time and picks up a big first down here for Purdue's offense chief wold the nickel man Malcolm Jenkins frequently lines up at safety number two he's very talented the Boilermakers coming back with Corey she's the senior the Connecticut Manchester Larry grant the cigs in there there is Jenkins a picture of perhaps the best defensive back in the thing and I say just perhaps there's some other fellows that are pretty good that he certainly want the best talk about his versatility going from being one of the top corners of a conference to and they play nickel which they've been in every snap so far he's back on a hash mark very tough for most corners to be physical enough to be able to play safety his painter picket line giving him time and he snaps wound over and for another first down that was cheek wall right first question from Florida this is Curtis Boehner in a nutshell right now he's making quicker decisions and you're a quarterback with a lot of experience and you make quicker decisions it makes it much easier control the football simply looks off to his right looks into the Ohio State defense he's Larry Grant a linebackers flied out to the flat and once he does that he realizes he has his man open right in the middle but it's two quick decisions they're from painter we asked for two first downs and his life side of the offensive line a false start on his snap false start offense number 61 at the five yard penalty had remained first a 65 junior he's out of Plainfield Indiana and this of course the big Bugaboo even for home teams when there's a lot of noise we've got the anxiety the offensive lineman when they set down for Joe tiller or any other head coach and they break they're so eager to move off of that ball sometimes pass block and it is such a killer penalty first down and 15 the bunches on the left looking for the solo man down right he's going to throw this away you live to fight another day and it will be second down and 15 Ohio State with a spread attack from Purdue who is going with three defensive linemen three linebackers and five defensive backs Jim Haycock the Ohio State defensive coordinator feels it mixing up the looks and getting the speed the athletic ability of the linebackers and especially the secondary on the field to defend the four wide receiver look from Purdue very important to give themselves a chance to stop saw number one Marcus Freeman member that I like as there is making the stop on cue and Marcus Freeman brings him right down so when we talk about sprinkler sprinkler Fez mission the linebackers and he's mentioned this Purdue offense there you can see in the big 10 in defense of the Buckeyes over there on the left the offense for Purdue on the right so we definitely have strength on strength right now for this third down coming up Kirk and you also have a great deal of experience for both sides they're three returning nine starters Ohio State really bringing back the entire defense from a year ago Cameron Heyward rushman checks in for the Buckeyes they throw in underneath sort of a first down they drop it off to the tight end Dustin Keller and Larry grant defending him so Kirk let's talk about Cameron Heyward number 97 who was on for his first half Ironhead here with the late character behind running back played the National Football League and his son would come in and out as a defensive end right now for the rare to see a true freshman get an opportunity but with Lawrence Wilson's injury early he's been pushed into action we're about to see the puck eyes for the first on this take a boilermaker bounce and it'll be down in town at the 15yard honor Jared Armstrong berries Ohio State and College Beckman that will meet the bucks you're watching ESPN on ABC folks hey take a look at that end zone down to our right down here guys there are thousands thousands of Ohio State fans here tonight wearing red their wrote behind the book i huddle and they've got coming up I may be active and I nod Beckman brings the offense up to the line of scrimmage here's 15 he was with the first carry and let's go back to bulkiest introduced these Iowa State offense 5 State's offense is led by quarterback Todd Beckman who's number one of the conference in passing efficiency tailback Chris beany wells with four straight 100yard rushing games and on the offensive line dear senior and local media favorite Kurt Parton and I started not to presented by Dell later than Saturday Night Football second down and five in truffle opens with wound back H back looking without end place a fact his first task is for the first hour of 52 the 27 yard line and Terrell Vinson the senior corner from Irvine California defending row Biscay I simple throw here for Todd Beckman mentioned is huge I mean he is 23 years old but young as far as opportunities to get out there and play for Ohio State and nice simple throw here for him to try to find his rhythm and settle down on the road against him for their defense and deal with his crowd with blue Sun God rolling hard to the right on the throw complete and 8 yards and now let's meet the defense in here is cliff April and we behind the action Brenda look like Ohio State's going to get caught for a late hit like Steve raring hit a Purdue player after the whistle was blown after the play was over dead ball personal foul often second Steve raring to the left guard negate a bit gain and again it's all about trying to create some rhythm we saw Purdue make a mistake to set themselves back and after a nice completion on first in 10th Ohio State now sets themselves back for second and 17 going T Hillery 515 yards and a 1st and 10 Brian Hartline was followed by Royce Adams catheters defense number fans 15 yards only from the previous spot with an automatic works at big friends at Ohio State has to show the ability to do is throw the ball vertically and that time at that time Adams put his arm right around heart by his heart line was going up for the catch he felt he didn't touch him that you could see in the replay that the left hand came around the waist of heart line bio states people which is the best role Pat Beckman has in his arsenal important tonight to open up those running lanes for being well bugeyed 35 we're off shift late incomplete for Biscay the intended target and now let's go to cliff April start line up to do deeper right next to you that I was going to be a real a train for the line bags you guys Josh Ferguson aka Fergalicious from Florida and for the DB's you got to row Vincent aka TV tricep them boiled down there and you got justice Scott okay both the hard demon defense now looking at a second intent for the book he explodes force to midfield Chris Wells the sophomore from Akron and Justin Scott forced to make the sign Feeny Wells has been talking a lot about his ankle bothering him in fact he's walking off the field right now but the offensive line for Ohio State is a great strain Jim Tressel told me this week mentally for the best offensive line that he has has he been a Columbus coaching for Ohio State with the ankle beanie well to become a huge story in this game it's been bothering for the last few weeks and he's now checked out again putting Maryse or MOU Wells and in here he is across midfield force outbreaks to daylight and he's just short of the 30yard line Brandon king the free safety that's 21 more rushing yards and Rox backs defense back on its heels but they are back on their heels and I think it's a combination Ohio State coming out throwing the football but what a block by the fullback Johnston number 49 right there to open up to the outside and then the receivers hard line picks up a block risky downfield trying to pick up a block anytime you see a running back pick up big yards you know you have to have outstanding perimeter blocking at Ohio State's receivers showing that right there they're going deep Fanning complete robust be being defended there was some bumpin with Vinson but no flag this time and there's the default curb you spoke about yeah I think you're going to see more and more of that the reason is Purdue has to get an extra man down the box to try to slow down Ohio State powerful running game so if it's oneonone on the outside Jim Tressel fielded Todd Beckman can throw it downfield comes on my own state is not just going to run the football this year with Todd back but if the first year starter look at the incredible balance of running in throwing be well getting that acreage checked out for the Ohio State Medical Center second and ten short of the first down on at the 27yard line to be third down as Stanford keg lured defended part line that not so the fine senior linebacker from Indianapolis was all over the receiver and this will put the eyes here in a third down play in the 26 yard line Kirk they need to reach the 21 we mentioned in the open how Purdue has been suffering a bit the last couple years and been waiting for an opportunity brought back because the coordinator former player the Boilermakers feels very confident with this group because of the experience that they bring back they've seven senior starters to get playful Corey Williams checks into the secondary on this third down Enzo Ohio State rain fall the sophomore from Cleveland working against worse Adams and I'm sure that replay will take a look to make sure that one foot is down in bounds and looked like he got running and maybe a second no question he one down the left foot is then you know it's interesting at a first try Brentford Ohio State has decided to come out three or four times they're trying to get the ball down field to try to challenge this produce secondary the only question is did he bobble the ball like he's secured it I'm sure they'll take a look at that extra point is good so Ryan Praetorius adds the extra point Ohio straight strikes first very nice Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines with Southwest Airlines convenient nonstop flight it's like having your own company play visit Southwest comm Verizon Wireless for bold moves they happen every day and Taco Bell think outside the bun now there's some great pictures college football folks but to hear West Lafayette you just stop by Bruno that's for all these oh oh really like you've made it in there a few times indeed came lamin and I go down and dirty basketball he doesn't open place will go down I'll join you join get over him and feel the spirit of it wrestle with the ball on the feet kick it off it drives one out of the endzone back to touch down curve but again taught Beckman has the ability to throw such a fine beat boy gets back he's in rhythm puts it to the outside shoulder and for Ohio State fans they've known a lot about Ribisi and heart line but to see number four small out of Cleveland Linville step up and make a play downfield fans have been waiting for small to be the next head again any time you see him make a play like that they get excited he did secure the ball and get his left foot in for the touchdown leprechaun catch let me guess applause Brian Curtis Painter now we'll see if the Boilermakers can answer the bell three down linemen look sad bring the linebacker they hit Peter on the release suck it down and ten and that was Marcus Freeman Freeman and Laurinaitis are the two best blitzing linebackers on the Buckeyes well real could do it Freeman is going to come around and get the pressure I think it's a little bit of confusion you have an odd look upfront the offensive lineman gets a little confused Setzer comes down because he feeds Freeman a line right in the middle of that defense just comes right around and has a clear shot to the quarterback Werner's pressing sheets going nowhere and Freeman again is off to a great start defensively here for the bug eyes in Jimmy Hickok you touched on Freeman ran a couple times and led to a few plates for him now he has really improved this year as a junior good especially last couple of weeks he's been more physical it's almost the distance he's being the field but much better he playing faster a different turning it loose which is a breath of fresh air for Jim he cot and Luke pickle Laura victreebel confused and 1/3 down horrific coverage that time it was no daylight over there for Gregor and Washington Donald Washington the sophomore from Indianapolis they had really covered him up that's the play that purview we'll have to hit if Gregor is alone one on one with Donald Washington on the back side away from the three receivers they've got to be able to convert oneonone or it'll be a long night for Purdue's office small is back on the field again he's back there with Hart line to return this point not a good punt down at the 41 yard line so Jared Armstrong a little shaky here at the start and a short field to work with you're watching ESPN on ABC area coverage to the game courtesy of the Outback Steakhouse airship bloomin onion one bag state has airship specializes in aerial sports coverings up for the bloomin onion at sporting events throughout the year only its 23 yard punt has quickly go to make a defense in jeopardy here again as Chris beanie well tucks back in behind Johnson he's the tailback the ankle is we taped down and he was get a carry after coming off the bench and he pounds behind the left side of that veteran offensive line and Josh Ferguson makes the stop Turk well one of the things about this offense was how would they be able to replace Troy Smith and Anthony Gonzales and Antonio Pitman and Ted Ginn lost obviously all of their passing most of the rushing and most of their receiving and putting in a quarterback who didn't have a lot of experience in contract but Bryan risky has been asked to step in Brian Hartline finances have been and all they've done is average 36 points a game up to this point and also a great start tonight in their toughest environment that they've faced all here Jake Ballard in beckylyn with time whiskey again for the first down breaks the tackle and he is down at the 21 yard line David but something about Todd Beckman did you kind of fit his age he's 23 years old and it seems to me that he gets better and better almost every single day there have to be quarterbacks in the NFL young way that he is the 3ds going to night here at college he's on the sixyear plan is the gray beard yeah but it's a huge series for Purdue they've got to keep it's brown the game and step up and make employ to stay in the game all game emotionally back when you complete puts it in the hands of small again great speed and he is down at the 8 yard line that was david kinder when he well designed playing again very impressive to see ohio state throwing the ball they're going to have to tight in take the linebacker and you'll see a receiver come underneath welldesigned cleared out second heckler goes out look at the opening right underneath that and when you give raise small space who's very fortunate that time he didn't take it all the way to the end zone Rory Nicholas Jake Ballard both out there the power I Johnson back at the fullback and a couple of yards Josh Ferguson the senior from Florida number 17 defensively for Purdue this was tough field position Kirk that 23 yard punt really put this defense in jeopardy sure did and their way to scheme started out for do cook football it surprised me they tonight's drive going they had a false start and from that point on they did not been able to do anything right Torian Washington I feel it to question Texan a wide receiver and shuffle spread the field fires high grab touchdown and this was for I'm Brian Hartline and that's the second touchdown pass of the night by Todd Beckman boy is this Ohio State team making a statement here in the early going both times the offenses had an opportunity to be on the field they have marched right down the field and it's been hot Beckman throwing the football one on one hard line against the linebacker you think that every single time ball is perfectly placed by Beckman and a great catch by the young part line notorious tax on the extra point let's hear that offensive line against filler food very cord old person important no one's touched Beckman yet we welcome you back to West Lafayette 14nothing the Buckeyes strike first in Turk a lot of your friends here in West Lafayette wanted to make sure that you felt very very comfortable and you could sell see what the fan Jill this is a black out night yeah they wanted to make sure you take this home to the to the family here like I said I will do that I appreciate you as an Ohio State alum but you're rolling already but the black out right now and it's kind of it's been muted occupy yeah they need to get something them guard again a right back out here let's see if jump you can do nothing oh great coverage by the Buckeyes he's down at the 21 yard line Dorian Bryant a fine wide receiver and right now just listen quiets qualities oh yeah anytime you get a heavy favorite on the road you've got to keep the crowd in the game it got to be the 12th man they've got to be a factor they help you get over the hump and this is exactly how Purdue did not want this game to start an honor of Illinois hi folks you know look at some folks are saying because Wisconsin was the fifth ranked team in the nation that that was an upset well one way to look at upsets is the rankings and if you view that then yes it was however the oddsmakers having looked at wisconsin out at UNLV and watch them struggle out there they installed the Illini as a favorite at home in that game and it'll always step up today or did they ever run fill last week and take care of Penn State this week with everybody waiting to see an April real boy to his team make a statement and a shard mendenhall people around the nation need to pay attention what he is doing juice Williams seems to get most of the credit at the quarterback position but that's the tailback Mendenhall the physical path our referee Steve Heymann has sorted out the flag and Navigator rekick game this time from the 25 yard line so pillar and the Boilermakers are trying to give Bryant a shot at going to daylight but a great coverage just see how the Buckeyes come to the second 2009 25 looks for a priest in a jitterbug well they picked up some we artista to 32 now we'll see what Curtis Painter in the offense can do we talked about cookies suffered as a program and Joe tiller is really been going through the tough times because you kind of expected Purdue through the proof freeze era and Kyle Orton it's always expected to Purdue to be a team that was capable of getting to seven or eight or nine wins in the last few years they just had not had the kind of team that I think Big Ten fans have come to be a custom of Joe tiller and Purdue but he loves 15 this is not the start that he envisioned I'm sure bringing the end around and Ohio State's Freeman wow what a good looking linebacker he is and that you talked about how important this game is for Purdue in the what we all ask Joe tiller about just that you know the excitement surrounding this game is maybe out of the portion for the game itself and there wasn't quite sure but you know we need to stay grounded it's been a challenge for us and a challenge for our players because their classmates everyone on campus is excited about this game everyone the community's excited so it's been a challenge to keep them grounded looking for a first down here and they cannot get it Jake Standefer Christian receiver that time the senior from Indiana and Joe tiller knows now it is really uphill being down two touchdowns to a defense that good Joe thinks might be the best Ohio State defense he's looked at since he's been here now remember he has not played Ohio State the last couple years who didn't know that bunch intimately last year but he said they're looking at the tape this week there is no question this is a very talented ID 3:20 left here they are people to help out defensively on that reception Dustin Keller the type in Liguria Bryant gets most of the attention in the Purdue offense the Arsenal Dustin Keller the big Tynan is picked for about 250 pounds is one of the more reliable tight ends in the country and he's give you an idea of his athletic ability once Anderson Russell comes into close on him he's able to shake off and pick up another 10 yards and the timing could not have been any bigger for Purdue they're on third down to get across midfield soar 20 yard gain a march in to Ohio State Territory at the 44 yard line dear King the freshman's the running back diggities first carry no more than a couple of yards and there is that man freeman again and right now let's check in with New York back in New York I'm Matt Winer here to keep you off the data what's happening all around college quickly first up this Taco Bell update from Piscataway New Jersey Cincinnati and Rutgers Ben mock big top by Devin McCourty 36 yards big big so it's 7 nothing there meanwhile at the Rose Bowl you see always just kick the field goal the Bruins needed Reno hustles it out of bounds nobody was open it is so hard against this Ohio State front to find a Steve we have been bragging about Laurinaitis for a couple of years but Marcus Freeman is about an active and tough a linebackers we've seen this year as I said I think the last couple weeks the light have caught on for Marcus Freeman and he is out all over the field and tonight and kind of good job of preparing himself for this game because he's leading his team and quickly closing in on painter in the running backs in Purdue picked up this time almost intercepted fourth down as Anderson Russell the free safety the designer between the quarterback painter and his receivers of all the offenses in the big 10 it's essential for painter and his receivers to be on the same page because a lot of times he's throwing the ball anticipating the throw well before the receiver gets to his final position of turning back to the ball and there's a miscommunication Bryant with to the outside he to it to the inside if he's very fortunate that Russell didn't step in front of it for the pick I save Armstrong to punish better this time fair catch small slips down knee touched down just inside the 10yard line so this a little bit different field to work with well so if we can ask our shuffle to standing to the chase for the NASCAR Nextel boost at Talladega the car tomorrow hits the high bank over 33 degrees tomorrow and be on ABC beginning at 1:00 Eastern with NASCAR countdown you know we talked about the car tomorrow and right there hope that that's the car yesterday that's a cool entrance though and they run on the field just the last time I think they were fire health they need to make the play to get his crown back into the game Feenie well the Ohio State tailback straight ahead hops the middle of that defense Anthony Hager so Beckman is off to a big start well I think the thing that he's showing tonight is confidence and Jim Tressel is showing a lot of confidence in him for giving an opportunity to throw a lot on first content and when you give a quarterback time to throw the football especially with the group receivers of Beckman hands he's going to take advantage of it but he has with very calm and cool throwing his third world start his career he's serving a call with a few touchdown lead and only resist an interception they bring back beany wells number 28 that time as he was coming around the corner for a first antenna and vertices happy that the chains are moving I'm second touchdown in being 23 years old he's one of these guys who grey shirted once you brace her all the way back to the 2003 be felt long he's been playing football for IO state that he redshirted I mean he's been a backup for Troy Smith for a number years and now he finally get the opportunity go in deep right side battle for the Volvo Biscay can't quite hang on and he was defended by sophomore David kinder they Jim Tressel is making it very clear that he's going to attack the Purdue defense downfield all night until they're able to make adjustment Verbitsky got up he's in position to make the catch he you won't see that happen very often it's one of the more sure handed receivers in college football this year he was up great position just not able to hold on to it with Purdue loading the line of scrimmage to stop any wells they've got to be able to play oneonone on the outside against Ohio State Bristol Cassandra Krista a little bit of a crease but Jason Warner a linebacker 50 Milton and final minute 15 coming up here in the opening quarter the Buckeyes battle of the unbeatens couple touchdown up on the board Perdue defense if they last time they rust in Ohio State threw a touchdown pass this time if they try to bring some preference was free Backman in review and their first down for your nickel and this time a higher state is forced to find any time a defense ring free the logic behind that is to keep everything in front of you and did you have to close in and be sure cackles and the two times five we think to do make the kind of play that they have to make to get their defense off the field and give first pain or an opportunity again to try to move the ball down the field you know standing back there Dorian Bryan's waiting for the Passover trying to give pride as many touches as possible 23 cannot escape the Gunners Wow and Tyler molar made a terrific plays we send you to New York and that wider Thank You breastess what's in a minute is powered by Visio Wisconsin was one of the beautiful 10 teams to escape last week but their 14 game win streak ended today at Illinois Rashard Mendenhall of free touchdown meanwhile Tennessee blitz proved the Georgia Bulldogs today they were 28 nothing on their way to the worst loss in four seasons for Georgia Mark Rick's first Walton four trips to Knoxville and here Peter and the Boilermakers trailing by two touchdowns and not much doing four so on Lyman Nets his first reception of the night and the time runs out on our opening quarter here's ESPN Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines will return after this message board from our ABC stations well our great area of shots tonight courtesy of our friends at Outback Steakhouse the Outback Steakhouse airship the bloomin onion one by Dario coverage for sporting events across the country the Buckeye defense choking down on the Purdue offense eight yards rushing for the Boilermakers net opening for 53 yards passing and painter six of blow for 53 that's only their kid or something like the little four yards on the 10th and that will not do it suck it down now compare the Boilermakers as we start if I can play back gorillas in Philly hit only release as the arm was coming forward I think that will be an incomplete pass yes it is he was hit by cheek walk of HHM day cheek water they continue to bring pressure from different spots this time from the corner towards the boundary Chico with the nickel package is the quarter heat up there he had great feed and closed in on banner before painter could get rid get rid of the ball Chico comes in at the nickel and the fastest players on the team he anchored with four by one hundreds of fast Frank Ohio State Peter willing to pocket to the left fires and almost intercepted by Laurinaitis number 33 already has two picks this year and that is close to number three well there's the difference in James Laurinaitis is Jamie become more physical but he's also mean at the same time talk about having framed instinct and field watch how he closes in looks around heads on a swivel he beat Bryant we've been working on all week he knows the ball probably going to be coming his way and he closed on that throw like a corner would close on it on Shawn busy tonight at the 35 by hotline and he is out the 39 so let's take a look at the Pacific Life game summary here dues have to be able to get some more offense going you're talking about a team discount to be close to 500 yards a game and clearly they can't get anything going because Ohio State is set the tone by being more aggressive I think it stands out to me the soul yards for Ohio State of 148 but tremendous balance c57 running 291 passes and they have gone down field Jim Tressel sending a message Memphis for Joe Miller he will continue to attack down field because of the confidence that he has any thought about that starting thing back then hands off tomorrow with a 43 yard line and Maurice checks in and my baby smiles with these stop can't say enough about the difficulty of replacing a trophy quarterback first round wide receivers in a starting tailback and to be on the road your first road test see how they would handle the adversity of conference play to start off like this Anthony Jim Tressel credibly proud again for confidence on first Thorin Trevor Robinson is the neat pull back on this isoh play and the least wells squirts through Clarice to a first down and Robinson led the way that time show the fellows who replaced them and they feel pretty good job yeah yeah I think it all starts with Feeney wells were built you've got to stay healthy because everything revolves around his ability to run the football being physical Brian Rowe Biscay is off to a great start leading the Big Ten and receiving yards a game of course Todd Beckman's leadership and decision maker Josh Ferguson's the injured Boilermaker right now they senior middle linebacker really one of the leaders for Purdue as a senior he's right the middle with a boilermaker defense hopefully he'll have a chance to get back out on the field for the boilers in Bic senior from Louisville checks into the middle of that defensive line but once the Buckeyes took 14 foot points up on the board and coming from behind against the US it has been stuffing now here's your third down effect me and the bus Oh small again first down on that pass where anytime a corner on third and short gives you about a 10yard cushion on Benton's could have sale right in front of me I'll take that every single time to the first down but I can't say it enough how difficult it is to replace Torrey Smith who is the pulse we at Ohio State up number of times last year just the heartbeat of Ohio State's team you lose them and the receivers I think a lot of people expected pretty significant drop off my estate office bmp2 you know they played very well and certainly off to a great start here tonight leading by four feet hurt they're in the Purdue territory again and here is a yesterday ray Paul breaks today light to the 30yard line Averell makes the play defensively but that's ray small there's becoming a huge problem for Purdue that's four catches tonight for 62 yards and a touchdown great small if the neck petkin as far as Ohio State fans the Ohio State coaches are concerned it's just a matter a him gaining more more confidence with playing time and we've seen that the last few weeks and of course tonight you've had an opportunity with 4 catches 62 yards and already one touchdown carving Shana backup quarterback signaling the Boilermakers show pleasure on this one and this time they stopped Maurice Wells Anthony hate go to converted running back number 42 from chester pennsylvania hatred shows his speed coming from the backside he just is going to run Maurice Wells down from the backside nobody's there to pick him up he came off as a flit any time a linebacker blitz is even from the back side he's got speed the okay hatred does he's going to be able to make a big play and push Ohio State back six defensive backs Roy Williams and David Thunder checked in for the Boilermakers the poor down side and hit the flanker screen well read by Carell Vincent Lee senior from Irvine now put in starting to play with a little bit of fire and emotion this is a great reaction from benefit look how quickly he closed event and when the first thing he does the coordinators at the high level on college football want to see how quickly you can make a decision and info on the football he was able to get up there before Alex Boone the left tackle came out to make a block third and 16 for Todd Beckman pressure off the corner section sucks away from it and will not run for the first down out of bounds at the 27 yard line there was keg Lerner who made the blade of a 59 Breton Purdue the last three plays deciding to bring pressure all three times Brock's back decided to turn it on and try to create a little pit bulls alone in the other side of all they were able to do that precarious mother holder a 44 yarder curled it and it's 70 nothing you're watching ESPN on ABC 10:21 left in the first half Ohio State 17 Purdue nothing in the book is after that field goal we'll kick it off and the Boilermakers still looking for some kind of a spark with them going again Ohio State football and up with it I believe that was small over there with his friends let's get Gantt there Russell did Erin Gantt came down with the ball one of the things that Purdue always wants to see in Doria Brian get a chance to make a play what coverage by Ohio State the ball goes up into the air after they hit and it lands right into the arms and it's laning of course Shawn Lane keep it the back row highest eight ball go through the air lanes right into the arms of Danny just laying on the young 15 let's see if place all our Trumpler goes to a juggler after the turnover from the 33 right now shows a powerful nation Chris Wells was back handed the one about there was a whistle prior to the snap it's going across the Bucks perfect next time off Purdue so the Boilermakers got the timeout called so they sorted out the sidelines let's send you to New York hi Fred time protect your font on multiply to the weekend 7 inches top 25 games Rider in progress we're about to kick off we've got a bunch of them including Virginia Tech leading at Clemson dokie to take an advantage of three tiger turnovers Watchers has got its points from an interception return at a field goal to lead Cincinnati 10 7 if you have game plan Brett you'd be watching UCLA Notre Dame perhaps the Bruins and Fighting Irish are tied up at 3 at the rodeo and here bandit is 17 nothing Ohio State and a chance for the Buckeyes again inside the Purdue 35 yard line after the turnover back made incomplete whiskey the target we had riskiness the first four throw by Todd Beckman as soon as he got back you can see the crease that he wanted to wear he wanted to throw the football and I watched him after he released the ball he had to smack himself as if he's saying enough my bad so he knew right away what a great start he's off to at that time Idol rhythm a little bit miss bro Broadway huh and well specifically yards on that carry I stayed throwing a football on first and 10 region that is so important when you're playing a defense that once a proud the line of scrimmage and that makes them realize they're breaking the tendencies and it make them start to secondguess maybe they're not going to run every single time on 1st and 10 in terms of taking chances being very very aggressive with his play pong tonight forethought Beckman race ball off to the right of the formation will play and short of the first down Mike Neil defensive tackle making the stop for the Boilermakers is down and they're going to go for it Ohio State leading by 17 most Russell things they can pick up the first down and Ballard checks in along with the fullback Deante Johnson Jim Tressel system that he has the Boilermakers on the rope here decides to go for interesting call nothing doing and that was Anthony hey good the converted lying back making the biggest defensive play of the night as coach Tressel asked upstairs who missed that van he's going to come off to the right here and does a nice job of your coming down and shooting the Jap and before Steve raring the guard can come around to pick up the block Haygood was by him pit stop Ohio State on fourth down that time the Boilermakers did not yield but they're still down by 17 points battery Night Football on ABC presented by

right how about she was the back leg kick there my form there was a good guys aggressive grille handles on a 50 to go Buster's then for the Boilermakers it fell asleep that's the right foot you can get the right foot back foot oh there that was it that was a normal breakfast we just go I was writing continues well then after a few years you can't be perfect I didn't have anything okay yeah baby the first one I started right after that first time in ten pad here's Esau artists bring the 45yard line Laurinaitis but there's Dana yeah oh it's 182 Dana yeah he was a 180 282 and away I'm telling you they had some ringers on it so he set the bar Oh Dan it was uploaded champions from Mexico I mean it was unbelievable do we right into a juggernaut in two weeks no matter where we are K been tough count me in that can have big edition of the pillars like crab to the trap false start they're often number 61 at the five yard penalty remains second down exact oh he's just about to say that Purdue seeing them run the football with Corey sheets such an important thing but Zach Jones for the second time false starts pushes them back and now instead of being second for short now it's back to second along Curtis Painter needs to make a flight here inside handoff and that will make its third down and long they say go till the street likes to be very conservative with that's right well with Ohio State playing is much nickle and respecting painter and coming into this game trying to give pressure on painter at some point if Purdue's going to get back into this game believe it or not it's going to be Corey sheets in the running game to take some of the pressure off of the passing of Curtis Painter but Jim Haycock again defensive coordinators doing a great job of mixing up two looks in the coverage to confuse painter but sheath has got to be a factor to help for their out Lyman and viola to the left side of the Filmation on this third down first and ten on a brilliant second effort Justin Keller the tight end what a second effort to pick up the first down here for the Boilermakers but the second time he's seen Dustin Keller on third down get a chance to make a catch short of the first down and in show how tough he is to bring down it's the second time not only on third down he picks up the first down second time he is shaken Anderson ruffle one of the better tacklers on the Ohio State defense to pick up more yards in a percent there are three catches tonight and 39 yards swing it and no gate on that blow by Corey sheet so let's check in with Matt Winer in New York Matt hi Brent let's get a check on a top 10 matchup in Baton Rouge Florida and LSU Tigers been a tough time before football Tim Tebow moving around biases on eventually found peace tambour in the end zone total yards 116 245 on the court and nothing Gators on top UCLA is down to a third string quarterback Ben Olsen is hersowitz McLeod Ethel Thompson now for the Bruins in a 33 game and the irish matter first hoping to snap that fivegame losing streak listen which actually with seven going back to the end of last year second down and 10 incomplete and let's check in down below with Lisa Lisa well Brenda Kirk was talking about Curtis painters include decision making this year and when we were talking to him yesterday he said you know honestly my decisionmaking last year was suspect Joe tiller says sometimes he would get over to the sidelines and he'd say why did you do that in tenure was to say I don't know he said that you know I often would get the prize last year in a game I didn't know what the defenses were doing but I watched so much film and study so many schemes that my knowledge level became last year miss year like night and day nearly facing a third and ten I caught it short of the first down cheek wall over there defensively on Greg Orton two young men with the high school together markets Freeman from Kate Marion heater hikes Lane poster export and also from Lane talking to each other having a little funded then huge fourth down and Joe tiller doesn't have any choice but it he had to go for it and pick up the first down right now down by seventeen inside of five minutes in the first half five seconds out and they break if they got time we're going to hurry he's got to hurry it up and they get it time our producer second guards timeout so we'll take the freight is Curtis Painter comes over to the sideline Purdue trailing by 17 well there the end of the game we'll select the Chevrolet player of the game from each diamond Chevrolet will make the $1,000 contribution to each University of general scholarship fund and now is the port down for the Boilermakers they've used two of the three timeouts they need to get to the 39 yard line you can see yellow line paint is still back enough familiar shotgun for Draco though takes it going to throw the strain and complete Buckeye ball Wow dangerous call right there Curt that's the problem with Fred offenses when you get into a short yardage situation you can't just line up and be physical and run the football to pick up a first down a little razzledazzle out of a timeout down 17 to nothing the plates are too long to develop the Ohio State defense is there even if he catches the football there are three Buckeye defenders to bring him down that's the shame of the spread office you can't just rip it inside and pick up a first down and we saw on that replay your retirement Marcus Freeman came clean on the other side he was you know he was all over painted icon so now he's first and ten inside of five minutes guys first out pouncing again and he slips free close to the first half about nine yards out his robe is be in there and we take a look at our app like real question which former Purdue head basketball coach was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers oh man I only have one coach in mind you think I'm affected the 30 how could anyone have anybody ever vote here he coached over there yeah you're right they never have a coach before gee you've given it away psycho down and his bust their beanie wells for the first down and could see the Ferguson's back on high I don't know the answer but I'm just being on this campus it makes me think of new basketball I don't one of my friends up there how many great games did you call with gene Keady and Bob Knight over the year it was unbelievable I mean one:1 great personality you know the old coach Knight now he'd get up on you know he intimidates people but he never exhibited this KT that's what made it so much fun so looking in the back down first down again and so just like perks are Justin Sweeney wellseasoned stop that time for the run applying the greatest coach of the history of Purdue basketball yes he came out of Kansas State he was a running back and Jean Katie was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers back in 1958 Shannon go back to the 30 I appreciate getting closer to my era where's it along here I think he's gonna leave South tonight they may not be could be a Purdue fans out there once they pick it up there a little bit it'll be third down down and you had a look it makes for the officials then that's course Weber there yeah I dunno line everything in his life is will change recruiters and righthand man yeah just a wonderful wonderful person between dr. Ross Abe project hoping the defense can pop him here on third down exactly the kind of lifting still stands Paul no first time terrific though vive Benson Benson good defensive back he brings down small I'll tell you number five cheap liquor well Vincent made a great play because the fighting Nikola started to go up the middle of the field and he started the fire when he came off with him and came back underneath the play we saw earlier that Ohio State picked up big yards with small but this time Vincennes there to stop him short of the first down good adjustment by put in have some loss on to the field Dorian black deep end nailed the food into the end zone it'll come out on the counter yard line so the bull American 49 work with him in the first half Purdue has been held at 98 yards well here's a program reminder you cannot be filthy rich without getting a little dirty donald sutherland william baldwin peter cross star Dirty Sexy Money all new episode Wednesday at 10/9 central on ABC start here your point if you TiVo that you told me some that have an unusual another shot forgot which one that was I'm from there's a lot of wives I don't know we could read there that one that was very nice that's a good title Dirty Sexy music so you can me help you 249 I do that inside the 10 yard line after the pump fake Larry grant number six in on the Purdue for today well what about gutcheck Saturday here ponder what jumps off that page I think it jumps out to me for Big Ten fans of course with continent Illinois Illinois and Ron Zook congratulations second big win at home last week Penn State today number five Wisconsin and how about Georgia at Tennessee Georgia was starting to gain some momentum in Tennessee decided to show up and they dominated the dogs at Neyland Stadium two minutes later breaks it in some blatant miscommunication there you know you mentioned the Illini and Kirk they are three and O for a Big Ten start that's the first time since 1990 we going back to 1990 and that's even I might have been Dana Howard or that Bank group of players that they had back in that era it's a great to see ronzo Kevin rice what do you been back yeah I think he was right around that era might have been a little bit before his time at the 350 Ron joke after everything he went Gainesville's program up and running a lot of people expected Illinois to be good but maybe a year away from really competing in the Big Ten but they're making it exciting feeling those deep and incomplete and so crowns run out again and go ahead and say Curtis Painter right now come into this football game coming into this football game he has just been in sync and playing with confidence Lisa touched on his decisionmaking we've looked at and talked about him all all week that where this guy's at different quarterback and 19 interceptions a year ago but tonight he is going on page he is rattled here in this first half because of the confusion at Ohio State's preventing and also because the fee to which they're playing with makes of Purdue bounces time for Armstrong a little roll down near the 35 yard line 1:40 let's go down below to Lisa well Brent won the Purdue offense was on the field offensive coordinator bra fake was telling his defense hey you guys are out playing them right now and if the momentum in this game is going to switch it's going to be because of us we just held them for the last three possessions hopefully we'll get some points on the board but we've got to keep hanging in there right alright there is good point he has 11th year defensive coordinator for Joe tiller and he played here at Purdue and retention said earlier ranks fifth alltime in tackles he was a pretty good defensive player in Moe Wells he's back on the field all right easy today are blind and you can give the umpiring it's about four yards a carry still kind of hurry up offense Ohio State decides to apply here three timeouts but a minute and a half remaining look at their own 40yard line on switch their content or if they want to continue to press the issue you got to believe they're going to try to come away from voice here man asking somebody back home for looking better on television is building person 17 I think there's the rush job took away a few from the roof it's still not good in row Biscay spin for the first down midfield didn't get out of bounds you're going to have to hurry up with a clock stopping get to play called I state with a quick huddle lemon morning but you know Wow unbelievable three straight just a pounding this as a nationally guy though the Diamondbacks have had a great year I like to get better teams advance for the nationally invention of rockets in Vegas Deathwing was in the grasp and there's a penalty so that's going to be grounded and that was Anthony hey good again and you know stocks defense has picked it up here he fentanyl grounding number seventeen often losses on the table five second down I think Brent one of the things he has done in these last three or four possessions is turn up the heat he's bringing the linebackers bringing pressure realizing that if they sit back they're not going to be very effective against what Jim Tressel doing tonight throwing the football hey good athletic ability and speed a big factor tonight to this boiler defense in the adjustments that they've made here in his first half I suppose with 46 seconds here an old Russell a little bit he might be very content he's get Eames in a locker room for the original 17 you would think what he has to only be fair about this I say they not throwing about go to the snap now I mean Beckman yeah busted now yeah they always run a dress coach now and there's the come dressed up like woody but look at this now they got a new look going to do but that's the best one that they run down got the head set out is the aisle alright I went back this one as young man he's definitely yep the teens will cross when they go to their locker rooms but what they do is they make sure that they don't meet up at about the at the 40yard line they they send the visiting team across first and coming up at the Bud Light half convert for John Saunders Craig James and don't Flutie we'll have highlights from all the gutcheck Saturday's big games including Florida LSU and a loss by another hot five d so stay tuned for the Bubba halftime report with John prayer get done after this yes this is off this lovely note that consistently victory if you the best idea and God well Purdue was dominated completely in the opening quarter and then Kirk Herbstreit in the second quarter at least the Boilermaker defense and made a bit of his stance now it's up to the rope it sure is last three times Ohio State has had the ball they've been able to come up with stops highest a gets the ball to start the second half again it's going to be up to the Peru defense to make a stop and how I feel Iowa State defense coming in we knew the joke think the showdown would be James Laurinaitis the Ohio State defense on the best of the country against the highpowered Boilermaker office first half goes to Ohio State they pressured from every different angle show tremendous speed and athletic ability Curtis Painter was rattled clearly in that first M as we took a look at our Southwest Airlines playbook here on Saturday Night Football on ABC remember the Boilermakers win the flip and took the ball so they will kick off their December 2nd half the guys will have the first possession great small is back beef and this room will be down to the 20yard line and now our Pacific Life game summary if we take a look at some of the numbers that you talked about Kirk and it is simply highlighted in the fact that the Boilermakers were unable to move the ball against that Buckeye defense yeah the total yards Twitter 9fo hi Oh state 94 to just talk about how high estate Deacon spent all of them incidentally Ohio State play calling 20 runs 19 passes amended balanced by Jim Tressel on the Buckeyes in the first half huge steering's here to start the half the Alford who handles it Chris Wells will get the first Paul here and he battles his way for about five yards on that first down Gary if you're chiller when you get into the halftime nothing seemed to go right you sell your players on when they get the ball to start the second half our defense to start the play better we're going to get the ball back guys we're all way down to 17 with Cantus painter we can strike our defense will get the ball back that's why players need to believe that they need to step up here on the side second the Buckeyes offensive line has done farewell the people pity party boys no girls again for a first outbreak spree and he is out to the 39 yard line behind Julian wearing cord old person and Barton Ohio State this is something that's key not only tonight but for the season Jonathan wells many wells showing great patience there bouncing the ball on the outside so I'm Chris Lowe bouncing the ball to the outside and employee aligned to play to develop and then shooting it inside it's been a problem for him this year he's been a little bit impatient that time he relaxed let the paint the play develop and it shot it inside therefore big game for wide on this first and 10 great protection going deep through 15 King was the defensive back right there and it's incomplete ruled incomplete over there for just a brief instant it looked like what whiskey might have made the ditch but Brandon King was right here well the theme continued in a second half ohio state taking some shots downfield this time Todd Beckman waited way too long in Telegraph the past or a biscuit gave the safety is closely yeah he does right now this might have been a pick they're going to stop it and take a look at this now Brandon King on that replay looked like he might come of being reviewed we will take another look along with you remember it's not a challenge automatically these plays are running back and forth up in the booth this is the covers in your scene Randy Griffin it falls away from risky and he had both feet in bounds the only thing they could question is did he rip it away and have possession clearly why his feet were down there fighting for the ball he's got the ball to put it down that looks like an interception Beckman did Telegraph it giving King plenty of time to come over to fight for the football it's just going to come down to whether or not they decide he had possession away from revista while his feet were still in bounds I'm in pain it and jicama play on that ball regardless of what happens here is a junior out of Warner Robins Georgia Jim Tressel ready to call second down I'm pretty confident that it's going to be incomplete it was officials have to decide is when both players have their hands on the ball when do you decide when King takes possession away after reviews ruling on the tailed is reversed branding ting make system sensational day for the Boilermakers his first interception of the season as Jim Aguirre upstairs overturns the ruling on the field what a great flood hits the white car right away you could see the King got he had a chance to get his hands on the ball rips it away from her Biscay while his wife foot still with down in bounds for a boilermaker interception just talked about what Joe tiller probably told his team we're going to get the ball back to credit painter in a minute 15 pickups and felt later they got the ball so that's the big news from Peru the bad news is that Joel Osteen's got a move he for 73 yards against the defense now Wyatt has now a catch tonight and incomplete will make it second and 10 first half nothing need to go right first drive they did a nice job they had a false start to slow them down after that you can see not only the 3m lack of continuity the lack of rhythm from the Spain with his receivers perfect God and number nine he came in with 40 catches more touchdowns and 11 for to average the bagel so far tonight please push them to the 45 yard line and Dustin color that Cayenne has been a leading receiver whoops in the middle 427 young right Bryant seems to take a lot of attention which allows Keller to come over and get just before the safety both safeties actually see Malcolm Jenkins shift to the middle of the screen he walks it right to the middle of the field killer dog but a great throw that time by Penn Stater not enough time the linebacker Lera is to get back in coverage Brian is swatted to the right of this formation and they run Cory shoots here from Connecticut Laurinaitis makes it done we check in down below Alicia well Brent I spoke with Joe tiller going into halftime and I said coach you told us at Ohio State's defense was really good but what specifically a fault any problem and he just looked at me in 50 they are just simply faster than we are because we just gotta settle down and play with more consistency as for Curtis Painter he said he was way too excited in that first half he's got to be more precise we can overthrow it like he didn't say they fried his first catch of the night for negative yardage third down and long Jenkins is right there Malcolm Jenkins the junior from New Jersey you touched on Dorian Bryant how they have to get the ball into his hands the problem is Ohio State knows that the Curtis Manor Purdue they can't force the issue and try to continue to find ways to give the ball because Ohio State led by Malcolm Jenkins they're locked Claunch at number nine Dorian Bryan Callen Curtis Painter you're going to go out have to go in another direction the movement falling out of you third down and 10 for the Boilermakers they're coming here is going to be sat at the 44 yard line Anderson Russell the safety blitz and the sophomore from Atlanta sacks the Boilermakers quarterback what a nice job of disguising coverage this entire game from Ohio State and him bringing pressure when it's allowed this time from the offices left Anderson Russell Clara nidus Russell speed gets around the tight end Keller it's Ohio State defense one of the fastest Ohio State's defenses that we've seen is going back a few years with a say halston companies these guys are bringing it tonight aren't draw hands in high heart line picks it up on the 18 yard down at the 19 terrific coverage right there by the hunt team they are known as the seals here in Purdue they did their job Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines with Southwest Airlines convenient nonstop life it's like having your own company playing business Southwest comm powered by party AG the official performance machines of the NCAA and Pacific Life for insurance annuities and investments to specific life the power to help you succeed and the Buckeyes continue to play with that attitude and I'm going to ask for your question because all of them because remember that fateful night of the desert like January for this Ohio State being ran into the Florida Gator I'm going to talk about that write this down here change of heart Tuchman there now pretty sure lux well breaks free step down 11 yards and a 1st and 10 so Kirk take me back because I know you've been around Trussell since that fateful night I think this is one of the more embarrassing nights for Ohio State for the players that were involved a lot of these players are back this year they're not going to be living it over and over but they don't want to ever forget the feeling that they had when they got embarrassed in the national championship 41 to 14 next we have a picture up on their bulletin board it stays up all year it says a real buttkicking which is towards miss getting destroyed there's some reminders and I think the defense plays with a chip on their shoulder because it away they play that night his Wells again and partner they jump up to number four and very important I talked to someone who follows the BCS very very closely Jerry Tom was here tonight I said Jerry who would be 1 &amp; 2 right now in what order he said coming into tonight LSU would be one a USC would be number two but he said the Buckeyes would be stalking that spot between what happens you know the next we record their game they are very much in the thick of things again LSU is having trouble with the Gators absolutely Ohio State needs to control their own destiny is an LSU look because it's called us they play one another back way battling toward that yellow line versus is chris wells in a bush I think Jerry told me that is October 13th or 14th that the first BCS rankings officially huh and I've got to say what's going on with the top ten maybe it's time for everybody the way from the ranking till we get more evidence about the absolutely we wanted to see how good Ohio State really was it's still playing football to be played tonight but I think they're making a very strong statement in a nation about how good they are right now they're playing and looking a lot like their national championship caliber teams over the last three or four years there's taught over the top and Kirk I know you know he was Coakley as father right Tim in the high school that was down in st. Henry Ohio this is Todd Beckman now and his brother Toby is Napoli in the plate down Cincinnati is that where he went to play I think so I think so but one thing about Saint Henry Ohio Jim Lachey was a great player right that was the radio booth yeah great athlete at his time Bobby boy and Tommy Boy Jeff Hardy's with the Penn State played in the NFL small town of police 400 after perfection I would grab at the 38 yard line by Road Biscay Harry's son doing it again oh that's a big great throw right between two linebackers Andrew Piske is about a tweeter his receiver you're going to see put on a uniform for anybody agent level stab did a great job in coaching him over the years his dad now the wide receiver Bogart rod the Miami Dolphins I'm sure he's proud watching tonight the kind of year the Brian Ruby is off to he continues tonight great route runner and a great great athlete 21 more yards he has 54 tonight that been going and that david Hinderer their second interception and put this one Thursday in six for the Boilermakers Ohio State continues to challenge Purdue down field Hickman had a lot of success with that in the first half came up with some stores in big plays tonight in the second half we've seen produce secondary make big play first Brandon King this time Pinder goes up over that much taller Brian Hartline and makes a heck of an interception we're going to go up in the air to make that play just ripped it away here again you shall break free tremendous athletic ability in full speed there to go up and take it away from hard line the pocket of the ball the only one yard line now oh yeah we got 99 to go against the defects there is some police Newton and painter on first down goes far sightings of leaders we suck it down and canden you saw Donald Washington over there and it was interesting with Joe tiller said to Lisa but the basic problem that happened is with the Buckeyes me yeah the speed of the Ohio State defense thought that was going to have to regroup a bit two interceptions I have double possession for highest eight he gets to did the same thing twice but a little bit too much air under the ball and allow the defender to come up and make the play under through both of them because of the amount of care and attract joining people both interception Murray sheets was over 25 women's rhymes the right guard 66 is getting down Justin put off quickly or down play coming up great Orton the regime who reads the junior from Dave them lock in a hard spot being pinned back in their own territory but they have to continue to be aggressive at this point the game don't help themselves by being conservative and being careful and cautious to have to continue to be willing to take a few chances which is very risky against these opportunistic Lauren is talking down in public grows it incomplete Wyman the intended receiver on that play and there was heat all over that front for Curtis Painter he happened to look to his right based on the coverage Brett if he would have stuck with his hide in who's been pretty effective tonight on third down he had it breaking free right in between the middle of the linebackers wide open for about a 10 yard gain they looked to the right never even looked Keller's way on Stan san diegoans oh good amount of trouble small and part liner back deep from heart line cut for 35 David for the 29 yard line and well Beckman can make amends for those two interceptions right now so we'll see what the six five junior quarterback from Saint Henry Ohio could do this time IBM presents the 25 greatest players out number Sharleen terrific in a college career that straddled service in world war ii truthy was the MVP of the 1943 rose gold won the Maxwell Award and laid Georgia to a perfect

here on ABC great players already just imagined and coming up next on that list and now the Buckeyes they've been slowed by this Purdue defense it's been way through the second quarter in 1700 here this is an example of how you benefit from having a great defense you throw an interception three and out a punt return and you net about 25 was a frightful small on first down and he steps out of bounds at about the 25 yard line I think that's the difference from what we have seen now five or six games in with Ohio State is that last year they made it to the national championship game with a young defense breaking in eight or nine new starters this year it's a new offense and they have a veteran defense right now from what we've seen this fifth team has the makings of looking and good if not even better than the team last year that went to the championship game and at least Wells air flies and short of the first down Anthony pay code number 42 easy ah man waiting the coaches is about fourth or fifth time Charlie back except I'd like to take a crack at linebackers they said if you want to do it they'll let you try they never expecting the progress like he has in Chester Pennsylvania and he's a young man who had a scholarship to Penn State which was taken away the last one when they recruited a running back over there and so hey good is really looking forward to the Penn State fatiguing now third down and three the but ok and they get doing a good was coming along with Eugene right so 42 and 45 applying to pressure that time and now it is bill both I remember Hurley early on the first out I say later first after Russell casse table filled up this time getting right in the game he knows that he's going to have to bring the pressure for Brock's back and making great plays right now the adjustments that they've made it simply let's bring pressure against this Ohio State offensive line and again Todd Beckman they've had a lot of success with it especially with a 339 yarder for Pretorius and it's good so it's a 20 nothing game what a baker's old are still in it if they can do anything I guess Jim Krause defense this can be broadcast on ABC 80% of IDL PE HD TV and we've had our great HD aerial shots tonight courtesy of our friends at Outback Steakhouse the Outback Steakhouse airship bloomin onion one they provide aerial coverage great sporting events across this land we get ready now for the house they kick off following their field goal my guys are 20 the third 7:43 and receiver Brian Phaneuf in the 9yard on which a Packard battles equate to the 25 so Curtis Peter brings the offense back out here needing to retouch counsel they ever make those to warm here so far tonight they have 112 total yards the Boilermakers because of the sacks they have only 1 yard rushing 111 throwing the book as I shown you where there are easily gonna be a defect in the big game Vader keeps it on the teachers and now for today's trendline presented by Sports Authority we look back at the great Lenny Dawson was here before 256 Bob Griese another notable Purdue quarterback when either Mike Phipps with a long time in the NFL also mark Herman he was here that's legendary quarterbacks and there's good reason to come out to Pasadena in the last time they appeared in Roseville three my first down at the 39 yard line you know that's powerful runner is number 20th Dustin Keller of the senior well if I'm Curtis Painter I'm looking to number 28 almost every time that I brought back the throw because he has a matchup opportunity against markets Freeman and the other athletic Ohio State linebackers where he can outrun them once he catches the football for big yards that's huge from the head bobble diving on of his painter yo Keller came in as a wide receiver to Purdue he's been about six for 205 pounds he's from Lafayette they decided little red shirt and put on about 25 or 30 pounds moved into an hback tied in I think he's one of the one of the better receiving tight ends you're going to see this this nation one of the first times bring up a third down after like grab by Greg Orton we check in with Matt Winer in New York all right Brent let's get you this nominee for the Pontiac gamechanging performance Virginia Tech and Hudson CACC game 1000 Hokies when any loyal collectors punt takes it 82 yards the other way this straight win Virginia Tech Oberlin here's another was it incomplete some pyro right there say those things oblique and that was Marcus Freeman number one been very very active Freeman had a chance to make an interception here just about because of the pressure that Ohio State applies Cameron Heyward the true freshman from one end and burn Gulf been on the other Freeman has the ball in his hands as he takes a temperature definitely came out and hit the surface the O'Hare was right there coach should stay Cameron Heyward the true freshman the son of our head forward is going to be a star Armstrong again no signal at the 10yard line so small catch the ball right there without seeing like fair attention that's where they'll put it in play after that hit by Aaron Lane who's been a star and Tuesday's folks a comedy hit for guys who do it in the diamond lane United they drive divided they stole make a mandate and share a ride with carpool lose Tuesday at 8:30 7:30 several ABC over here carpool now that's the familiar with that one hit tell me and after they after the show on that one that's a new one for me to flip it on first down 10 out and Beckman and the Bucs are bottled up here but he can't fire the first down incomplete the Biscay for eating the intended target it's going to be second down at Nimoy puzzled them going is really throwing a ball on first down here tonight he has been opening it up showing an aggressive side to him play call most fans expected Ohio State to be conservative with the play calling on the road but you can see the 20 thick passes but a few of those that come on first again I think it's always a great thing to open up the running wings to get back to your bread and butter of being well we'll change up on a timeout and Brendan King assured Richard coming over to the side Backman spotted him but time you got back time running down a little bit so who use it timeout it over and talk about it we'll take a break right down we are back flick it down back on the yard line after thank you guys and certainly the Boilermakers could usually help from above right now in the box his wife as beautiful but could not break the second Justin Scott long safety create the play that looks like Mimi has shaken up again here we headed to the reverse trip told you first I've been bothered by that ankle almost all season we can the tickler baby bellowed twisted here Kirk you got to wonder if this ankle it was just going to become an issue for him to deal with throughout the entire year unless he's able to take a week off I don't know when oh hey rolls up I'd say yeah I don't know when he's going to get a chance to try to get it rested and filled in what Ohio State's coaching staff wants to see is him be able to block that paint out the best that he can and be able to try to fight through that they have obviously they had no wealth behind the focus also snoring that brand insane it was mr. football Ohio he's been for two games effort undergoing arthroscopic surgery he is here time number three is with the Buckeyes and available if they need to spell Maurice Wells here there is a grateful encounter play close to a first down depending on where the spot is on that counter he got it Kamin signals it right away what a big play and one thing about maurice wells is he's a great change of pace completely different style of back from what you see from Beatty wells who had the power when Maurice well comes in he got a lot more quickness and that time that quickness was able to get up to the field and didn't pick up a Bible first down deep in their own territory I cannot say enough about this offensive line here tonight although the Purdue defenses is over that challenge but Kirk helped me out have they been called for one false started here tonight I I cannot remember Boone raring chordal person and Barden no false starts by that offensive line folks what's your favorite NFL team whenever the noisy stadium they go into Indianapolis and leather coats or something see if they can make it through a game without one pole star Jim Tressel : since we've mentally maybe the best offensive line can he pass that has been the head coach at Ohio State well where can we buy the boilermakers daiquiri goes up over the top incomplete I want to tell you something folks there's been some crazy things happen this year but wait until you hear this one this is unbelievable as we send you to Matt Winer story of the year could be bread USD 35 game home win streak and a lot more in peril right now Stanford down six to beat a Prichard first start it's mark Bradford in the end zone they reviewed it it stuck as did the point after and the Cardinal lead USC 24 23 less than a minute to go and the Trojans are very much on the ropes next a 49 seconds to go there and the outcome of this humble hope are waiting to signal great uncle's outdated bleep ass one of the official going to blow off payment hit that pin there Brent Todd Beckman got back control of football starting to give it a pump fake but the ball slipped out of his pants and his arm was coming forward and he stopped moving his arm the ball slipped out of his hands and Purdue jumped on top of him that was jared swilley we think her who would pounced on okay he's a junior from Evansville Indiana number 54 down there and a golden opportunity I am still in shock folks Albert Sanders was a 40 point underdog against USC now let me see LSU's been in trouble LSU is one end to possibly California moves to ones and I sit on a couch and pull them for Stanford I mean this is unbelievable as we're wait Devon let's take a look at this now is the arm going forward here I've asked officials about this all the time when a quarterbacks arm is coming forward and the ball lips from his hand is that a fumble or is that an incompletion and the ruling that I've gotten every time is if his arm is coming forward at all whether it slips out of his hand or not it's an incompletion this time it looks like veterans arm comes forward he tries to stop moving his arm and the ball came forward to the pumper I saw the the replay group and she refused over there at the intermission out here huh and they said yeah nice boy first after what that stays that way but if they've got that intersection on the sideline and now they've got this ruling on the field was reversed it is the officials that I've met with all the time because this is the one that I always want to make sure when their arm is coming forward even if the ball is out of their hands it is fault incompletion and they reverse it the world has not been the same since the dreaded duck roll out of my story and I'm sticking to it fourth down and 11 well there's a tough break for fuller had a chance to have the ball inside the Ohio State pointed notice it'll drive to deal with this part girl Burke this is a before the snap timeout oh there's only ten know how they use the timeout so they get the 11th man out on the field a bit of a mental blunder here by Russell screw and you can see they're down to the last timeout and let's go to Lisa ID line getting that ankle repaid for the second time in this game the head trainer Doug Callen without him are you okay to go and beanie kept saying I'm okay I'm okay you can tell that it is a little core and that it is giving him some problems but many Wells has been told for the last couple of weeks like Kurt mentioned that Jim Tressel has asked him to be a warrior he keeps saying coach wants me to be a warrior and I'm going to try to play through it okay all right Lisa and now Levin been on the field now and pusher they come astral Bryant written back by what a beautiful put that is out of bounds at the 20yard line and AJ proposed oh we get word from out west there's about twenty seconds left and the Stanford Cardinal on the verge of I you know Appalachian State is Appalachian yeah that stands alone but yeah but this one's his big folks you're playing number one down there and you're a forty point underdog amazing I I don't know what to say I mean I what I understand USC has been fourth down at their own 35yard line and time is running out it doesn't look good for the Trojan it's one of the biggest I love your blackberry Oh let's go to Matt Winer the foot muffin man Brent it is all over in LA Trojans with the ball last gasp John David booty is picked off this USD turnover of the game Stanford pulls the monumental upsets Pete Carroll incredulous number two has gone down number five has already lost today and look at number one LSU trailing Florida 17 7 that game midway through the third quarter Matt strummers through the world of college football Peter going he did Danny over to briny had him up with that night he had it right there occur well he had it in the middle of the Ohio State defense want to get too technical here because you always hear the term can't put two but pamphlet twos deepest green you have two safeties that say on half of the field and thing deep as they can vertically and the middle linebacker James Laurinaitis has to get back and play the middle of the field to try to prevent plays like that across the middle that time Brian had a chance but the ball was thrown behind it I do you Buckeye fans who's the bad name tonight Jim Harbaugh that's a good note to the Stanford Cardinal gets it done right nothing or the dish fado good point he's the favorite Wolverine of all time of all time anything that he's ever done including the prediction in 1986 to Michigan would beat Ohio State is all mouth from after Stanford knock it off you know see III think it's bigger than Appalachian State beating Michigan because of how significant it is because for the landscape of our triple UNC losses right now LSU is on the ropes 17 to 7 in half to Florida they'll they'll shoot up it is no background third period they started the second half he'll move up negative search team we get word on that game that was a long way from being exactly here's small now coming back over the left no flag now let's let's take a look here 5 but turnovers so John David booty no Heisman Trophy okay there's the game when he touchdown pass how many of you tell me something about to beat up Richard all I could tell you his first career start right in the back of the starting quarterback without Ostrander they put in Prichard throw the gamewinning touchdown pass in Los Angeles Coliseum to knock off the USC Trojans and John David beauty's woes continue we thought it'd be a matter of time and filthy these young receivers got into think wells and now the Buckeyes are in a beauty contest California is idle I believe this way right I'm right about that ah yes there are okay so they're sitting back there on the couch here are the Buckeyes and Jim Tressel weaving a shutout on the load there as I recall there about a seven point favorite coming into this game regardless their defense has been out here we've got the point who's going to be one two things very next week that rules like I said that football game still has a lot of time left and unless you ask them snap false start offense number 63 ls5 got forever under it ain't their ability to kayak in a football game there's the first one fin person yep yep but you're right about Ohio State making a statement and see how they finish here their defense is playing light out they play lights out all year but tonight against Curtis Painter and a boilermaker offense it's been just going right through defense they have stepped up and I think taken advantage of this big window to show that their top two or three to first down and 15 complain and a ride in a footrace 15yard line Anthony hey good able to get brian on that play that's 41 yards row Biscay gets most of the attention but hard line gives them another receiver that has speed and acceleration through the secondary they've been going vertically downfield this time they decide to go underneath the coverage because 40 Williams and the boilers were sitting back they hit a quick plant and boy Mark line showed a pretty good birth there almost took it to the end zone as well there is not but battling from a couple yards there Dan Vickers in Manorville of course last week Arizona State 41 Stanford 300 everybody could be a family it's been a tough start for Jim Harbaugh and he's been talking trash about you when he first got here first got the job he started he was poking he was poking the bear yeah hey everybody said don't do that during yeah you know maybe I'd want to stay for guide said keep your mouth shut don't get up it guess what it worked one for the ages tonight as well as for the Buckeyes he's battling away hosting the year 5yard line down there and I wonder if the players over there I don't worry should we yell it across the way they look they're doing just fine on their own as I said hey from the opening kickoff they took the crowd out of again they made a statement with their defense and their offense because the way Jim truss was attacked I think they played very well consider hits there's one first big test on the road and doing all they can to show the voters comparing a powerhouse this year as well and he shortened his plan to bring up a up fourth down decision here and the second pick away on the third quarter Jim Tressel the dafuq eyes in the mix where I shot at another national championship ESPN Sunday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines will return after this message from our ABC stations Matt Winer in New York USD may not be the only big home favorite to go down in LA tonight UCLA trails to Notre Dame who had turned it over three times Jimmy Clausen with the sneak they're just the Irish is 7th offensive touchdown in six games but good enough for a 7 point lead nearing the end of the third quarter at the Rose Bowl expect anything match that's this year 20 nothing right now the Buckeyes shutting out to do and the book ranked team figures to move up at least one spot that is my team for the year 3 there's I fit for this morning on game day except the unexpected is the whole reason Florida to win down in Baton Rouge but if they did for another cuts down by the way the Gators before another that blackberries beautiful in Frenchburg this text uh it you know a our legend King Katy was in the booth just a few moments ago so let's hear what he had to say here to the symbol folks okay everyone let's help the team get some points on your feet it's time to shout magic down 23 the buckeyes kicking it off and it will come out on me 2009 and so here's the shocker folks and let me give you what they say old front bore he would say now you're about to learn the rest of the story the young man who can fund the when he comes down as weapon okay his father died just hours last Friday and they didn't know whether he would even be able to play and he made the game and won the winning touchdown pass I get us say that I mark Bradford playing with the make that text that he saw Matt Winer showed it to you in the corner of Van zone okay it just doesn't get any better than the program completer again another stroke play by Donald washing business sophomore from Indianapolis Donald Washington so excited to have an opportunity to come back to the state of Indiana ball jump campus junior and senior year at Franklin Central High School in Indianapolis and she showed tremendous ability there Malcolm Jenkins gets most of the credit for the ohio state secondary Lohmann Anderson Russell what a nice play and he kept his left hand all too important while he went up into the air and batted that ball away it wasn't greedy he didn't go for the interception just knocked it down great play by Washington tuck him down and then he drops it off to his running back in the in short now I take you back to the AP top ten the Allstate standings review and you see LSU is losing by ten right now the Trojans had lost others California sit at home here are the Buckeyes folks in Florida can hang on it figures that California and Ohio State would be one two I'm some desmos say that again they say California and Ohio State one two yeah what you did you just had you now people in Columbus in the state of Ohio are calling your travel agent to New Orleans they're going to get weight they're going to get a pop they're going to get real excited now in gun playful Wow Anderson Russell making that Scott crowd wanted a penalty flag on up at this secondary let me talk about Malcolm Jenkins Anderson Russell Kirk Coleman Donald Washington Jim day cheek WA and folks a fourstar recruit as given played tonight release I haven't seen her that's Eugene Clifford he nicked a little bit he's not been out there the thing that I'm seeing beyond the experience and ability of the intangible is a tightknit group on the defensive side of the football I think it goes back to the embarrassment in the desert against Florida they've lived with that for a long time and that helped fuel the fire here's Hart line again up to the ride into a little bit of positivity then down at the 49 yard line work Wow two weeks I could never remember two weeks quite like this Emily are you close enough I'm Matt Winer in New York let's get you caught up on what's happening in Death Valley right out of the half LSU goes on a marathon touchdown drive Florida comes right back Tim Tebow to a lonesome Cornelius Engram for the touchdown if Tebow second touchdown pass of the night previously L if you had allowed one touchdown pass all season long Gators on top by 10 late the third lonesome indeed Matt nobody within 10 yards every bug that touchdown pass said to hear the Buckeyes dominating Purdue in a battle of the big 10 unbeaten when Illinois has picked off the number five ranked team Wisconsin did particular at our Pacific Life game summary well Todd Beckman got off to a quick start really again you have to give Jim trust all the credit world for giving confidence and faith in Todd Becker to be able to throw the football downfield raid small to make touchdown heart pine had a crossing route into the endzone right away they took a crowd out of the game up 14 then they handled came over the defense the Buckeye defense has been swarming wide to the football and of course had come up with three field goals to go along with that effort from the offensive defense back when goes long robe is discovered coming up over the top is torie Williams the senior from Texas that's the third interception today it could as Ohio State is most innovative winning this game Jim Tressel will have plenty to work with with his offense and in particular his quarterback Beckman third time this been on the deep ball Todd Beckman can Telegraph to throw and allow the safety enough time to come over and make the interception Torrey Williams took advantage of a high ball and he when the quarterbacks eyes down his intended target for two or three seconds then puts it up in the air a good state you'll come over and make that play every time nice play by Tori Williams those are the three Buckeye turnovers tonight there's been one turnover by Purdue but still the Buckeye is dominating 23 nothing because it's defense how about every time they turn it over it's inside put in point five gamma which is going to get a put very them inside the time again he's been their best target tonight picking up the first down for the Boilermakers they've got 13 minutes to work with trailing by 23 they really got to get this ball down field and there's just no indication they could beat this defensive backfield of the bug eyes the academic driving link to the field are not very good but Todd Beckman putting the ball in the air taking chances downfield all three interceptions or on the deep ball and again either under strong or putting putting too much touch on the ball let the safety come over to make the play incomplete and again with that linebacker Marcus Freeman with coverage that guy there's no daylight there when you're working at a Buckeye defense you're right about 700 to go back to Todd Beckman and hit the fence even though he's making mistakes first time he's been on the road and this kind of climate deal with the mercy of the crowd but part of his process is growing up and becoming a finished product down the road when they get him to see tougher environments at Happy Valley and of course I can harbor late the years trouble incomplete crowd again mommy the penalty then one of those nights for painters 19 of 41 for 153 yards came in averaging 308 darts per game including 57% of his passes has been in with his receivers the timing in the rhythm has been outstanding we've been wobbling about his decisionmaking coming into this game tonight it's not all in him but he's not been in rhythm at all but rush great exception for a first and ten snaps it off to someone Lyman the junior from Fort Wayne the reason he's not had a chance to again get into think is because Ohio State the job that they have gone into creating confusion this time he has enough time to come back to the back side and one of the few times that we've seen all night he finds Lyman for another first down this time complete the Lyman again climb as a young man they were very concerned about last spring he was stabbed in the chest in a offcampus dispute and felt that he was more an innocent bystander wrong place wrong time and it was a lung that was damaged but he's been able to come back remarkably so in both of the previous ball bounced incomplete this will be third down and our monster upsets it doesn't none bigger than what we have seen tonight with Stanford but I agree with you those are the three biggest certainly appeal of the year my happy state was one of those sports when you heard it you hit the floor and in Colorado knocking off Oklahoma when they were really struggling with with Coach Hawkins and then Stanford tonight I would probably if I were to put him in order as I said I would put Stanford at the top just because of the importance and what it means to eventually the BCS standings it will be coming out another week on third down complete for a first down at the 43 yard line great Orton a junior from Dayton he's got a people Curtis gorillas cannot be happy with the performance of the the offense here tonight is defense battle back by the time they did they were quickly down two touchdowns in the opening quarter they throw 14 melting first quarter and they have not been able to to recover blitz coming and down he is sacked by Anderson Russell that's a second time that Anderson's got there tonight we check in again with Matt all right friend all the excitement I almost forgot to give you our nominee for the ATP he has been allamerica Player of the Week Illinois's Rashard Mendenhall made a captain this week by his teammate beam came through with three touchdowns in the win over number five Wisconsin Tech's boat date seven six five four and your AT&amp;T Wireless phone to cast your vote if a shark Mendenhall is a man he perhaps almost unheard of running backs that country was tough today for hooking the Illini almost intercepted should have been picked off by Anderson Russell that time this just in my friend Cincinnati 21 Rutgers 20 in the third quarter Cincinnati bearcat that oh hey Ohio State might be the secondbest I don't know but there is a defense tonight is not only played well but think about what Purdue is done and keep talking about this averaging 45 I know they haven't played great opponents but forty five points against air we know pretty good another day they get if I go to them yeah they let 23 he'll get down tonight the the Fighting Irish battling for the Rives on west coast against UCLA he's been underneath too bleak to the 45 yard line dan jerking the freshman his is that he Scott Durkin played here at Purdue and then spent eight years in the National Football League and of course Jason Taylor would have been wanted their backs but he broken arm come games ago he hasn't been seen sent they're hopeful there get him back and forth down and the hunter trots out of the field and that that brings the boos running back as crowd wants to go for right here what do you think art I think really doesn't matter I think the punt is probably the best fault hangs it up now and small you didn't like that fair catch proceeded to find a he got great feed and he is down at the 25yard line that was Anthony hey good over there on the but they don't think because Cooper you want to gamble you want to gamble with my chips big but look good would let if there were a place and where people still believe they can change we are back here in West Lafayette and the Ohio State Buckeyes looking to move up and who knows how high already number to UFC has fallen deny number one LSU is in trouble against Florida you got to go back to the mid 90s the last time 1 &amp; 2 were kicked off I will be Nebraska and Tennessee they lost Arizona State and Florida respectively I was Allstate being the brush in for the beating Tennessee and of course still to be determined and the Irish are up by 22 6 we are tol over UCLA what a year yeah if the score holds up in Baton Rouge in the Gators end up knocking off the LSU Tigers an account will move up the number one the problem with Cal moving up to number one for a lot of people around the country they don't watch packed in football lesson involves us see what do you mean we had Kelly when I heard a 9 foot ball week one everybody's young people saw play last week against thorn I was a huge win for them to go to Eugene and win that game so for now they'll be plotted I was thinking number one again if Florida ends up beating LSU at Ohio State all moved to number two in the country let's check in down below and Lisa Lisa this is a some week in college football Oh Brent I asked James Laurinaitis earlier this week about the buzz in the locker room in a practice this week about being ranked number four and he said I haven't had a single conversation with anyone about and he said in all the years that I've been in Ohio State Russell has never brought it up and Greg you remember at breakfast this morning we asked Russell that's through and he said absolutely not he said the writings aren't irrelevant except of course you said when you're number one and end up number two I have something exactly and but in the fans the fans although they would look I always say Brandon saying who I told you was here and this is his series now on third down very talented pressure great pain but God he gets an alley at the forty for a first down Brandon King and we're also told Burke if LSU loses and let's say you will write the Cal climbs to the number one the last time that the Bears were number one you got to go all the way back to October of 1951 my era up at the heyday 1951 and it was I'm trying to think happy Waldorf was there in the late 40s yeah they're gonna question on a road wall back there in 49 think about that Jackie Jenson is they've run then you go in the village first out again plaintiff free because it was born for every day we wear face masks you know is there reminded house they do for your late local news immediately following the game over both of these ABC stations and then on ESPN SportsCenter will have post game analysis and they'll show you the highlights they'll show you USC going down in flames they'll show you West constant with the nation's longest winning streak Matea who had the son LSU might have had the second longest winning streak you remember you guys had on game day today do you remember yeah LSU I can't cover the number I can't even so are you going out with my little life a little longer a big palooka I'm hip phone Donna that'd be getting much speed dial he'll know immediately who has the longest win streak together if if it's LSU that Finan is that you know speaking of winning mr. Trussell over there you know he's got a great record obviously I said before before he came to there's beanies like the Fifi Zayn's but the mr. Trussell had a great great record in youngstown state and the most impressive number that I found about him this is Jim right there now is when he was at it was over against a state he was to a no against the Montana good thing they lost to the Grizz here out in Missoula one was a big semifinal with the Penguins I should have saved that trivia for when we go to Columbus he will probably be going there for games the way these guys fall stocks if you know what number 86 I put have yard penalty remains third down my buddy Jerry Zwick the quarterback on one of those teams managed you had a chance to to meet was a proud member of the Youngstown State penguin he was welding Penguins yeah Porter well Bob Davie was a penguin yo coach yeah right sure tradition in history day he just taken that tradition and won four titles yeah and now he's creating a whole new kind of tradition Division one just goes out the butt luckily the labs are going to take a step back to Columbus with it we know and then players and fam coaches would probably go to work right away but if players and fans await for the polls for could not level I will be there celebration we've got an injured a boilermaker down and that's cook table they're fine defensive end I've been a linebacker I know you hate to see them puts that knee like that hopefully it's just it's fine well that is some Saturday let's uh let's take a look at week six Illinois in Champaign mendenhall 193 total yards were really good ending the nation's longest ones very beating the number five teen Wisconsin Stanford stunning USA with 48 seconds remaining the Irish closing in on their first victory up 20 to 6 and then South Carolina started off the madness by knocking off the number 18 Kentucky in the it's just wild week after week yeah of course Stanford stunning USC is the story of the not only today but the year but Notre Dame may be able to shake that oh and eight start involving clamoring and talking about they said they had their best week of practice this week it felt very good about their chances of going out there and knocking off UCLA that is a UCLA you saw there's pretty good down yeah very athletic on defense have a few issues on the quarterback position but her name is they go hunting Rick and Leigh Boston College and then they host USC and you know when you think about it coach this really is two subpar performances in the road for USC we cut up some concessions like Philippine penalties yeah three turnovers was it doing you're watching ESPN on ABC now liner in New York the SportsCenter minute powered by Vizio Stanford pulled off the latest stunner from college football Savita Pritchard to mark Bradford on fourth down to end USC 35 game home win streak and from baseball this year won't be next year for the Cubs they were swept by the Diamondbacks in their nationally divisional series dbacks headed to the NLT edge of the first time since 2001 the Cubs will remain without a World Series title for now 99 years and counting men are director Dima long time tough man just said to me with a mixture and a reporter that's the woman here come and check for counselors and one said anybody can have a bad century but Jack if you're listening to me up above I'm a too bad surgeries come on first down and ten down and let's check the buckeyes schedule here the home on the road here and see what their what they're up against what's the what do you make of this the road game in Penn State and Michigan to several games all of a sudden the the home games Illinois becomes a very interesting game but clearly these are the two games that everybody wants to see and if Todd Beckman I think is going to hold the key there his development in the next few weeks will be very significant on whether or not they can go to Happy Valley by then always the tough place to play for Ohio State it will be a night game at Happy Valley and of course at the end of the year Ohio state of Michigan it wasn't Jim Tressel's last loss of the big ten of the regular season at Penn State yeah that night no real tough game Toria the guys were juniors yeah they will be there remember they said in great TSP game yep white out here there was a white out over great noise they'll be ready at Happy Valley oh they won't have and then of course you get to the Wolverines and Brussels had their number here the last few years you're going to Ann Arbor now it has never reason knocked away because they what a job by this defense and that is Marcus Bremen folks he's been a standout from the opening whistle what a game he's played you can't say enough about the players intensity the way they've been flying around and running to the football Luke fickle codefensive coordinator along here Jim Haycock these guys took on so much heat after the Florida game about not making adjustment where they've been determined to kind of throw a different kind of break or to a tall fences but we've seen a lot of that tonight they've been rushing three down linemen played three linebackers and ripple look but they've been creative with how they've gotten pressured tonight on Curtis Painter his heart line and a he's going to figured out bounds at the 35 yard line with the foot they find it so so you know he's going to be second guys next week but TV Carol the game is passing by clearly very night football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines with Southwest Airlines convenient nonstop life it's like having your own company play visit Southwest car the Nissan Titan proud presenter of the 2007 Heisman to write in Wireless and full state proud sponsors of college football are you in good hands the Buckeyes stock soaring here tonight closing in on their sixth straight win if the Buckeyes in California don't make it I'm predicting mr. Herbstreit a South Florida and Hawaii BCS oh great only fitting for the year that we've had so far it's crazy isn't it I mean let's for example the LSU loses now to Florida at home tonight if they lose I'm sure there's still time again what do you make a Cal schedule haircut well we've been talking all year about Wow can't wait to see town USC but now you really start to look at UCLA on the road and Arizona State on the road and of course a rivalry game with the Stanford Cardinal and Jim Harbaugh so they'd be very very surprised to see Cal be able to navigate through that entire schedule unscathed thing back in is the running back and Robbie showing off the backup quarterback the junior from Mason Ohio Kirk against lowflying time here 350 to go know Cincinnati st. Xavier Claire that was given an opportunity to win the starting job in spring in the summer okay okay okay yeah for sisters whose name starts with K give me the four names no I do that graphic just gave up four sisters oh really the first name sergeant okay I've got nothing for you I want to fight the honor I thought for sure here I'm the one of one of our track guys Ryan mobile Center George Hill one of my crack Ives the mobiles have ducked at bowling tournament the other night do by the way he get ball yes let me out there today to rule whole new cutter balls over myself and get her ball did you roll by the way too many well I told you you look so nice to destroy ya you know that it's amazing what you can do with trick photography made that one look really good you nice big towel you know if you have a hard time navigating I think Cal the great team I just think they have a suck taking short of the first down into any long most sent you the says that there's the poor sister starting with K you want to read them off the players are probably watching it with Kimberly and Kelly and Kerry and Chris it's great very nice stuff appreciate that information is good with other graphics I wanted I want to tell you this he's from a high screen that's becoming national power Cincinnati saying that yeah you mentioned that they are a powerhouse you get some great high school football teams no huh Wow yeah yeah you think about Florida of course California Texas in Ohio is right there and that makes it we're not about is Ohio with Cincinnati elder and training and rain great teams so when you know when you say that Russell how come you missed on this guy you can't take anybody can you know I mean a lot of schools from the not only the big ten but all over the country coming to the state of Ohio to try to take talent out there sure here's here's a reminder again folks I know some of you are waiting for your late local news and we're going to wrap this up soon as soon as we can and most mostly stations and then SPN if you haven't seen any of the highlights of USC going down in flames at the hands of a 40point underdog coached by Jim Harbaugh first year lost all his quarterbacks started a young man tonight had never started a football on the road this game was not up at Stanford I mean it is just one stunning game after another this year you know when I see these two teams get together and I see the colors and I see the field I have to go back to 2002 for a great call you up to the offensive line no crystals going to perform they go for the ball game would you believe what a calm take what it would it you know that song that's a national championship oh you know dint win the title and what crazy is it he was so conservative that year I don't making a short pass and a runny principal goals for it all on Sally and your reaction thumbs up the entire reaction of the college football community I just shocked when he came up firing and Michael got loose down there you know I can still see it down there it seemed like we had one great game after another perfectly with the Buckeye they held on for dear life every seemed like every week in the residency they've given us given us great thrills I'll never forget for example of the victory when the Chris Spielman made final 2324 titles against Michigan their approach didn't work in a game and era thought it was a desperate moment by a small middle linebacker who he'd ever seen 1985 attempt Emirate well in Columbus Takas might have been the game that Jim Harbaugh guaranteed a victory it could have been I like to think about it there's a first time to end their king the first marketing getting some playing time here I'll have a minute and a half and this defense wants to shut out right now they don't take out about it that's always a hoot always something that you lack here a defensive coach and foil line and watch the ball and we take a look at the listen Russell's eye on that clock right now there was 1998 my belief is of Ohio State can maintain the intensity that they played with tonight throughout the rest of the year I think this football team has the potential to be better than last year's team that went for the national championship because of defense leading them this year not the offense with Troy Smith and all the speed it's the defensive intensity it's kind of a staple of this 2007 edition of Ohio State incomplete well today's Chevrolet players of this game and we can honor a couple key fencing players Marcus Freeman seven tackles one for a loss broke up a couple of passes and Anthony Haygood the converted running back 11 tackles tonight three for a loss in a sack and Chevrolet will make it $1,000 contribution each University's general scholarship fund and the Boilermakers need to go in and and regroup if they do if they're to get a couple defensive guys yeah and always give it a little bit yeah you do they spread the run a little bit I often ask our society get this week off to get to regroup get ready for the big one in their Talladega tomorrow though you get a chance that's at highbank oval they got that new car down there that they're worried about good chase bad bad tough loss for Tony Stewart last week he thought he had it won when he gambled the rain delay and they've gone back out to the crash and so you know you've got the defender Jimmie Johnson for Court are you Jeff Gordon what are your favorite haul of course a Rainbow Warrior Yeah right my boy is be surprised or gone Clint Clint Boyer is the what I say the Appalachian State of the chase oh yeah there's one one and he's hanging right into one of the closest chases compiled it really a big reward on their some of the guys watching they got these big dishes on that big Arby's down there and they watch a lot of football the night before the race and then when we have rain down there you're going to join our interview and ever watch of the NFL therefore these big dishes because it worth knocking the Boilermakers trying to get on the board before this is over that's yo Turkey looking pretty good Turkey's getting a chance to step it no Jason Taylor he's been knocked out earlier this year and then they're typically to try to spell for ishikawa game get to opportunities how can you come down to go home state get the shutout or not final minute now what is the do you think you get it grabbed at the 2 yard line by Greg Orton give the Boilermakers a scoring opportunity here what a catch initially to midnight for the Boilermakers to see some of this earlier in the game the ball was thrown low just where it had to be in Greg Gordon 6 3 about 195 pounds goes down lower the long reach joy for desert deflected incomplete us almost intercept the big mitts were up a the log of it a little but 72 Larimore oh my gosh his life flashed before if he's actually in there with the hog molly's Hayward gets a hand on it then it's a it's a fight there for the big linemen hey Larimore had his hands on it was going to be an intercept he's in Indiana when there's a second down and goal the freshman Dickens running back good Amazon down late away for the touchdown let's say it still hasn't been signaled yet you know was in the middle of it was Hayward looking where they spotted Hayward they lured the fool on the other kid you told me helmet good look at youngster he's going to be a superstar for hioh state I really liked it you know yeah yeah we don't see true oh wow we lowered the boom there it bent it back didn't I mean for a second at that angle it looked like they were going to get it in here let me see it looked like it might across the friend it has to tear the helmet that's his helmet in heaven right there you know body's missing upstairs he got it wow this is such down they were writing I'm sure the boys will stop this one hey hold up the booth probably saw that last shot at me David evidently not that was a touchdown to Purdue when you go down Peter's going to grow water makers make sure that they score this time and Curtis Painter after the last call they didn't get the opportunity before even though they did interesting because Keller took two defenders with him he cuts down the time to put a seder to go to the food I honestly doubt it for summers tacking on the extra point 10 seconds to go Boilermakers we're not a shutout on itis of the rest of the blog I defenders with a terrific ever gone back to the drawing board to frustration on Ohio State defense well big claims they were good look at him the part just like his daddy he said I'm pretty kind of regroup true Ohio State look at their filming saying big win would look great we'll play here for Jim Chester the dice tax with his staff draw highstakes ready to go has to get to full of themselves because in Columbus in the state of Ohio we're going to get a lot of notoriety and smoothing up in the polls yes three seems a certainty and we'll see what both that who knows what tomorrow's gonna bring if you got and configure design if you're in sidekick down and Buckeyes will end it right there go to six and Oh undefeated in the conference so that's one of the big stories of the day in the big 10 the other one of course Illinois ending Wisconsin's winning streak it's time to go it's time to go but if I was taking to
