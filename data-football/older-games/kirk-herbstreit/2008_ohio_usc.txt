============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on ABC the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosting another extravaganza a red carpet welcome for USC head coach Pete Carroll his quarterback Mark Sanchez is ready for the biggest game of his career against Ohio State the Buckeyes will be without running back Feeney Wells who was a lonely figure when he arrived in his sideline attire the numbers don't lie the legends don't fake the best team in college football Petrovic WLC and you don't need hype with this kind of history the story is in the contrast between the Heartland and the coast the flash and the field the new wave and the backtobasics approach in the Coliseum to proud traditions clash legacies carried on by those who lift their teens with every hit and bring back memories with every pass they leave teens whose national title hopes may well hands on this game words don't do it justice all you need to hear are the names Ohio State USC on Saturday Night Football you are looking live at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were tonight two of college football's traditional powers meet in a highly anticipated early season showdown on Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines tonight the number 1 USC Trojans hosting the number 5 Ohio State Buckeyes in their first matchup since 1990 and when they bury the sword came on in LA welcome everybody I'm Brent Musburger you know it is hard to believe that it has been 18 long years since Ohio State at USC I played a football game in fact back in the era of Woody Hayes it seemed like these two schools played every year in a Rose Bowl in fact they did meet four times in that bowl very 1969 and 1975 so it is indeed a pleasure here tonight to have UFC and Ohio State move back to center stage and it's always a pleasure for me to welcome my partner Kirk Herbstreit been working overtime you saw beany Wells won't play tonight so how did the Buckeyes pick up the slack I think the big thing that they have to do is now rely on some running backs that they've not been in this kind of environment especially boom Herron number one he's going to get an opportunity to see what he can do in running the football Brandon saying a sophomore also has to step up but more importantly Jim Tressel has to break tendencies to have any chance of moving the football against this USC defense talented freshman quarterback terrelle pryor does he figure it all tonight I just talked to coach Tressel on the field and this is breaking news it's been speculated now we know terrelle pryor will be heavily involved in tonight's game plan for Ohio State in fact the very first series look for number two to be inserted now he's not going to be asked to take the series and drive 80 yards down the field tonight they're going to look to insert him within a series to take the weight of the world off of his shoulders to see how he'll do it if he performs well he will play throughout the entire game some spot this is a great USC football team I think when the dust settled this could be Pete Carroll's most talented team and the deepest team that he has offensively the firepower is there Mark Sanchez gives the mad at quarterback and they always have skill defensive wait do you see this team they play around and they're going to put a lot of pressure on Ohio State time for a wild ride but Stewart down on lets up Kenny Chesney take it home Wow to the wise anime in all well now when you talk about points and we talked about how it's been a tough day for the pac10 joint cow losing that game to Maryland UCLA had their worst loss in 75 years to BYU today the I don't think USC is going to have that type of problem against Ohio State although it's going to be a real testament now they're coming they'll come out flying defensively they got all types of speed and talent and they're going to give Todd Beckman his hands full Rhea malroux their linebacker Brian Cushing at linebacker Clay Matthews who's moved to defensive end was a linebacker they fly around and they're going to be pressure all day and in their face all right we played the NFL I'll go back and say in the spring I had a chance to stay and watch USC practice I'm on the practice field in the huddle with the USC offense it's a 9 on 7 drill so it's a running game only I was nervous that USC defense was unbelievable the pressure that they will put on Ohio State's running backs and offensive line Azzam it and that pressure that same pressure they put on their offensive line at USC will help the Trojans offensive line were they actually going to tackle you I was afraid not buckled up had my knee that's like you brandy of course has been there all day long so for more let's go join Chris Fowler and Lee Corso preview for Ohio State USC now John the LA Coliseum bathed in sunshine filled with 95,000 people they bought tickets online from 45 different states everybody wants to be here the Buckeyes arrive at doubledigit underdog pulling together without Feeny wells of the tailback position these are not the two teams that know each other well they have been 18 years but still there is animosity both sides are waited a long time for this occasion to prove a point USC's West Ohio State in Alaska BCS chance to give believing they should be there the block has of course corned beef redemption for losing or osoo games the Corso is alongside what's the key for Ohio State without Wilson well a save runs to win I'll tell you why if they get 125 yards rushing they're 10 and 1 if they go less than 125 they've won three and lost four they gotta at least try to establish some kind of run early to keep the pressure off the quarterback the will it be with terrelle pryor the guy who has only three Buckeyes on that helmet down there he's played a million few ballgames would you take on this one I think Southern California wins the quarterback Sanchez is too good an athlete I think he beats the guys on broken play giving the ball to the athletes from Southern California and they go Joe McKnight is a key guy I got offensive line for Ohio State's a lot of pressure on them they haven't played that well for USC it's been rebuilt so keep an eye on the guys up front and Kent Sanchez get the ball to all those weapons Mark Sanchez has waited a long time for this moment in this place in a big game so many subplots so much intrigue they can't wait let's go up this front Musburger and Kirk Herbstreit in the booth right the sights and sounds of big game America USC hosting Ohio State the trojans brothers have been there Coliseum turf in LA that final pep talk but the Buckeye Nation is here in full dress they'll miss running back beany wells the two outstanding head coaches this has been the Nissan pregame shift kickoff for number five Ohio State and number one USC is coming up next you're watching ESPN on ABC I'm a good man sir that stadiums can be rocking to make it back possible a lot of people over been in this football game and we're going to give everything we have they're a great football team and you can see that but it's our chance to show the world that we belong on the same field with us it was not the type anymore around here is nothing terms of the method people at home as a bowl game people call these different things and it's just an honor to be a part of this ESPN showdown at ABC is available in high definition well tonight Aaron Andrews will be on the Ohio State sideline Lisa Salters will be covering the breaking stories regarding USC let us begin with Aaron Fred I had a chance to speak with Deanie weld during warmups and he is devastated he's not playing tonight he said he begged coach Tressel last night he begged him this morning and he says he's even get a bag of during halftime to let him play but the bottom line is Preston said I don't want your hurt yourself anymore and if you're not healthy you're not going to be effective tonight now let's send it over to Lisa Salters well Aaron USG hasn't played in two weeks but the Trojans have a good four days down here describer you can almost touch it among players and after reading while not playing linebackers coach Ken Norton said that is his loss we can honestly say we didn't mention his name one time in meetings last night for today he said you know what we went he was going to play because we wanted him to feel the Trojans a little bit attitude Brent attitude isn't that the truth the Trojans get ready down there the tunnel the captains for both sides have moved out to the sidelines we have a packed pin officiating crew and they will of course take it to the coin toss will be the referee Jeff Pollard and now the program's come out 94,000 about twenty minutes past five o'clock along the Pacific coast there'll be a little bit of sunshine here during the next 30 minutes or so and then it'll dissolve to the west 8th year as head coach just the same as Jim Russell you James Laurinaitis over there on the lefthand side Malcolm Jenkins two of the players who came back this year as seniors when they could have signed lucrative contracts with the national football shaking hands with their okay starting your call that scale what is your call all is get always head I'm an imposter and section if I don't catch it I'm going to reap off okay a call it is tail you're one to talk alright USD is one that's off they'll defer for the second half you want the ball which way do you want to get the end funnels you want to kick this right okay so if you'll see the Buckeyes without beanie welds right away in this game some of the most storied programs in all of college football so much history between Ohio State USC the national championships 18 between 11 for the Trojans when it comes to hardware seven Huysmans apiece Rose Bowl wins one p3 for USC and six for the Buckeyes Jim Tressel's with Aaron now so let's go back down to Erin will cause Feeny Wells not playing tonight wasn't keeping him out of the game well it's the best thing for him and his health and that's what we're in this work for the young people and you know he might not speak to me ever again but we'll be here doing all the game you mentioned at Parker Street we're going to see quarterback terrelle pryor early tonight what gives you so much confidence a freshman can handle an environment like this well you know throughout the competitor and how much we seem we're not sure but we're going to get them in there get a stick wedge alright coach Nate let's send it over to Lisa Salters thanks Erin see with all the drama is being involved playing not playing what impact has that had on your breast preparation we've prepared like he was gonna play the fact that he's just like this didn't put him in the game so we're not worried about it at all all right in terrelle pryor they were backed off he's not the starter yet you plan to see him how do you a game plan for situations much different you know he's a runner and so we have to take care of that first watch the scene you know how much they want to play more ready for it thank you Michael our league now you go back and again it's been 18 years since these two schools have met each other churches lead it overall having won the last five games the last Ohio State when was back in the 1974 Rose Bowl they've played seven times at Deer Park Pasadena and the Trojans lead it by one the song girls are ready for this evil David peeler putting the ball on the tee at the 30yard line brand insane and boom Herron are back deep so there you see two of thee but guys boom is there on the right number one through the runners were going to be seen as three tolis he'll use all three they'll see what they've got it running back behind a big talented offensive line coming off of poor performance last week against Ohio here comes Karen from the goal line well as cure to the 20yard a special team coverage and here comes Todd Zachary realtime Beckman at senior he brings a great deal maturity to the position of course we talked about terrelle pryor will be eventually inserted but Todd Beckman is the leader of the offense especially with Feeney well down they need to look to number 17 tonight as a guy who knows he's going to make good decisions with a football the look for Ohio State Brent no matter who the quarterback is to spread this USC defense out and try to throw the football to set up the run Herron is the opening tailback it's the first carrier of the game a couple of yards into the heart Ellison the safety coming up and talk to us about these running backs now Colonel Maurice wells has been around he's kind of a steady running back from Iowa State but I think you're going to see more of number one boom Herron who was just in the lineup there to start his game electrifying back with great speed and Brandon Zane has the fastest hundred meters sprint in the history the state of Ohio is a high school track star so there's a great deal of speed with pain and of course with Dan Haren boom Herron in the backfield Sampson bucker brings the play in is number 12 going toward the top of your screen hey overload three wide receivers put Beckman back into gun let's see if pressure gets there flips it out to the right flat that is race more and it presents the first third down of this game as ray mama Luca comes up with his first act that's what Ohio State is going to have to do even though it didn't work they're coming out on second down four wide receivers inserted into the lineup just trying to spread out the speed and a creativity of Pete Carroll 15 he thing so there's no pressure and they bring it short its threeandout elephant making another stop as the pressure closed in at sea team on the Blitz with the two linebackers but Kevin Ellison as much as we'll talk tonight about tailormade the free safety the leader in the back is number four kevin ellison close to the line of scrimmage and heron look like he might flee through a theme that elephant makes a nice play to set up the fun so here is Capasso the putter but the big thing is McKnight is the return man for the Trojans and he is standing at the USC 43 yard line he's the most dangerous allpurpose back on this projym team did not signal fair catch and now he is out of bounds a very dangerous grabbed there with check wall closing in the defensive back on top of him and now we'll see Mark Sanchez gurken his the biggest story ever well he is waited for this game and this kind of opportunity his entire life growing up in Southern California had to pay his dues sitting back behind John David booty and Matt Leinart before that but he has been patient and now he steps under center in a game that could put him on the map at the USC quarterback DJ Gable opens as the tailback he's out empty backfield against the poor man Buckeye rub incomplete on the first pass how about the impact players for the proaches offense Kirk as we were looking at this it's very hard to pick three but we should start with Joe McKnight because they had so many children ight you're going to see him moved around the entire lineup to try to find oneonone opportunities Damian Williams the transfer from Arkansas number 18 it elevated the entire wide receiver group and Ronald Johnson out of Michigan I'm excited to go up against the Buckeyes tonight it really matured against the SDL offense a deep threat downfield McKnight checks back in the backfield he is cryptic and that was Malcolm Jenkins a firstround draft choice for sure come next April and if Ohio State could have stay in this game early this is exactly what they need for their defense to make plays Malcolm Jenkins unblocked showing some pretty good acceleration in his own right if McKnight has some room to run but look how quick Malcolm Jenkins comes down to make the play there for high Oh safety comes first third down for the Trojans centage back in the gun McKnight comes out of the backfield they throw short and complete and it is three and out both teams kind of feeling each other out here both three and out two great defenses tonight they're going to play some football SP deciding to go with the screen realizing at Ohio State may being frank pressure but the rhythm just not there you have an offensive lineman heifer downfield getting in the way there of McKnight Boyd neck and to return men back deep now the Buckeyes are going to let this one roll dead and it'll take a Trojan top at the 18 yard line so the Bucks will be coming out with their second possession of the evening here in the Los Angeles Coliseum on a beautiful night for a football games so much at stake for the Ohio State program because the last time you've seen them on center stage they were losing their second BCS championship to LSU Beckman showing the action a prior play gaining four yards and when you talk about respect here's part of a Todd Beckman on that subject the whole lot just by going out there and losing the last two national championships I think we kind of lost in that respective national eye and I think one out here and planet team like you I see on the national stage primetime football game I think we can win a lot of you know a lot of people over the women's football game and he will watch as the phenom terrelle pryor is out for his first snap of the game moves up under center he was quickly identified by the USC defensive players runs around the corner and out of bounds let's see if fire stays in or Beckman as Kirk you told you directly to come back in yeah they're going to they're going to insert terrelle pryor into this game within theories as opposed to say hey take the third or fourth series and feel the weight of trying to go 80 yards they're going to just use him throughout this game in certain spots in that time he didn't take anything he just went around the corner and trying to pick up some yards and give Ohio State now a third and short opportunity another backup for a man Jill Bauman was talking to the young Pryor on the sideline now Beckman is back in the gun they only need two yards for a first down they got it offsides I believe it doesn't matter they throw to roe Biscay for the first intent but I believe that the right side of the defense jumps to cross that would be Everson Griffin the sophomore let's see now so the first first down of the game as we expected Trel prior back on the field again for ohio state and this time to go on no huddle with prior and the ball of a spotted Kirk at the 34 yard line so just as you recorded at the top of the hour we've already seen prior in for two snaps and remember he did not see really meaningful time against Ohio he played last week but not when that game was on the line so Jim Tressel has been busy putting this package in his eye on the Trojans and the young man hands it off and powering ahead is Herron I think it's important for people to understand why Ferrell Pryor is being inserted into the game it's been reported in Faust about how elusive quarterbacks have given us the defense pitch over the years Genna fiction Vince Young but this is unprecedented to see a true freshman on the road in this environment taking snaps but it just shows you the confidence and also how they feel they can spread the USC defense out make them think and slow down the aggression and intensities that's why he's in the lineup Maurice wells play fake two in Beckman rolling right throws high tot and reaching for the first down is Brian Hartline so that is the second first down for the Buckeyes we're starting to move the ball on this us CD it's interesting here bootleg and again Jim Tressel breaking tendencies and just showing a variety of things the bootleg I want you to look and see right here how many different receivers the Todd Beckman has opened he has a choice of three different receivers trying to change the tendencies of eight months worth of film study right now what Jim Tressel's trying to do shuttling quarterbacks in and out here comes prior to throw his first pass and it is complete for another first down to Dane Suns and bucer her wife so much for thinking when two comes in look out for the quarterback keeper right here early in this game you're seeing Ferrell prior showing the ability to throw the football downfield in a confidence that Jim Tressel has in him to put him out of the corner with an easy read a simple throw to get his feet pedal Jim underneath himself round go out and play con Beckman comes back into the lineup Cogan's for the fiveman rush press Herron on the run and he backed his way for a nice gain a terrific effort by boom Herron and we go to Matt Winer in New York for an update Matt hi everyone Matt Winer in New York throughout your game I'll have all the latest from all the days most important games let's start with the Taco Bell updates over a battle number three Oklahoma the highest ranked nonconference supposed to visit you ducks in 69 Stamp Bradford to Jermaine Grisham there the extra point blocked 1300 Washington staring oh and three of the faceless they can slow down the soon here comes the Blitz and the defenders going too far on that play flag flies my ABBA is it such that penalty I mean he was in full flight when he came across the line of scrimmage of made contact I know Pete Carroll could not be happy with the digit ball contact by the defense number 43 the fiveyard penalty results in percent he cannot be happy with the lack of discipline I should say early in this game right now for the defense we saw crucial third down jumping off side here this time myoga jumping ahead trying to get a head start on the Blitz and again credit Ohio State Jim Tressel for mixing up the play calling in look not to mention support Finnell especially under center it horrible I was driving the ball inside the 30 young power quarterback draw very elusive slips the first colony down to the 25yard line what is happening here right now for young thrill Breyers he's starting to settle in and he's starting to just play football he's forgetting where he is and he's just starting to get more more relaxed with each snap that he thinks you can almost see it his eyes a little bit of a swagger as he goes back to the sideline getting ready for his next play second and six and the Bucks are driving the ball on this very deep talented program defense they're comparing looking for another first down ran into his old man and still got it Burke I believe you're right that man has got a little bit of Flash I think both of you have not seen him here and that's what he brings is it has the explosiveness for undersized running back at about 510 about 195 pounds runs with a great deal of passion and had the acceleration to be on this field tonight with this USC decent first team into the red zone from the 20yard line back when under Center on the sneak and different some potential Buckeyes got on the scoreboard at first they realize you're Steve Spurrier back when he was at Florida rotating quarterbacks every play Ohio State every play you're seeing a different quarterback and yet the rhythm of the offense and the rhythm of the tribe is not being affected at all in fact it's being enhanced with the two quarterbacks playing on alternate play there's a county trichome other than movement by the Buckeyes start number 70 of the offers/price early for that that's Bryant browning the the right tackle Alex Boone plays over on the left side Steve raring Jim Lord open person that runs out Russell's offensive line veteran group coaches probably working hard this week coming on the subpar performance against Ohio Frank Solich is bobcat stayed into that game well into the third quarter fumbled punt and turned it around first in 15 after the penalty costly when you're down on the red zone to give up five yards fourman rush complete just inside the 20yard line a little biscuit USC giving a cushion to the outside receivers and we've seen two or three times now in this Drive where they've given both Todd Beckman and thrill Pryor an opportunity to just throw an easy throw quick five or six yards moving the chains trying to move the ball right down the field now it's about executing once you get inside the red bow can you punch it in for a touchdown he leaves Beckman on the field for the second and ten apparently going to try to take it down and feel a little bit so they're going to hand it off the boom Herron but the Trojans already this will present Ohio State with a third and long pushing Mao Eluga will hear those names all night long number 10 for the Trojans is pushing and of course number 58 mala Luger hard to find a football game matching any two teams in college football this year where you would have for better linebackers that least contains prison so here's your third down 13th play of this long drive keeping the ball out of USC's hands Beckman back going to throw that middle screen is a penalty flag Heron across the first down line on your screen but there is a penalty flag thrown back at the 11 yard line and there's no time to play and that is a first and goal yeah what was called is an illegal man downfield but the call the ball is caught behind the line of scrimmage and I think that's what confused the official is with the ball caught behind the line or beyond the line and boom Herron was two or three yards short of the line of scrimmage and that's why I was surprised to see a flagon but maybe it was something else but a good no call there by the official to pick up the flag USC has to be aware of this young man now standing back there well he can run the quarterback draw roll first down and goal here's the door play and the Kosovo ready for it they joined for a loss back to the pinata Miami kulikov my other the senior from Hawaii number 43 said we're not going to pull on that Ohio State read the entire USC defense outside of the box area the area between the two tackles but you saw the speed the closing speed of the to USC linebackers coming in that's why tonight you're gonna have to see more and more front row prior other than just running the football again we've seen on this front we have Jake Ballard too tight in for the Buckeyes gets into this past pattern he's on the right side of the down line that went in trouble another law and ugly looking broken play what we're saying again is you feed hot Beckham anything your feet care and you're thinking okay he's going to hand it off he's going to throw a screen he's going to throw the football the second time on this series we've seen option football out of a shotgun from convect Minh trying to give a different look so SP defense is not having an indicator based on who the quarterback is and what play might be coming up puffpuff down the execute against this USP defense here third and goal and the ball back almost at the 15yard line a little bit indicate isn't it a penalty quite as far as the handoff the line judge coming up very snap false start big Alex Boone so the Buckeyes reached the fiveyard line and selfdestruction the ball will be back on the 18 yard line with a third and goal Russell will be happy probably take a shot at it but he'd be happy to get out here with a field goal right now and strike first and that's exactly what they're setting up Karen goes to the middle of the field and the field goal unit will come out if three minutes little over three minutes to go in the first quarter USD and had the ball from 55 seconds in this first quarter interesting Ohio State bets off best defense so far has pinned their own often that's one way to slow down Mark Sanchez and all the great athletes that USC has on their offenses to keep them on the sidelines exactly Vittorio's is going to attempt a 29 yard field goal so Ohio State with its second possession strikes first with a field goal they lead favored USC three nothing you're watching Saturday Night Football on ABC Saturday Night Football on ABC brought you by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fees Nisa passionate about performance and proud sponsor of the Heisman Trophy and Outback Steakhouse brave our followers on the tee at the 30yard line and the kickoff the man is Aaron country so Pretorius kicked the field goal there you see the deep men for USC Ron Johnson is number eight and CJ gable is number two Johnson a wide receiver gay below tailback USC's had the ball for only three plays in this game if you joined us late 306 to go timeconsuming drive for a field goal put the Buckeyes ahead they kick it off again and gable has got it at the eight yard to the 25yard line there abouts it'll be spotted as we i kickoff team comes down coverage and here's a reminder chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup because it New Hampshire tomorrow can Kyle Busch and Carl azuz derail Jimmie Johnson hopes of a third straight Cup championship well we'll start to find out the long one Eastern Kosh has a 30 point lead remember they reconfigure got the chase and Jimmie Johnson's third says yeah Jimmy go for three in a row now I'll reconfigure it is you have to provide a bigger the deal now got to do the head can't wait got punch of the boys that's it you know Mark Sanchez has not completed a pass he's going to try on the roll to see what he can do and he hits Williams and percentage with all the time is now and he says he's ready for the big game this is exactly what I signed out for this is what Coach Carroll Palmer you know I mean that's the only promise they'll give you during recruiting is that the games are going to be unbelievable and now it's my shot you know I don't want to make too much out of it I want it to be a game but you know I'm going to be very excited I'll take a second right before it starts to kind of soak it all in look around and all right get back to my focus though I can't wait for it to happen and I'll be smiling soon great his first completion tonight was the Damian Williams the transfer from Arkansas that's McKnight dancing from the tailback spot first town and that's the project first flourish down to the night moved it pretty smoothly the different wrinkle there was Sanchez on the boot to the right it tends to be a little more mobile and what they've had a quarterback the last few years so I think we'll see Sanchez pull out just like you did on one completion yeah and running the football is the key to be able to set up the playaction game of USBs I think it's probably the best play action game in the country over the years with Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart John David booty but it's all predicated upon us these ability to run the football then they can start to spread things around now they brought him too wide out you saw him run out of the huddle so this will be a direct snap McKnight juggles it runs right straight ahead here's the Trojan another first and Penn so what McFadden popular popularized out of Arkansas perk so many schools are now using the direct snap to running back these Carroll says all right is we going to play the young freshmen I'm going to put my young ball for in the lineup and we're going to be able to show the ability to do the same thing one thing he has is much quickness and speed sarkeesian's the offensive coordinator very very creative and very aggressive with his play calling gable is the running back behind Sanchez Williams is in motion Sanchez looks downfield throws in underneath slipping the running back out as the wide receiver that time so CJ gable with the catch and and that's the beauty of being a quarterback at USC one of the things with Mark Sanchez said he really wanted to work on this year is he had such confidence in his receivers in his arm if it's not there instead of taking a chance downfield he knows he has to be willing to find his outlet and just check down because think about who you're throwing the football to Jo McKnight CJ gable Saban Johnson those guys in open space to make a lot of people miss Blake Ailes the talented young freshman that's the tight end in motion Sanchez is looking down field goes side on incomplete chip walk was the defender on that side and Patrick Turner was the target myristate broad pressured his time with their sophomore linebacker Ross Coleman he got enough pressure and got in the face of Mark Sanchez he goes right by hubby Lee it's entering CJ gable he gets in there and I think it forced Mark Sanchez to throw the football just a little bit before he wanted to the client his hope it was fever there Patrick Turner third and four percent heads and the Trojans way to throw forth there's a penalty flag short of the first now but there is a penalty flag Jenkins with the coverage on Patrick Turner Lawrence Wilson Ohio State defensive lineman jumping there Mark Sanchez knowing he had a free play how he could have taken a shot downfield defense even outside why not Michigan families decline now we've seen both defenses jumping little hands be a little antsy down there especially on third down was so important to have that first step being so quick try to penetrate the offensive line they've not got the football yet the Damian Williams who's at the bottom of the spring of Maureen Keene and I know they'd like to yeah they hit me without one earlier pass he comes in off the corner they can Dan lay hubby Lee takes it to the house for the game's first touchdown he brought one two weeks ago against Virginia but he is a preferred target and he was a year ago with John David Boudia here tonight with seconds he definitely is able to hold on to this keep his ballot could take it into the end zone for USC family have really gives us see that threat where they can sneak him out oneonone against the linebacker and into the end zone so Kirk the Trojans with their fine march down the field they don't settle for a field goal they score a touchdown and lead at 73 the Los Angeles Coliseum and this aerial coverage for tonight's game courtesy of the Outback Steakhouse airship bloomin onion one the bloomin onion 1 airship fan favorite every week on ABC ESPN college football broadcasts they've got a grand scene up there Karen goes back into the endzone Santa's big needle it the mouse on the 20 yard on let's go to replace her see family have really moved to the outside right here and what he has working for him here is you've got it tied in working one on one to the post that draws the corner Mountain Jenkins and confuses him and he's one on one right down the sideline with the linebacker market screaming the ball in well chrome downfield and allows them to run underneath it for a touchdown I love the way they move family who dearly around 250 have such great hand to the fullback they look good over 101 opportunity knocks Beckman gave the Ohio State quarterback starting this drive Haren for a couple of yards it will be second down and eight and Pryor stays on the side this time very impressive ause answered after Ohio State controlled the ball rolled down the link to the field and came up with three points Mark Sanchez the USC come right back and put a touchdown up on the board they'll let the final seconds of the first quarter tick away so the Buckeyes had the ball twice earlier settle for a field goal the Trojans a second time they judge did score a touchdown Saturday Night Football presented by South Pointe Bella's returns that the defenses to work for ABC stations six o'clock along the Pacific Network with Kirk Herbstreit on Brent Musburger a USC leading Ohio State 7:3 this is senior quarterback Todd's Beckman sandy back in the jug gun and here comes another penalty flag thrown by the umpire and that ball was 35 in the office second pileated Alex Boone in this game and he's asking for the umpire to explain this one okay the steady state clench clench I don't know who moved his feet but he definitely flinched his upper body goodness angel the umpire second down and 13 throw in under these short of the first down and it's boom Herron the running back running circle route and Brian Cushing number 10 the linebacker there what USC is trying to do right now went on picnic comes into the game I think they feel more of a threat to mow high o States passing game and their group of receivers and what they're doing is they're keeping through with our defensive back to safety thanks for venting the ball being thrown down field and forcing Beckman to dump it underneath and then they're forming to make it any pencil in front of Nick hold to defensive coordinator sets the cogent D for the third and six take the inside shuttle goes high and complete guys will put it they ran some success with that counter out of the shotgun coming back to boom Herron because USD defense moves so quickly a little counter place a lot of times they've handed it off this time playaction Brian Cushing lowers the boom right there on tot Beckman but still get the catch of a ball thrown to Brian Hartline but Josh Picard drive fourth ride there and able to knock the ball away nice back again it goes out and on display its Beckman taking that inside play and he gets whacked by pushing you're watching Saturday Night Football on ABC we're looking back to Los Angeles if we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary the Trojans of course leading it with that fine second Drive even though they've only possessed it 328 on the line of scrimmage a handoff by Sanchez out of at night and McKnight picks his way and then battles is worried for still another now let's see what's been going on in the sidelines we begin with USC at Lisa Salters Lisa well Brent Brendan Carroll Pete Carroll's on the tight ends coach wanting to keep his offense fired up after that last touchdown he went over to the office and said there is no ceiling in this game we're going to try to score a hundred points if we can because Jay can't stop us now for more on Ohio State over to Aaron we said the Buckeyes over here on their sideline are very very calm you know the one interesting thing is every time trial Pryor gets on the field the entire team gets up off the bench and goes over to watch me also kind of highfiving each other every time he does something guys he will not sit down when he's on the sideline pot Backman over on this side with the receivers throw fire all over the place print Williams is going to limp back over to that side line going down for the Trojans when he was running his pattern he slipped so obviously Lisa's got someone headed her way it's going to receive a little medical attention over there Kirk find that interesting with Erin Andrews just reporting and in the cameras showing it for a true freshman playing on the road for the first time not only we've seen him play pretty well on the field but he's over on the sidelines being a leader offense or defense kind of competitor third down and six Johnson comes in motion and there's the Turner and Turner to midfield and a cogent first on this in many ways is a very very important series for the Ohio State defense they gave way on that last Drive this time they're going to come with a blitz with free men laryngitis and you see Mark Sanchez has enough time there to go right where they were read it the area that they were able to vacate opened it up there and it's about again facing and finding an opportunity there to get the football to a playmaker on that quick here comes McKnight McKnight in a footrace and the talented one from Louisiana is thrown out by Anderson Russell but the Trojans are threatening again with their outside speed a 24 yard gain they can attack you in so many different ways this is zone play and it's about having patience vision and then a burst I look like a little faith not there at the end but look at the post here by McKnight great block downfield by the receiver corner home ignite every time he touches the football you hold your breath wondering if he's going to take that the distance in yards an average didn't you bet that a true heated yard allpurpose game against Illinois in the Rose Bowl first down and 10 appealing to pass block Sanchez stands deep has all the time in the world now papili slips out as a safety valve and nearly is to the 14 yard line for another first intent he was pass blocking there was all the time in the world there is a penalty flag however and let's see what happens is roughing the end of the play so a big penalty here on number 87 what great patience by Mark Sanchez and how about this everybody talked about USC with an inexperienced offensive line it was about six or seven seconds and then once he jumps into Nabila look at the linemen trying to get downfield to pick up a block this is not a design screen this is just a find my outlet and look at the linemen trying to help out have Ely getting down field to pick up a block CJ gable number two their ejections in the backfield number one team in the country two weeks ago they love it Virginia where deny driving again on the Buckeyes after trailing by a field goal Sanchez changes the play here's gable picking him play had it in zone and stopped a couple yards shy of it Laurinaitis and gable very tough to bring down get moving that pile at the end as we second down and goal for the program Joe McKnight receives most of the attention when you think about us these talented group of running back foot watch how quick and watch the footwork here up Gable there's two white jerseys he gives them a little shake and cuts it back to the inside towards the allamerican James Laurinaitis but it's that quickness envisioned on the inside there that I think makes BJ de Ville probably the best allaround back to Trojan panic Stephon Johnson is now the tailback and they use the fullback fake thanks a touchdown up over the top to Blake Hales the talented freshman from Orange California he is six five and what a future he has as a Krogan tied in y'all remember Fred Davis real coming up the road now is that Yemen right there this mild highspeed Sarkisian off with the coordinator this quarterback brought a call to go play action there and find an open target behind the safety to behind the linebackers healer taxing on so a little bit uneasy early but now coaches right back in the thick of things and he loved this play Sarkisian worked on this several times this week Saturday Night Football on ABC brought you by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fee the g6 from putty an official performance machines of the NCAA and Aflac asked about it it work a 15yard penalty on that extra point a personal foul call against the Trojans and now they will kick it off from the 15 and it moves the deep meant for the Buckeyes up to their own 15 so this could be a break for them as they trail it now 14 to 3 here st. inheritor back deep and dealers ready beautiful people juggles it drops it picks it up at the 12 so after that 15yard penalty they get no further than the 23 releases what make this office so dangerous here's the tiny nail here is the safety right here Anderson Russell once you watch the play fake and watch how aggressive this Ohio State defense is and coming up thinking that the bolt carrier is going to have the bull look how open in the back end and what is exciting if you're a USC fan and you've known this over the years is how aggressive these cartesian is as a play caller they're not your conventional offense but they're just going to try to wear you down with their break backs they attack you where you least expect it and that time goal has a higher faith expected run great time for the play faking the playaction back when back on the field for the Bucks Kevin Thomas is number 15 blitz out further at the corner the role in that direction so to the sidelines and it is dropped in the complete race mall the intended target well as you know when New England at the Jets New England has gone to a former USC quarterback Matt Cassel did you know that Matt Cassel never started a game here as a quarterback for USC and Pete Carroll which players kept him on the bench you talk about a reporting tool you talk about a recruiting tool Pete Carroll can now go to any quarterbacks house and say hey you don't have to start for me to become a starter in the National Football a I'm kid that's that's all the Trojans being drop it is another edge sukkah down and ten going to Biscay and underneath will miss be just short of the first down marker Z being run down by Kyle more Kirk you're making these these questions too easily I know that's why I didn't ask you I said what year it was the twenty it was the twenties and third where I'm last year it's nineteen I'm laying in the weeds for you party don't worry but so pumpkin okay I got a few that take you back to higher rent range of those guns Livie there the fifty huge belly third in that a few theories Ohio State after USC and the stadium back in the game and clearly the momentum has shifted back to the direction of closure nothing doing at the point of attack and there's a kind of like so hang on complete flag by the umpire right quite close to the pile this is against the Trojans is the early indication and judging from the look a face mask on the defense number 84 15 our family first out and that is more in the middle though I have a couple of boys and that moves it and that's an important penalty here 1957 left if you're just doing this perfectly if my guys jumped out by three but the coaches have scored the last two times they've met good man under that they've scored quickly and I think they right now in offense they've really been able to make some adjustments and found ways to attack Ohio State Ohio State's offense has had some success for all prior has been inserted tonight he's been used and he'll be used throughout the entire night but we might look back at that play right there by Carlo depending on what happens on this slide is a crucial play Ireland Backman goes down fail incomplete in that one might have been picked off that was dangerous for wizkid we check in with Matt Winer in New York hi friend you're watching number one us see number two struggles today it's our nominee for the Pontiac gamechanging performance South Carolina and danger of tying the game Mike Davis hit by reading hurting off stood up Nashville and hops on it Georgia heggs on the 47 you can vote for this week's Pontiac gamechanging performance starting tomorrow at nine o'clock is going to yes the induct ah Pryor is back in the game the Genet Pennsylvania then the quick pass out to the side small except about eight yards on that reception simple throw Jennifer Pryor just by having his presence back there in the shotgun he Carroll is electing to keep more guys close to the line of scrimmage and that's why Jim Tressel has to have the confidence to be able to throw the football to the outside simple throw but did the ball quickly to the perimeter we're feeding receiver back to try to get upfield hesitated leave it on that play ball that went out for the third and to Murray back standing to his left and Beth who's going to throw for it first and ten and digging in for that hit was Kevin Thomas and Sons and Baca but it is a first down they move the chains here he wanted to try to find rebus t towards the middle the field off to the left is well covered now he charged the panic and he starts to improvise and does a nice job of using his vision downfield and fans in Pocket who they feel could be the next Anthony Gonzales of his ability to make the tension traffic shows you he makes a good play there for a first down and Pryor checks in on the first and then inside the 35 now his wide open to the right 12 yards Mahoney in the red zone as it opened up on that side and he runs for 13 yards that was good recognition by Terrell fire well said Brent the defensive line for ufc's moving you'll see it right to the left right away he comes back and I think he wanted to throw the football that he sees an open field around the edge of the USD deep end for Clay Matthews that taken himself away from the play and you can't do that with a speed of Pryor now it is Beckman dropping it off for small small cuts crew breaks to the two yard line and it is a first and goal coming up for the Bucs that hang on there's a penalty flag at the 13 yard this one's going against the Buckeyes they threw it right at Brian Hartline he was trying to make a few a block downfield might have got him for holding costly penalty would have been a first and goal for the Bucks on the offense number 12 then you are doing with father Sal first down that Suns in Bakker who's called for holding the ball is going to be brought back all the way to the 26 yard on the outside number 12 trying to make a block on Charice right definitely grab the jersey with his left hand he definitely grabbed onto the Jersey is right but trying to break free Beckman's in trouble has to throw quickly and does same short of the 20 yard line cooked up by Brian Cushing number 10 now Luger gets most of the attention the USC defense because of his big hit but the more more you watch Brian Cushing play the more more I believe that when my Luger leaves to go to the NFL and Brian Cushing I think both of these guys are going to be potential firstround draft picks and Pete Carroll he calls Bob Lang pushing his faith starts to light up he just loves the intangibles in the instinct that he brings to that position party now for second 12 show crusher safety blitz boon has to pick Ellison up he does seconds got a receiver open touchdown broke risky but hang on flag down right in the holding area for Ohio State coaches and fans and players of Ohio State are getting a little frustrated holding on the offense number 63 in every spot then person the right guard 63 will be to the left right there right in the middle with his arms right around fight looks like he locked him up them in their room yep second and 22 and there's the penalty toll becomes the Blitz I've been lucky to gain a couple out of that more was it on the on to stop ohio state having success in Griffin there and I'm sorry that behind a hundred potential on the football basic you has been secondary they've had a few plays fall back on him but I think the private key Jim shuffled that game was on the continue to try to look for opportunities downfield of throwing the football but for him to try to get the ball to the middle of the field to set up a potential field goal here we're going long the better those backs of our Biscay who had turned back and Beckman thought he was going to break wide but he was under enormous budget they didn't have a long time to communicate on that employers Clay Matthews zone of a Hall of Famer was applying the heat Clay Matthews off from the left the quickness played linebacker last year they decided to move in town as a defensive end he runs a 4/5 it gives you an idea of his quickness and regardless there was a mixup there between risky and Beckman there on the throw Feeny wells not in pass that I watching from the sidelines we saw the corner Maurice White and he was involved a little bit of an incident Pretorius he'll go to the right no good so it stays at 14 3 I'm a possession very misleading here tonight Feenie Wells had to help out the coaching staff here on to get the offensive line going a little bit down there meanwhile the student body for USC across the way it started to chant overrated overrated and the Trojans have to touch down to their last two possessions it is put the UCLA for helping students sexually crazy play fake Sanchez in trouble drops it off to hockey lien Leonidas was the first to hit him but then he's brought down on the Aflac trivia question and if you are a USC fan don't know the answer to turn in your season tickets Matt Cassell never started a game which players kept him on the bench here there you do it all along for a couple of Heisman Trophy winners but there is Matt Cassel backup quarterback here now so here for Kirk Herbstreit which the Little League team did not cancel all hos bear with a bullet or do you find anything though it's a big night flag thrown on this play norther Northridge okay you know those youngsters made it back to Williamsport and no we'll get the holding hold it on the often I'm reporting then you are filling in the previous spot second down that's one of their tight ends and that's a Ellison but else I know that you and I love college football absolutely you love literally will to it is amazing we you came back from a discover we start talking about this year's I think start going back how many years even something a little different I was 19 right you come up with names guys are playing hockey now guys there's a major league Chris brewery yes I'm Boka dickhead for my greatgreataunt everyone here like up in Colorado doing that yeah you know don't ask me about the Taiwan easier opening everything off of them my friend all right second down and 20 yards to go here Kirk here is McKnight on that quick pitch he cuts back you can see his elusiveness and he almost picks up a first and ten after the holding penalty second down in 20 think about this now second down in 20 what do you expect from a USC offense this is old John McKay often student body left toss it to Joe McKnight and show it he can do 18 yards on second 20 now what's interesting is you're suited think that they were trying to throw the football to give themselves a chance on second third and short but no no they have such confidence in their back student body left 18 yards third and to Johnson back in at tailback Kirk I can't think of a team that can go for deep the tailback we haven't even seen Bradford yet and he's pretty talented football player here is Johnson little cam caused the bounce outside and battles his way it doesn't get the first consent and Hayward is really quiet up there about the the young mothers locked on in the lawyer and I just comes away with the football James Laurinaitis made a great play and upon Johnson when he starts to give his momentum picked up he could push you in the other direction watch Lera night as he mirrors him and he explodes right into him to keep him short of the first down great play by the allamerican linebacker and they force a punt with that aggressive look on Dee at the 18yard line small going down in a hurry we'll take a break we're going to show you a comment from small that has really fired up the Trojan here tonight when he touches the ball the small split out wide now what guys looking for big play Pryor is the triggerman ends it off Danny Haren running away has got a big game 11 yards in we talked about small and the comment that he had here at Ohio State they teach you to be a better man men recruited prepared he said they're it's just all about football and he's finding out it's just how much football it's all about out there they all I can tell you is both coaches do a great job of winning football games and you and I know these guys both very well both do it different ways could close to a great job of raising young men within their program as well Rajan's show a blitz and Declan goes down again incomplete pass into the ground he goes there bringing the heat on number 17 cookie going to be interesting to see this game goes on when Sorrell flyers in the games you really sense that Ohio State has more rhythm and he has shown the ability to throw the football and I think Pete Carroll's doing a great job of zeroing in when Todd Beckman is back there taking the snaps Pryor comes back here again on 2nd and 10 so Josh Pinkard is again in at that right corner and Wright has been off the field a couple of times I think that moves up on the line of scrimmage toward the copier screen here comes Pryor keeping it and coming down and up Lisa what is the situation regarding our right well Brent this story really shook out yesterday late afternoon the incident was over the weekend it's being described as a party that got out of hand to Reese right what's at that party for people who are arrested at that time and at the time rice was only detained but police said that they were going to continue to investigate and throughout the course of that investigation they ultimately decided to arrest or eat right and he has been charged with felony resisting a police officer not talk about it the end zone touchdown plugins with Dick Butkus watching here tonight Moll Eluga stakes his claim to being a finalist for the Butkus Trophy given to the finest linebacker in the land and they could not push the big fella out of bounds as he ripped down that far sideline over there I thinking stayed inbounds here boy what a great job of leading the quarterback five oh it's close tie at the end right at the end it was very inside the five it was close it's a great look at it right here yep what do you think right there on the side it looked like the right foot very well well could have been yeah right there he did a great job of just reading the eyes of Todd Beckman who threw him right towards the receiver and then he shows his athletic ability getting the ball downfield how about the defense attacking Beckman to give him a chance to get in the end zone if it stands it would be raised first whoever touch them again if it stays 48 yards being reviewed as every players in the college game upstairs ray has four tackles to go along with that interception here tonight so result to a big game in a reminder that that near the conclusion of tonight's game will select a Chevrolet player of the game from each team and Chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution to university general scholarship and Ray has staked his plan a career here ruling on the field stands well the Greek Bible found that it was not conclusive upstairs even though it looked like you might have caught a little chalk there but regardless later had a person roll down there here comes peeler next on another extra point coaches of three touchdowns tonight one of them at defensive variety you're watching number 58 as he drops back into that zone stepped in beautifully and the ball is thrown late not to mention Todd Beckman stared Brian Hartline down the whole time once he threw it late that gave mallalieu got plenty of time for his instinct and athletic ability to step right in front of the throw and then he turned into a halfback watch the strength to shake off hardline then kicked into the endzone that defense the defense attacked Todd Beckman and again both the injury after the interception he got pummeled and knee down inside the five yard line there's your time of possession but it doesn't show up on the scoreboard doesn't curse the big plays tonight for USC the defense there we've seen it from the offense reason they haven't had the ball long is because they score in a hurry as part of the reason the Ohio State wanted to possess the ball to keep the ball away from their dynamic playmakers tough to do and be welcome on a sideline trying to help this team out of the cocaine off what I've seen I don't think one man could make all the difference very very things I can say this might be the best you have 15 so we go and look at them right now and if it's a team that last year lost 10 players to the NFL and think wow they're going to be down this year and the next wave of player steps in and they're able to continue to keep that bar and maybe even raise the bar from where they were in previous years all because of that man right here I could be wrong and so I should have a Brian Wilson George Hill check this for me but I think the approach has had about seven players drafted in the first couple of rounds of the NFL right there put it up there or kids might have gone to the first round we'll we'll check that for sure you lose that kind of talent anyplace else and pick and you think that if it intercepts it up here comes prior to he'll be the quarterback running beautifully for 13 yards again and let's go to mad at New York for an update Matt I breathless would center right now presented by Vizio the Ravens Texans game first post post Monday now has been rescheduled for November 9th at duty damage to Reliant Stadium from Hurricane Ike and a costly costly victory today over Michigan for the Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis injured in me when one of his Irish players crashed into them on the sidelines itself diagnosis to these posts flowed out now we certainly hope that's our that really looked okay Matt that fires going down failed incomplete and we have just checked and there were seven trojans in the first and second rounds last year Cedric Ellis Keith Rivers Sam Baker and Lawrence Jackson went in the and they just keep coming back let's play you see tailormades an allamerican safety letting a true freshman know what it's like on the road for the first time throw priors Maxton across the head saying i will see you next play taylor mayor just keeps coming back yet and keeps attacking him trying to get into his head hit amazed will be a first right choice and he'll be that live he's a prick I don't you look at him went the 43 at his side it feels like Hillary that there he kind of Ryan Urlacher except he moves the practice Beckman's back in in trouble throws in underneath and they lose yards on that completion my allah and claim at number 47 Jim Tressel staying with the game plan I said before the interception from Todd Beckman that from up here in his first half believe it or not it just looked like the offense had more rhythm with the threat of terrelle pryor in there with the ability to stretch the USB deepest from sideline to sideline with the formation with his feed and then they could still one up the middle with boom Herron and Brandon famine he is also shown the ability to throw the ball the Jim something will come up when I do he's sticking with convict path here his senior names running around at that safety spot they come in underneath for the first down Brian Hartline and they'll stop the clock and move the chains Buckeyes would dearly love to put some more points on the board before the intermission and have something to build on here is a trail at 21 3 surprised there weren't a twominute drill here from for the offense of the defense Ohio State a call timeout made it pretty easy there for Beckman resolve coverage easy throw for Beckman they pick up the first down a little reminder that coming up on the Bud Light halftime report John Craig and Doug will have highlights from the nation's top teams including the top 25 upset scores highlights Hurricane Ike update and again we certainly want to pass along all our condolences to the families down in the Gulf area some of those people of course have been dislodged it'll be a while before they are able to return the Galveston area to their homes down there Kirk well while I'm at it also we had a terrible tragedy here in Los Angeles yesterday when a commuter train about 40 minutes from here collided with a with a freight train and you know some of the people impacted by that terrible tragedy or watching the game here tonight and again we pass along our our condolences that's one of those inexcusable tragedies that the failsafe system failed and it was a headon collision here commuters headed home just a terrible sequence of events 129 left here in the the first half that man juggled and he hung on so showing good poise was row Biscay on that reception well it's a short game but the clock continues to move for Ohio State and they're trying to come up with it least a field goal and trying to move the football downfield coming out for the 105 left in the opening half oh do not come up with it USC football no it's still loose it is still loose both teams look like they had a shot at it that was clay Matthews who ripped it in from the blindside ripped into Beckman so a Buckeye comes up with the football gym chordal but both sides had a shot at it today and they're going to rule that the Trojans established possession Brett the linebackers here show blitz and then drop what happens is Alex Boone decides to come down because he's feeling the threat of the Blitz and it frees Matthews from the outside they back out boom comes down and look at Clay Matthews coming untouched off the edge that's the fight for it right there he is down for that speed Carroll showing blitz trying to create confusion and it works linemen blocked down and Clay Matthews comes free off the edge all I can think of is a whistle blew when the two proaches pounced on the bull but the whistles are the flags have not the instant replay decisions have not gone in Ohio State's favor here tonight nowadays a person can let's here Sanchez off a play fake gonna try to strike at the end of the half in underneath exhausted and that is CJ gable so if you look back at the eight years that Pete Carroll has been here his turnover margin is now plus a hundred and four now I want you to think about that number a hundred and four that's amazing and his championship teams throughout his season has been over plus 15 up to plus 20 gotten away from it a little bit the last few years but that's something that they've really been stressing they love to tear the ball away from anybody this they go up against and a lot of it had to do with the way they they coach in practice the way they love to mix things up and try to make you think as an offense and that was a great illustration of it right there twominute drill and they're trying to instead of just being forbidden and try to hold Ohio State from scoring they feel like they're the aggressive they're attacking the offense in Sarkisian they're on the left in the offensive coordinator which was a fine quarterback up at BYU BYU ran all over UCLA this afternoon up in Provo now do you think Pete and Sarkisian will attempt to strike here and they're closing there's no question if they have the confidence to try to get the ball downfield I would see them trying to go with a route and a formation they've not shown and try to again find that oneonone matchup here comes Sanchez in trouble steps away from it incomplete thousand good reporting that Ellison is slipping out one of the tight ends Sanchez a little gimpy remember dislocated kneecap in the closing days of late summer practice but he was able to get back there was no ligament damage so he was able to come back and start against Virginia he does wear a brace on that left leg but when you go over watching them practice he very very mobile Williams back on the field we transfer from Arkansas McKnight is also their only third down they will let might ignite coming through into the red zone mano 40 seconds anglers and Russell making the stop third down and long and again you're seeing us seem run the football and to be able to do that you need great blocks downfield and you're going to get it from the tight end and watch the block out here by VTOL Hazleton good blocks allows the back to find the seam and with the vision of Joe McKnight once he gets to the second level it's very vacant candy from a baby he's able to accelerate and get upfield and pick up another first down but good block downfield by this SV offense Jimmy Hancock and the Buckeye defense trying to draw together here for the final 40 seconds that's Jim in the middle now putting the headset on Luke chuckle the coordinator talking to him upstairs and they're trying to get maximum effort here and there is Luke bending over with the headset he's sitting down with the headset on they say one of those moments again we would like to try to stop the Trojans they have three touchdowns to none and there's there is McKnight with one timeout remaining 40 seconds to go they have all the time in the world to try to attack downfield and take a few more shots they want to touch down they don't want to settle for a field goal there is Sanchez brine Chuck ball for Williams incomplete gym day tech law the defensive back on that corner second down and ten Damien Williams we've talked a lot about in here in the first half Brent the transfer from Arkansas and the SD coaches just love his ability to run for its routes this time pretty good coverage on the outside one on one by cheque WA get up and high point the ball and keeps it away from Williams for making a big catch would be surprised to see Turner on a post towards the middle to field because of his size put it up in the air and give him a chance because the Blitz on Sanchez gets it off and that was Patrick Turner and first down stops that clock the most attention to the same thing middle the field wide open man sheds because of the size of his receiver Patrick Turner at stick five takes the oneonone opportunity Sanchez with two touchdown passes this have Gables in trouble now you use the timeout here Worthington in defensively for the Buckeyes Sanchez will trot off to the sideline well ABC Tuesday at 8/7 central the 90minute wipeout season finale the biggest its biggest lab we have from White House of the season TV that hurts no good the 90minute season finale of Wipeout Tuesday at 8 Eastern 7 central here and these are great news that I've been provided by the Outback Steakhouse airship bloomin onion one captain Ojai know at the controls of the bloomin onion fan favorite ever week on ABC ESPN college football broadcasts and next week Kirk you and I'll be down in Tempe Arizona looking forward to seeing the Georgia Bulldogs who survived Matt Winer showed us the highlights at Carolina might have tied it and forced it into overtime but they fumbled into the end zone so Georgia survives and they will come west of the Mississippi to play Arizona State next Saturday night on ABC and they're sort of looking forward to that Sanchez brings him up now 19 seconds second down and goal Sanchez throws out of the back of the endzone and the the wide receiver was pretty well covered that time anyway so it'll be third down and goal on Petes thinking can we throw one more time into the end zone and then get the field goal unit out there with the 14 seconds we've got to have it to the back of the end zone when you see a quarterback throw it through the goal post like that clearly Pete Carroll and Steve Sarkisian telling him got an inexperienced quarterback but you feel fairly young when it comes to reps in this kind of atmosphere say hey if it's not there just throw it away we'll play on third down and take another shot people can get into the end zone if not you can always pick the field goal are they like Gabe ELISA with hands protect for youth who is a quarterback fourman rush Sanchez goes in zone intercepted picked off in the end zone by Tim daytech wha we saw him with a great hand fight won it oh there's a penalty flag down hold on everybody hold on it's back lately on the office number 74 interception lead a fine touch that that's big safe it was a book day because at the very least UNC is able to get this to a three touchdown advantage heading into halftime and check one just made a great play again family win he's out in island look how he looks back to see the football takes a chance a bit of a risk because Williams is breaking away from him but he had the confidence to look back for the football goes up and gets the right foot down to the interception I play again by check when it's 2 in the last couple play exactly I was a bigtime athletic play down there in the corner you don't know CD B's Gill position like that and of course Williams one of the things that Williams should learn how to do is to not get away from him force the incompletion so that you can kick the field goal he'll learn to and they'll go to the house trailing 21 3 the thing you usually go see four corners in college finding the football and looking back to a check within that Mark Sanchez and let's go down to Erin all right coach USC defense putting a lot of pressure on your quarterback what are you doing the second half to stop on well we've got to stop having penalties maybe you have touchdowns called back and big plays called back and can't get any consistency when you have a penalty they have a great defensive front or put a lot of pressure think our kids are hanging tough that was a big play at the end of the half for us our guys would keep going coach thank you please fill attended over do thanks Erin Pete obviously on offense you're doing your thing let me nitpick a little bit on defense through all prior having some success what do you think that was a couple calls we made a couple of sticks on the sidelines of course she did so we'll get that cleaned up so he doesn't have so much room I think so too hustling sideline reporters that times they tow folks for the Bud Light halftime report John Saunders Creek James and Doug Flutie right after this and break always turn the car sad we walked me back to Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines Mark Sanchez and the USC Trojans lead Ohio State 21 to 3 and Kirk I guess the question is if you were Jim Tressel which you use young throw fire a little more here in the second half I actually fit in the first half and I would say even more now in the second half down by 18 points where you got to be able to put pressure on the USC defense time for our Southwest Airlines PlayBook in net Kirk three touchdowns for the project yeah it's been about the big play for the explosiveness of the offense from USC Ohio State the best of all more than 10 minutes in the first half in USC but it's been big plays and of course matches fighting off it but Raymond Luke and the SD defense got involved with the big interception return for a touchdown so exploit the explosiveness and the big play ability from USC dominated the story in the first half so the second half kickoff and our Pacific Life game summary looks like this curve gin Utes you can see that Ohio State with a not a huge advantage but five yards advantage of an offense but because of us sees six plays of ten yards or more three of them on the ground three of them through the air Joe McKnight and on display his big play ability and I look for USC if you're not familiar with this team don't expect them to just ride this home and try to work on the clock in the second half you'll see more of the same and more big play ability unless Ohio State defense make some adjustments to slow him down toss play and here comes McKnight McKnight with a big hole most of the 35 yard line let's check in down below with Lisa we'll be corrected Brett I've had a chance to speak with Jim hey coming out of the locker room he said the most important thing he stressed two guys coming out settled down calm down because when you panic you're not executing your assignments he thought they did a good job of that towards the end of the first half he said he was happy with the stop there but that is something they're going to stress throughout the night just calm down Sanchez hands back to the tailback McKnight bounces and he's run out of Bounce after picking up a yard on that play Erin Andrews talking about calming down and she's right when it comes to your mindset and getting too worked up but at the same time if you play defense you have to have a reckless attitude and you have to apply to the football and it's ever been present for Ohio State in this game down 21 to 3 with us be getting the ball to start the second half it's this possession what happens on this possession for both teams could go a long way in deciding what direction is second half goes who comes the Blitz off the corner suck it down an eight down build and they throw for a first out against Jenkins Patrick Turner with the reception late flag coming in there right at Patrick Turner is going to be a face mask on Malcolm Jenkins so they'll have 15 more yards here to the end of this play face mask on the defense number two a 15yard finger print you and I love to play here Sam you and I love CJ gable he I think the most complete back watch him moved to the right a blink by the safety Kirk Coleman picked up perfectly allowed fans head to step into the pocket and then he's got one on one opportunity with a much larger receiver and Patrick Turner without question Malcolm Jenkins the old school grab ahold of a facemask and pulls down harder for 15 more yards so the ball is on the Buckeye 31 yard line seven penalties tonight for 58 yards against Ohio State play fake Sanchez is couldn't find an open receiver so he picks up about a yard Kirk I I think you agree with me and now we've got Sanchez he will give me a couple times tonight there is that that knee cap over there remember was dislocated and kind of a fluke accident noncontact accident and was down for a while but he's a gamer but you know say Kirk I think you were you and I was practice a couple days would be approaches the one big difference we see with this team the downfield weapons that Sanchez had the downfield passing game is better than it was a year ago yeah because if Sanchez his arm and the way the receivers had grown up as a clue before the play prior to the snap false start offense number one hi Garf every second down and that is Turner the young man from Nashville Tennessee you know and it's one of those things that Steve Sarkisian is an offensive coordinator and a play caller last year they had young receivers and they kind of had to nickel and dime you to move the ball down the field along with a great group of running backs this year with Mark Sanchez and the big arm mobility to get to the outside Damian Williams coming in the receivers have taken their game to a different level so you'll see us see attack downfield as you said and also still utilize their talented group of running backs where is that running back screen and McKnight slips at the 36 yard line so here comes the third down well the one thing that I think a lot of fans that's really not here not pro Japan they forget how effective Steve Smith was as a wide receiver and if you go back Eli Manning winning drive against the Patriots he used that rookie from USA you know he didn't make the great catch that I redid but Smith was a very big weapon coming down the field and that Drive and throughout the drive for a Super Bowl championship for the Giants Joe McKnight to the bottom of the screen right here in the slot going in motion come back at him aiming they were aiming for him they slipped him back out Kirk after you saw him and circled him coming back that was a neat little play they practiced that a couple of times but throwing a little bit too hot huh last couple plays just gives you an idea the versatility of Joe McKnight he's not just a tailback it's a lot like Reggie Bush trying to find different ways to motion him move him around and give the defense a different look but at the same time just get the football into his hands so occasionally the quarterback talking over there on the sidelines and back now the punt way next try to hang this one high pressure seal the Bucs up inside the 20 better than that and be inside the five beautiful beautiful punt roaches have got the whole package they lead it 21 to 3 over Ohio State this ESPN telecast available in high definition on ABC HD with Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger Erin Andrews Lisa Salters along with this Todd Backman continues at the Buckeye quarterback their first series here in the second half and they are backed up inside the 5yard line continuing with Karen if you joined us late Feeney wells did not suit up and let's check in down below with Lisa on this projym D that's right Brent I spoke to defensive coordinator Nicole coming out after house on I asked what the key was to holding the Buckeye statistically points in that first half and he said you know what we didn't give up any big plays but the key to this second half they were going to have try to keep running we've got to stop the run I asked him about terrelle pryor he said you know all we got to excited on a couple of plays who missed our debt can't give up any big plays you got to make them keep working pretty good shot of Ken Norton who is there alongside role of course they're enthusiastic coach as prior keeps at this time and is only a couple of yards before he is brought down and Everson driven and Charisse Wright was back on the field at that corner for USC the reason I talked about prior staying in this game is because I think he neutralized his USC speed because of his ability to get outside it almost freezes USC to make them respect his ability to go outside interesting first play that he did in the second half the adjustment but both the defensive end to the outside try to contain him and prevent him from getting around the air third and six Beckman in trouble sacked at the 4 yard line the Trojans front collapses the offensive line and muala number 75 folks he doesn't receive a lot of hug but you're looking right there at another future number one draft choice stay with Todd Beckman's in the game they pin their ears back and pick up a different attitude that time play Matthews went right through the running back boom Herron right in front of you boom Herron tries it step up and get in front of him he pushes him right back into the quarterback and puts the pressure and accessible step off martyr on for Paso short punt goes out of bounds Mark Sanchez and the USC offense will now be working with a short field meeting at 21 three when you come back we'll see if that I defense can hold one more time Saturday Night Football on ABC brought you by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fees

toward Miami where the BCS championship game will be played this year and a win tonight over Ohio State will send USC well on its way first and 10 here Kirk look for USC here to go for the jugular with hit only down two this series here it's midnight people even though he has stuffed on that play he's already gained 97 yards on the in Laurinaitis stops it if you have such an advantage with field position this is a great indication of that you can see that Ohio State up much of this game has been pinned back deep in their own territory way it gives you such flexibility as a play caller especially when you're controlling things for the most part of the line of scrimmage to attack and typically when you see USC attack it's on first down illegal motion on the offense number eight that tenant lisa kline second down usually on first set when they try to get it downfield that was a Ronald Johnson and he's over there on the sidelines with hazel the wide receiver coach head coach Pete Carroll eighth year here at USC second down and ten but Billy the fullback he scored the game's first touchdown will leave block on the toss play there is McKnight making his way past a hundred yards still on his feet and showing you why he is one of the more dangerous breakaway threats in the country his Joe McKnight think he's playing a video game anyone what kind of moves the 1/4 NCAA 2009 in a little was it the circle button little jump hop twist turn got 11 white jerseys trying to keep up with it it needs a new Reggie Bush bogey does it remind you just a little bit of a bush when he was here with the produce has to fill out a little bit he's that great hop in speed miss Johnson going back in motion here's a third into right ahead with Abby Lee founding it of the firstdown powerful run by the vleague here's mcknight kirk he has been all over the field tonight you mentioned rantings over a hundred 100 yards in 105 right now he caught the ball they motioned him they just want to continue to move him around to make the defense get into a bit of a guessing game that's the whole reason you see the movement and because of his birth facility he not only the great running back he can slip out he has a great feel as a wide receiver then they can put him in a lineup together with the other backs like Gable and Stephane Johnson step on Johnson stepping into the middle and he picks up nine more yards for this Virginia Tech let's go to Matt Winer in New York for an update back all right Thank You Brent time for a Verizon Wireless update an SVT knockdowndragout in Starkville 32 game Bulldogs trying to get back into and Wesley Carroll looking deep intercepted by Walter McFadden Auburn held the Bulldogs to a 160 total yards meanwhile Oklahoma wrapping up a blowout win and Washington Sam Bradford at five touchdowns and here Matt Stephon Johnson being stretched out and a penalty flag thrown back at the 16 yard line hold on the offense number 68 at the 13th penalty of the night game second down which Lewis at a Denver Colorado with sophomore C offensive line now they picked about it but they've done a good job butch Lewis is the right tackle never there at right guard Christopher O'Dowd played a lot last year Jeff Byers and Charles Brown a big left about to comment from Ray mal luga the allamerican linebacker from USC after the Virginia came was very unique continue we kind of thought they'd be the weakness this year against Virginia Tech stepped up and for spring food we're safe tonight very solid effort I was young hopeful and I served as a police officer as another like start on the offense number 45 Italy listen second down now there should be something for the little bit here I'm 21 3 after trailing in the game by a field goal and coach Carroll over there lobbying on this on that sideline Ohio State plays more mantoman down people in territory know that Steve Sarkisian feels he can find some matchups to try to get the ball thrown down into the info we may get down here I'm going to suck it down one of you a Cinnabon costing 25 yard line and this would be a third down they need to get to the 14 yard line for a first intent to keep in mind in the second half we talk coming into this broadcast at Ohio State because of their effort against Florida in the big stage in a championship game two years ago and last year against LSU and now tonight against USC a lot of fans want to see Powell hioh State this year can stack up with the elite teams in college football they're playing for a lot more here than just trying to get back into this football game in the second half some down linemen on this rush Sanchez Middleton plate touchdown USC strikes with Williams in the middle the transfer from Arkansas there is the big difference as far as I can tell with this USB this year they can get the ball down the field and that's 24 yards on third and 10 and that percent Chas his third touchdown pass of the night and as he off to a great start this season Kirk because you go back to that opener he threw three TDs against Virginia so he's now got six on the year and that was a lane turn he got back in rhythm made it perfectly and was in perfect timing with his favorite target Damian Williams is the route on at the Coliseum will the Buckeyes battle back will we see more of the young freshmen well the yellow flag stop flying we'll find out there's a big night for traveling now it's up and down that field after the after the touchdowns you know the Trojans loss to Penn State back in 96 but since then they've gone seven and oh well on their way here and in those eight games they've outscored the Big Ten 296th and 94 sevengame winning streak Youth the Big Bend juggled at the goal line and here on out schools on the 20yard line and let's go back to the score per breath you talked a lot about trying to get the ball down field and you're going to see that right here from Damien Williams where he flips a seam right here and when you split a seam like that that ball has to be thrown between defenders it has to be thrown on a line watch Mark Sanchez put this ball on a line and the timing was perfect with Damien Williams but you can't hang that ball up in the air you've got to have the arm strength right there to be able to freeze it in between a linebacker and a safety great throw and a good great timing there between Sanchez and Williams like them snaps it off right clap they have about three yards on the blood Williams has his first USC touchdown catches we check in with our French is Jani by the OSU sideline you know when the defense came back despite the fact they've given up 28 points they got a very tight huddle they were all jacked up getting all over each other but when the offense was over on the sidelines before they headed on the field it was almost like they were lethargic no one was sitting by each other they really looked as almost people defeat it I mean no one talked they were just sitting there by themselves not saying words listen with a can opener on a second and six and it is same you picks up the first down and look at how many coaches the plunders were pulling him down including Bryan pushing Aaron I think the reason you're sensing that is because of what this team and his program has been through over the course of the last two or three years I think they felt much like they did going into the LSU game last year this time it's going to be different and it wasn't against LSU and then here they had eight or nine months to get ready this one's going to be different and they're down 28 to 3 think the tails between their legs youngster in it for them and short of the line of scrimmage embezzled arrogant numbered minute he's played a well in the game and so Beckman coming back and there are the Buckeyes twenty two and two in the pick ten but against the SEC they've lost two championship games and its Notre Dame and the other VCS conferences four and one and of course these two teams might have met a year ago in a Rose Bowl ad the Missouri or West Virginia had one last week the regulan see that they would have played a second week WT Nigeria West Virginia and throwing it away with the left hand there's the penalty flag that could be intentionally grounded in pile or forced that penalty they might not be up see here now is going to be a pencil rounding number 17 in the author friendly places involved the koala pal bosses down assistance the first half that when Todd Beckman's in the game USC has no concerns about Ohio State skilled a pin their ears back and they attack Todd Beckman every single time they see him back there the only thing that slows them down as Mark Sanchez excited looking up at the video board the only thing is closing down its when terrelle pryor is in the game hearing Beckman again on third and long probably to see a brawl and screen let's see what USC does when they see him back again under center in such a way but he cannot escape we rushed by Everson Griffin the sophomore from Arizona 93 and he too has a great upside and Beckman is now starting to feel the pain from this projym defense it's men and boys right now in the trenches between the Ohio State offensive line and USBs defense they know what's coming they're able to be aggressive and again a tack Todd Beckman terrelle pryor wants to be out of that field helping his team is becoming frustrated obviously with way the results of this football game have gone so far the return man for the protein such as car as well as night has gone out falls out of bounds and for an update let's go to Matt Winer in New York all right Brent I've gotten nominees within eight the MPS being allamerica Player of the Week and you get more than one when you put up 69 points if Missouri did chase Damon became the Tigers alltime leading passer and four touchdown passes three caught by Jeremy Maclin racked up 172 yards cast your vote by texting goat two five one two three four near a TV wireless telephone I'm at Mark Sanchez and the Trojans looking for more throws tin to heavily mealy I should say at that point on tuition right let us check in with with our Lisa down below well Brent after that last touchdown Mark Sanchez came to the bench and he went to everyone on offense each skill player everyone on the offensive line and he said the same consensus this painted we are not done Brandon you know at least I think the the energy that he has has been talked about a lot but I said what I know he has the energy that they said the fact he came in with mal livid and Brian Cushing they all want him to succeed and gable picks up another first no we're talking about Mark Sanchez as a starter coming in here as a starting quarterback member John David booty Delton injury 3 &amp; 1 is the starting quarterback lost only to Oregon there was this first touchdown pass to me lay in and then off a play fake he's got his freshman tight end and finally Williams and that's his first touchdown pass reception as a Trojan he had to Kirk with the Arkansas sent out last year after he transferred of course he came here with the valley who Mitch Mustain who was one of the backup quarterbacks for USC the game experience that Mark Sanchez was able to receive last year with the injury to John David booty invaluable for the 2008 season you're seeing the confidence that he's playing with dropping it off now to Bradford Allen Bradford he's number poor on the tailback list and he's got talent he's one of the young men who played the role of terrelle pryor in practice roughing the penalty first number 115 Arthur Miller at the end of the play first down frustratin yep I'm sorry frustration setting in on Ohio State's defense Marcus Freeman getting to Sanchez but a second or two late give him a little shove there at the end of the play and there's the fourth string tailback for the fighting for the Trojans a minute Roy Allen Bradford picks up the ball he picks up momentum 230 pounds running downhill in that red zone after the penalty fall at the 17yard line roads have been very efficient going in that's a way is a wideopen is Williams his second touchdown catch of the night and somebody blew that coverage they was all alone Ginobili folks realize oh well designed play Brent he's on the inside it's mantoman it's a little bit of a rubber out and it confuses Ohio State it puts Damian Williams all by himself in the end zone and he vitro and well executed by this Trojan offense and Dirk I think you'll see Johnson it could walk come on that is dealer edge on still another extra point let's take another look at this because the play it looks like they've been waiting for right here and then right down the end zone look at the confusion with the Ohio State and secondary watch the mantoman coverage Damian Williams routes to the outside confusion pressure on a pressure on the reporter back Mark Sanchez but he had his man all alone watch Johnson yep great block right by Johnson there Maronite us gifts there a little bit late check well that's nice pick survive is a beautiful pick by Patrick Turner you no wonder there was nobody over there you couldn't pick somebody any better than that yo traveler you going to take that that's illegal my friend only if they call it just kidding Prowler don't take a person entirely people travel and one not as pirate is that Dave beat my old Frontera parser yeah I'll tell you that era said I get so tired of seeing that horse run practice football Pierre going to be a good one Mark Sanchez is answering a lot of your questions tonight folks those of you who wondered by the Trojans really this good did they beat much in Virginia Richmond Virginia trouble well I think you're seeing tonight this is a pretty pretty good foot broken come out of the 20yard line 94,000 on handed and I about 7:45 along the Pacific that great scene those great aerial shots pretty to our friends at Outback Steakhouse proud sponsor the Outback Bowl it's over in Tampa with bloomin onion one airship and favorite every week from ABC ESPN college football broadcast and here's what the Trojans have got their eye on right here folks coach's trophy give it away in the BCS National Championship game they'll play that down in Miami Florida shoes representatives of that great Bowl game are here tonight watching we will see how it all unfolds a lot of snaps I never know in this game it and he flown down by pershing bigtime linebacker let's go to Matt for SportsCenter right now man hi friends for center right now presented by Vizio the Ravens texans game first postpones of Monday to now been rescheduled for November 9th due to damage to Reliant Stadium from Hurricane Ike and no baseball in Houston this weekend either Major League Baseball's with two of the weekend schedule pumped Astros game to Milwaukee will be played tomorrow and Monday afternoon so the Astros for the home game in Milwaukee if you cook fans there and there's maurice wells on that pitch had no relation by the way those of you who are wondering to the injured beanie wells what is UFC defense like a feeding frenzy right now they are attacking down hill against the Ohio State offensive line now a middle third down if he Carroll like to get pressure with four bring pressures got fire in here this time to try to contain and make him cut up inside the different and that his mole in fire finds an ally but it doesn't get much out of it more great authorities defensively again for the third fire I wanted to throw the football but if they outstanding job coming off from the right now Louie gets picked up by Ballard but right there Josh Pinker 36 horses terrelle pryor to cut back in to where the rest of the defense is instead of allowing him to use his speed to the outside he has Hartline wide open breaking second in that zone out right the omens guilherme Houston that okay I'm telling you right now that's more than part of being a true freshman it 50 fizzle you're just trying to survive well the third quarter coming to an end USC dominating ESPN Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines will return after this message and a word from our ABC stations Wow hopes I can tell you that Rafer Johnson did not lie to this that cauldron a couple of Olympic Games have been here in this Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 1932 and 1984 here the Trojans dominating another Big Ten team fair catch it's a 31 by Brandon Carswell who in fact returning punts and that's where Sanchez will put it back in play Santa has had four touchdown passes and one interception here tonight so number six his father Nick who attends most of the practices his father was a fireman but not just any kind of apartment he is on call for FEMA for any kind of a tragedy that breaks out or severe fires and he's on high alert if they need him down in the Texas area because of Hurricane Ike so that there were some fires that were burning down in there and so he could be yanked out at any time so here's young Mark Sanchez now makes a beautiful toss drops it back off to Bobby Lee and the Buckeyes were certainly not fooled on that play at all as Malcolm Jenkins opportunities there 35 to 3 starting the fourth quarter again all the buildup and hype about Ohio State in the previous years in the big stage now out here if Ohio State going in this fourth quarter thinks the first three quarters have gone bad wait wait until they get a feel for the fourth quarter here if they shut it down emotionally if they start to feel sorry for themselves this one can just keep getting worse and worse to this I change if you exceed ocular counting for the 39 yard line nor should that I am me I was Chuck a little bit with some coach think somebody's trying to run a spread up your jobs to stop them that's what you're paid to do that means have a tough night and as will I think any quarterback who plays against this defense SEC may have a couple of defenses that can know that can compare with this one but I don't know many off the top of my head this virtual defense over there resting right now before they came back in and now they've got an offense at the march down the field Sanchez fires and the receiver was knocked down on that played Williams went down they wanted a flag over there on that side look at Pete Carroll he going to be hostile against about this one science a replace of it he feels the defender hold on Damien wages his faith master and from top of his helmet there is a new replay screen here there it is high above the stadium that people have been watching replays including the players there's the Trojans of course the punting that'd be a fair catch at the 25yard line well Buckeyes are without a touchdown they've got only a field goal and they've given up 35 we'll be right back first and ten from the 25 yard line for Todd Beckman in the ohio state buckeyes Cushing number 10 is coming got a shot at him Beckman have to get off intercepted Ellison right there picking it off at the 34 yard line you saw the Blitz coming somebody's got to pick up the Blitzer come on Kahn Beckman has thrown a few of these balls that he throws before he's even looking because of the pressure he throws it to a spot and Kevin Ellison was fooled maybe a couple plays earlier but this time reacting perfectly and instead of defending hardline he was going back to that spot expecting hardline to try to get there but of course he beats in there and the pressure all about Brian Cushing getting there and it's a good prolife Carroll to get that pressure with the blimp now on first and 10 here's Bradford again and how about a look Kirk at the Pacific Life game summary Toby game summary goes like this pressure pressure and more pressure especially the continent has been back there now I think in fact three times it feels like 8 or 9 because when Beckman comes back he's made for the sake this is the biggest rain mouth noodles the interception just kind of opened up the floodgates and him more fence as that a second half stepped up and got and gotten into sync with his group of wide receivers so now I've got a question for you on that of the cosplayer gable the way he has played would you make Mark Sanchez a solid early Heisman Trophy Canada well USC the only team that can beat UNC is us to on their schedule they're going to have a week or two they might struggle but everybody in the pac10 comes here so listen up straight answer the questions the answer is yeah ok I got it down thank you very you know where you are gone which I think they're going to win all their games so if you win all your games somebody on your team good Heisman candidate good marks tension very much mark sands is going to be one of the front let's put it this way we'll see in New York smells great started really the short handoff to the fullback and all he does is pick up a first in certainly reminders stating that to the game for your late local news couple very important story to cross the country come on mostly the ABC station then on ESPN for those of you who haven't gotten all the scores a highlight support centers will have post game analysis as well as today's scores and highlights and the analysis will be USC was very very good and Ohio State has been bad there's not a way to put it looking around and all his skill a lot of its young but where the skill was from Patrick Turner from Tennessee Tennessee Damian Williams from Arkansas McKnight from Louisiana Abby Lee from Utah Kaiser turn from New York City or from all over the country Sanchez can't find somebody open so he shoveled it off and underneath the gaggle and Buckeyes are able to stop it whole thing but this tells you why his teammates love him he clipped the ball instead of running it himself and instead of just pulling back and kind of coasting this kind of thumbs up the attitude he flips it and then he's going to get downfield he's going to take on James Laurinaitis when the players see that in the film room tomorrow or on Monday his his rating in appreciation will go even further through the roof the players love to play for Mark Sanchez for the Mexican American community really they're like Mark Sanchez or Southern California youngster carries himself awfully well fires deflected incomplete Williams has already compared here today he was going back this is the combination that could develop I think as the season goes on Ethan Williams according to his father Sanchez his father would even spend a lot of time over to Sanchez household and the two are developing a bond this is a very very close friend and you know how that goes to the quarterback event and a wipe you see how we've hit the Nike 11 elite quarterback camp in Southern California and Mark Sanchez is one of the counselors and one of the days they had a little bit of downtime he had some of the USC players the Damian Williams would one of them just kind of hanging out and the camaraderie I think is all controllers records short of that person 10sc back inside the redzone of course fans going to go for it looks like they will or down here is that during sex that student body came about through two and a half hours fires the start of this game because they've got Oh seats over there in the student section was the first come basis and here we go can they pick up this burst Johnson is going back if the tape sanchez freeman's closed it in any socks and back Athene 29 yard line so Freeman in hot pursuit was able to track him down and make the play the Buckeyes take over on down Freeman showing you some speed in the backside with my gloves Holman might make complain a bit Marcus Freeman coming from the back time to take down more expansion time speed for that linebacker Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by Southwest Airlines low fares no hidden fee dodge introducing the allnew Dodge Journey if you can dream it do it Dodge grab life and college gameday is built by Home Depot you can do it we can help with Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines next week will be in Tempe Arizona it will be Georgia and Arizona State here deny another pac10 team USC beating up on Ohio State 35 to three freshmen terrelle pryor starts to shovel it down the field of being complete as we take a look at the ESPNU Allstate standings review and let me bring in here what we make of this USC I think that solidifies their spot up if one Georgia a bit of a struggle as you mentioned that Brent over in Colombia against the Gamecocks that they're able to escape Oklahoma's league is really been making some statements you look at Florida they're not playing go to Tennessee we'll find out about them next week Missouri is the team that I'm really intrigued as the season continues to go on and on how good can this Missouri Tigers team dinner they ready to challenge the big boy issue I think there's no question the shd is still number one but the big 12 now means solidly in the second place when you think about the strength of the conference's around the country because for sure Missouri will jump Ohio State the way things look and put 69 if this was up on the Nevada here today and chase Daniel the Macklin might be one of the best has combination to come play game offense fiveyard penalty we knew that combination would be lethal but when they they have so many more weapons which allows Macklin to go out and get some oneonone opportunities I mean you leave Malone nobody can cover in shape Daniel he's like a computer that with the read that he makes even throws that he's making right now play with a lot of confidence well let's take a look here at number two represents the future well fire takes a deep drop in underneath the hair and this would be well short of the first down Kirk I'm going to take a look here at the Big Ten Conference and what they did today and a big one under way up the up the coast in Fresno they're just underway the Badgers strike first their double overtime Oregon rallies against Purdue Michigan State wins and rainstorm Iowa Penn State teaming print to watch out for the Penn State Nittany Lions despite all of the distractions off the field his team with the old Ferrell Clark and it's the talent that's grown up around him for neither player good football right now to turn honorably looking for Paul Russell number one I think doesn't want to call a timeout before the third and nine so we'll take a break 8:37 USC's solidly in control against Ohio State the largest crowd to watch a USC game since 1999 against UCLA 93,000 607 that's the official count and all the celebs who got the sideline passes terrelle pryor and a footrace is short of the first down marker Josh Pinkert forced him out of bounds and tankards been playing tonight remember they they will not know the status of right yet so they give him Pinkerton was injured last year and he's a veteran corner he was able to come in and turn in a lot of snaps today play a little Nick along the way he's had plenty of injuries in himself that he's had to overcome and he good to see he's been able to fight back and come back and be able to be on the field his senior year gives him good death it's probably the best depth that Pete Carroll has been able to enjoy on the defensive side of the ball since he's been a head coach here I think another time I was getting burned so that would indicate that they might be going for here my fourth and to the punty my think was moving out racer Hill and now Pete brings his defense over there and I guess when you're down 35 3 with 8 minutes to go you know why not what he got given the ruse on we've talked what do you think about your talk had a break and we're sitting 35 to 3 another embarrassing loss for Ohio State on a big stage against an elite opponent it almost looks like the varsity against the junior varsity tonight and in my opinion you start to think about how much more the season is to go and is Todd Beckman going to be the quarterback next week with Ohio State plays Troy or they go back and try to say hey we're going to continue to plan both are they played throughout prior so peso filled it at the 26yard line by cars well he's across from 35 yard line I believe there is a penalty flag down you can see it right there a little push in the back is that that preliminary 18 penalty third block in the bag by number 43 on the return team the 10yard penalty first down the drama the romance is the season premiere that you've been waiting for why is Anatomy returns a 2hour television event Thursday September 25th at 9/8 FS 9 o'clock back in the Herbstreit household on ABC hey how the twins they saw the way they're here they're here like another one again look at a red eye back home the ones once said to me Ohio State was going to win it and so I so I asked his brother I said now what do you think oh you know what and he said I'm not so sure he was he was the size confident that the Buckeyes could beat these guys think there's you know fans and shut up for their jerseys and I got to hang in there and I'm gonna get on the suede and long white hole there will be both carriers Bradford sing up now we've talked about the big 10 was not a better day either for the fact that you look like Oklahoma did the Oregon didn't come back and double overtime in Purdue win that game Marilyn California wakeup call about halfway through that game Oregon State a win Arizona State not from an away from UNLV yet but look what BYU did you see LA I mean that was huge in that game and New Mexico could be a beating Arizona too so they can't act in not a real banner weekend as Bradford it's the 31 by my opinion and we thought that maybe Oregon or maybe Cal maybe Mark Sanchez his night is done but we thought maybe he pushed us he going only there you always want to see somebody push USC because they just dominated this conference planned this way if I'm watching this game and I'm in the SEC I hope people nationally are looking and watching UFC and gaining more respect for who they are because they're going to be standing there at the end to the matter of if they don't selfdestruct who's going to match up with you and see in the championship this is Erin core a Frenchman for me Villa Park California who basically has beat out Mitch Mustain for the backup job dropping the Bradford in Bradford's rights out they are very high on Corp purpose 64 195 pounds and that's a 12yard gain as he looks over to the sidelines for Steve sarkeesian's play so I was wondering Mitch Mustaine who transferred from Arkansas of all the schools just select have USC Saudi but remember you don't have to start at USC I start on Gannett over that now you're right showing pressure Radford patiently to midfield Jason Amara is the modernday NYPD detective Sam Tyler own hurdle back to the tumultuous times of 1973 New York City's alright capita or ontime life on Mars series premiere Thursday October night the 10:9 says right after the all new Grey's Anatomy began for the final five minutes here there's mark Tyler Wendell Tyler's son is now in as the tailback another very Valley who claws back he's number five on that tailback roster we've talked a lot about this offensive line how young they are they feel that number 70 a true freshman hi Ron Smith who only weighs 270 pounds coming in as a freshman and eventually get up to 290 maybe 295 pounds look at his bill he will be the next dominant offensive lineman at USC as this year rolls on and he gets a little bit more acclimated to this game you're going to see him not only had depth but he's going to be pushing for playing times the UFC's offenses he put looking offensive linemen you see you right on the target that it was broken up beautifully that time by Coleman Goodman was the intended target that time portal Sanchez take that knee brace off medical staff will check it I'm a couple times you can kill him and give any stage before the cameras give you a safe ride let this really roll like a group supers what about disappoint to your my the auctions Saturday Night Football on EBC George Arizona State next week folks well the USC with a big one here tonight and interesting note that Alabama bounceback 417 we had them against Clemson with a big where they were a bit sluggish last week but if you're denied and turn them loose again down first down and ten now real Pryor and herby as we watch him and they pitch out and it was a beauty they run the option for nine yards that time and what we get to my question the great aerial shots courtesy of our friends at Outback Steakhouse proud sponsor the Outback Bowl the bloomin onion 1 airship fanfavorite ivory we from ABC ESPN college football podcast but look ahead a little bit for me and on what this means to specifically the Buckeye offense will we see more of terrelle pryor in the ensuing weeks if they get into conference play lesson young veteran what way the true you think this is going to take and he's they ganged up on him si I think tonight Thrall priors gave Ohio State a chance to move the football because of his ability to improvise and get outside it kind of slowed down and neutralize their feelings in the first half but it's a big picture I think Jim Tressel stick with Tom Beckman I think he'll continue to sprinkle in terrell fryer and I think you'll see some kind of combination out it will be every other play but I think Beckman and Pryor will continue to rotate in my question it was so much coming into this year 20 returning starters off a team that has experienced a lot and also dealt with a lot of depression and those championship games to lose this game how does Jim Tressel circle the wagons and get his team back up get arrested a few picks up the fumble and throws a completion for a 1st and 10 so Terrell fire can create plays that's the one thing he could do it using race small for the first down he put the ball on the ground was able to pick it up and create a first night for one thing that a mobile quarterback can give you is sort of that the busted play look if you haven't seen a lot of it tonight but I've seen him throw the football very very well and the more confidence that he gets in throwing the football in these kind of situations and more that Jim Tressel hazard his ability to throw would just be a nice complement to his skill running small again across the 40yard line I really think that's the challenge for Jim Tressel so many veterans so much hope for this game to regain the credibility and what happened looks like a 35 to 3 loss on that big stage again going back to the Midwest with their tail between their legs embarrassed can he regroup and get them ready to still feel that they could have a successful even to a great game penalty we have a road trip from Madison tell me now anthem played rope whiskey was was covered Thomas was sitting over there they do have they get Penn State at home you mention how you think the Nittany Lions are going to be a force of the Big Ten and Purdue and Penn State are both are both there then that that tough trip to Wisconsin on October 4th I think going to manage Senate e12 going to Mystic state could be tough going to Illinois take on the Fighting Illini team that beat Ohio State a year ago could be tough at the Penn State game in Columbus force to go along with assigning who isn't winning the Big Ten in Corbin I think I made water view and you touched on this earlier is the Big Ten the Big Ten the last two years has been embarrassed you travel around the country get outside of the Midwest the Big Ten is kind of become a punchline to people around the country when they talk about how overexposed and overhyped and a bit of a fraud the conference is overall the team captain of that of course to the Ohio State because of the last two national titles or what happens tonight 35 3 mashing loss to USC it puts the big 10 as much of the work for hire Carswell puts it down and wraps it up on the ground the 14 yard line now the Trojans let's talk about their schedule because I think it's made for a drive to Miami they've got Ohio State here W Oregon Arizona State California were ranked coming into the way California Fall Out Washington Notre Dame all here on a road now Oregon State Washington State Arizona Stanford they will be a favorite a big favorite and every one of those Road couple touchdowns easily but let's just say this they always have one game in conference play the last three years think about the game Stanford last year when they were supposed to dominate the Cardinal here and lost Oregon State a couple years of the Corvallis and lost UCLA couple of two or three years ago and walkers all the FIFA teams in conference seem to play USC obviously much better than the nonconference because they're more used to seeing their scheme is there a team like that this year who can challenge yet see if they have that off week that they again they've had the last three weeks for the last three years coaches have start to celebrate final minute Mitch Mustain is the mopup man right now so you'll take a look at the Arkansas transfer ended as I've reported time after time no one runs a practice quite like Pete Carroll you would think that he is one of the players and not the coach he's out there he's part of the team he's a quarterback he works against the linebackers and the defensive backs he comes down the field during kickoff coverage kickoff grilles spend a lot of time with the defense let's Steve Sarkisian runs that offense it's far different the way he operates a program anybody else were around and just because he smiles and coaching out in Southern California doesn't mean that he doesn't have discipline doesn't mean that he doesn't do a great job of affecting the people who come suitors program a thirty two point victory 38 total and the Jim Council has to be a little bit depressed as he heads off to the locker room there are the two great linebackers how about that seam right there folks Wow what a picture let's get out to Lisa with with the hero a baby thanks mark one big play after another how is your offense able to go thoroughly hurt Floyd their defense you know like you said the big plays really helped us tonight it was a testament to our offensive line privilege another game in a row you know they did it at Virginia they did it at home the receivers making big time tested the offensive game plan going into this this matchup I felt like we'd played this game a million times already we've gone over everything in fact regiment and things look great was all clear when you guys got a 28 to 3 you went to your guys who said that in it we are not done why was that not enough we wanted to this is a dangerous team a highly ranked dangerous team from the big 10 a tough team and we knew that if we let them linger around at 28 degree they can come back and make this a game I still think we left some plays out there that we weren't a hundred percent tonight it I don't think we fired on all cylinders there's there's a couple plays don't want back but the score looks today and what they say I know you're going to say you're fine but we saw D 11 out there what's up with the knee oh no it's good it's all good the cautionary and I'll be ready for where we got a game in two weeks against Oregon say so when you look up at that score 35 to 3 what statement does that make oh that means a lot for us that proves a lot to our team you know the defense keep holding them to three points that's that's something in itself they're a great group and you know we're very well prepared that assessments are closer thanks a lot congratulations bright all right and he's one of our Chevrolet players at this game Mark Sanchez doing an excellent job as the triggerman and Tim date Chuck wah showed us a little of that corner he had that interception of the end zone broke up another pass and also had a tackle but he was a very good cover man and kirk your final thoughts here you've got to go all the way back to 1989 the last time Ohio State lost the regularseason game this badly and that score was forty two to three to this team right here USC so it's about regrouping for Ohio State and it's about not getting ahead of yourself for USC and trying to make a run to the championship fight on Trojans when it's thirty five three and a reminder now next Saturday will be in Tempe for Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by stuff was there live number two Georgia will take on number 15 Arizona State 8:00 eastern time on ABC so for Erin Andrews releases office at Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger saying so long for the Los Angeles Coliseum thanks for watching
