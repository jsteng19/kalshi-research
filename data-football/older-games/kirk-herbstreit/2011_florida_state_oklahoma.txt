============================================================

Seminoles tonight he faces the number one team in the nation the Oklahoma Sooners they're led by the Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback the Landry Jones and the Seminole nation is ready to rock the world here tonight over the past 40 years Oklahoma and Florida State have swung the full spectrum of success both experiencing seasons of great triumphs through the 1970s and 80s the Sooners ran roughshod on their way to four national titles the 90s they belong to Bobby Bowden's runnin and gunnin Seminoles but it was the defensive battle of the 2001 BCS championship that put an end to their reign now in front of the first alive crowd in Tallahassee in two years number five Florida State looks to regain the swagger of Seminoles past the Sooners and their uptempo offense will try to push the pace and impose their will as the number one team in the land number one Oklahoma number five Florida State welcome to Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines you are looking live at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee Florida the Oklahoma Sooners the number one team will land invade Seminole territory in an effort to clear the path for the BCS Championship large and good news for sooner fans their leader on defense Thomas Lewis has been cleared to go we expected to start but Kirk Herbstreit you're telling me that the Knowles big pond will be the suitors offense well last year it was a huge problem Landry Jones and the Oklahoma Sooners really attacked a very young Florida State defense we've talked to you and I've called a lot of Oklahoma games obviously the hurry up is a big part of their office they create tempo and they force the defense to get lined up and to be able to communicate you can see that Oklahoma's dialed in they look over they get the call Andrew Jones is able to communicate that at home very easily and then before it or the state can adjust to get ready Oklahoma snaps to football Florida State still trying to figure out where where the Oklahoma players are aligned and next thing you know there's a time of tight in flipping behind coverage for a timeout for a touchdown on the road this time in front of this crowd border state hopes the communication will be much tougher for Landry Jones and they'll see if they can change up their looks to try to slow down this Oklahoma off every does the public understand how good Jones is becoming quarterback well he really finished the year last year I think taking command to the offense and really showing that it is now his team Sam Bradford is gone in the NFL Landry Jones is one of the calmest coolest most collected quarterbacks you'll find and that will be tested tonight as he brings the number one ranked team in the country into a very hostile environment here is ou Campbell and a young man we can't wait to see Izzy manual the quarterback of the Seminoles he says he's ready we're about to find out and now Switchfoot stadium singles are courses from their new album vice verses when the arrival of the Florida State Seminoles before a sellout crowd in Tallahassee and the number one team in the nation will oppose the Oklahoma Sooners this has been the Nissan frigate watching the SEC on ESPN from Tallahassee it's one of the grand openings of a night game for Florida State Osceola aboard renegade game on Jimbo Fisher is down below with our Tom Rinaldi let's go to Talk alongside Jimbo Fisher Jimbo you talked about what an opportunity that could be what a building block how do you know what convinces you you're ready and I look at our kids designs they're ready they're they're quick they're not they're not in a hurry their minds are going right they're thinking and they're looking around when they walked out that tunnel now that locker room that's good luck to you Jimbo let's go to Erin Andrews on the other side all right tom thanks so much coach let me ask you so much has been made of this team tonight what's key for your team in overcoming challenges that an atmosphere like this prevent well you know it's a long night three and a half hours of ball hopefully you start off all right but if you don't you got a weather the storm and keep going great era thank you very much the suitors will handle the ball first and the nose defer and there is Bob's younger brother at markridge the defensive coordinator who hopes to have a much better night that his defense had last year enormous 80,000 on hand try Frank's and Brennan play will be back teeth returned a kickoff for the number one Thurston Hopkins sends a low line drive to the back of the end zone and play pranks they take an evil come out of the 40yard line and so here comes junior quarterback Landry Jones herby he's on target to break every passing record ever established at Norman and he's got some good names he's going fast well there's no doubt about it thirty of forty 380 yards and four touchdowns last year against his seminal defense but that was in Norman as we've seen with his uptempo offense a little bit comforting execute when you're dealing with the crowd in a defense it spinning at their back what's the sort of state to try to change up their looks tonight so try to confuse Landry Jones in that also join play will open as the money guys sooner fans know they'll rotate three or four at that tailback position up under center Millard the fullback eight back look they throw on first down to the outside Kenny Stills who did not play in the game against Tulsa he had been suspended because of a DUI during the offseason but Kenny Stills one of the great weapons for Oklahoma is back he's number four and here come the Sooners again this is what we all wanted to see his Florida State going to be able to get lined up in position and ready to go now clay works for the first down out to the 39 yard line LaMarcus Joyner the free safety makes the stop for the nose at the 13 yard game great execution up front the offensive line really trying to set the tone here early to try to get a push that's not creating a nice thing confidence in the offensive line they spread everybody wide empty the backfield lit it out to the right and Ryan Broyles with his first catch of the night against Tulsa 14 catches 158 yards certain allamerican and a leading candidate for the political war because the coaches always talk about leverage leverage means keep the ball in a position where the rest of the defense can come and Corral the ball carrier the receiver that time nice job I so the state is saying outside given the rest of the defense second down and seven there's the pistol formation quarterback still closer to the center of the tailback right behind him quick throw to that screen pass outside Royals could not get the first down the nose hold and force a third down Horton State has a player down it was interesting there Brent I don't know if we could see this but Greg Reed looked like he was actually able to come off the field and then to slow things down maybe he looked over and actually don't onto the field and now of course it's a pivotal third down here early in his shame the Greg green looked like he was ready to come off of the field and then he's kind of been on attack oh he's right there lowers the head makes the play on Ryan Broyles what was those left leg oh yeah he looks like he was going to try to hobble off but they've really instructed their players don't limp off if you have an injury just go down well milord is in the Oklahoma bobak H back and they split him out to the right if it third down and two now they bring it in motion drink to the left they run play in that direction for a first down and frame Hillary leading the way so the pull back the 255 pounder from Columbia Missouri lettuce that way the changeup that I've seen here in the first few snaps from Florida State and Mark Stoops and odd front three down linemen they typically played with for which what happened did Brandon Jacobs maybe the best pass rusher in the country of time playing out in space come back to hand it off to Miller at that time as a lead blocker he earned an opportunity to carry the ball that time this is a young man who wants to play fullback at the next level and he could do a lot of things before the nights over the Sooners will throw a pass or two to it he now is flit way out to the right he is over though he's a fullback in H back to tied in and like you say he'll line up at wide receiver then haver in the center and that veteran offensive line we'll protect Landry Jones he's all alone on this second down Knowles can't get to him and he throws to Broyles for a first down at the 36 yard line and Landry's Jersey remains clean here in the early going and that's a big key for Oklahoma it's an option route for for boils and a thing that boils does such a good job on the inside is he's able to find space I don't think there's another receiver in the country it has an ability to create and find space against a zone the way lands that way Landry Jones with Brian Broyles could do that that was a big pickup of a first down Andre Jones perfect here in the early going her before of for 25 yards and back off to play as they pound behind the middle nightmare Hebert and Evans they're going to need enough from their running game people get so caught up in Oklahoma and their tempo and Landry Jones in two quick passes in the rhythm that he tries to get into but a great Oklahoma offense the one we saw a couple years ago had the ability to control the line of scrimmage to get physical in fact that was an area of emphasis and you all see now Brittany's play the sophomore from San Diego reaches out for another first down Christian Jones makes the top of the nose even though that was a delayed hurry up once Lantry Jones got the call he quickly got under center in his Florida State defenders have been out there for nine plays now Oklahoma methodically just moving the ball down the field Dominic Whaley who lit up Tulsa with four touchdowns the walkon is quite a story number eight is now the running back for the Sooners he's the second money back news here tonight first down at the no 45 Whaley's first carry of the knife can he get the edge he does still on his feet across into the redzone the 19 yard line what a story this young man from Lawton Oklahoma is was not a blue chip are coming out of high school I had a real good runny back ahead of him went to school still was at number one left football came back Sooners gave him a chance and whoever you just can't say enough about what the young man has done Bob Stoops just raves about Whalen and the fact that he is such an athlete he put on 20 pounds he's stronger knowing that when camp started I think a lot of Sooners fans expected Brennan play Roy Finch and Brandon Williams to be the guy I Prix free the boil close reaches for another first down Terence parks a safety makes the stop Royals it's not four balls already are but not only that just a little thing but the recognition and the downand distance by royal the veteran receiver and he's really been doing this now for years but a short quick pass like that he knows where the first down marker extends the ball across there just to make sure he picked up the first down Rory Finch on the field and there seem to be some confusion now they'll signal the play in from the sidelines so Finch and Whaley faces a fine receiver Whaley is right behind Lander dollars two on that clock he's got a hurry to get it off and they burn a timeout so with the seconds winding down in the play clock Oklahoma uses its first timeout we'll be right back Thirteenth play of Oklahoma is opening drive coming up it is Herbie told you a year ago in Norman they scored a touchdown with their first four possessions in early universe ocking this is such an important rhyme but all the buildup in the highs about maybe this year being different this is not how close the state wants to again they go back to a power I would play and he was stopped around the 10yard line check that that was way late number eight that was not play that is they left Whaley in at the tailback and execution in the red zone is always important but when you go up against this often it's particularly important because you're going to give up yards between the 20 it's one Oklahoma does in the red zone this department is you endo stopping and holding in the field having a chance to win this thing the nose show man if you can see on your screen see the corners buttoned up on the white house second down straight ahead reaching for the end zone very very close that is it certainly a first down and Whaley almost stuck it in again he's becoming a touchdown maker let's take another look around what a good push again this offensive line is impressive Miller gets in there to pull back and lead the way good effort by Whaley want to maybe get another look to see if he extended it across the goal line but Brent the thing is standing out to me right now that's different about Oklahoma it's the opening drive to this really the 2011 sea sing with all respect to Tulsa is the way this offensive line is coming off the football the Sooners did not have that ability they had to rely always on Landry Jones in the passing game I don't think he got it across the goal line I think he's about on the sixinch line and we have another injured player down at the 4 yard line for the no that's that's one of the big fellas get secondoldest McRae is to see him walking off it was the execution obviously with Landry Jones but 14 plays they've had nine runs and five passes and fourth Landry don't five four five on those passes a great balance right now six minutes gone on this opening drive one of the things that has to disappoint the Florida State coaches right now is in fact at the middle of their defense the tackles and the middle linebacker are not holding up Oklahoma has been able to dip in there they've used the pass yes on the edges but they've gone to the middle just like they do there and Landry goon sneaks that I believe across but let's waiting the official there's the touchdown signal fire the Lost Ark something Kirk Herbstreit used to do it Ohio State Hill quarterback so old cool but what it what it driving how important is that for Oklahoma number one ranking on the road this Florida State for Rio is their defense capable of stopping Landry Jones and the opening drive 15 plays 80 yards and a touchdown Thank You Jones extends that football cross against that touchdown in two if you now will see BJ Manuel in state can answer that and thin haver in the center has done some job here's Jimmy Stephens on for the extra point makes for the southern nothing score the crowd grows quiet in Tallahassee just what every cent would have when they scored on their first drive the crowd for the time being is out of it come on back and see what the Noles could do offensively Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines find our fares online only at southwest.com and the Droid Bionic meet from machines to rule all machines only at Verizon are you conquered and the nulls have to rally to back up their slogan here and Greg Reed is not going to return this kickoff place on the lefty we're toes down below instead Rashad Greene the talented freshman from Albany Georgia along with LaMarcus Joyner there is Rashad we'll see him as a wide receiver here tonight ball on the tee Patrick O'Hara kicks long field goals for the Sooners will pick us away then here comes tripped up at the 25yard line Tony Jefferson over there defensively and let's remind everybody that Sunday NFL countdown presented by IBM is on ESPN at 10:00 a.m. Eastern new start three hours the best of the business the host Chris Berman analyst Tom Jackson Keyshawn Johnson Mike Ditka Chris Carter NFL insiders provide all the news from stadiums around the league right up until the kickoff and so here's the young man we hoped we would see here tonight certainly sooner fans did Travis Lewis dr. B he makes such a difference he's the inspiration and leader of this defense many people thought he may miss the first four or five games it's big news to see him out on the field Ty Jones gets the first ball carry for the Dole's and Tom Ward the middle linebacker Florida State has got to be able to find some balance here they don't want to get behind schedule meeting second long and third and long and I think running the football and being able to try to sustain that line of scrimmage to be able to open up the playaction would be big tonight for EJ Manuel also Jay Manuel the great athlete obviously he's going to have to run the football tonight Noah's gonna have to create make complaints jack nicklaus to Boone's downs very happy his grandson Nicoli rejas checked in he's a tight end for Florida State you'll recognize him he doesn't wear any gloves he's number 35 and they put him down is one of the two types a Jay Manuel comes back fires and a first passes bleep to the outside ticked in II Shaw who has to step up with Bert read Aileen with an injured ankle well Kitty Shaw has tremendous quickness and this is really what I want to see tonight it's not just about EJ Manuel it's about his supporting past and with first read ailing guys like Kenny Shaw Jared Higgins Rodney Smith Greg dent even a freshman Rashad Greene are going to have to be able to get some separation that time outstanding route by Kenny Shaw to get open still two tight ends but they emptied the backfield EJ Manuel he's a very good runner and obviously Oklahoma is is aware of that as you are as a fan and they keep EJ right there in that pocket and he completes it outside and that is Jack Nicklaus grandson that is Nick O'Leary he's a freshman out of Palm Beach Gardens Florida comes out after making the catch Kirby that's unbelievable he doesn't wear any gloves I don't see many receivers or tight ends now I asked Jack what if I close when he plays golf yeah he wears a cloak well yeah yeah but he's kind of a throwback and Kripa tremendous athlete fits right in here in the element be able to be out on this field of the true freshman I think says a lot there's second down djay walks up make sure that everybody's on the same page right now Brian stork his Center here tonight there is the handoff the cheerily third down coming up well the impact players tonight for Florida State it's obviously Jay Manuel is going to have to make the plays and show tremendous poise Chris Thompson along with the host of running backs are going to have to be able to take some of the pressure off Manuel up front and Drew's a throw the left tackle watch him be able to try to go headtohead against Frank Frank Alexander which should be a great matchup and I said Rodney Smith big tall receiver they love to throw the football to him downfield in their vertical pass again there was right in his Reliford this is your third down and manuals going to have to convert some third downs here tonight from the pistol formation second effort he's got the first down close to midfield and it was Nick O'Leary his second catch of this game making an impact early look at Oklahoma's deep end they're dropping defensive tackles a defensive end good exotic look rushing three dropping eight try to create some confusion up front but O'Leary showing strength to get off the line of scrimmage and then shake the tackle attempt there by Tom Warrick the middle linebacker first down at denna Chris Thompson is in as the running back bleh fake manual steps up had a man wide open a knee over through it it'll be second down coming up and let us check in when I have Robert floors Robert what do you got pores hey Brent I've got six TVs going right now and I need every one of them here's a taste of what's going on in the ESPN networks Ohio State in Miami on ESPN and Navy and South Carolina a tight game in Columbia the home opener for the Gamecocks but Navy giving them all they can handle down just three early fourth quarter bridge there Robert it's tough when you play Navy early you know I'm talking they can dominate the clock with that offense in there yeah very tough to prepare to that offense in surprising the same holding South Carolina so far to 24 second down manual keeps it a beautiful fake still going make the quick move to the outside thanks it back oh they stay down to spend on it is and beautiful rug then you meet Virginia and Chevelle living is forced to make this up but at the 28yard game here's the design we're on and trying to get the read here on 21 Tom Ward watch him ride this out or takes the running back of course Thompson it opens it up for Manuel now you get an idea even for his size it's six five about 245 pounds he's got great acceleration gets upfield in a hurry the big boy running that quick break read there and notice they come my sideline he stepped out of bounds so they have moved the ball back to the 24 yard line first out in ten on that deep handoff and that's Chris Thompson he's the junior from Greenville Florida both these teams will use several tailback show tonight but obviously Hervey we see the difference between manual and Christian Ponder who was the fine quarterback here who's drafted the first drop at the Minnesota Vikings manual just a little more mobile when he showed it on that great run and anytime you have a quarterback back in college football in the shotgun with the ability to run it gives you an advantage with the numbers in that box area and Oklahomans can have to account for that which can open up the pass again Florida State will verdict on the manual comes over to the sideline to talk to Jimbo Fisher and the assistants over there Jimbo of course is the man in charge of the offensive play combing as far as the Knowles are concerned as you look down from above what a reminder tune in to an exciting new show in FL 32 highly interactive program driven by social media were you the fan help decide the topics of the show join the hose Suzy Kolber Chris Mortensen and a rotating cast of ESPN analyst weekdays at 6:00 Eastern on espn2 in FL 32 where everyone has a voice mr. Herk Street who's your favorite NFL player of all time who wore number 32 who a lot of good ones Jimmy Brown yes sir that's right there from Ohio HECO Joe Cruz if I could mr. brown like a down in nine now Bri Jay Manuel in the nose from the gun force on the move again there's a holding penalty going to be called wide open receiver in zone diving catch for a touchdown a touchdown is on the field but there is I believe a holding call yes of a Scott Novak one of our fine referees working this game here tonight Sanders Final hold on to a block here you can see 77 against seven Nelson the linebacker blitzing he just grabs onto his jersey what's with the shame there is I really think he Jay Manuel was going to break contain and be able to run away from Nelson and still be able to get that pass a stamped off but that time Sanders right in front of the referee with the holding call to push forward a state back Florida State has slipped Loni choir they're fine pull back into the game but this is second down and 18 territory now and you'll try to make it manageable and they move it to the 24 yard line that gets it back to the original line of scrimmage right in that area that's go Reliford the other tight end now even though EJ Manuel is a tremendous athlete the thing that you have to appreciate is the way he's really put in the work to absorb Jimbo Fisher's offense and Jimbo Fisher asked his quarterback to be committed to the cause and the effort the preparation in the offseason and EJ Manuel had done that he is a quarterback who has athletic ability he's not just an athlete back there running around he's got great patience and he'll have to show that tonight with his receivers eres torque is rooster nose back field empty Bob Stoops calling his time out of Patman strangled was concerned about the personnel that the Noles had substituted with over here so we'll take a break there's Brent Venables talking things over with young Cory Nelson we'll take a break we are back for a third down and ten net for Florida State after that timeout by Oklahoma and then Olsen three receivers off to the left Jerrod Hagins question from Lakeland Florida is in this package they try to overload the left here on this third down and ten and manual again has to run and this time he's going to be sacked there is a penalty flag thrown the umpire through it as Tom wart came barreling in on the quarterback so the penalty is declined because Manuel was sacked vaca P 35 yard line now they have a tremendously effective field goal kicker but let's see what they elect to do here we saw him making fifty some yarders here he comes he's the man with the golden shoe ladies and gentlemen Dustin Hopkins is going to come in and during pregame warmups he was making him with room to spare from 55 this is a 53 53 yard attempt for Hopkins he made a 55 yarder to beat Clemson last year this one is up look at that height he gets on that one and he puts the Noles on the board what a weapon a junior out of Houston Hopkins picks a 53yard field goal we are back in Tallahassee to series 242 left in the first quarter Oklahoma beat Florida State 73 his pranks coming out from a yard in and he has stopped short of the 20 yard line well these wonderful shots as you look down you see the baseball stadium off to the right here is a great baseball school and our aerial coverage is provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires the superior performance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven mark stoops the defensive coordinator from Florida State's got to continue to reach into his bag and try to come up with some different looks that first drive did not go so well for the Seminoles after having all this time to prepare for that tempo last Drive they went right down the field in 15 plays and 80 yards and that touchdown escape the whole is going to jump from the pistol boy hey the running back gets the call and we note that Greg Reed who is shaken up has returned to the defense former fine defensive backs he's a junior from Valdosta Georgia those of you down south though harmony great ballplayers have come out of that part of Georgia so far communication not a problem at all for Andruw Jones with his temple they didn't call to the offensive line and receivers seven deflected complete first out again and that time it was Kenny snooze may be his second catch of the game he did it first down they're looking to go with the tempo still compliment Ryan Boyles on the other side so well and Jones is still perfect six of six make it seven of seven now I think it stills on the right side again and it's another first down if they flex it in the water in Norman I mean Sam Bradford never missed the pass and Landry Jones has taken the pathan and now it's his turn he looks like he's just sitting back there board even though for changing up the look he's got time to make sure throws and that's that offensive line fires far side is receiver with down stills with down on that far side that is a very strong arm to throw from the right hash to that left side arm left side line as far downfield as he did that is a strong quarterback here a lot of people talk this week about how would Florida State adjust to Oklahoma's tempo I think Oklahoma's had a few adjustments they're relying more on not offensive line and a running game here early in his football game on the road second and 10 the call comes in for the sign and get it off they were going to play this would be third and wrong so the Knowles defense with Mark Stoops here Herbie they've got them pretty much where they want them on this third down this is where Mark Stoops wants to try to be creative you know Mark Stoops is good friends with cocoa in enforcing his brothers on the other side but vocal any more scoops these guys believe in a lot of pressure and taking away the underneath easy flow for Landry Jones okay the goals could get some pressure as your pusher for the right side and the Sooners picked it up they saw the same thing you did then they come again trying to get to it interception finally scoops is able to get pressure on the quarterback and it forces the turnover and for the first time in I was a grass pain on Landry Jones number 12 and this was the key tonight for Florida State deep it could they get after Landry Jones bucket delays lit by the Nickelback LaMarcus Joyner the safety who walked up over the slot receiver he got there just in time as Jones just trying to throw the football away enough to be able to slow down Jones he puts the ball into the air and what a sensational effort by the linebacker Branham to be able to make that big play that's the key the noes have to get after Jones and that time they did it I drove radical an outstanding linebacker Ty Jones is the running back play action by manual after the turn over look at the go deep down the middle the right side it was going to fire the little was covered he came back to the right and Rodney Smith and it will be second down in 10 what about the play call after the turnover hurry I love that it the Jimbo Fisher wanted to get aggressive but this is part of the use of EJ man go you're going to see Smith's coming from the left to the right linebackers are up throw it now he's a little bit late and he also throws the ball behind if he throws that to the sideline there's no question Ronnie Smith makes the catch and picks up huge yards and keeps the momentum good effort that time as far as the play calling but that time EJ Manuel would say a good read but just late with the throwing behind his receiver let's see if Fisher stays aggressive now and second a dead screen pass against that great oklahoma rush that was high Jones the running back they didn't break it but they serve notice on that rush to be careful by showing the screen and they also brought the safety Aaron Coleman off the left he's clean number fourteen perfect time to go with the screen and that's one way as you said Brent you can slow down a defensive line and an aggressive defense it spinning its ears back you mix in a drawl you mix in a screen good time to call that to set up was very makable here third down Rashad Greene the freshman checks back in for the nose with this package on third and polar as we come to the end of the first quarter Oklahoma leads Florida State but the Noles are threatening this presentation of Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations come back to the second quarter of the number one team in the nation Oklahoma visiting number five Florida State in Tallahassee this is a third down for the Noles following an interception they're down by four DJ Manuel over the middle got another first down diving to the 25 is Kenny Shaw the sophomore from Orlando the open man it's a result often EJ Manuel's got to be able to get back there especially on third down because Oklahoma is going to get creative with their blitz package I think EJ Manuel well school there knows he's got to get the football makers worried process hit and put the ball right on the money which he did Rodney Smith goes off to the left Kenny Shaw is one of the slot men EJ Manuel with a first and ten at the Sooners 25 keeps it straight ahead picks up two or three yards on that they have many designed runs in this game plan today for the quarterback and that's one we just show it if it ends up breaking and you hit a big play great but it's another little wrinkle for those Oklahoma linebackers to be aware of the safeties to be aware of you have to appreciate and respect EJ Manuel every time he pulls that down and it's going to force Oklahoma to keep out extra guy down always aware of Manuel's ability to run the football that opens up other things in the passing game Jimbo Fisher one of the better play callers in the country he was the offensive coordinator when Nick Saban won a national championship at LSU manual buckets clean got it touchdown no incomplete they wave it off they wave it off and out there's a penalty flag comes flying they wave it off any Shah was the receiver he is down but it's a big big hit I hope Kenny Shaw is okay to Oklahoma defenders closed in on in that time the linebacker Tom wart and also the safety Javon Harris both of them hitting him at the hain't same time Harris right there you'll see Ward coming from the left both of them coming up high although it wasn't an illegal or dirty hit and we didn't appear to me because he was sandwiched that's when the ball came free looks like catch the football instant replay is taking a look at it let's see if he had actual possession before the contact the ball was coming free as he was sandwiched and he's down in the end zone and call in the field incomplete and let let's just hold Kenny Shaw is okay the Oklahoma players right now taking a knee close to Kenny Shaw Furby this is a personal foul this is a point of emphasis where you bring your helmets up that high near the helmet they they have got to call it and and they're going to call this penalty on Javon Harris okay you cannot deliver the blow so it's going to be a personal foul after he makes contact down here and you can see the players here the concern with the sooner defensive players but that flag came in really late you know and I it was 200 by the sideshow if that was on the initial hit I'd be very surprised but it came in very very late so what Kenny is being tended to they'll bring the card out for it we'll take a break and we'll be right back to Tallahassee the first concern here is Kenny Shaw still down in the end zone that's that's the most important part of what's happening right now the medical team is there and the cart has come out it was a very violent though unintentional foul but the hit was delivered up high by one of the Oklahoma players and half the distance to the goal line is a ruling on the field but again let me go back to the fact that Kenny Shaw this is this is the emphasis of this story right now is the young man being tended to down in the end zone early well anytime you see a player down like this that's forget about the game forget about the situation your thoughts are with them and hoping that he's going to be okay that was a violent hit no question it was you mentioned it was high and they ended up getting that first down but it's uh that's part of the game and it's one of those things we hope he's going to be able to be okay I think the unfortunate part when he was impacted on which was his left side because he's backing into the end zone he got sandwiched on the other side there was no guilt right as the young man was was being contacted by two defensive players at the goal line and again it was ruled incomplete I thought for a moment that he had it and was going to fall right into the end zone with it sherlynda fall had come free and was on the ground and therefore it's in a completion you know and he has worked so hard he's a sophomore out of Orlando and say he's the best route runner on the team and I told you in high school living in Orlando he worked with Tom Shaw in high school Tom Shaw of course is one of the great speed coaches in the country that works with a lot of the college players who head to the NFL as they prepare for the combine you had the luxury of being in Orlando and working out with Tom Shawn it really paid off for him because Jimbo Fisher saying with all of our receivers Kenny Shaw is by far one of our quickest and definitely our best route on it so the young man will be taken to a hospital here in Tallahassee and just as soon as we get information we certainly will pass it on to you I think somebody on the other side and you're the big ovation and now they're back on the field they're going after the penalty and this will bring up a second down it's an automatic first now is half the distance on the personal foul ball on the play and now we will have a second down coming up time you have that kind of hit and player goes down like that both sides thoughts are forced with them and now you still have to be able to try to coaches get these players cranked back up and especially pivotal point the red zone here for the Noles trying to take the lead here but Robert Reed is also sidelined with that injured ankle he tried it during pregame warmups but he's been ever unable to go so the Noles and there's a penalty flag comes flying down at the 4 yard line Rodney Smith is Bill English Watkins they'll check in down below now with Tom Rinaldi thanks Brent according to Florida State medical personnel Kenny Shaw they were unable to assess the state of his neck because he was knocked unconscious on the play he regained consciousness fleetingly but not to a point where they could assess his neck he's on the way to the hospital where they make further assessments but obviously our thoughts are with him absolutely Tom and will keep everybody informed just as soon as we get information second down and 16 for EJ Manuel who is back at the gun deflected intercepted picked off by Tom wart the linebacker so the Sooners stuff the rally with an interception this is a great job of recognizing the screen by Tom Ward the sophomore linebacker who lined up right here they're trying to get the ball right here to the tight end Releford but watch how he's able to sit sniff this out he sees it right away and how about the athletic ability to go up in the air and be able to come down with that interception a pivotal time to come up with a turnover to get the ball back to Landry Jones in the Sooners office it was a great play run into play back in as a running back and Miller's the fullback is split out for the this is Miller again eliminates back he will lead play shakes a tackle back to the liners from each second independent this is what you have to see if your important stage man and Mark Stoops have got to love to see it every talk is that timetable to slip through there and get some pressure on the running game Oklahoma first drive they sustained Zhang's up front and Landry Jones and a Sooners were in sync last couple possession we've seen some adjustments before the state now really attacking the home office the backfield center with two and hand it off but nothing good this will be B or and Warner the young man from Berlin making the stop together the nose and Tom I understand that we have one very good report regarding the injured receiver absolutely but the most positive kind of update you can have pretty saw movement we're going to take him to the hospital xrays Nick thank you so much for that third down and ten I mentioned the young man from Berlin method balloons in they close in on Landry Jones again in the passive drop incomplete in Oklahoma is forced to punt and I might say everything Mark Stoops has changed the pimple in his defense he's being more aggressive and he's mixing up the look that much more the other things let Brett should just be plain honest I think the Florida State defensive line is starting to the evidence get off of blocks are playing with more aggression and this crowd is back into this football game and I think it's affecting Landry Jones in the communication of trying to get to play call there's much lower right now that what we saw a year ago they play minnows in Norman press way is back to punt for the Sooners he'll hit it about the 25 and great read back on the field a great return man Marrakech bobbles it goes back after it and is out of bounds almost a disaster on that fair catch but it'll be Florida State football when you come back Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines find out there's online only at southwest.com a flag official partner of the Heisman Trophy and Nisa proud partner of the Heisman Trophy the Tallahassee Automobile Museum home to three Batmobiles including the original Batmobiles used in Batman Returns in that man or ever my kid before watching right now they're going to wonder if I got a chance to ride in that car Chris down to tau I checked it as the money back for the nose play cake Manuel rolls pocket to the right drops it off to the running back he's out to about the 17 and Tom Ward in for good let's take a look at the Pacific Life game summary were talking about food quarterback sports while Landry Jones got off to a great start five for five minute opening drive 80 yards in a touchdown fence the Sooners have really struggled in for EJ Manuel right now the numbers aren't going to really stand out the interception obviously he'd love to have back although nothing resulted from that but EJ Manuel still I think a balanced attack making good decisions with the exception of that one great play by Tom Worf but they're pinned back in their own territory here too the first time let's see how they can react to this sigh Jose is set behind prior prior leap the way to pull back got the block on the edge there's prior lead and Jones does the rest what a great lead block by the young man from Okeechobee I love Lonny Pryor because he's a former tailback that's more than willing to move to pull back they got the receiver that time right in front of the tailback Ty Jones and Greg dead you know they're relying on the depth of the receivers because the Burt Reid being out and how skinny shawl being out 15 off to the right there Craig dent just locks on to the corner Hurst that was a big game for Florida State to get out of it deep in their own territory but I'd say Lonnie Pryor I know I had to come back he does a good job at fullback he's a former tailback more than willing to block and catch the ball to the by the backfield and I like how Jimbo Fisher rotates these backs and keeps them fresh to be able to have some good acceleration in that backfield Chris Thompson is the fresh running back and he's jammed in the list I believe mr. purnsley not yield and that cleaned it up for Tom wart Tom Ward has been very active with the middle linebacker here absolutely and they pretty always hear Bob Stoops and Brent Venables talk about gap integrity meaning no book no seams no easy runs and you're right Tom Ward really all the linebackers and I think the fact that Travis Lewis is back in the lineup this providing leadership to go along with Tom Morris I think that's very very important to this linebacking crew they're dialed in especially against that run game John Ward's best friend of course was the Lake Austin box who died tragically back in May he has dedicated his season for the young man that he played middle linebacker with last year this time EJ Manuel gets up roared that first down marker dives for it it will depend on the spot and there is Travis Lewis just on few from what where bitola said that her you know we talked about in Austin box started the last five games and this team the defense honors him with a player wearing number 12 in each of their games and tonight there's a great Frank Alexander their defensive end and he will honor by worrying well can I'd rather as usual 84 and when the defense Brady come on they all break it for 12 Austin box legacy lids on with his football team and they really they really miss him so here's a big putter I mean Big Sean Powell goes about six for 240 fair catch v Broyles very sure handed at the 32 so when you come back Oklahoma will have the football don't tell you surprised we got a low scoring game we'll see what happens the Sooners opened up this game with a 15 play drive 80 yards and a touchdown since the last couple drives really the Seminoles have made adjustments with marks getting more aggressive and mixing up the look causing some confusion for Jones and a big offensive line dominic Whaley is a running back they send him out as one of the receivers he's got stills doubled over the top help from the safety and it's incomplete great rotation that time by the safety as he came over the top on stills right I think he caught the football it was it looked like there was a collision there but they'll be hanging out there yeah watch watch this effort I think he knew double move he'd be able to get around Road watch the safety come over oh my Twitter comfort and he's able to just get underneath of Joyner who was accelerating through him big time concentration and a huge play by kiddin Phil shaken up that colorful Mohawk of the Californian heads off to the sidelines what a great graph by still I have even with a chance of the world when that safety rotated over then he get a name to that 38 yards first down and 10 Whaley now pounds the Middle's in the 25 appreciate this I know they're in a hurry but Kenny filter we could spend in that first game soand corpse this and he there's the blow he spoke from Joyner there the left elbow over against the face first of all I did it was interference the opponent be okay still managed to make that catch suck it down now Jones drops it off underneath the milord Miller makes his way to the 9 yard line first down and go this is a staple in the open the home all brick for back 33 let's flip him out piece of linebackers can stick with him he's able to get away from 13 Branham and I'll say Miller succeeded his office he can do so many different things quickly they come and thought is dominic waylaid by Bjorn warder the young man and grew up playing soccer his only played football for a few years came to a prep school the United States and now a penalty flag comes flying look at the power of burner of Warner he just goes right through the junior length Lane Johnson just tremendous strength pushed him right into the backfield after the play was over personal foul and that's very welcome random commits that foul settle down settle down exactly what you cannot afford to do in a game like this you cannot lose your cool the emotions are flying high but middle mistake mental mistakes will cost you confusion on the Sooner side with their personnel grouping our I Miller the lead back runway Lee to the fiveyard line to be second and goal and Warner again he's becoming the dirk nowitzki of defensive ends here when they may want to stay away from the right side because right now Lane Johnson is getting overwhelmed by the size and power of Warner sick for about 275 pounds my action here dangerous could have tied in for the Sooners love James Shannon also the fullbacks Miller power running game and he can't get there down at the 309 joiner the safety joined in on Whaley and now decision time for Oklahoma the left side of that line is getting much better thirst than the right side they try to get outside on this third down bullard stays in Whaley's the runningback the backfield Josh Heupel stayed with that running game and Xavier Road bigtime corner and also Smith the linebacker come in and make the play great job is shooting the gap by Calvin Smith back the backup middle linebacker is able to shoot the gap in a goal line defense it's a great old adage there's pinching taking everybody occupying behind that divine Lane John can the right tackle whiffed and it opened up a nice scene that time when you tell Mo's good to be able to get through there Jimmy Stephens only one you are 19 of 23 last season nails that one and the Sooners are back with a sevenpoint there second a 7 point lead of the night Florida State's turn when you come back for 30 new of the first half now I'm mr. Herbstreit time for tonight's Aflac trivia question Florida State's only win versus Oklahoma came in the 1965 Gator Bowl who caught four touchdown passes that day for the Seminoles think of my dad right after that kickoff we'll reveal if you think about that one night all is on the day Oklahoma will kick it away Greg Reed has now gone back with Joyner and I can hear the wheels spinning I kick off he's going to come out 10:20 read to the 25yard line harvesters great why yes well I mean I'm thinking of the lead for so Burt Reynolds era but that's that was before 65 was after 65 1965 oh he caught it not a dozen passes oh my gosh Oakland Raiders what Nicole there you go there you go yeah the wide receiver award is named a Freddy Biletnikoff burned and all I do you 65 ladies are going there is number 25 over the numbers retired here Chris Thompson now checks on in as the Noles running back you might have guessed sellers another great receiver him out of here EJ keeping it running all the way time run cutback jumps over one of his teammates got a first down and is upended at the 36 yard line punting learn by EJ before gable in looking down it's about the fifth time we've seen EJ Manuel run the football and he knew this coming in how about the little jump over this burlock his guard but a good effort and again just enough of a run from EJ Manuel to keep the safeties and the linebackers honest and they have to be aware because of his athletic ability and speed to hit any time to pull that down and have the ability to get upfield and pick up 10 or 15 yards in a first down Higgins one of the wide outs off to the left in the formation Manuel get some time comes in underneath the running back Thompson that's a first down well I was checking with Robert Flores for an update Robert all right Brett AT&amp;T allamerica Player of the Week update South Carolina's Marcus Lattimore becoming just the third player to run for 200plus under head coach Steve Spurrier 246 three touchdowns as South Carolina took care of Navy but it wasn't easy you can text boat to five 58.62 to take part and for a chance at a trip to the national championship Brent Robert thank you very much and they did not give him a generous spot so they still need a yard on this play you know what this is a hearing physical hardhitting football game helmet came flying Brunel Lewis defensive end that time we had players go down on both teams most seriously injured was Kenny Shaw who's taken to a hospital here stills was shaken up and probably tested him on that sideline for a concussion he hopefully will be back in now on third down Manuel makes it rights for the header motion both defense I think it's settled into the game and are starting to become more aggressive not just at the defensive line you watch these Sooners linebackers they're attacking through the ball except they're attacking diamond down hill and reading their feet right now they just close by Brent Venables with Oklahoma more food for the Florida State for now and have the upper hand as the adjustments within this game continue on didn't get it by much did there folks Thompson turn it back in that backfield the jail move up under center and Hill 6 5 245 pounds to be it endaround give it back down Manuel Figueroa takes off maintains his balance to the fifth day and he was lucky her be with David King closing in on him to get that much out of it and now there's a sooner down that is king who's on the ground don't pitch back to Manuel trying to catch Oklahoma napping they actually do a pretty good job at the thing defending that King is able to chase him down from behind but again his mobility just getting away from trouble instead of a big loss excuse me Brent he's able to pick up three or four yards and continue to just move the stick or move the ball down the field and avoid the devastating play but coming up on the northwestern neutral halftime report Scott Van Pelt and Jesse Palmer will have all the day's big highlights where Scott does even watching all the games across the country in for the Sioux know what's happening I believe Miami leads Ohio State 176 right now it's scored quickly a couple of touchdown painted there comes your second and 7 to the nose who will host Miami a bit later this season over the middle incomplete so we third down now little was into the garden cut it we can't say it enough just being Travis Lewis out on the field playing there Oklahoma over there between his Walker Casey Walker's checked out of the game the Travis Lewis his he is such a leader he's an extension of the defensive coaches always getting people lined up and I think the fear of missing him for the first four or five games was scary but just his presence being out on the field definitely on the road a big plus for this sooner defense makes all the calls Manuel is 8 of 13 for 60 are intercept it threw it away in the middle of the field picked off by Harris Harris in a footrace cut off on the angle cuts back and a brilliant return with that interception inside the 5yard line and the Sooners are in business with that turnover now these are the mistakes are going to cost any quarterback on third down he throws it high and there isn't a receiver clear away in the middle of the field he fighted in making a cut back to the middle of the field or that was just a miscommunication but that time EJ Manuel read one thing and his receivers and again he's working with a lot of backup receivers the receivers read another and an easy interception by Javon Harris vibrate Jones brings the suitors back out Whaley and Millard are the running backs behind Joan this time they get a throw down there inside the five incomplete threw it away his receiver was covered remember let's talk about the new lay collar here for the Sooners so that Josh Heupel is in the role Kevin Wilson another head coach at Indiana the last time I thought they were very conservative down here they come up throwing on first down that dog and John Highfill will I think be very similar to Kevin Wilson you got to take your chances when you think you can take advantage of a guy may be out of position but a lot of times Oklahoma's a new part of this offense and down in this area you've got to be able to run the football and push people off the line of scrimmage the part of you've just got them waiting nothing doing it will now be third down and goal last time down here doles course the field goal Mark Stoops defense up against it again after the turnover so here is your third and goal Miller is the lead fullback Whaley Texas iodine as does the quarterback cosplay to his trying to get the edge on the line Millard and there's a penalty flag he stopped by Vince Williams but there is a penalty flag on the far side and that's against Oklahoma that's a holding penalty Jimbo going he could have declined it and brought up fourth down and short but I believe Jimbo was concerned that Oklahoma was going to go for the touchdown and they're going to back him up a little bit and you know Bob toots he's not going to hesitate he would take those chances that's why Jimbo Fisher pushes him back that time hey bird trying to reach block just blocked onto the linebacker there Kenny Stills is back on the field Mark Stoops is very aware Savior roads is locked up on the boundary was filled and back in Joe forced out of the pocket on the move fires it away and it will be fourth down and long pressure is being brought by the order the order friend continues to just dominate lantian plan Johnson they're going to have to start the chip they're going to have to do something in his second half as an adjustment it slow him down because whether it's a run or a past as much as everybody wants to talk about Brandon Jacobs number 49 and his pass rush at 13 and half sacks last year can i order 29 yarder from Jimmy Stevens again to the left hash and again he nails it is true for to here tonight so the defense is keeping the Knowles in this but the offense has to show up at the second half let's go down below now to Erin Andrews coach I heard you tell your offensive line you have to be better at the goal line what adjustments do they need to make it the second half blood a guy or two to run through earlier on you know backward jump the gap and penetrated here we're just you know got a good matchup they're kind of haven't been able to knock them off the ball well enough and their way through your line overcome thanks very much Erica Steve explain really well Jimbo offensively you're moving the bell how do you remedy the mistakes at the turnover we don't tell we got to turn around the middle of the field we got a guy wide open he turns out we should have turned in make the play had a good throw the other time we drop the touchdown down there we got a big hint which was I hope he's all right but in the penalties we've got to relax relax and make a keeper boys where this is a great job are deep into 13 to 3 we shot ourselves in the foot as much as we can for 10 points I got the ball coming out so we're not magic that's very much Jim appreciative Brent and twice now Holman inside the 10 yard line only to come away with 6 points our aerial coverage provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires for superior performance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven now let's send it to the studio Scott Van Pelt and Jesse Palmer for the Northwestern Mutual halftime report take it away Scott be presented by Southwest Airlines listen to Switchfoot's new album vice versus now on espn.com slash music an intimate trance which in the Rose Bowl game presented by Vizio with the band you look down on our setting as we take a look at tonight's Southwest Airlines playbook there was only one touchdown hurry and it came on the opening drive of the game by Oklahoma and as Sooners win 80 yards and 15 plays it looked like what it's off is going to be in sync again they were able to punch it in finally and get the touchdown with Landry Jones it's a big play or they finish all down turns out he is ok which was great news Tom Warren had the big interception here to set things up for Oklahoma really motivated selfdestructed with the two turnovers they feel like they can execute here in the second half you're watching the ACC on ESPN from Tallahassee and I would be remiss in not following up on that ACC mission by saying that there's a whole lot of talk first let's watch this kickoff return this important Drive coming up and the nose will start as Joyner gets to the 20 to the restricted life game summary early take a quick look at this as I said the Florida State the two turnovers they've had their opportunities they've moved the football but you heard Jimbo Fisher walking off talking about hey we've got to settle down he's got to settle down and be able to play in the scene but I've been very impressed by for two state defence three times the Sooners have it inside the red zone they've forced two field goals and allowed the touchdown on that opening drive that's a big unsportsmanlike conduct foul on number 89 and that'll move this ball that Hayward herve up to the 37 the tight in Austin Haywood a big hit but he came in high but she just can't do and you're talking about trying to create some momentum to start the second half always been very important to start off the second half with some momentum and for the state just got it whoa Lonnie fires cut off Walker one of the defenders there Florida State rushed for 55 yards and Oklahoma 59 in the first half Walker's the nose guard and this is what you need to be able to get a big push up front and you know he's just overpowering the center Brian stork who last week played guard he's undersized they say he's quicker and that's why they want him in center the problem is he's gone up against Casey Walker in about 310 pounds with quickness and he slipped right by him there for a big loss Florida State shorthanded his wide receiver second down and 16 ej snaps it off to the side but not much doing that's Jared Hagin he's a young receiver and the Higgins couldn't get much out of him so check it whatever sick friend Oklahoma's dline shorthanded right now KP walker defensive tackle is out with a left ankle injury he's over here on the sidelines and then David King you friends have been he's cramping right now Brent so both of these guys trying to get back in all right so we'll follow that third down and 19 when you take screen or draw something safe don't make a mistake that was safe well they don't take advantage of the 15yard tackedon and the kickoff great defense by the Sooners and you know we talked about adjustments and schemes for right now they're just out playing right there up front there's no question and here's the big punter but Jimbo Fisher could not afford another turnover down here now local members being played with a short field Ryan Broyles soil very dangerous the punt return man Jimbo talking to his quarterback down on the sideline 64 240 pounds rajat but it's low for Broyles and he's going to let this one because it's good coverage um it will be down right around the 30yard line so when you come back it'll be the Sooners first possession of the second half up 5:10 well as you look down our college football scene is under dramatic change we'll know more next week first now first down in ten Landry Jones and the Sooners back in the gun bobbles a stack and down on it right there but from earlier reports both Syracuse and Pittsburgh have applied for admission to the ACC and of course that would swell that conference and the Board of Regents of both Oklahoma and Texas are due to meet on Monday there have been stories that Oklahomans pointed to the pac12 Texas might even want to join the ACC we shall see as all those stories unfold next week set the screen pass and that's James Hanna the tight end and there's a penalty flag comes fine and if this is going to be personal foul on Florida State you got to be kidding me dead ball personal foul is that what we're talking about here after the labors over is for some iconic comedy talking about boy Jimbo Fisher mark stoops act like you've been there go out there and play with boys the emotions are starting to fly high defensively 440 state Bradham losses in school when they they had them set up in a third and long and now it's an automatic first down what is the head and crying in him on you can't lose your cool like that the ball out at the 45 yard line 1st down and 10 for the Sooners play on the inside roaches midfield Jenkins makes a stop for the knoll all this talk this week about with Florida State be able to get lined up right remember last year when they played Oklahoma they couldn't even get lined up right because the tempo got the best of them well now in Tallahassee a year older this defense is not only getting lined up right there beating the blocks up front and getting awesome and making big plays ever since that first drive they've made the adjustments in a plan Finch one of the slot receivers for Oklahoma with a running back they drop it off the other side it would be third down and long lay the treatment was running a route and Bradham who was guilty of that foul makes the play defensively and Mark Stoops continues to mix up look you know Oklahoma tries to be the aggressor with this uptempo office they try to confuse you and mark loop's is trying to mix up the hope that confuse Oklahoma back in the gun third and ten Russia the yarn warder the young man from Berlin Germany is having a huge night at defense it in for the nose brendi he has been to the office his right and dominating Lane Johnson this time he's just going to watch how quick he gets off the snap are you kidding me Donald Stevenson never had a chance Werner known for his power in tonight against Oklahoma using that power and also incredible quickness to overwhelm the Sooners up front plus way gets it off and Reed is back again lets it go and it's a beautiful punt trust way the junior out of Tulsa buries the Seminoles so you come back we'll see what each a manual and the Knowles can come up with offensively Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines find out fares online only at southwest.com Pacific Life for insurance annuities and investments choose specific life the power to help you succeed and for drive one well we welcome you back to Tallahassee and there is the coach's trophy presented by dr. pepper both these teams would like to play forward in New Orleans from next January 9 ej Manuel's in trouble drops it off beautifully under pressure back there by the 2 yard line and Brent Aaron Colvin came on a blitz it was a little bit delayed and it caught Brian historic off off guard a bit and Brent Venables much like Mark Stoops mixing up his looks look look at his safety coming in late stealin centers not able to come over and pick him up great job of improvising and avoiding disaster that time by you Jay Manuel to find his check down the Noles are searching for a wide receiver Burt Reed ankle injury Kenny Shaw taken out on a stretcher in the first half and without their two aces but it goes for a first down Higgins picks up one of the youngsters in its first intended Tom Rinaldi what is the latest on Kenny Shaw very good news from the Florida State medical staff right on finish off for that frightening hit on the goal line knocking him unconscious in the second quarter CT scans at a nearby hospital negative of his head and neck the best kind of news feeling in all of his extremities should be fine according to team doctors wonderful news about Kenny Shaw but indeed first down in ten now and Hagen's a sophomore from Lakeland makes a big play so they're searching for wide receivers they could also use a running back beside the quarterback here and the quarterback comes up with a nice play to the 35 yard line and that's where shot green another the pressure incarnate in Georgia I think they have some receivers with athletic ability and speed and this true freshman is a blazer ain't going to be a superstar here me but it's the way they aren't on quite on the same page to rate the way Bert reading Kenny Shaw might be the miscommunication we saw the first half with the interception these guys have ability it's just making sure they're dialed in those defenses that they're seeing and reading and making sure they're seeing the same thing that EJ Manuel is so a freshman and a sophomore are trying to replace a sophomore as senior and that is one thing he can do brilliantly running all the way where they first down and Tony Jefferson making the stop for the center thing about running that football is you're going to take some hits and Travis Lewis got in there and a lot of acceleration really the backup quarterback Clint Trickett and when you're going to run EJ Manuel he's going to take some hits and you're going to take a pounding so as much as it can help you and obviously he's been productive running the ball you got to remember it again if he gets a chance to get out Brent you got to get out Daniel's gonna throw on first down snaps it off you to play to green who is 45 yard line arrows came up again he's done he's been taking some hits but the play where he ran the previous play Travis Lewis lower to boom on him at this time is Harris taking out Rashad Greene but he's able to hold on to the football and the previous play he took a shot from Travis Lewis that I think he maybe didn't feel until he tried to throw the ball there now Devonta Freeman has come in as the running back and he has the burst he's behind prior here's the freshman's first carry of the game they run him up behind the left side of that offensive line Danko and Buckaroo but it looks like EJ Manuel hurt that's what we just talked about how you're going to run with him and that's a great play and against Oklahoma's defense you make him be aware of it opens up the passing game but Louis Travis Lewis will come from the left hits him right there on the left side and he's kind of been holding the left side and it might have been really when he came down absolutely that's part of the risk using that athletic ability and went trick it the freshman who's looked pretty good in the first couple games these are some of the offensive line cochair the backup quarterback trip still flips it out but nothing doing for Devonta Freeman Grinnell Louis read it right away he Brent he is really feeling this I mean I we talked about this before the game started clenched wicked offensive line coach he was coach's son he knows how to run the system but let's keep a close eye with Tom Rinaldi and see how serious this might be with EJ Manuel on to fund for Florida State in 445 John model so Powell back and broils goes deep for the soda repeat Row one drive punt royal scoops it up at the eight steps out of bounds at the 17 yard line another return a fierce Oklahoma defense here tonight in Tallahassee Seminole quarterback DJ Manuel is going back the manila's locker room to receive medical attention and that means that redshirt freshman foot trekker2 has been warming up will be coming in he just had a brief conversation with Jimbo he's out now taking some snaps but this is a punishing Oklahoma defensive and I Dominic Whaley is in as the Sooners running back comes over and here comes Whaley and now it looks like Oklahoma is going to try to hand out some punishment with the offensive line on a power earlier again once again Werner is in on the play that's I'm actually the right tackle Lane Johnson doing a better job and moving him at least laterally to try to give Whaley a little bit of room to work with coming back to the left side with him for the first down Knowles trying to tackle a football where they would have none of it it looks like maybe Jay Norville and Josh Highfill to go off at the coordinators maybe finally off it with the sideline man said hey boys was trying to hit aggressive up front and trying to run the football he's first Gary kind of getting a little bit more aggressive in serving himself this time tuck himself throws to double coverage intercepted picked off at the 30 yard line by LaMarcus Julie nerve Landry Jones a little greedy on that play but it is good as a big punch if they tried to catch him napping with an out and up right here Joyner sees it the entire way and just it's kind of coasting now he's a former corner and he has great closing speed and that time he shows the ball skills to go along with the speed able to locate the football and hold on to it for that interception so here comes Trickett off the bench replacing the injured EJ Manuel for 21 left after the Joyner interception give him high Jones to 210 pound senior from Tampa he'll be the eye back on the he'll be feature here is cricket takes his first snap from Brian stork and they're going to have him put it up on first down those deep cover incomplete and as the family flag he draws an interference call on first now how about that time to call the cook by tiptoe Fisher's what are we going to do with our freshman quarterback coach's son we're going to throw a pass of fade and a deep ball go right after one of your top corners and Fleming Hagen's back in is one of the receivers for cricket I like to take if we can take another peek at that because I know the Oklahoma bench is pretty frustrated with that call on it there was a whole lot of contact on that sideline you love because well the balls in the air that's the call right there towards the end of it it's not pass interference but the old hook to the jaw on green is what was called it's a great call downstairs many officials but how about Jimbo Fisher first first play for the young guy welcomed into the game now they give him Thompson as a running back not much doing on that was big run llois did number 56 well you have a polling card on the backside and the acceleration of Louis getting up field you know Louis moved from outside linebacker to defensive end and Brent Venables telling us this week he's just now really settling into understanding the technique of that position and that time he sniffed that out quickly got upfield and I don't think they fear trick it running the football on that zone read option play obviously the way they do EJ Manuel they're locking in on those running backs put them down second and 15 and that is complete the Hagins freaking for the first time just shy of it by a little over a yard so here's the young man his daddy too is on the coaching staff great you you've been talking about which one of these receivers might step up and we've seen a couple of them Hagen's has been able to do that and Rashad Greene that time Hagan fighting the sauce pot toss pot the zone but I'm very impressed when we watch playing cricket in practice on Thursday you know he got off to a good start against inferior opponents but he has tremendous poise for a young quarterback who hasn't played a lot there's his father legendary offensive line coach for many years with Rich Rodriguez and Morgantown with the Mountaineers but a coach's son showing a lot of poise here stepping into this game in the third quarter third down play action Trickett get a throw for the first down it is going to be close Releford it'll depend on the spot above Reliford they're marking it as a first down treinen this gives you an idea they're trying to squeeze the safe things up and he wants to go down feel the problem is Oklahoma State so they're trying to catch him off guard on third and short Oklahoma stays with it a great job of looking off of the receiver that he wanted to go to showing the poise and checking it down for that first down so Jimbo Fisher gambling with his backup quarterback here and now the freshman running back Devonta Freeman from Miami timeout is going to be used where the state burns a timeout and let's check in down below with Tom Rinaldi thanks very much Brenton when EJ Manuel came over to the sideline trainers looking at that left shoulder asking him to raise his arm up was not able to raise it parallel to the ground as a result they brought him back to get the pads off him get a better look at the shoulder and examine it that way that's why they brought him off the field soon as we know more we'll get it to your breasts look to me on the hip or the shoulder went into the ground a little bit right you know and I guess I guess take a look about when you run him you take a risk of maybe taking a big hit and Travis Lewis to hit and then to pounding into the ground is where I think he really felt that he tried to get up after that play and try to make a pass attempt the next play and that's when I think he really started to feel the pain set in but hey how about so far this young freshman comes into this game and we'll see how we be able to manage the game the rest of the way but so far looking pretty comfortable for this the new father Trickett it's time again upgrade that's right charity Oklahoma had to safety high and deep so you got to try to attack the middle of the defense Kagan's is really starting to settle in what concentration there but a great throw by trick it does lead him right into the hole in the middle of that defense and pick up a huge gain for the Seminoles and I said to Jimbo what's been easy recruiting him with Odell on your staff and he said you'd be surprised it was as easy as you might think him man had a lot of offers and here is Jared 6:1 only 191 pounds against that heavy hitting secondary and now they come back with the other freshmen Freeman and he ran right under hearing through his lineman Cory Nelson is their number eight now he has the most curse if you get into an open field Freeman is the one who can take off for the nose but getting there that the battle against this shorter defense as the true freshman is then low center of gravity great balance tough to bring down but I'll tell you what this guy comes in off the bench let's give a ret let's recognize the offensive line in the play falling and right now Oklahoma's brought some pressure but for the most part Trickett has been able to execute this offense without a lot of pressure on him christian green checks in as one of the Noles receivers he's a redshirt freshman get hit on the delivery got it from The Blind Side from Tony Jefferson so finally Brent Venables dials up pressure on the backup and they got there of course just as you say the offensive line doing a pretty good job Venables does come with a blitz he brings both linebackers from the outside and Tony Jefferson comes untouched that's why you don't use freshman running back folks Freeman oh my way to the coaches see that didn't even try to take him on that stuff that is why running backs stay in a game and that's why they come off you've got a blitz protect Chris Thompson now in is the running back incomplete crowd what an interference on time angel they've got the leg the dopant appeal goal here there me not about that Hopkins can make it as we saw earlier from well within this range made a fifty three order back in the first quarter he's now him oils guys look at the shoes by bill bill addresses the man with the golden toe 46yard only again a forty six yarder I snap now it curls and he's got another one automatic whoa well this week on ESPN's Monday Night Football former Oklahoma quarterback Heisman Trophy winner Sam Bradford leads the st. Louis Rams into mid laughs MetLife Stadium where they'll face Eli Manning and the Giants ESPN Monday Night Football at 8:30 Eastern I wanted to show you some statistics as you compare the two Oklahoma history now you great Sam Bradford past 480 400 yards but look at this Landry Jones is about to go by it probably with the next completion he will have the most career passing yards of any quarterback in Oklahoma history of Asia there's Landry engaged the basketball player back at Norman I think her name is Whitney hand I apologized they were a player they were engaged this summer her she's back school Watchers inside of a minute here in the third quarter I should play our back and those are within seven there's a beautiful kickoff so again they'll return with the young man Dustin Hopkins and it will come out on the 20yard line as you look down this aerial coverage provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires for superior performance inspires what they roll in tears Goodyear more driven a record crowd tonight 84,000 plus the largest crowd hurting in Florida State history as you look down now eightyfour 392 Oh Marcus etiquette the cane by 7:00 snaps it off the skills and skills were great speed he's a four three man climbing down and he made one of the catches of the year in the first half it was a chance in a world but he held onto that football he did he was shaken up with to the sidelines and he's come back Lord of states kind of take away the easy underneath rose by Landry Jones now they run the top play with play play about a yard short of a first out against that defense I have a sooner down here inside again on that's Broyles I believe that's Ryan Broyles number 85 is down he has been rather quiet since the opening part of the game he caught four passes early for 24 yards and since then he's been quiet Jones now after hitting his first six of the game his 12 of 18 overall this whole offense has been quiet since that opening drive boys inside the 5yard line browsers they really do go really the first time this all fan in the mastermind behind it have been tested without Kevin Wilson who's now as he said earlier the head coach in Indiana milord and pull back the film Suns in motion they're going to spring quickly going and those would have none of it Christian Joe we're running out of Winter Park Florida I think the motion that time actually drew the attention even a Houma can run but it hops to get to the perimeter against the Seminole defense for the speed that they had can the Knowles come back with a backup quarterback in the fourth quarter we'll find out Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airlines returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations the new season of Dancing with the Stars printers Monday September 9th 8 8 7 central of ABC most surprising cast ever soccer goalie Hope Solo the u.s. women's team in LA Ron Artest our London contestants we start the fourth quarter 13 6 Oklahoma lead 2 5 7 Landry Jones of the suitors and almost intercepted by Michael Harris want to state that time and press man coverage again trying to disrupt on third and short take away the cushion good job there but a defensive back taken away that cushion disrupting the rhythm and timing between Landry Jones to his receivers they're expecting that short quick pass and they took it away that touch way has hit 251 yards one 7i3 Greg Reed is that deep and way hangs one up in the air you see that sideline again and this one's going to roll good at the 9 yard line what a job by trusts way as we take a look at the Pacific Life game somewhere here tonight before the largest crowd in the history of Florida State only touchdown to the game scored in the first quarter on the opening drive by the Sooners Sooners have now 195 yards to Florida State's 177 if you watch the Michigan Notre Dame game and you saw some fireworks 50 n so far we have not seen many fireworks which means every possession in every snap in a one possession game matters especially for two state deep in their own territory like this with a backup quarterback Thompson's is running back playaction they're going to throw it again on first down complete to the 30yard line a brilliant pastor Reliford and Jimbo Fisher comes up Tori again this time for twenty yards on first down and Fleming is shaken up as a quarterback when you're coach as a backup quarterback shows the confidence to throw the football and play action on first intent that makes you feel life you're going to be able to sit in there and make it throw great job of protecting him giving him enough time to be able to make it have a chance to evaluate the defense puts the ball right on the money to the big tight end you feeling it right now look at him why not he's 4 of 6 from 59 yards he's the son of the offensive line coach here at Florida State Rick terrific that his daddy apparently had a tear in his eye when the young man threw a touchdown pass on his first play ever he threw a touchdown pass to Rashad Greene it was the first snap for either now he's got the nose down by a touchdown there is Rick who's done an outstanding job with the oline here at Tallahassee and one of his weapons is the nephew of Coach Odell Hagen's who worked with the defense here with the seven our number 12 and he's had a big night here receiving he has four catches for 45 so some youngsters taken charge my action again truffle coming back Alexander's there Frank Alexander gets in there and again there's one thing about Brent Venables you might be able to throw on first and ten but the next time you get in that position they're going to have to bring pressure they brought to safety Coleman off to the right and pray now Frank Alexander that time just flatout beat his man oneonone you know we're kidding about this offensive line and think about Rick trick is maybe to top this off at the line coach in the country probably think it you better block for my son watching South there Rodney Smith is off to the right second down and long for cricket fires in underneath and he hit great dent and then as a sophomore from Belle Glade Florida there is that offensive line that the number of starts stork was switched back to center this week and foreign crew who was an outstanding JC offensive lineman a year ago flight center for a couple of games and tonight they moved it back to left guard Jones it has the running back alongside Turkey be careful here pressure got oneonone first for infil break out of ours that was dent working the nearside knife baton call here where the quarterback you don't even have to make a read he's just going to get back put the ball up in the air and hope that Ben could be able to make a play oneonone against Dave Lynn Gabe Lynn never even sees the football ball was just thrown a little bit too far to the outside the tremendous effort that time by dint try to get his foot down clearly out of bounds Royals okay reason to return this front John Powell hold boy Boyle's catches it at the 5yard line and we surrounded outofbounds and about the 9 this is a great attacking spot and there's a penalty flag great attacking spot hurry for the dolls deeper absolutely and they may push him back even further looks like a late call he came in and they threw it right into Monterrey Hearst possible push in the back or a holding back during every third personal foul wiggle block along the way oops can't be happy about this penalty even before the penalty folks into the 69 yard punt come on back the chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup begins with the Geico 400 in Chicago Jimmie Johnson I am his sixth straight title coverage begins Sunday 1:00 Eastern on ESPN with NASCAR countdown EJ Manuel Herbie has returned from the locker room and now it is as stewards who are backed up they're going to run Whaley and he is so by fladam that get down coming up back then I think the noisiest part to this Stadium the Seminoles have been in their ears back right now Landry Jones right now force the experience of veteran need to avoid the turnover but Bob Crewe still an aggressive guy sometimes take some chances with oneonone coverage on the outside everybody's got skills stays conservative and they run it out to about the six yard line so this will be third down and not an easy third down for the Sooners either both Florida State defensive ends corner and Jenkins have the ability to get off the ball in a hurry Houma decide to throw the football Lantry goes it's going to have to get the football out of his hands in a hurry Phil is slotted to the right on third down Landry fires middle incomplete and the Sooners are forced to punt EJ Manuel reappears and the Noles course at three and out I think any stills may have been surprised the football was coming home as quickly as it did but it just a great play that time by Terence parks to come over and get a finger on the ball and knock it away now tres Ray who is perfect brilliantly is backed up toward the back of his endzone Gregory attempting to give the nose some field position for melanoma lines outside very cold in 14 gotta thank position for Gregory when this electrifying playmakers in all the college football has a chance to make something happen don't attend rate on the staff the defense force to fall I'm trying to get to his official detention he drove around the 10yard line Brent you been doing games a long time I've been screwing games and well this place has not been this loud since Chris blankie was a quarterback here it's been about ten years that this place rock like this agrees there we go now press way very close to the in line Marina waited and because the brewery was in the pressure that the forest front of the IDI EJ Manuel has his helmet on and has walked onto the field let's quickly check in with Tom they're going to take him back out he now is moving back to the sidelines let's check in with Tom Rinaldi Brent after examining him trainers determined a bruised left shoulder for EJ Manuel he came out up warming up throwing the ball but obviously the trick is go back in but EJ Manuel warming up as if to return and appears to be ready if needed he wanted to go in he was out on the field and her coaches sent him back the competitive spirit of each a man who wanted to get back into this game went Ricky can do he's played pretty well for this point where's Thompson is his running back motions out straight back on first down and swallowed at the 40yard line for a loss on the play let's check in with Robert Flores for a Taco Bell studio update right now on espn2 Utah and BYU first time in a hundred and thirteen years these rivals not meeting as conference opponents Jake heats to rasa PO puts the Cougars on top 10 7 and Miami has defeated Ohio State 24 sick Corey Harris two touchdowns and two picks Robert thank you and here it is second down and 12 for backup quarterback Clint box office green there's a Hillary black filled by the Empire the play on the field results in a first down at the Empire through the penalty flag in that canary el hold a the veteran David Spurlock good time to be able to call this you know one thing about cricket being in for EJ Manuel you saw it on first and ten when things break down you lose Manuel's ability to create so you've got to be able to dial up more plays like that the screen to get the ball out of his hands quickly Rick trigger wants to know who is that call on Hagen's Watson is one of the receivers second down and a bunch it's time to make third down manageable that they can and remember they have a great weapon in the field goal kicker but they need more than that we're in the fourth quarter too late developing and Tom Ward who's had a big night defensively this is the middle linebacker for the Sooners roars in on it now the trick play and trying to go with plays that bit are are unique as far as a play call I don't know if it's the time for that because of the timing of a lot of these guys are backup players it's one thing to execute it in practice is the second team another thing when Oklahoma and Tom Ward are locking in onion this drive started at the Oklahoma 38 now they're all the way back at their own 44 on the third and a punch trick it goes deep quite crap 2030 the freshman from we're sorry fifteen seconds third in 28 my man Chris what the heck third down and long we saw some of his class last week surface twenty a fourmile against this defense where we saw a little guard Robinson last week throw it up and hope the receiver makes the play that's exactly what the freshman Green did for tricky pleistocene to safety Devon Harris when we come back we'll show you the angle that he yes the done Saturday night and college football I'm all back y'all Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines Thunder fares online only at southwest.com Cadillac and the Home Depot more saving more doing that's the power the Home Depot we welcome you back and a very upset Oklahoma defense here and having surrendered a 56 yard touchdown pass on third and 28 and trick it off the bench has led the Noles to a field goal a punt and now a touchdown in his three drives and now Justin Hopkins with that long way will take it off Frank's from the goal line short of the 20 yard line rent on 3rd and 28th watched the safety right here number 30 watch how slow he is to break on the football and the angle that he took Devon Harris was slow to react and then when he did react he didn't go up and knock the ball away 1328 gets it up and lift the ball down he slow to react in the corner halftime claiming didn't do anything to help him out just really for play that time for the Oklahoma secondary is brick strict if free don't rare to see a smile from him in a middle of a football they've been happy for his song play is the running behind Jones and the suitors he'll try to come to the left vixx's way before harris brings him down number one for the nose 918 regulation were deadlocked if they're clean now Breathitt all tempo tempo tempo as Florida State going to be ready to the tempo after that first drive they're really sense that tempo is a concern at all we explore safe lined up a home is not going nearly as fast as they typically there with a Goldberg position winning back bill is empty and hot but short of that first down and that was Kenny Stills with that reception you know Irv you go back to the last couple of years talking about Oklahoma they've been a different team on the road Missouri intentions and beat them as they come back here and pick up a first down with play the year before they lost at Miami and Nebraska invincible in Norman yeah but not invisible on the road communication is so important to this tempo with Jones in the offense looks like they will go over get the ball going communicate thanks to the offensive line but then they has to make a judgment call and be on the same page within the hostility of these stadiums that are on the road safety or the pistol formation Royals wrestling it away makes the catch and Broyles moves the chains for the Sooners here Oklahoma had had to work for everything underneath they usually make a living on these underneath crows ball with behind Broyles he does a good job of adjusting and they can attend they come back to the left by Michael Harris the senior from Miami great job here recognizing the play they have tripped off to the field Mike Harris as soon as he sees the receiver the outside parts going to come out the block he knows the inside receiver Boyle is coming out on a swing pass he's got to be able to break in front of his offensive glass perfectly second and 12 almost intercepted on the deflection right linebacker Christian Jones is sitting there and Oklahoma is very lucky that he didn't catch it where to see Landry Jones hurried he is hesitant he is hurrying and it has a lot to do again with the way they're mixing up their look within this defense they're matching up on the underneath of the easy bro the crowd staying right in it as loud as they can with the shooters on the field hit on the release but he still gets it off for a first and ten and he finds Ryan Broyles the young man from Norman Oklahoma another big catch for him well this is as big as it gets on third down and Landry Jones shows the toughness to fit in the pocket he finds his man breaking for any earned at that time 22 yards pump fake by Jones going to go deep down the far side got a man open at the end zone Phil's present touchdown Kenny Stills what a pair of hands the importance of catching a football with your hands a little pump fake and it got Greg Reed to bite on it and walk out strong kenny field hands are to be able to secure that football is underthrown a little bit late look how strong it is to secure it and bring it down for a touchdown now Stephens on the field seven catches for a hundred and twentyfive yards for stills including that unbelievable grab in the first half Stephen splits the uprights two big plays 22 yards to Broyles 37 yards to still and Bobby Stoops is happy again what a fate Marcus donor we welcome you back there's the young man he put the Sooners ahead one of the three big players on this team come to think we can't until big plays in big games and that's what those two did without much but now it is the Noles turn looking for a big play Greg Reed is going to come out and read out close to the 20yard line press speaking of Greg Reed he's going to try to match up this time with stills who's not going to get fancy he's going to go down the sidelines but I won't really want you to focus on Gregory Gregory who's a great corner see how he steps up that he had to take right there and I don't think he anticipated stills getting behind him if he has such confidence in his ability to stay with receivers do Kenny feels as a rare exception gets behind him adjust back to the ball has the hands to be able to hold on to that football those a 43 guy yeah you'd better respect that fief first down and 10 briquette still in the game and why not three drives he'll go on the touchdown a onehopper incomplete it will be second down and 10 for the nose no reminders that right after this game stay tuned on these ABC stations for your late local news or you can switch over to SportsCenter for postgame analysis and all the scores and highlights from around the country West Virginia hanging on against the game Maryland game of the fourth quarter and now the Mountaineers will go home and host LSU in Morgantown next Saturday second down and 10 Trickett on that slant and Rodney's fifth in a footrace and Rodney's a veteran a junior from Miami and he has some veteran skill at that wide receiver spot they're coming up with different ways to get the ball out of the hand to trick it as quickly as they can whether it's a fade down the field different types of Springs this time as you said they get it to Smith who shows some pretty good acceleration coming around the field and getting to the corner being able to pick up some big yards it's a big drive here obviously with for Florida State now down a touchdown under six and a half minutes to go and gets because of the momentum of the game switch so drastically after that touchdown by the Sooners let's connect it down at the 33 yard line Grinnell Lewis wraps him up but there was blitz pressure coming from the right they've been bringing Aaron Colvin a lot they had brought him to the offense his left along with Tony Jefferson and this is what you lose with Trickett he doesn't have the mobility and what you'd also remember he's playing at about a hundred and eighty pounds up there out there against this Oklahoma defense when he takes off the run with it it's survival mode he's home free he's found praise value heart second to 13 as time to pluck tenor diving interception at the 46yard line is Javon Harris the young man who made the mistake on the big touchdown pass to green he comes back and comes up with the big turnover and press that's big for Harris he struggled a couple times against Tulsa in week one sees the tip and how about the effort here in the athletic ability to adjust back to the football and secure that interception five and a half minutes remaining number one in a dogfight with the Florida State Seminoles welcome back to Tallahassee reminders stay tuned for the Ford wrap up after the game reminder fans to log on to the BCS tailgate calm for your chance to win the ultimate tailgate f150 so that'll be right after this game here in Tallahassee 2013 Oklahoma leads Florida State after the second interception of the night by Javon Harris now scoops to the suitors we'll see what they can do against the clock here they're up against a backup quarterback 528 remaining oh you with all three of their timeouts they lead it by seven the pressure is on the other side down by seven and scoops would like to knock some time off this clock and finish this with a kick either an extra point or a field goal if he can here give himself a little daylight second down and seven Whaley is the Oklahoma running back found daylight for a first down to the 38 yard line Harris makes the stop he follows a doubleteam off to the right side here hey Byrne and Evans a nice job Lane Johnson did such a good job as well along with Donald Stevenson at time when a respect thing run still over able to open up a huge hole and whaling they would float through it inside a 439 milk supply start motion with millet run behind it Whaley is jammed around the 25yard line too short of that first diary I know how much you and I think of them which we think of Miller here and even when he doesn't carry the ball watch the lead block on the corner Mike Harris how'd you like to be a tailback he may have locked onto Harris a little bit but that's okay he got away with it he's able to push him almost to the sidelines when Bob Stoops says that Millard may be the best fullback we've ever had since I've been a head coaches Oklahoma that says a lot against them good one absolutely second down now what picking away on the nose Whaley fangs for the first down first of the 20 yard line and Williams you can't give up with your Florida State you gotta keep fighting they've played so well defensively and each time Oklahoma is able to get a first down not only they work in clock they're making it that much easier for Jimmy Stephens to be able to put this game potentially out of reach you gotta keep fighting or Stoops expecting everything out of this defense this is where the no badly need eternal sooner is knocking on the door of the redzone a57 clock is winding down that's one of the reasons why Bob Stoops is thinking with this running back this is what caught his attention in a scrimmage a while back Oklahoma normally says a fellas who is that never read out there the coaches alway ladies were walking on he came and asked us for a chance they watched him a little bit more the one thing they noticed he didn't fumble the second thing they noticed he would block for the quarterback so they gave him a chance he had four touchdowns against Tulsa and here he is tonight coming down the stretch as their number one floorcare when ball security is uppermost in the Oklahoma thought process right now do not give it up and he just burrows in behind the left side of that on the line I think when you look at all the backs on their longterm play and Finch and even Brandon when it's Whaley because of the weight he's been able to put on and he's maintained his speed he's got the best combination of skills the power to be able to come into a game late lake like this when you're trying to work the clock aerial coverage provided by Goodyear here tonight everything Goodyear has learned making tires for superior performance inspires what they roll in two years Goodyear more driven well our Saudi big picture here today take a look at it early some big games today and since the Brys and clench didn't able to take care of Auburn a slow start but they really came on strong and family watching the true freshmen look good big win for Notre Dame their first one of the year in state and maybe the most impressive team the Florida Gators at home join a lot of see the Miami Hurricanes at home to get jacory Harris back and the other two her suspended Travis Benjamin and they knocked off the Buckeyes in dominating fashion 24 to fish third down and two we'll get there now it's going to be up to scoops to attempt the field goal here to give himself a 10point margin and on the other side of the ball if ever there was a time when you wanted to block a field goal and you had a way to do it this is the time one way they can stay in the game clearly here with 2:05 remaining is to block Jimmy Stephens field goal attempt easier said than done he gets it off pretty good at this distance this is where a veteran team on the road ranked number one dealing with some hostility this is where you expect them to come through you want to be ranked number one you want to deal with that bull's eye show the maturity to be able to handle that they made the big drive late to be able to get the lead to get the football back after the interception by Harris and now they methodically work the clock with a veteran quarterback put Stephens in position now to be able to make a simple hoop see if he can execute Austen woods is a snapper Wow it was low but it goes across from 31 yards and that gives us suitors at ten point lead but you believe that looking ahead for Venables was you got to be kidding me on the height on this would look at this it's a line drive and flickered Landry over here now get a Kron oh oh okay oh are we gonna vote oh come on La Hire Oh whoa not so glutton filming it he's like whoa my now he's got two minutes for this defense in the it has been a punishing defy both these defenses deserves praise here tonight but Oklahoma has been punishing they have handed out one hard hit after another knocked a quarterback and a wide receiver completely out of the game created three turnovers five sacks and you're going over your receiver wanted a destroyer and Gregory so read and join or go back great return and a quick strike to put them back in business but they've got to move quickly now Florida State has exhausted its timeouts is read and he's down at the 15yard line and look who the young man who was hurt early Kenny Shaw has come back and what a what a great picture that as that is we've we saw him carried off on a stretcher taken to an ambulance we'll hospital and as Tom Rinaldi reported that's you the tests were all good and and here is the young man he got sandwiched catching the ball at the goal line and took some kind of blow Thompson on the field here the cricket DJ Manuel an old starting quarterback also driven out the game and that ticket goes down at the 10yard line Jefferson was in there when I loved the Blitz you've got the 10point lead instead of being conservative and sitting back in prevent you got an inexperienced quarterback bring the house and that time Tony Jefferson comes up with a sack number six tonight for the Sooners second down George backer gets the defense and it'll be third down coming up you think about what this does for the Sooners it puts them on track the stalker spot in the Allstate BCS National Championship game in New Orleans now doesn't mean they're going to get there they still got to play the schedule they got some tough games still ahead of them but this is a big step forward for Landry Jones and the Sooners I think they convinced a whole lot of people tonight that the defense their defense is for real get ready to plan you get you get ready to take some licks from these dollars they've got a lot of time fires high and this one is blocked and now it is fourth down and 17 and this could be the last snap of the night for the nose Jimbo Fisher trying to make up his mind on what he wants to do obviously you got a go for this but the play clock already starting to move and crickets going to have to be able to get up here and you know Oklahoma is going to pin their ears back and come after him one more time from the end zone incomplete Oklahoma takes over and the Sooners will leave Tallahassee with their second win of the season as still makes a couple of huge plays here tonight especially the one that put them up by seven when the game was tied Brent Venables the defensive coordinator with work who played a great game look at that I don't think Venables is happy with what he did it on their play yeah ancient saying avoid that personal foul potentially with a late hit on a quarterback on third and long but you know I'm gonna make it excuses for Florida State but when EJ Manuel went out of the game the game plan changed the vibe in the stadium changed and triggered did a nice job at the backup but it's a totally different game and Brent Venables defensive approach without that mobility from manual changed when they decided to just start attacking Rick hugs my Trickett now here's the key for the Knowles and Jimbo Fisher Harvey talked about it don't let the season go down the drain just because of one loss yes for the tough loss it was a big game we were ranked number five but there's still the ACC title up ahead of us that we can go for we've got plenty of time we hope that Manuel is going to be healthy along with Shaw get read get everybody healthy because you don't want to let one defeat turn into too ain't going to be the critical thing for the Seminoles they go to Clemson next week a team that right now is playing with a lot of compound so they win against Auburn today so the favorite formation of any offense the victory formation impressive number one team on a road tough environment early in the season only second game of the year I think you're right I think they definitely made a statement justified that number one ranking yet or question well we're going to see a team that's up there and has its sights set on New Orleans next week when we go see LSU take on West Virginia when was the last time you did it gave a Morgantown river then it been a few years but anyway that's it's an FEC like atmosphere that'll be fun let's go down to Erin Andrews with Coach Stoops no wait a minute friend he's having a moment there with his brother mark I noticed I know that's never easy for any coach would you just say dear brother Mar fair I just said I love you he said the same thing and you know I heard phone but they played a great deal they're a good team they've done a great job hardfought game nothing to be you know everybody should be proud and and you know I know it you know his defense really quite well supposed to be talked about at the beginning of the game what kind of challenges a hospital environment like this would create for your team what impressed you the most with how your campaign will be at birthday tonight obviously the fourth fourth quarter when when we all of a sudden the crowds on you they tie it up and when we come back continue my offense with the big drive defense gets the turnover we knew ended up the clock and get a bill go so I'm really proud of how particularly after advance to developing the headers thank you thank you sir all right all right Aaron thank you very much and there you have it the number one team in the nation comes in to Tallahassee and herby they were impressive winning it by 10 23 13 and I thought Bob Stoops made a very astute point about the point in the game when the crowd really got into it Florida State had just sided third down Landry Jones stood in there dealt with the traffic made a great throw and in the very next play coming back and he finds Kenny Phil's oneonone and stills goes up and makes the catch for the touchdown and that is going to do it next Saturday on Saturday Night Football on ABC 8:00 Eastern we will be in
