============================================================

this will be a madhouse on Lake Mendota Wisconsin Camp Randall Stadium in full big game mode as the Ohio State Buckeyes collide with the Wisconsin Badgers two of the four top 10 teams in the big 10 a warm but moist night as we say hello NES p.m. 7 Football on ABC and this presentation of the Big Ten on ABC hi there Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit Sam ponder will join us on the field this should be fun for that every visit to Camp Randall is a lot of fun Ohio State will try to conquer all this atmosphere they're one of the great road teams we've seen in this sport 19 straight true road wins in a row for Urban Meyer here when all the games by 21 points Kirk this will be a challenge definitely a challenge and it's a hostile environment I think Ohio State really not just 19 and owner Urban Meyer I think the game earlier this year playing Oklahoma on the road has created a lot of confidence and the other thing is it's a young football team but they have a great leader in JT Barrett and I think JT Barrett comes in and I think he just he has a way of not just putting up numbers he has a way of this being a calming influence on that young skilled it's around him he'll need to be able to be outstanding tonight for Ohio State to have a ability to win the game on the road here's a couple things that he needs to do tonight this last week recognition of the Blitz not only the Blitz but man's the man on the outside so you can see makes the check the line of scrimmage gets the speed option called the great call against mantoman now we just have to read a defensive end if you get it pitch it keep it the end goes up so he keeps it underneath you can see the mantoman pressure downfield back to the ball he picks up big yards the bertigo attack if he gets corners from wisconsin isolated one on one something he struggled with last week he'll have to be able to be very accurate throwing the ball down field because Wisconsin is going to load up to stop that powerful Ohio State running game Chris I think JT Barrett and those receivers will have oneonone opportunities will they be able to capitalize well to wait and see and can they keep Curtis Samuel busy such a versatile weapon but only nine such as it gets Indiana they want to make him a lot busier tonight in this game so versatile you'll see them lined up in the backfield you'll see em lined up as a slot receiver the line of milk is a flop motion and back into the killed along with Mike Weber keeping both of them at the same time back there and attacking in a different way so yeah he's a very versatile player somebody they're going to try to take advantage of Badgers defense told us if Barrett's going to carry the ball all those times and when they can feel every carry they're without three starters but they're still playing great defense only five touchdowns allowed this year this defense I think really exploded onto the scene in the game against LSU could see the personality the team there's Jack vichy PDI's he loves to make plays number 48 now look at this this pj1 same unit linebacker look at the intensity and look out focus very different approach but they set the tone and I think they create a real belief throughout the entire defensive unit they're not intimidated by Ohio State this is this teams played LSU Michigan State in Michigan they have a bye week to get rested two weeks to prepare and their minds in this stadium they feel that they can match up and play well both these defenses are fun to watch they play with passion and energy you know Ohio State's defense will try to corral Alex Hornibrook a young quarterback a redshirt freshman who's played just three games now as a starter well I think he's going to have to be good with his decision this is a game last time he played against Michigan he struggled with his accuracy they also struggled around a football we'll have to keep a close eye on him tonight the Buckeyes and the Badgers in Rock and Camp Randall coming up coming off the loss exactly in our mouth I feel like we have a lot to prove two vacant houses yet the best people in the country goin toetotoe two teams a lot of statements of your Street claimants hey Mark you look like Derek slitting brother it happens everyone dare Harry effect so welcome to the Nissan pregame rush nissan premier partner of the Heisman Trophy we're getting ready for Ohio State and Wisconsin stambha right here with Matt Brown and Mark mail let's show you what's happened earlier today starting with the number one team in the country Alabama taking on number nine Tennessee's hadn't won nine and are over the balls Tennessee punting down 35 Kidd and Eddie Jackson does the rescued some great blocking here on the punt return this is the 11th non offensive touchdown for the Crimson Tide but the key was the running game they rushed for 438 yards on the road and helped Tennessee the 27 who had unboxers for the Volvo NC state runnerups had Clemson Wolfpack missed the field goal in the final seconds of regulation that would have wanted and then in overtime down 7 Brian Finley picked off by Marcus headless Clemson so for 24 17 Nebraska Indiana fourth quarter Nebraska up 1715 a terrific job here throwing the ball long Tommy Armstrong to you what a great catch and score by Stanley Morgan Jun where'd he go to high school Matt I think staying on with you the best I remember a few years after two years after but you were better you were faster just decided to take a different run no not really Baylor over Kansas 49 to 7 and West Virginia 4817 over Texas Tech both those teams still perfect on the season as well all right Wisconsin had an extra week to prepare for this game are they ready I think Wisconsin's ready I really like what Justin Wilcox is doing on defense but Oklahoma has been to Norman they've been a tough environment before they won the game convincingly talked Urban Meyer he's worried about man coverage got to hit some balls deep I think he wins mark the extra week of preparation Alex Hornibrook the young Russian freshman quarterback getting him ready the defense only given up 12 points a game along with Johnson in this game fresh TJ why five and a half sacks on a season getting it done defensively close football game upset with stocker shy we'll see at half time out to Camp Randall all right Stan thank you the Badgers tell us this is the best thing about playing at home the entrance to that tunnel a new light show this year pounding music and they take the field to YouTube where the streets have no name what they've waited for all week both these teams have looked forward I've been looking forward to coming into this game on Saturday night and now it's right here there is a special electricity to night games at Camp Randall can the Buckeyes conquer it Badgers haven't been a home dog since 2010 when the upset number one Ohio State this has been the Nissan pregame rush kickoff from Madison is next but first a look inside the Sonde's Heisman House welcome to dr. pepper championship drive game of the week welcome to Camp Randall as we get ready for the Buckeyes and the Badgers and with the head coach Urban Meyer coat no doubt scissors a big one what is the last message you wanted your team to hear before they ran out of the tunnel it's got to be stupid strength stupid strength is for those people you love if you're close theme play as hard as you possibly can gonna be a great game you know you're going to see a lot of man coverage tonight what's the key to being successful against this Wisconsin defects the receivers got stuff I got a game sup raised a very good secondary a lot of minute coverage after supper we'll see you Thank You Jared going to be a street fight des Meyer who is a mere 55 in fort around state Wisconsin won the top deferred so PJ a south key will kick it away and over 21 for all out state Paris camel ride a 91 yard return the key play against Indiana will not get a chance it is good way through the end zone here comes JT Barrett is boys leadership Kirk in this tough environment yeah it really distraught that mixes the drink for Ohio State a great leader couple things that he needs to do tonight number one he's got to provide the leadership Solanas you surround him in a hostile environment quarterback one has to be a factor when that quarterback runs a factor they get mantoman on the outside and they need to reestablish the deep ball wouldn't surprise me at all after his struggles the week ago thrown the ball where he was going 9 at 21 you throw turbines at receivers need to get separation do not be shocked to feed him early take some shots chops to test his secondary empty backfield for the Buckeyes first play Samuel a versatile welcome emotion into the backfield and of course pays to the communication will have to do with the Baptist crowd noise Samuel runs into heavy traffic and the tackle is made by the linebacker TJ Edwards Turk the chickfila impact players you just got to look at one of them that's Curtis Samuel we talked about his versatility and how he can make so many plays from different spots also Pat elf line and Center a leader an experienced player on the other side TJ watt and also the other corner told him Felton from the pocket Barrett Bryce chriskate does make a man miss he doesn't slide folks he dives headfirst just about a half yard short of the marker to third down previous protection here one of the things we're going to keep an eye on young offensive line you've got a couple veterans and Billy price and Pat elf line the other three so kind of feeling their way they have played in Norman but being able to communicate and protect the quarterback a big team for Ohio State in the early going invading the backfield dispirit Julie the outside linebacker makes the stop expensive defense into play but it is a first down he just shoots a gap anticipating something with Thompson has been great on all year third and two or last third in the country and they feed Samuel already he's been very busy what would one touch in the first 25 snaps against the Hoosiers that was a different plan tonight yeah and again once you pick up that initial first down you'll see that the uptempo approach approach from Katy Perry whereas looks to throw far side was Noah Brown couldn't come up with it curtain five out see they want to get the ball out of the hands quickly on JC Barrett but even trying to do that he still was feeling those linebackers pitch he whom he talked about in the open he is TK watt will get after number 16 when he drops back to throw five receiver look Samuel in your flat Madras was poor and their destruction sighs Connor Phoebe the defensive end there to wrap up the quarterbacks in about ghazal part he comes from the outside on his stunts but watch the Blitz right there by TJ one occupied two offensive lineman just long enough they get by the true freshman Michael Jordan but it was a welltimed blitz by TJ wanted send it up and Alvey Barry Alvarez fired up first full sack of the season for Sheehy Aaron Johnson is allamerican punter and 40 Clement the running back is back deep but got some punt grooms to the end zone here's Alex Hornibrook Kirk first three starts of his career on the road East Lansing gets the win a tough one three interceptions on the road in the big house and now Ohio State at a routine starts your career now you can see great size you know and I think those are those games and the experience the Michigan State against Michigan gives him some confidence early down playaction pass they have struggled to run the ball that could help him also he needs to be decisive he cannot hold the football I think a big thing for him when we talked with him yesterday I was very impressed you didn't feel like you're talking to a Freshman Fifteen kind of mature beyond his years he'll need that tonight to be able to be effective against Ohio State it's going to be a long game needs to be patient not a really excited oh guys Wyatt boys and a very fast learner obviously they fake it to Clement and the lefty 100 rolls out and makes a nice throw and that's cool to Magali his numberone weapon the tight end up near midfield quickly he has the best hands on a team he's lined up right here just a sail round I think this is the route that Hornibrook feels the most confident with I love how they move him get him on the run get him away from potential pressure and a throw that he's very comfortable with drawing it to his favorite target and a bit tight in for a big game we get 28 on the first play with his Clement he gets the corner hurdles a man gets inside the Ohio State 40yard line the Badgers running game unfairest irately has really been struggling so far this year he poor climate able to get around there and he is one of our chickfila players to keep an eye on also the big tight end kogami he also already made a big play getting downfield and fro hioh stated great quantum annealing needs to do a very good job of leading that front and mallika malik hooker has done a great job himself being able to read the eyes of quarterbacks and make big plays and coming up with a number of interceptions from the AI its Clement again and the senior from New Jersey in averaging under four yards of carry a very frustrating start for him but they can get the running game going tonight you like their chances photos interesting to Paul Chryst and Joe Rudolph the Alpha coordinator talked about during the bye week he in the office of mine worked on their timing just trying to make sure he's becoming more patient not always looking for the home run letting that offensive line try to establish the block and then try to look for a crease and try to pick up as many yards as you can second and seven as jazz Peavy to receiver emotion he's got supporter TV hit hard captain around but Mark John Latimer but it's another first down another good call here by Paul Chryst second time they've been able to get outside of that edge contain watch the two tight ends to the top they do a nice job of setting it step this along with Fumagalli the ohio state relying on the corner on the other side Lattimore to come over and eventually push Peavy out of bounds go with bouncing right now on a very impressive Drive to start this game nobody has found the end zone against the Buckeyes defense in their opening possession so far this season run again does Joseph pace it picks his way on the right side and burns about four yards keep in mind everybody wants to point the finger at the youth on the offensive line because Wisconsin has not been able to run the football the way they're accustomed to running and they are young upfront but it's about all of it coming together the offensive line in the timing of the of the running back you can see against LSU Michigan State in Michigan you talk at three point two three yards in two point five yards and caring and just here early in his game point when it feels a little bit different the way he's running he's now spelled by darae Oh give wale who gets the pitch runs right to your wallet offenders their grandma Joan at the defensive tackle stop them it'll be third down adjustment by Luke Bickle they're coming with some pressure nice blitz there he brought his safety update in lab anticipating that Wisconsin may run the football as a blitz the kind of a blitz that you would expect against the run the wrinkle this year the pickles helped out by Greg Schiano both offensive coordinator from the Rutgers head coach and errors that go on the staff a big part of a defensive plan leave six is pressured and we'll go down the one stack for each team that was Nick close up the true freshman Ellen late flag comes in and of a skirmish after the sack oh so already with three sacks in his rookie season following in Joey's footsteps out of Fort Lauderdale he's done Willard after the play sideline warning Ohio State for Salas so I say folks got excited came on the field not a penalty and the sack does make it pour down Chris Nick Bosa continues to just get better and better on the inside here watch him watch the movement and the power that he has and being able to extend his arms against the right guard Ben Shaw and just guy that had an ACL about a year ago they've been trying to ease him into the lineup you can see the power that he has that pass rush Andrew Endicott is the new picker for Wisconsin after the injury to Huff al ghul Iannone back surgery very inexperienced kicker from 46 yards flies it through he's a great story didn't kick a field goal his entire high school career until the allstar game kickoff specialist who is two for two in his life not bad 46 covered Bigfoot the Badgers of three nothing lead productive opening drive for Wisconsin Wisconsin a three nothing lead dr. pepper championship drive game of the weekend opening possession where they gain 28 on the first down pass and then ran the ball six times 46 yard field goal from Endicott now the second possession for Barrett and the Buckeyes coming up now she has a very strong leg and I think he may deny the Ohio State returns all night all the lost production from its Ohio State offense 14 players up last year's team I think in the NFL with the budget that's getting not only playing in the NFL a lot of them are starting and add all this up and discard al Jones we look at the rushing Lindsey Kelly at all the receivers nearly 80% of both receiving and the rushing and I think when Ohio State expected was that they knew that they have recruited well and that they had an abundance of talent they was their turn to step up and a key for Urban Meyer has been having a veteran like Katy Perry to be able to help them settle in it's the old 41 passing the opening series offensive lid up Oklahoma but struggled last week against Indiana and bearable growth plan the catch is made wrestled down is Noah Brown amended by sojourn Shelton clearly Ohio State going with more quick game approached and some anything we've seen from them earlier this year I think it has to do with the respect they have to the pass rush that they'll be seeing tonight from Wisconsin just trying to get JP Barrett into a rhythm here early in the game pressure right up the middle by that Badgers defenses one glisten on fouryard gain from Mike Weber Edwards tackling a different wrinkle there when they went with a triple option they modish voted motion her to Samuel for receiver back into a two back running back look and see Jamie Barrett reading the in man on the line of scrimmage something I'm sure they'll go back to again and if the defensive end collapses he's able to pull it out and I just run it could have the threat of been pitching it as well second and six to five in market want left out to the right three Samuel cuts it back not much room Alex jeans on the deck it will be third down I love the way these linebackers in his front seven plays I mean they play with a chip on their shoulder they play within a bunch of confidence and they trust one another but guys do not stuff to do the badness tried to and had to run guys back on not quite set it's beginning to play but they're just have to throw it away and now apply it comes down Alec James pressuring the flag was way away from the play in the pit there could have been a lineman downfield and there is no foul for an eligible player downfield so again Badgers pressure defense gets Ohio State off the field and Ohio State electing to go fast like that to try to catch Wisconsin offguard I think by rolling him out it's either there's really one receiver there are nobody and the receiver is covered there was pressure and all JT bear could do is throw it away is Johnston the Anzhi again and Clement who has not been the regular punt returner to the Badgers this year is back deep a low kick from the fields of F of six cannot escape any flag comes down so the Badger is going to be backed up with poor field position after this penalty Eric lover Williams down for the Buckeyes to make the stop it's going to be a block in the back yes I could push in the back on the return pagará the corner who's out there on special teams so now a challenge for Hornibrook a productive opening drive done mostly on the ground return the illegal block in the back receiving team 10 after this is the goal first out time out so the ball will be at the 5yard line the Badgers will take over Clement already a pretty productive start to this game for the running back who came in frustrated Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by Neeta from their partner of the Heisman Trophy and Allstate proud supporters of college football it's good to be in good hands Goodyear providing aerial coverage committed to honoring GLIP worthy athletes to demonstrate hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff good to see the blimp up and flying tonight there is a chance of a thunderstorm that could arrive 2nd 3rd quarter tonight and certainly be heavy enough to impact this game Badgers have to be very careful now second possession backed up at the 5 yard line after the penalty on the return see how Paul Chryst the head coach and play caller decides to try to attack here as you said Chris backed up deep into his own territory moving and shifting presnap to see it at all night his Plymouth running left for a plummet as the corner breakfast tackle sidelines in the clear season for a run like that by far Wisconsin's biggest play but he wants the ball at the end he lost the ball and David Webb running with it for Ohio State in the far sideline was he stripped before he went out obviously they're going to take a close look at this to see if his shoulder was down or if he stepped out of bounds before the ball is out Chris Worley chased him down and makes the strip that summit tries to hold on what ball is out and it's a matter but I get a sideline yeah I think the ball did come out before we went out of bounds but it'll get hit on the sideline ruling on the previous play as the fumble recovered by the defense forced out Ohio State overnight now we could talk to Dave Kataya about this but I can the first look keep an eye on the football I think the ball does come out before he goes out of bounds boy set the tough angle be his needed hit down first but I think the first look showed the ball kind of coming out he was trying to hold on for dear life with two arms yeah balls out there like throw up now it's just a matter of where does it bounce hips off of his knee and Fidel Dave khatai how would you see that if you were Stephen Beckman in the replay booth well right now it's clearly as fumble as you got he said but the shot is that players knee is blocking the ball to see if it it's a sideline or not we need to take some more looks at this but if they can't get a shot it shows the ball hitting the sideline they're going to have to stand with a call on the peel that one shot doesn't show us a lot solo ever had it's you can see they even wonder if if he touches the ball while he's out of bounds and knocks it back in bounds is that what would the call be there if he touches it will the fall is while he's out of bounds he's put the ball out of bounds and the offense keeps the ball so if the balls in bounds while he touches it keep an eye on this David definitely the he's out of bounds now himself the ball is may be inbounds does that impact anything at all if the ball didn't go out of bounds take a look at his foot right up there take a look at his left foot and if he hits that if that left foot yes while he's laying out about she's put the ball out of bounds because you're touching procedes possession I think he clearly touched it with the look like it his left foot pressing and Herbie so you would say they're going to be Ohio State ball but take away the long return there yeah let's take a look at this one more time all right you can see his hand on the sideline right there and his forearm right there you see him touch the ball to me that's put the ball out okay so they've retained possession then at work before it's recovered that's what I'm seeing in my opinion yes good luck a lot of stuff to look at it one fly after further review it was a fumble however it touched the player while he was out about therefore by Royals don't first ten losses of the game five to seven minutes 14 seconds joyluck for telemetry Chris Worley made it tremendously knocking it loose swipes nice to have Dave to tie up here with all he's got it all covered takes all the pressure off of Mayday we love you good that's 1/4 150 there was so Clement gallops down the sideline in by far the biggest play Wisconsin's had this season saved almost a goal line defense expecting run at 9 guys up there so in clinic got free nobody left there to slow him down for picking up big yards I've bar the longest way oh how states a lot from scrimmage so far this season first charge timeout of the half Wisconsin the whole time out so the Badger is up three in scoring position again as we take a break it's a big start tonight for this offensive line that's been sometimes questioned at left side that offensive line RAM check and döner do a nice job opening up a couple missed tackles opened it up for Clement to get down the sideline and pick up big yards that's something you don't see here Conley the corner misses in hooker has a chance to make a play he misses it two missed tackles on one play very very rare for Ohio State defense what are they under five mid tackles a game one of the best method apartment the last three years meanwhile Wisconsin in position these fans are relieved and thrilled to see the running game working early or what they expect to see it Wisconsin Clement gets a breather with that timeout and I think to talk about three yards 71 yards Arnett rushing against Michigan that was it almost that many on the one carry by c´mon it and I think Clemens taking the challenge from his coaches and along with the offensive line about how they have to run the football and see a couple big runs for Clement is open this up and already close to a hundred yards on the night rival state I think one of the adjustment is being able to set the edge Wisconsin getting to the outside of the Ohio State defense you fake a dick Clement Hornibrook looping it over the head and trying to come back and make the play was to pull back Alec Ingold quite able to track down that this is an example though Chris when you run you run you run now you go play action and watch him slide out you're expecting okay they're running the ball let's stop the run see how quickly he almost got out there is a good adjustment and good recognition by Chris Worley who actually recognized his lake but when you start running the football Bureau Wisconsin player and quarterback it affects the Ohio State linebackers and safety because they start forgetting about their assignments and opens up by action or the brook very accurate for that little sandwich could have been thrown better on the third and seventh in the pocket covers a touchdown and that was the boys and the accuracy but this freshman quarterback has shown in his first three start Wisconsin goes 95 yards in four plays and again today a quick strike for an offense that's been desperately searching for one all season here is the inexperience Andrew Endicott dat it is college career and the Badgers up by double digits Bart Houston the other quarterback known for his arm strength this a great throw by Hornibrook safety drops to the middle corner drops back here and here is Peavy who's just going to work right in between them for the throne watch how he gets between the crease of the safety in the corner when you make that throw it's got to be on a line with great arm strength he gets it over top of the nickel and right between web and Connolly as a heck of a throw and I'll tell you he's a rhythmic passer even felt pressure there and he still is able to deliver the ball with accuracy that's what he's known for we didn't see it when he went to Ann Arbor we had seen it so far tonight the Wolverines were able to pressure him made three interceptions but it's been a quick study and in two weeks to kind of work on things this entire office looks like a new unit and you could see the pressure actually got to him on as he was releasing the ball from Taekwon Lewis but he kept his eyes downfield and was able to throw in rhythm the huge run by Clement sets up the touchdown pass and suddenly Ohio State and Kenton trail though here in a tenpoint hole kickoff year week six NFL Sunday with ESPN ten o'clock Medfield insiders as the injury news will suck you need for your fantasy team eleven o'clock sunday NFL countdown picks ready to kick off both also on the West ESPN app keep in mind Ohio State is coming off a week where they could not find their passing game Jesse Barrett had a rough outing they relied more on running the football and now they're on the road and they've yet in this first quarter to get JD Barrett going and his wide receivers it's not just taking parents to receivers trying to get separation and also how high up it attacks will surprise me to see them try to throw a little bit more hair there's the handoff of Samuel and his prints around the end and get the first down they went to full quarters against the Hoosiers mid first to mid third without a passing guard last week incredible yeah and I think I think and talking to Urban Meyer he felt that the way the game was going the field position they just relied on them on running the football I like the safety Barrett on the ground and now the pressure delivers a short pass and the test is made over there by faith Jaina fill another verse out I think one of the things you do is a play caller and as a head coach you trust your guy thank you the guy he trusts is JT Barrett put the ball in his hand even with the slow start AJ Elkin first to get involved and make a play in Paris for a triumphant losses of all the Badgers do not come up with his Barrett is able to track that down lucky yeah he actually gave a tremendous effort that ball is not free I think bitch he actually got his hands on it 48 knocked that ball loose and now he's on his hands and knees trying to get to the football before TJ Edwards got a look and said she again call me gym rat to ball time he knocked that ball loose bear was able to pick up eight yards crawling the possession whoever to bounce it works hard to get three yards and another first down that this defense is is playing it probably as consistent as any defense in the country watch the outside linebacker work here trying to get off the block he does he gets right around dontre Wilson it's a heck of an effort by zach bond but also the corners are involved they're also involved in run support setting the edge they want to they were almost set a wall like a picket fence to not let Ohio State get around them where they try to run the football they've done pretty well that's all Wilson motes again Barrett fake fit through the look downfield that flips it over the head receiver at his parish Campbell's couldn't come up with it little misdirection therefrom on the Buckeyes facing a an offense that are a defense rather that is that is really flying to the football he's dontre Wilson that time kind of a jet sweep motion trying to get the defense out of position they did a nice job of covering the Buckeyes receivers downfield and Verint missing para scandal action game execution we're not looking for Ohio State 8205 for 21 yards in Paris he decrees takes off and close to the first down at the 32 before city got him with his fungus and rape on the yellow line and I'll move the six now Wisconsin has to defend Ohio State is that JT Barrett is a running back he's a quarterback but we saw last week he carried the football 26 times and their defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox saying that we have to respect him and in effect how we call the game because we got to make sure we have a guy not right amount of guys in the bottle then they fake it and Barrett takes off it's a straight run and he just barreled down near the 10 yard line the coat addiction stopped him good block here by the freshman coming around it's Michael Jordan watch him be able to make that block right there also lead block there by Mike Weber there's JT Barrett he is not necessarily the fastest at running Urban Meyer's offense but he understands the scheme he understands where the holes are and he's very powerful it was through tackles with Michael Jordan the original three freshmen with Michigan roots and at the 11 Darrin mr. Weber he with barrels straight ahead see if books from the quarterback and now they're running back with a quick first down inside the bottom in that same look they went to earlier it's a little bit of a different look for that tripleoption guys playing with tempo here second and three Barrett looks to throw in the flattest incomplete market saw the tight end was very well covered there Derrick Tindal the corner even if Paul made the catch there and he's probably have been help sort of getting into the end zone so they can make a first down at the one serving three from the poor hesitated and his drops were you looking to make a little pets jump past there there was certainly no room to run I don't see anybody that he was trying to throw the football to I think it was a play that was just disrupted how about TJ watch how fast he comes off the edge watch him right here sensing and anticipating the potential quarterback run the guards are pulled around Jordan didn't even have a chance because of the anticipation it's one thing to be an athlete it's another thing to be smart and athletic and that's what what has runs in the wot family doesn't it this is Tyler Durbin a very very reliable short yardage kicker who knocks it through Ohio State 67 yard drive in 11 plays but certainly disappointed to have it stall down inside the 5yard line an offense that scored 21 touchdowns in their 29 red zone appearances so the Buckeyes don't answer with seven but they got some things going in it it looks like similar game plan it's going to be a lot of number 16 running the ball at least so far yeah and I think until they're able to find a rhythm and they're in their passing game watching here early all the Ohio State receivers one way to slow down an aggressive defense is to try to get behind them but get with contact credit they are holding up outstanding and man demand pressure right now and it makes it a lot tougher when you're trying to be able to throw the football but you can't get down fear so you're loading up on JT Barrett and on that running in advance is well aware of whatever Myers pointed out there offense is predicated on successful deep shots right many servi of horizontally but bear getting the ball downfield those receivers getting separation against men if they don't do that yeah it's a horizontal attack brutal vertical attack and a power run game but it starts with their ability to throw the ball downfield when they're really humming Urban's kick sails to the endzone de Samantha ponder yet Christmas miss Ohio State defense came off the field they were seemingly in a sweeter shock the position that they're not used to being in hanging in their heads really quiet on the sidelines their defensive coordinator looks luke fickle really got after him then you've got to keep your head in this game the message was settled down and I know this is going to come as a shock but we have got to tackle just getting back to fundamentals because it's kind of foreign territory for them on the road could be struggling too early like this it sure isn't definitely weird when they start missing tackles that has been their calling card as a defense but this is a an experienced group as well as they played a lot of guys are not familiar terratory big conference game on the road for the first time clemont's been through the middle and another productive first down run before Lattimer reporters often another rare miss tackle that time by the middle linebacker Raekwon Macmillan Corey Clement looks like a different back tonight it reminds me of how he looked two years ago he was a sophomore backing up Melvin Gordon he was very very effective back last year battled through injuries and and this year slow to start a good talk with Juan day in the Heisman Trophy where yesterday he just echoed what Paul Chryst had said of what Clement himself had said he was just off his game mentally not not trusting the offensive line not running with patience went through that time it'll set up third and short but when the guys up front were very very young are now opening typical Wisconsin hole that you can get in the running backs head right absolutely absolutely and it really puts all with all of your production on a redshirt freshman quarterback in an offense that isn't necessarily equipped the past in obvious situations when they do well is when they throw early on first and ten a little playaction and then get back to being able to run the football it's a big third down here early in this game eightythree morning Brooke look to the direction of oguns lolly who's there third down back but he was well covered by Raekwon Macmillan both suppress him in a fourpound say this is big news to watch Nick VOSA the true freshman it seems like in the last couple weeks just Unleashed him on third down they bring him in as part of their nickel package and right now he is having his way with boban shawl that right guard he's a sophomore and BOCES known as a young true freshman for his power but you can start to see his knee is getting healthier and healthier and he also has great suddenness to him as well the best key to punt not very long and the fair catch is made there by Dante Wilson what's cool about Bosa he comes in with the big name and all the hype they say how humble he is what a good listener his own there's a lot of veterans at that position who can teach him things and he's been eager to learn it was incredible to hear jaylen Holmes talk about that how he comes in he's determined to learn and listen to the older players of course his brother such a great career low high o state it's so many amazing things individually and part of so many great teams and now playing on on Sundays for the Chargers good to see him back and plan and they made a couple sacks in his NFL debut against the Raiders well against the Broncos afonya but a lot of these three coaches have been around say they the clothes as a true freshman he proudly comes in maybe even more powerful than when Joe came in Barrett back to work option look Samuel is it for a loss again hichy who wore the haircut from kind of a mullet to ammo box he made the move this week her clean shave with his big game on his he sure did there's a flag he's an engaging guy the former walkon the very steamships scrappy guy think about it gotta get the most out of his ability studies a lot obviously my umbrella to meet his game he told us that you know he's not necessarily the fastest guy and the former walkon he learned to really appreciate the work out after the play sidelines on your ferret 15yard penalty ii got a warning the first time watching that i think the referee who is falling the employers whistle hit Urban Meyer in the face on the sidelines there you get a warning in the second time cost you 15 and that is a costly penalty it moves them back to the 15yard line final minute of the first quarter they're backed up now near the Badger student section Lila's part of the stadium second and 27 I snap samuel again at the sidestep a defendant in the backfield that was julie with early penetration go back to that sideline interference to see urban meyer right here see the officials starts to call the play is dead and hit service the windmill upside the head it ya basta ohio state big yards pushes them back as wondering who the cousins didn't yell out but you can't yell anybody when you're the woman get your head and no fat good spot by our crew their third and 20 now Shattuck ten seconds in the quarter they don't have to stamp it and they won't fly does come out JT says the quarter ran out before the flight clock did if he's right prior to the false start the first quarter has ended timeout so Wisconsin with a hundred fiftyfour yards of offense for fall Kris against the tough defense back after this message in a work via local ABC station ten seven for Wisconsin then bridge success welcome back yes being Saturday Night Football on ABC this presentation of the Big Ten on Navy C top eight collision here and the Badgers and attend nothing lead Ohio say it answered with a field goal late in the first quarter what guys gets the ball back but it's been a struggle against an inspired Wisconsin defense so far for parity Sunday great he's been an effective runner but just super sick passing facing a third and 20 as we begin the second quarter to look fit Samuel cuts it back and flips down across the 30 well short of the first down a flag is out good me I'm calling third long to be a hold on oh hi Oh state receiver trying to blob receivers in this offense better beep good Walker's will earn the wrath of Urban Meyer said he'd the success KJ Hill that time here were 14 trying to make a block illegal block in the back offense number 14 that Pelle supply fourth down let me see Lana KJ he'll this season and that will not will not please the coaches there's a blonde right there and crab behold his jersey locked him in the back so Meyer head of 15 are friendly on himself interfering that penalty sends out a punter Johnston Clement had a big night running the ball again back deep giving a lot of respect to Johnson but this is kind of a short kick and not one of his better efforts it'll bounce out of bounds near the 21 yard line and that's where the Badgers will take over trying to stretch a sevenpoint lead what an opening corner for Corey Clemente it's been a rough start to the season the fire we've helped him get healthy work on his timing is a huge run backup folks whose own endzone shakes a couple defenders gets down the sidelines for a big game let's also give it a gift to the offensive line okay they could use that five week to get healthy but look at this 97 yards in the opening quarter 76 for those after contracting a great legacy curve at that school at that position he watched Melvin Gordon wait for his turn then explode James White same thing II thought this was his year after waiting to explode he wasn't healthy last year Badgers at their worst washing out put in about 20 years you see Melvin Gordon assists the bye week or the Chargers are I guess played Thursday so he's here keeping an eye on Clement my name is the TV on the Indiana jazz teasing's in the clear but back out near midfield to productive ones for the receiver tonight Ohio State playing a lot of mantoman which means Denzel Ward needs to run with Peavy you can steam in a background trying to run with him it's a great way to complement the inside power running if you don't always have the great vertical passing game you can stretch a defense horizontally and they've done that now a couple times with jazz Peavy number 11 he's got 40 yards in two carries and the 24 yard touchdown reception from Hornibrook he's their fastest receiver the one guy they thought could get separation could make a big down field play Oden wale and he's not really an optical power back more of a thirddown guy but a productive game again a nice confident played a lot of football year ago you know hiyo States been interesting they've lost contain they've not been able to set the edge quite a bit here tonight and win surprise me to see their edge pressure the defensive ends whether it's Lewis and Hubbard trying to we'll get upfield and trying to prevent with constants running game getting around the corner with Sam's Reformers a good winter you can see the look in the eye of the Ohio State defenders not over used to sin oh dude wall a short gain to be third down for the Buckeyes 44 to roam Baker one of the backup linebacker shackleton Vokoun dilwale he's played a lot of football by him coming in to be able to carry the ball I just play on third down it gives for a clinic arrest and if your offense you kind of need to maybe even a third back to be able to stay fresh for an entire 60 minutes and that Taiwan deal is out with an ankle again he's one of their guys they would rotate in and not available by them kuma golly in the back hill to the left of the quarterback morning Brooke Shay and back for a second time lost the ball remember the fall back on it Sam covered the sophomore from Cincinnati and that's that foot Hornibrook into obvious passing situations it's an advantage for Ohio State we have Lewis at the side at the top but look at Sam Hubbard just use a bull rush there to go right over top of David Edwards they have mixed a couple guys jacob maxwell and now David Edwards trying to figure it out you can see Edwards holds on to Hubbard and still unable to slow him down it's a big advantage for Ohio State to get Hornibrook into those third and passing formation he boots it away Wilson back peddling fields at the eight escape usually things around across the 20yard line so JT Barrett's still looking to get the passing game going back to work Buckeyes down a touchdown Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you a Pacific Life helping generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years and Coca Cola tastes the feeling again thanks the folks at Goodyear watching over the hard work and determination of blimp worthy athletes more than 60 years Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff earlier today Clemson certainly a strong playoff contender barely surviving four turnovers at home to beat NC state hardhitting defensive team in overtime yeah great game so Alabama and Tennessee play earlier and Alabama is continuing to to dominate went on the road into Knoxville and could control that game early we got number two on the road in a hole here they have been all night eris keeps it on the pocket takes his first shot downtown jump ball incomplete jindol running right with the receiver Terry McCarl Kendall did a good job of getting his eyes back that was key because the ball was underthrown GT Barron waiting a little bit too long to let this ball go and ends up under throwing it so his receiver by working back to it a lot of times you see in pass interference but indle read the eyes of the receiver macgowran came back to it and turned his eyes around and made the play go over the first two corners on this team or a start at both from Fort Lauderdale's Ken doll and soldier and Shelton there again from the pocket a lot of time nobody open and now just takes a shot down the peel that Markus bought a tight end they're talking about it spawning the ball again kept what an acrobatic play about a six five junior when they told her sixweek what a great athlete he is I think he got his left foot down which was an acrobatic catch look at that in bounds I put an effort only nine yard gain block guys playing with temple embarrass the look is it short to Paris Campbell was knocked down by Shelton immediately after a 7 yard game what an adjustment I call to turn around balls any areas that turn the other way go up make the play and get his left foot down this is more of what you really expected to see from yio state up temple throwing the ball being more aggressive in their play ball involvement is nice having a great jumping ability great speed for a fighting 55 pounds going up the air though I may connect option look again Samuel thexa Pickett is an immediate trouble and worn under for a fairly gloss that gone and Dakota Dixon the safety were there in a hurry they snuffed out the option again did they they sure did it was a reaction by Dixon and how quickly he was able to come in which was the key watch how quickly he reacts they're going to pitch off at this man but because of his approach now quickly he came down I'm sorry Wilson didn't have a chance to block Dixon because of how quickly he reacted probably play he saw hundred times this week during this the preparation he wasn't until it lost skin on that play so serving 13 Derek harassed draft escape still looking downfield and will throw it to Samuel who makes a catch and Ohio State converts on third and 13 Barrett is somehow staying alive PJ watt almost came up with the sack he walks around and gets around friend grabs on on a horse collar that they didn't call but this is where Katie Barrett improvising does he give up on the play and a nice job there by his main man there's main target her did Samuel getting his feet down they because what with grab of the Jersey the Wisconsin will spend a time out there because if it's in the pocket they don't then we'll call the horse collar but but Barrett's showing the strength is what time I was a half Wisconsin just like JJ has is known for those strong hands it's hard to get out of his grip they say heavy hands those heavy hands almost brought him down you're right watch Prince who grabs on to walk lots grabbing on to the grabb and everybody somehow Barrett stays up they still holding onto what I mean that that's hard it's hard to miss this kind of a hold he is he's locked onto him daddy whoa going to hold up and he's still grabbing his jersey Prince holding on for dear life but then at the other end the terrific catch by Samuel good job of JT Barrett Curtis Samuel eyes connecting and then eventually he waited just until the last second to throw that football they could tell you you don't see the officials Miss a holding call that obvious very often yeah that was a significant miss I mean he crafted by the jersey grabs in the second time and there is the horse collar there also because he didn't go to the ground and it's in the pocket so high on state but itself behind the six in it that 10yard lost then converts the third and 13 Samuel has been a huge impact player cause you suggested he would tonight he has really been DJ for heavy ice the top Barret collected look for Samuel in the air jump over his hand he has beaten the safety Dakota Dixon once again a deep shot not quite connecting but in first at 10 and that's an adjustment here little stutter and go that's a matchup that Ohio State wants to take advantage of when you get your better and Seaver against the safety Dixon's a great player but he's off by about 8 or 10 yards gets Samuel chance to build up his momentum give him a little shaking wide open they just want unable to pass in a common theme each that's just folks that not quite the last few games Barrett keeps it round forward it was about five more yards or to being sort out again incredible the versatility these outside linebackers and you think about the injuries Vince Biegel one of their leaders is out he's expected back in another week or so but here at Dooley who went five tonight pj1 these guys are interchangeable obviously what has special skill set and he's a relentless pass rusher but I've been impressed exceed his team he's first miner ticket to the season every single week you see that same approach and in same consistency from both sides not just from one side it's kind of a three receivers to the top got a hurry just snapped it and now Barrett looked over to the left and deliveries any complete we didn't spot it turkey tried to get it to KJ a hill in the fourth down and they went with trips into the boundary and there's a little bit of confusion by Wisconsin Urban Meyer's frustrated by that or not but I see Wisconsin panicking a little bit because they only had two defenders in that area you think JC would spot that but he looks immediately to the left so here comes Tyler Durbin senior from Virginia sprung 40 yards a chip shot earlier and this one curls in so Ohio State a 56yard eight play field goal drive to cut the lead to poor Castillo birth of your Taco Bell studio update Texas still looking for their first conference win taking on Iowa State after trailing 63 at the half they had two quick scores including the 75 yard touchdown by Devin Duvernay Texas up 17 six over on the Longhorn Network Chris Erbe back to you hi Cassidy thank you tickle pal for the long horn offense you get going that will make the long horn faithful impatient to say the least got to leave now you're in Camp Randall second field goal for Durban has chipped away at the Badger Lee they've really led throughout the night breeze blowing right to left helping all those hiccups if you bring in but they're crisp Alika tonight's applet could be a question thanks Chris whose constant of course between two teams this year right to the top 10 in game time who was the last Big Ten team to win three games in a season versus top ten team prior to the conference championship prior to the conference championship so three regular season top ten wins haven't been a ton of years when the Big Ten's had a whole bunch of teams in the top 10 now knocked off by one team I feel Iowa I get it you know that's not your final area 85 85 it's impressive that's right like accident percent money but now flips it short at the screen here to Fumagalli and the site and lowers his head for eyes first time yeah right there crooks impatient he wants to know if he's right with his Iowa guests time now to answer that out loud for me a question I'll check on Iowa for you in break but the answer is Michigan in 2003 beat top ten Purdue Michigan State and Ohio State all the control over in question three vision so Breezer a bonus question who is the quarterback on that team bear that was John the far wasn't it now I don't know what within the bar but pick that one up for me bonus questions BB again on the end around this players worked three times for Wisconsin a movie stick to the 40's when you run the ball inside inside inside your defensive linemen have to think about collapsing down waiting their gap what a great compliment for Paul Chryst is Jake Peavy running around the edge Ohio State continuing to lose that edge in PVE discontinued to pick up big yards not only through the air but also on the ground third time he's run the ball is already 48 yards this will timeout the industry to change that's a great name isn't it jazz BB been in tune tonight junu Kenosha Wisconsin chance Peavy is they're really the best vertical threat we saw him earlier with that touchdown pass yeah he only had four carries coming into tonight's game so they hadn't shown that a lot you get the feeling that the Paul Chris was going to show the Buckeyes defense some things they hadn't featured too much earlier this year this you expect to see I formation handout the Clements of the stiff arm and is finally slammed down by Chris Worley Springs on strength there one thing did for fans that are watching at home and they're watching Wisconsin Ohio State's defense a lot of different formations personnel groups they're moving tight ends from right to the left the receivers that are in motion because Ohio State has to adjust so much with their front and his secondary they're just trying to affect the Ohio State communication and you're trying to create a gap or hit a crease when they're running the football that's why they're giving them so many different looks they pictured the climb at this time I was around that left side for a short game to be occurred and by the way you were correct John Navarre was reported out from Michigan Missouri Paul Chryst made it very clear to us he said you know we can't just lineup and the same formation and run the football and have success against Ohio State's athletes we've got it we've got to do a lot of different stuff give them a lot of different window dressing to try to affect them it comes a third down keep an eye on on Nick Bosa who again is in the middle they're matched up against been shot those who wanted would seal our state's act so far morning Rick delivers strikes to Magali close down another accurate throw to a very reliable runner I should go to the outside and then back to the inside it's a great route Hornibrook in rhythm here there's a nice job because of the middle linebacker McMillan on the Blitz it opened up the middle and Hornibrook dipped in there patiently even though he's getting blitz and wait for his tight end to open up the tough guy hit his hand stepped on and practice before the over against LSU 30 stitches does this seem in the top 15 on the bottom this goes out employees against the Bayou Bengals no problems morning Brooke from the pocket checks it down oh good voilá is hit hard except about for Worley again on the stop you've been active and Luke fickle telling us a great story about Chris Worley talked so much about Ohio State losing all those great players to the NFL and collectively these guys a lot of new faces Chris Worley they said the great story guy who was a fourthyear guy has had to sit around and wait behind some superstars like guys like Darren Lee and Josh Perry and now it's his turn and he just seemed to have a great appreciation for it after sitting around and learning from some of those guys and now with his term coaches love those guys don't the other grinders patience pays off owners work and that time was not fine Rob wheelwright dress beyond his outstretched hands it'll be third down but again that that same look who were they throw it to the tide in earlier to Fumagalli this time they're trying to get it to the Columbus native real wheel ride is just a little bit beyond his grasp to be able to come up with a catch but the exact same kind of sail route where it's about 18 to 20 yards and bending toward the thigh line it's an open hole right now in that defense after is 205 so far on third down 24 that's up to the trampled mounted the downfield shot is complete down at the 10yard line Fumagalli again got free from Damon went to safety will complete hooker number 24 here takes his eyes off of the tight end I theory you can see him just in front of Fumagalli he got his eyes caught up because the quarterback looked like he might scramble his losses where Fumagalli is and he's able to sneak behind him how about the catch and then the chippy it's the tote out there to stay in balance and on the route he stayed inbounds great awareness there by anyone and Wickham protune lofted right in the perfect position the Badgers and a deployment he was cut down very quickly charging up into the gap there was a Lattimore the corner Badgers time to again be efficient in the red zone after this leave his for 12 the fourth time impressive 20 Brooke time women gutter set goes for the quarter and fours as a flag comes down well away from where climate was scampering I think he knows this one's coming back you right there on the offensive line Fitchburg holy offensive rating one 10yard penalty repeat second that's a good place when I put the side and said yeah that one's on me for Magali just grabs a hold of the jersey of Damon Webb seven you see right there grabs ahold of it official right on top of it but what a cut there the jump cuts by Clement before he got to the corner where the block was attempted by Fumagalli but obviously grabs ahold of Damon Webb and when you grab a jersey like that in the open I mean put your hands up like it wouldn't be that doesn't usually work it's almost like a Fallon basketball put me 1 min like him fining was spotted from a long way away but again pretty obvious he was the ball back to the 14 second ago morning Brooke caught up in traffic and able through a skate but not much they're back to the line of scrimmage we've overshot very probably it's just very rare to see this offense at this stage of the growth of where they are with the offensive line and a redshirt freshman quarterback dropping back call chris is a masterful job tonight mixing up the looks mixing up the formations to play calling jazz Peavy on the jet sweeps have Ohio State have been on their heels but the drop back puts a lot of pressure on that offensive line to be able to hold him hold the defensive line and that pressure out that time for the coverage set now risking will Chris and his quarterback be on third and goal back at the 14 whatever incomplete tried to find TV in the corner Amon Arnett was in publishing here comes Andrew Endicott for field all talk about when they when they drop back how this defensive line and obviously on third down they get it they're going to try to get after him they want to make him feel sometimes you don't always come up with a sack but you can affect him and Jalen Holmes does just that and by forcing him to throw that maybe just a little bit early although it's still pre accurate throw pretty good effort there again Endicott who was the backup victory at the beginning of the season was reliable the first time from 46 this is from the 32 and Endicott has kept up his halfway all getting a known he was a terrific kicker there was some concern when he had back surgery Endicott said hey don't worry about that I got this tomorrow 10:00 Eastern and if insiders followed by Sunday NFL countdown might have to kick off by the way up the road in Green Bay Packers the Cowboys tomorrow then Monday Night Football the gents and the Arizona Cardinals coverage begins at 6:00 Monday night countdown and then the kickoff at 8:15 also on the watch ESPN app Wisconsin three impressive scoring drives in this first half turkey they've got 252 total yards against a very stout defense have done a really good job with their attacking up to this point a temple hi Oh state I think I've been off balance with that offensive game plan miss cow ski boots it's deep and Paris Campbell's going to give it a go from two yards in fun down and shot short on the 20yard line so 243 to work with for Barrett is gives you a backstage pass throughout the weekend to see what goes on behind the scenes see these big football trucks Ohio State had the original 18wheeler to haul around the equipment these are the unsung heroes of the program these folks here yes a players you show up and everything's in your locker these guys do so much work to make sure everything set up as you're ready to go truck weighs 16,000 pounds and Blair Jr was a Buckeye walkon back in 82 the driver of that truck people on fiction but into a sevenpoint badger lead they pitched it to Samuel who has been extremely busy but the other baggage is starting to focus in on him City again with a tackle for loss in since she actually saw Samuel coming in motion and actually started to take off running before he even had his hands on the ball again anticipating looking around seeing things and doing their homework in film work to get them ready to play 48 heck of a player there in the middle and they're from the pocket looking down feel for Noah Brown his well well cover by filter and Shelton he's undersized he's generously listed at five nine but he's a tough guy that beat deep and has great technique doesn't that change the veteran honey where he started we called a game one year he was a freshman has a lot of confidence from Fort Lauderdale love to be on an island he is undersized to get a good look at it there next to know around who's sick to put up dead Chris Ohio State two years ago had Evan Smith last year they had gone blank Braxton Illogan of course Michael Thomas to kick it right down field and while Noah Brown had success against Oklahoma he's more of a physical guy that's going to help fight you for the ball they're still trying to find that guy who can get downfield they've got to hurry Urban Meyer's goes that let's get a timeout here the play clock was winding down and he came in determined Kirk to get those deep sets to fix the passing game so far it hasn't happened Barrett 6 of 14 as we check in with Cassidy Hubbard for an update thanks Chris Notre Dame up 10 nothing over Stanford until Michelle Kaiser is intercepted by quick meek who takes it 50 yards for the pick sick Cardinal get on the board but a reminder no Christian McCaffrey in this game he's out with a lower body injury it's 10 7 in the 3rd Chris hurry back to you it's been a frustrating season so far for last season's Heisman runnerup from Sanford all right Barrett and the Buckeyes need 11 on this third down are they going to turn the back ball back over to the battery before the break here I think that's one of the reasons hit at Urban Meyer not only the play clock calling down better Meyer fences the importance here because Paul Christmas probably has confidence with the timeout two minutes to go if they get the ball back they're taking it at the very least trying to get into field goal range this is what it will be an interesting to see the past protection Ohio State against these linebackers JP JP Barrett knows the ball has got to get out of his hands quickly especially in an empty set that without a fax back there to help them out lot asking for crowd noise and they need no encouragement here Samuel in the squat five receivers for Barrett to choose from and bad review showed some of that pressure what they found out and Barrett takes off and he is right away by Alec James yet another talented edge player remain go empty this guy report says you can anticipate especially on third down the possibility to quarterback draw those linebackers are in there but the linebackers don't even have to make the play as you said Alex gains his awareness to being able to get around with his speed and then close in on JT Barrett frustrating for staff again for Meyers offense and Johnson who's been extremely busy most constant calling a timeout he'll spend the final timeout of the half to go for to work with CNC AP top 10 rankings Alabama as you said rolled on Rocky Top see statecreated Clinton a scare at a 34 yard field goal to win it in regulation missed wide right and the Tigers made a pick to clink that victory in overtime and Clemson last night or at Clemson rather Louisville last night sitting there at 7 they beat Duke 24 14 but not quite the type of game you'd expect from the Cardinals going up against part of it marathon you're going to have weeks where you just have to get through the game for whatever reason you don't have it that day and you're you're hoping to just be able to execute just enough to get out of there alive and it kind of that's kind of what Clemson felt like today that was when you said lord have mercy we got to learn to hold on to the football the five turnovers against Louisville they survived that survive four more today but they're living on the edge Clemson Johnston upon it way back it is 30 Loes kick the back spinning plummets I was a fair catch and for 35 yard line the Kasbah fall playoff national championship trophy presented by dr. pepper made him a cameo today weird is it one of the great institutions in any college town anywhere Mickey's Gary Barker kind of wholly wanted shake today yeah you got to have I think I had this scrambler for a breakfast yesterday and then you got the milkshake milkshakes being done and it's just right across the street from Camp Randall and it's it I don't think it's changed inside or out of about 60 years right now I think it's like stepping in a time machine over there it really is I gained a came on the bus and Billy banal the producer of the show tonight he he had about 40 different milkshakes about every flavor you can imagine that build the delivery man extraordinaire that's where the Badgers can do minute 57 65 yards from the end zone no timeouts to work with and this time on the end around TV breaking loose on the right side quad Chris says hey if it's working I'm going to go with it again and again these defensive ends keep collapsing down and not only is he getting outside and getting outside of the contain he's got two big tight ends they're just blocking underside defensive backs and just picking up huge yards again the very least they're thinking about a field goal remember they get the ball to start the second half it's the big possession for the Badgers and Ohio State defense you know Chris likes to spin challenges as opportunities that we were joking with them what an opportunity slash challenge is a play caller you're not one of the ball that well your receivers are not getting separation he's found ways to attack this Ohio State defense tonight sandbagging us yesterday or near it from the pocket delivers far side and in fact his real wife the Columbus native finally gets in his first catch of the night and there's that same route that same route where they have a matchup that they like with wheelwright from six three and has ability see the quarterback is in great rhythm puts the ball low in a way where we're right can make a play matched up there against Ariane Conley is in the slot this breaks away from him number 15 averaging 15 yards it gets coming in he called he's called a streak shooter by Chris you want to get him involved early and gets his head in the game then he can have a big night and finally do just before halftime threatening again when you're good delivers and that's from Adalia makes the guest there in field goal range now inside the 30 you can't get over the hands house off the hands from the big tight end six six 250 pounds has a receiver hands you got a tight end you can catch Kirk and you got an accurate quarterback you can use that right yeah he is so efficient tonight and again all works together a 212 125 yards with a touchdown he be in motion again they give it to him again he gets around the corner again for another person Luke pickle and Greg Schiano are going to have to make adjustment time the defensive end they've been rolling different guys in was Nick Bosa and didn't even know he came in to make the play and he couldn't even tell where the ball was who was around it more carries for the receiver in this force Anthony had all season coming in well now what you can do if you're if you're Paul Chryst I'm sure he'll go to it is you can fake that give it to Corey Clement or fake that and you can throw a playaction pass off of it because now everybody's worried about the running of jazz TV around the edge all five of his carriers have created first downs and they do feed Clement and cuts it spins back but not much they're closing it down with Robert Landers the true freshman and Ramon Jones BMW halftime report and the red mark maybe background coming up doors and eyelet updates from the night games minutes 16 away actors on second and nine send one invert back and he flips it short screen fighting Edwin plummet make the cut back inside the 5yard line business again heck of a time to call the screen it's just a matter of being able to dump it off you can see the line letting the defensive line in and now they're downfield blocking Fumagalli that I did almost a shield kid guy from getting to Clement very very well time there by Paul Chryst only the second catch for Clement this season the first one for negative yards that went for 18 and warning Brooklyn a pocket is hit as he flows and sailed it that was quick pressure by Sam Hunterdon Iowa State's defense very very fortunate that they got pressure on Hornibrook because Fumagalli was wide open but Big Sam Hubbard that time gets by Jacob Maxwell the right tackle and saves Ohio State from giving up a touchdown defense looks confused and running the crossers and rubber outs and Ohio State not doing a good job communicating and coverage and it's freeing up wide receivers one guy you have to identify if they're going to throw the ball is the big tide in number 81 Poole Magali eighth point of the drive coming up Oh through the wall a muscle but gets very little again dream on Jones it will be third and goal font running with no timeout no timeouts wisconsin's they call that play anticipating maybe that's not getting in the end zone they third down they take a shot here try to get into the end zone potentially if it doesn't work out you have to settle for a vehicle cannot take a sack here though now Ohio State's going to spend a timeout on defensive with with the clock winding down if they get to them and sack you'd have to really hustle the field goal team out there this is a Wisconsin team Kirk that clearly clearly made use of its bye week they came limping back cause it was a 147 loss on the road to Michigan but the game really wasn't that close look Maurice dominated him this is a Wisconsin team that was more like what we saw earlier in the season what would you play LSU Michigan State and he planted and Michigan in Ann Arbor and you have a young offensive line a bye week couldn't have come at a better time I think it allows him to be able to work on something they told us they were able to self scout and look at what was working what they're struggling with as an offense and I think it really gave their quarterback because it took a vicious hit early in that game against Michigan a chance for also him to recover and keep in mind this is his third start the way he's played in his first half he looks like a seasoned veteran and I think a lot of that has to do with him but also with the attack that Paul Chryst has put together he's enjoying the fact that he's finally at home the first two starts the East Lansing and the big house he is outplayed JT Barrett so far the Buckeyes continue to struggle with the pass game now what do you call here when I get the ball out quickly yeah yeah and you know you want to give your quarterback a chance to be able to you don't have to panic and just get back and get rid of it but there does have to be in kind of an internal clock and awareness especially as good as Ohio State can rush the quarterback but you get back there and it's probably just going to be get back one hitch ball is out and again you got to find a way to try to free up the big tight end kuma golly you've got the field goal team huddling the 30yard line just in case they need to hustle out and set up a temper Endicott third and goal money Brooke fired fart sighs Wilson Swamy but it's incomplete that's the first throw that we've seen where he wasn't in his balance wasn't there and I think it's because of what you just said don't take a sack though I'm sure they told him as he went out and don't take a sack and so he gets back there and watch his feet watch up different this looks compared to what we've seen he didn't step through it he wasn't able to follow through on the on the throw and consequently it affects his accuracy and the ball kind of sailed on so Andrew Endicott is trying to make his third field goal in the half he had one in his life come again and I mean high school and college combined this from 22 yards driven straight through and Wisconsin Kirk 314 yards offense for long drives of the opening out another 10play Drive and again we said it earlier but to stop that the Wisconsin defense down with about two minutes to go got the ball back to Hornibrook they drive down almost come up with a touchdown but they get a field goal they're up ten and again do not forget we come back start this third quarter Wisconsin has the football that's took a minute 42 Ohio State's offense has run 34 plays and they've gained just 161 yards this is the Ohio State Drive chart for points and those two field goals it's the first half if Ohio State ends I'm not scoring in the last 14 seconds it'll be the first first half all year that they've not scored a touchdown Badgers have been a very fast starting defense they only allowed three points all season in the first quarter that's what the book has got but I think Meyer expected to come out and certainly fix the problems they had against the Hoosiers and click passing and running tonight so far hasn't happened but still down just ten the other thing to keep in mind even Ohio State beat Oklahoma this is the youngest team coming into this year in the entire power farms of returning starters entry on offense and three on defense so there's still a young team in these kind of situations trying to figure things out Endicott has been the field goal kicker tonight it's not the regular kickoff guy for Southby so he'll just move it along the ground and that's going to get away from Campbell who touches it and now has to try to do something and will be dropped across the 25 with just nine seconds before halftime I think JT Barrett takes a knee or a short run and get back into halftime reminds got to be anxious to get in got much rattle JT so what would the conversation be you know if you're ed Warner's Tim Beck the Philippine coordinators I don't I don't think it's probably communicating with JT Barrett about what he's seen he nobody has a better look about what's happening and what Wisconsin is doing then then JT beard now ed Warner's their offensive coordinator he's upstairs he's looking down and recognizing it but over the years Urban Meyer has been credited on often about his adjustments get his hands full tonight to see what they do in the second half completed passes this is Weber birth for 10yards second week in a row get the same issues last week against Indiana this a whole totally different deal better defense on the road in this environment you know the home underdog badgers hold Ohio State to six in the first half a few of some Meyer folks team Columbus has ever had Wisconsin trying to spring it upset leaves 16 6 stay tuned for the BMW halftime report and Sam ponder will speak with Paul Chryst's right after these messages welcome to the BMW halftime report holy touchdown of the first half Alex Hornibrook the jazz TV Badgers up at home Sam Fonda with her coach Paul Chryst such a strong start from your offense in your estimation what's enabled that kind of early success I think it was you had some big runs and being able to run with a little bit of consistency know we've still got a enough half right in there like you haven't heard that from a coach before but it's uh they were able to get the running game going out of setting our defenses playing well we know that we're gonna get challenged in a lot of different ways and got regroup here and come back out but it's I'm proud of the way the kids are playing but as you know we've got a lot of football still ahead of us thank you it's BMW halftime report along with Mark main background I'm Stan Verret so we started tonight talking about the Wisconsin defense but it's their offense look like they're giving him the best chance to win so yeah Paul Chris is on a roll with his play selection 170 yards rushing nearly twice as much offense in the first half as they had in the entire game against Michigan and they get the ball to start 2nd half mark so they're they're on the roll you're looking like a genius right now no look so far so good not too stepped up they're only giving up 12 points per game coming into this I thought their defense would be salty led by TJ watt getting to the quarterback putting pressure on the quarterback and stopping the run and not only that they're holding Ohio State to 171 yards in the first half I think that's kmart call for the upset in in the pregame so we'll see number two on the ropes number one no problem Alabama taking on Tennessee at Tennessee they honor Peyton Manning before the game welcome back Peyton one of the best ever tell some peaches or something he is second quarter Alabama up 147 they got a freshman quarterback Jalen Hurd seems really good I'll keep an eye on 87 right there a Miller force on because it terrific block the H back leads the way they're not even going to cut touch the quarterback Alabama up 217 and then they can get you on offense and get you on defense and get your specialty it's unbelievable 11 non offensive touchdowns by Alabama that's unheard of they're getting as many defense even special teams touchdowns marks as they are all off unbelievable hit in a row for Alabama over Tennessee and the difference was was the ground game the way they ran it and stopped Tennessee for running unbelievable near 400 and something yards rushing to 32 I mean they just totally dominated the game and we know Tennessee's got a good football team so Alabama has to be the best team in the country and right now nobody looks like they're close to the Jalen Hurd's a spectacular at the quarterback position a young freshman even if he makes a mistake he comes back and corrects it with a big play but you're right that game was one in the trenches on the offensive defensive line dominated Tennessee in his football game number three Clemson also trying to remain perfect taking on NC State NC State with a win over Notre Dame last week in the weather beautiful day there at South Carolina today came down to this two seconds left game tied NC State attempting a 33yard field well this will win the game form Kyle bamberg I'm telling you these guys are close at NC State but when you get an opportunity to be the top ranked Clemson you got to make the field go overtime Clemson second and goal deshaun watch it RK the Scott he knows how to win mark he does so NC State's got to get a touchdown to their possession they won't get it and he just under throws this ball if he lays this fall over the top it's a touchdown for North Carolina State but a great play by the clemson defense hug in Brian sterling picked off 20 in a row at home for the Tigers number 10 Nebraska visiting Indiana Tommy Armstrong was in a walking boot earlier this week but he's throwing this one up and check out the catch from Brandon Reilly yeah I talked to Mike Riley yesterday he said Tommy had to play well for them to win on the road but what great concentration by Riley and plays like that explosive plays help them win this ballgame led to a Nebraska touchdown to the Armstrong to Stanley Morgan Jr from st. Augustine high still we need to make it in the water put them in that walking boot all week long alpha eight Nebraska goes on to win it 27:22 their sticks it over the first time since 2001 and how about Northwestern they score the most points ever by an opponent and Michigan State the Spartans now all in three in the big 10 for the first time and ten years we got more coming up this halftime report brought you by BMW we only make one thing the ultimate driving machine and berries what with in the pocket hesitated and his drama Fyers office and welcome back to ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC in the presentation of the Big Ten on ABC Badgers of 510 could be a big early they've really dominated that guy right there Alex Hornibrook in his third starting out playing but allamerican candidate in JC Barrett and an Ohio State defense Kirk who has only given up to 47 per game giving up 3:13 to the Badgers in the opening yeah we talked about I think Paul Chris came up with a great game plan on how he's really mixing up different looks we've seen a gent sweep be effective we've seen Clinton running the football be effective it's really taking a lot of the pressure off of the passing game and let's base it on the other side of the ball I think Wisconsin's is doing what Ohio State normally might do to their opponent they're beating them up they're physically beating Ohio State up in that first half especially up front of the trenches with constant linebackers they've done it against LSU Michigan State Michigan they're having a great start to this game tonight we're going to see jump around at the end of the third quarter now they begin the third quarter with this little light show all the stops being pulled out at Camp Randall tonight the Badgers will get the ball it's going to add to the lead again at the Ohio State team if you pointed out to you you are returning starters than any power five team you get that 19 game true road game winning streak on the line where has never lost through road game at Ohio State but his office has never had a less productive first half kickoff by Durbin take over Pacific Life game summary really highlighting what you talked about this could be a bigger lead and it is it really started early their ability to run the football control things upfront taking the pressure off for the quarterback who's making great decisions throwing the ball he needs had a big night running and throwing and his defense is as good as advertised linebackers incredibly active making a very tough even when Ohio State got deep it Wisconsin territory coming up with a big play there on a third down and they have come after JP bear they're basically down Ohio State we're going to load up to stop your run can you throw the ball to beat us you saw our run you feed Clement again the guy that was very limited it by both the Spartans and the Wolverines with Clement with 110 rushing yards in the first half got six more there and I know the Paul Chryst had success on that jet sweep with Peavy I think it can become potentially a decoy in the second half they used it even on that first play they put him in motion Ohio State's defense I'm sure that's a big adjustment that they made the Paul Chryst play of getting outside they're trying not to lose those edges so they can open up the middle of the Ohio State defense go stretch him why then take a deep shot down the middle we'll look for that wreath on when it picks his way shows some more patience there gets close to a first down it'll be third and short this to feel good for this offense in line it has been so heavily criticized it is it is a first ms very generous DeLuca's dick however all these guys that following in the footsteps of a bunch of ex badgers in the NFL eight offensive lineman from the school in the league and therefore shman and sophomore I was going to say with Paul Chris back in with a strength and conditioning program back to where they expect it to be now they're on their way back to becoming that again they're just very very young in that development TV has it again that time there were more ready for miss Malik hooker the biginning safety knocked them out of bounds for a shorter game again now you get the football again this is a successful play they get outflanked but there's a great job by Malik hooker and if I'm Wisconsin's coaches and I look down and I see a safety that's reacting to that jet sweep like that now you're going to go back to it you're going to fake it to Peavy you're going to drop back and you're going to try to hit a post behind it if the safety is attacking down like that against that action when he broke on second and seven foot short and it dropped it was off the hands of Eric step aside and it'll be third down he had his deafness was open good recognition he came off actually to his second choice they're balls thrown behind them but that's the ball that stuff is could definitely make make a catch he's known more for his physicality as a big tight end Fumagalli makes most of the receptions for their tight ends Fumagalli the only receiver that's caught more than one pass tonight he had five in the first half you pick the Buckeyes to pay attention to number 81 here on third down 20 brooken walked under a sack off the edge was dealing Holmes with his second back of the year in the Buckeyes third tonight and the entire game plan for Ohio State was to get this offensive line into third and obvious passing situations and Holmes here in the middle of this Ohio State defense really nothing fancy it's just a good combination of power and speed and again it's it's young beau finish all the right guard that continues to struggle on those third down situations before it was beau so this time it's Holmes those guys it plays with a chip on his shoulder eager to prove himself short one field it on the hop and then drop risky fly and the backers say they've got it dontre Wilson decided to try to field it on the bounce Meyer just drops his head and dismay it's going to be Ohio State ball somehow at the bottom of the pile Wilson was able to atone for his mistake he could any time you see it is his eyes his eyes dip down to see where they were coming from and obviously a big time no no you take your eye off the ball even though you think you're going to be able to secure it right there he prayed here he peeks up to see who's coming down either let that go you get out of it and not afford to put yourself in such a dangerous position what you don't know turnovers tonight he's fortunate to get the ball back berrak these Weber powers for a nice game Sam what did Urban Meyer have to say coming out of halftime frustrated at halftime just like he is right now Chris told me there wasn't a single area of football where his guys were doing what they were supposed to be doing and he knows he has some young guys who haven't been in loose positions or wants to see how they respond I asked him where the opportunity was that its downfield it's underneath it's all there we just have to execute Thanks whoever who came in the big thin lead in rushing yards so far this season able to get eight that time Varick rolling out and decides to keep it in will be stopped near the marker by DJ Edwards looks like he may have come up with a first down it looked a little indecisive there with JT Barrett rolling out and even even once he was almost at the line of scrimmage and beyond the lanstrom it's still kind of looking down field did he almost cost himself the first down they did get into him Urban Meyer very active up at the top punks over there neither line of scrimmage their lines it for the boundary breaks a tackle shows that leg strengthened dive forward the fastest guy but tough to tackle it city so physical as you said we talked about that this morning on game day you know that you've heard Urban Meyer's from time to time compared him to at Mt but a lot of that has to do more with the intangibles but Kim didn't necessarily explode when he was running the vault he'd run over top of guys look Jake he's not quite that critical but he does bring thyn physicality was able to run through some arm tackles definitely not contact averse from the pocket ferret the underneath of Harris Campbell makes the catch first down at 35 yardline most of the first time at Ohio State gave JT parrot some time to throw and the reason is with constant instead of bringing those linebackers latest there's only three guys this time they have five underneath to try to take away the underneath brows Hamilton's and I saw them fighting the hole there in that zone fake it to Samuel the look downfield nobody open and now takes off they see grieving inside the 15yard line same thing rushing three a little bit of a delayed blitz from the middle linebacker TJ Edwards but playing zone everybody covered great recognition that time by JT Barrett deciding to hold on to it found it free fair and took off for big yards he got 22 of them often look keep it all the way and knock down after a twoyard aim and here comes the rain all of a sudden the rain that was forecast arrives here early in the third quarter will not make it easier for the quarterback talked to both the coaches on the field about potential wet conditions and both telling me that they're very comfortable with the mechanics and their quarterbacks having big hands and being able to hold on to the football we'll see if that ends up playing out the fans are screaming for the raincoats and then some just don't fair we didn't get wet they've been Haven traffic to the game since 8 o'clock before you Samuel in motion on second and nine versus directed merit role and that way delivers into the endzone intercepted entire being a prize at fun addicted it's going to be big play maker for the team interception in the win over LSU force the fumble against the Spartans Justin we talked about the conditions I think that ball just comes out of his hand he has an open receiver there and he just missed it both floats over top of the potential receiver James Clark right into the hands of the coated Dixit for the interception take a look at that unsure welcome back dr. pepper championship drive game of the week all right Larry thanks let's take another look at this because replay officials Stephen Beckman has to confirm that the Dakota Dixon got his forearm under the ball Kirk now watch his left arm as his body turned ball slips on the hands of JP bear watch the left forearm turn and get underneath preventing the ball that's a great effort from hitting the surface it's a good interception there by Dixon so the ball with the rain which was shortlived by the way it's basically stopped it lasted just long enough to affect that throw by Barrett game's first turnover climate if for a loss there crying in was Jalen Holmes who's been active tonight Jalen Holmes is the penetration Ohio State memories made adjustments at halftime and come back out here in the defensive line has really done a nice job of getting things established up front you see the nick Bosa playing more and more he's playing right now it's a left defensive end along with another true freshman Robert Landers had a Dayton Wayne it has too many guys on his helmet yet he'll get a bunch before he's done talented freshmen playaction Hornibrook backpedaling and Fumagalli was very very well covered by Damon Webb nowhere to go did and both of us chasing him against both applies the pressure but give Damon Webb a lot of credit it's the same play that gave them a problem don't not only open the game but throughout most of the first half this time completely taken it away is Damon Webb now he's 510 but he's a former corner really good in coverage and even though Fumagalli he's at six six play really didn't have a chance great coverage by Webb now you put that line in a young quarterback here into that obvious passing situation need 11 when a bird ruptured again it's a screen jumped off and they are all over Oh Gonzales Jerome Baker stopped about an excellent defensive series of the Buckeyes second one in a row Holmes gets in trying to set up anticipating pressure but in the eyes that time by Jerome Baker guided it really exploded onto the scene this year having a chance to replace Josh berry big interception against Oklahoma but he felt that in the offensive line trying to get out there to block him by the time they saw him with his speed he was already buying into the backfield souse cape into punt and making the catch no fair catch made that time by Wilson and he is dropped in Wisconsin territory at the 48 yard line again some some hesitation from the returner Barret off the pick back in business with good field position Saturday Night Football on ABC brought to you by AT&amp;T mobilizing your world and Ford we go further so you can you thank good year again good you're committed to honoring flip worthy athletes who demonstrate hard work on and off the field good your official sponsor of the college football playoff at a 3 minute rain shower before just during that ohio state possession let's perhaps do the balls flipping out of the hands of bear for the pic but now the showers moving away Ohio State takes over after a break before lunch the badger is 47 hiya state's defense 3 now that's starting field position of the night for JD Barry to back books neither side of the quarterback and they picked it up to Samuel whose pursuit instantly exit excellent defense leo mu so that seniors safety arrived in a hurry and Zack Vaughn helped clean him up but that's great defense and it's also tremendous speed here by Leo Liu so watch how he runs you talking about Curtis Samuel one of the faster back punt into the big 10 but to cont the country but the angle that he took prevented to cut back and Musa who is a great athlete coming out of high school in high school for about tailback shows that to be there at 5500 rushing yards in high school 87 cuts to Samuel in the black gets a couple of blocks and knifes between them to the 40yard line third and short now they brought two linebackers eglass couple play something they got away from the previous series remember we talked about rushing three and dropping eight it's time Justin Wilcox the defensive coordinator said let's get back to our roots it's get these outside linebackers 32 and 5 News they're running all the way and picked his way for a first down he was slammed down hard by itchy before her progress should move the sticks Helen in his cuffs led it is physical you're going to run the football JT Barrett carried it 26 times last year last week against Indiana this their squad lowering the boom there on the tight end trying to make a flop we want to be so put up in the ice bath if you punch the feminine energy would you happen that he was again wasn't it bad but it's a different game tonight bear it eyes a bunch of dime and licks of all the end zone jokbal incomplete that was McClaren going high for couldn't collected actually a heck of a throw being patient waiting for is you know you're improvising these are things that are hard to really practice and we did an entire new group of wide receivers you got to make a play the ball is thrown right where it needs to be and again it's a young sophomore look at a shot he knows that that hit is coming from cinchy but he waited and waited until McLaren had a chance to go up and make a play if he goes up and holds on to the ball touchdown you'll have yet to commence a one of those deep shots tonight was a first down throw now it's a second down Oh Staniel vollis's walkers picks up about ten crazy why he was going to be a big part of the offense tonight gherkin and already Samuels carries 11 times o'clock three paths lead receiver and Russia but he's the office he had JT Barrett I think what urban Meyer wants to see is his offense grow as some other players get involved in taking the pressure off of a jason has also been busy again stopped short bitchy again on the tackle it starts with JP want setting the edge forcing JT Baron to try to come underneath and that's where city is able to make the play that combination of 42 on the edge and 48 in the middle it's been active CJ murders himself to JT once again watch him set the edge and then watch sitch he clean it up CT Barrett would love to get outside but the edge is set he's forced inside and here comes the middle linebacker able to clean it up well Kirk Jamar co Jones the junior left tackle for Ohio State is being looked at by the trainer's chance to check in with Cassidy hover for an update thanks Chris dr. pepper championship drive update number 12 Ole Miss taking on number 22 Arkansas and take a look at this Nixie moved by Chad Kelly the old 17 yard TD run puts Ole Miss up 30 27 Kelly which was in 46 passing yards 88 rushing and 3 total TV so far this one over on the SDA chastity thank you is for town fourth and one I don't state it just goes forward a lot on fourth down yeah yeah me but if they don't have nice like this very often so maybe that's why they go for it you know looks like he rolls his ankle right there just stepping on the foot of Isaiah Prince the other tack injury yeah but again interesting call for Urban Meyer because if you kick a field goal and you make it it's back to a one possession game but you're right his his MO is to go for that's what he's going to do it almost a full yard it was good content where the best defenses in the country third and fourth and short probably need to get wide to have a chance and motion in Wilton give it to Webber and he plows for a first down inside the 25 good forward drive by the freshman tailback yeah great power by by Webber but how about the offensive line that time Pat elf line Center Billy price to right guard the two veterans leading the way the powerful Mike Weber is that's a heck of an accomplishment against that defensive front on first and Webber again and very quick penetration at that stitch II the former walk when again just flying in the roses body you know a ball carrier he's one of those guys and anybody out there that's played linebacker can really appreciate this when he brings up film study and looking at the offensive linemen especially the guards amount of pressure they put on their hands and if they're sitting back in their stance or they're sitting forward in their stance it tips him off on being able to know where the ball is going to be going so it helps him anticipate where to attack and that's a great example there then last one the Duke does local details doesn't have to play the position Vegas or wherever Barrett sidestep pressure delivers in the traffic and that was Dakota Dixon who just had to pick its chance at another one there Kendall on the super to Kendall the outside man to man leave your corners on an island they've got to be able to hold up you can see the look there he actually missed his tight end markets ball who had his man Pete he locks in on Noah Brown balls thrown behind tend to almost jump 30:10 as loud as it's been tonight farik Russian escape delivers far side and a text made for a first down by Brown let's see if they give him forward progress where the kicks is made now they're going to spot it shorts going to be fourth down again just talked about fourth and one how Urban Meyer he likes to go for it a lot of times he likes to go with tempo going toward again give it to Weber and he fights hard again able to pick up the first down just through strength and will that that was Mike Weber last fourth and one was the offensive line along with Weber this is Mike whoever wanting to get the first down look at the penetration they stopped him short right there there's City once again help line helping out to push but that was the power of the big running back Michael Weber to pick that up well play just drive and now Barrett playaction for the end zone a battle for the pollak play comes out as lown was interfered with by mu so he was left outside there oneonone was Shelton the veteran the senior he has an advantage on size he got behind him Chris and when you get behind him and Shelton Pendergraft Eric defense number eight fala curtain is oh I ruled the ball plays two yard line automatic first out again we talked about this all the time because he's beaten watch his eyes watch his headgear he's behind him right now now he never turns around a lot of contact to officials actually make the call his Ohio State the ball and a right tackle by the way that time looked like he moved before the ball was snapped they got away on there here's the parisa pylon can you do they're going to take a res dumb shot to brown against this short corner but Shelton tough competitor so now for the two yard line first and goal whoever must have down near the goal line stopped just short they're trying to get guys in and off the field now drinking down to call it timeout they did try to get the some fresh bodies on there on second and goal doctors left to spend one here hard to do when Ohio State doesn't substitute Chris has shown some quickness down there to the corner Buckeyes a methodical Drive trying to cash in good field position and cut into the lead play a power football by Ohio State in this Drive it twice converted fourth and one's taken 12 plays to move 46 yards like an end goal and downside to one think about that Urban Meyer offense I defend till score in a minute two minutes we're going 46 yards plays to get to his 46 yard near Foothill trying to finish off the drive with a touchdown here at 14 they stay in that look quarterback run obviously Thatcher's unable to stop there are two barrels in four Ohio State's first touchdown tonight we do cap a grinding 47 yard march to the end zone when in doubt you follow the veteran Pat elf line seniors center and Billy price the junior both these guys have played for the last few years ill flying that time a heck of a block and being able to turn the nose guard to open up a little bit of a running lane for barracks Durbin yet elf on for sure one of the candidates for the Remington award with top center in the country watch him in the middle watch how he's able to just do enough here to be able to get a push there and open up a knife it's also Billy price the right guard picks up stitching they know they know that it's coming see the safety happening try to come in they're dicks of it city was picked up by by Billy price and help line also picked up the nose guard BT ferret gets into the end zone for IO state to cut it to three and you're right big guts of Urban Meyer you get into field goal range you got a shot to get it within one possession game the offense hasn't necessarily been blowing people off the ball he takes the chance believed in his guys and twice ends up paying all forms to get a touchdown fourth and three whatever we said at halftime Meyer crusted in the locker room it is helped motivate the so now State team the defense played very well after the break and now the offense finally finds the endzone turn short of the 20 yard line we check back in with Cassidy thanks Chris wild finished between Tulsa and Houston 70s Tulsa down a touchdown in the red zone and Jesse Brubaker stopped short of the goal I look as it's literally inches time expires and Houston survives 3831 Chris Erbe thank you Wow former Ohio State offensive coordinator Tom Herman narrowly dodges a second loss for his Cougars net loss to Navy may have taken some of the wind out of their sails there but see what Paul Chris does to adjust remember it's been a slow start for the second half of the Wisconsin offense Brook rolls out and delivers reliable jazz Phoebe from the far sideline nice gang more than anything Ohio State has kind of cranked up the intensity at the point of attack at the line of scrimmage with the defensive line winning the battle and the other thing is they were able to get a Hornibrook into some obvious passing situations a lot more third and long or they could kind of put him in awkward in difficult position to be able to execute against their defense in their secondary and get eight on the first down there from Stevie in motion again but they feed Clement who barrels forward for a percent at the 29 first and 10 is such a big part of with content either having success or not and they have done a good job of mixing up their looks tonight on their first downs they've had 15 first town calls nine of them have been run six have been passed what does it show up in that stat is how many times they've run Peavy around on the mother jet sweep to kind of go along with that so the try to keep Ohio State offbalance they need to stay on schedule on second and third another first down throw morning Brooke lobs it out intercepted coming up to make the pick was Gary and Connelly who read the quarterback and closed in and the Buckeyes back in business first turnover for Wisconsin well he because he is a touch passer he floats the ball here and he kind of times things up this time he he put it he puts it up in the air what I don't think he didn't expect with Conley sitting there in zone I think he was expecting mantoman and Conley jumps the route and I think he fooled the freshman quarterback as he gets hit right after he throws the ball by Michael Hill so Connelly his second interception of the season a leader of that secondary that did called itself CIA fest in America perhaps had to look up the back yet tonight this big play that Barrett into 30 a final two minutes of the third quarter proud rich really rock is now anxious samuel directs that Wilson takes the little flips and all that window dressing game to guard not only does it gain just the yard it almost was a loss of about 15 or 20 yards or maybe a recovery that ball almost goes over the head of Curtis Samuel he did a good job just to be able to come up with a football let alone get it to dontre Wilson the guy you're snapping to in that kid doesn't quite as tall as JD and almost got away from them before year right lined up to the right of Barrett's in the flat he gets it AIESEC cut back and lowers his head would he search down and they'll need about go back to that previous play look at that look at that effort they're just dipped his right hand up such an idea of his athletic ability handeye coordination and get back to that last series his Urban Meyer thinking about four down territory the Paulding third down play thinking about the possibility of being in a fourth in short final minute of the quarter rock back and deliver high strike force down still fighting his ground down near the 10yard line watch this throw and watch how he puts it between three defenders of Wisconsin we've got great coverage there that ball has to be thrown if it's late by even a half of a second the ball is batted away but he squeezed it in there for the first down trying to run some stuff Don they're still very confused it's still confusing nonstate ten seconds in the quarter snaps it in Barrett moves in front there was a lot of confusion so they come on they stay off that beggars weren't sure on defense it's about to be a jump around time here the great tradition at Madison but the Badgers are clinging to a threepoint lead back after this message and a word via local maybe sea station HCMC all access shows you the serious operation that the Ohio State coaches have to do to go down to the locker room at halftime get out of your booth they hold the elevator that's just the beginning of it I know you get a jump in a golf cart it's drive around is to get to the locker room this is a heck of an effort here now now we're now we're out of the street how are you good to see it alright we're just trying to make a few adjustments here the AT&amp;T and then you got to go down and get it here in the club is if Wisconsin's a push couple handshakes didn't see in it feeds the inside access so here we go while state trying to take the lead a second in six play as we begin the final quarter Madison dominate thirdquarter the scarlet and gray parents still got it folded at the last minute Kirk as he does so Optimus if she can wage the finger says out at that time now since she's done a nice job of taking him out but one thing Katie Barrett does with his own read the scene really does a good job on the ride he he keeps it in there but as long as a quarterback I've seen and the reason that's important is the kids have long her to make a decision on whether to keep it or give it he made the right read but since he sniffed it out enormous play now and the Badger beef n ol Ohio State to a field goal attempt which is build the tie of the game being the Buckeyes who spray out all night with their first lead ever it has success to go around this here face but the time running out we have to spend the time out here they've tried to pick on them they got an interference call on Shelton eventually set up the touch sad last time they've got cookin after this time out there dr. pepper championship drop game of the week Wisconsin clinging to a threepoint lead as Ohio State faces a third and six on the eighth beggars get a running start 50 came in flushed out there but he breaks free and scores JC Barrett one for the press sent in Ohio State has its first lien as he died the sack but they brought pressure from cinchy and watt and when they weren't able to pick up JT Barrett there's nobody left on the other side because you can see the corners locked up with Noah Brown nobody left and a big touchdown there by JT Barrett so high on state marches 38 yards after the interception from Gary and Conley fortunately the entire second half has been played in Wisconsin territory here's the pick by Conley first turnover by Wisconsin would set up Ohio State in good shape took him six plays to move 38 yards and 2 to 39 and JT takes it home progessive pylon can giving you a good look Wisconsin has been smothered on offense in the second half now they're suddenly down by four Saturday Night Football on ABC Roxy boy chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich Buick proud partner of the NCAA and Northwestern Mutual we help you live life differently badger hockey team beat number 653 one by Sunday 4:00 Eastern ESPNU if you were hockey Isiah preached the right tackle the Buckeyes would have been sent to the sin bin two minutes for holding he absolutely grabbed wat around the waist kind of a dance move on that touchdown which helps spring Barrett grabs him right there Barrett gets around it because you could what did you see DJ watchful off because of how hard he was held there loomed wale from the end zone good coverage stop at the 20 Samantha Cruz I wanted to observe Alex Hornibrook when he came off after the interception he did the exact same thing he's done the entire game which is something I've never seen before he doesn't sit down really interacted to me he warms up behind entire time and I was talking about tossing the ball around a little bit I'm talking 30 yards throwing darts on the sideline the entire time I talked to Joel Sava cuz he was down here observing asked him if he'd ever seen it he said no and it actually could end up being a problem when he goes to schools that don't really have much space in between the fans and the bench so something something interesting I'm not really sure what the reason is Sam I've never seen that myself usually sit down you're talking with the line you're talking with running backs coach is going over a Justin it's interesting approach move it up inside to try to get the quick hitter to the fullback Badgers got to get the offensive rhythm going Kirk got to that impressive showing 313 in the first half 11 yards in the third quarter yeah you always hear that tail too has and so far has been that highest a before you cranked up the intensity last time they had the ball the defensive line has done a very good job not just defending the run but also rushing the quarterback Oh guys showing some pressure on second second one if it flips it off at the screen they go back to Fumagalli but he has been well covered after halftime malik hooker came up to lower the boom it'll be third of all you're right Chris I talked to a hooker on Thursday and asked him you're a great athlete but do you like to hit people he said who kind of smiled and said yeah I said would you threaten or hit or make it interceptions I got I want to come up and hit people the acceleration how quickly he's able to close the ground there and take away that space the offensive lineman with that speed just didn't have any chance to block the great instincts hooker is a guy who misses elite basketball player didn't play high school football in his senior year on third down haunted rec for Peavy thanks to catch into Ohio State Territory instead of 45 he's seen Damon Arnett what a club throw what a throw right on the money and the great thing for Wisconsin is he gets back and the balls out he had just enough time he'll get a little pressure off to his right but you can see that the back up corner the nickel back Arnett gets a step behind Peavy who's got great downfield speed but it's the accuracy and getting back to throwing and rhythm for Alex Hornibrook the reason that works he's getting back to what he did in his opening started his career against Michigan State when he was six for six on third down most of them third and long we got 36 and 39 lemon spins back he could not escape Raekwon McMillen's tackle there that's the answer to Sam's question about him throwing on a sideline it's for opportunities like that oh that was an accurate throw and that's really what Paul Chryst told us was they had a quarterback paddle and they broke camp they and we got the LSU they started Bart euston a senior who's been a backup to joel Staub a and eventually Hornibrook won the job and pauperis telling us really it was the consistency with his accuracy is the reason he's now the starting quarterback it came off the bench in the Georgia State game and this offense really struggled and that's Houston lost his job when it breaking free get the fly muscles out in five to twenty five and the Badgers threatening again much the left tackle here ramp check watch him pushed down the defensive lineman Jones and open that right up and not only that you've got big lineman pulling around the big tight end that time step is with nobody really to block but it's the first time in the second half and we've seen that power running game of Clement this offensive build a billet e to run the football they get 20 of their women now it rest for 143 tonight that time they bring T be in motion the Clement busts up the middle as you suggested they use a decoy and run up the middle it catches the eyes of the linebackers it slows them down and when you you bring them around like that all it takes is a little bit of hesitation to help those linemen get up to the linebackers McMillan and also whirling your block for another good play call using that as a decoy there to open that up the Badgers would let all night fall behind by a forged welcome to reclaim the lead now inside the red zone on second to plummet out of state Austin yarded Sam Hubbard strung it out that's a play that affected them they were not setting the edge this time Sam up Hubbard does set the edge watch him fight to get outside they're dealing with a block from Maxwell but does not give up on the play keeps his outside shoulder and hand free to be able to get out there and make that play now Clement is going to come off on this third down play what guys make some substitutions Badgers need three yards sticking up at the end of that run Oh Jim Diwali spelling him they snap it at where did that flips off inside and they convert the first down the shovel pass to Fumagalli again this is visit a welldesigned plane they've not called in all night Fumagalli just following the right guard bench all around Philip this is the lowrisk play way to be complete yeah absolute a complete mask it doesn't work out little shovel pass Taekwon Lewis unable to get down there and well time there by Paul Chris hasn't shown it the whole game fourth quarter pull it out in Ohio State not quick enough to react on third down I might still out of there may have got kneed in the back on that tackle so it's open wale in the I formation he's got it he's not quite the physical runner that lemon is or it's hard for a couple of yards Hill and Lewis come on on the side yeah really known for him steal third down a billet e to play on third down but he is still a guy that I think can run the ball between the tackle now we going to look at the freshman bradrick shawl comes in he's kind of a slasher at 6 1 211 pounds that's Haller back you got to Texas as when touch the ball tonight this is the first Darian Bradshaw he shows some power and some burst and a nice gain down inside the five it'll be third and very short yeah they think he could really be a star in the future the offensive line really watch the center theater does a nice job there also the left guard it's actually the left guard that time theater is actually able to get up to the linebacker the Shocker does this job one carry and our planet comes back in for the third and two essentially it's more like a yard in a little bit three tight ends on all that beef option Paramus in the Badgers back on top they love that play that quicker to the fullback don't they executed there who else yeah how ironic teams love to be able to get that quick dive play in Ramage has a 250 pounds the leg tribe if he gets challenged that time he really didn't get challenged Endicott now turns to convert the phd make it a threepoint margin he does so responds Nick you're falling behind Kirk goes 81 yards in the 11 plays and this is with Taunton football you want to see this offensive line be able to kind of kind of impose their will look at that that is a great job that time by the right side to open that hole up and the first time the Buckeyes have surrendered a rushing touchdown all season long Jake did your turn down three now Catholic Hubbert's wish to do update back and forth affair between old myths and Arkansas 142 place rebels down for fourth and 16 Chad Kelly on the run almost gets the first down with that BAM out goes the football down goes the rebels Arkansas dropping Ole Miss wanted to in the sec brisker be back to you thank you good one there very good one here backers back on top inside of eight minutes to play Barrett will go back to work now skis tip again is very deep Pacific Life game summary of quarterback comparison JT a couple of rushing touchdowns 11 of 22 passing Hornibrook after throwing that interception impressive converting that third long in the last touchdown drive yeah he has played again very very well tonight see at the bottom there JT Barrett also has carried the football 18 times after a 26 carry game last week for a couple touchdowns tonight as well and you put the ball back in his hands down three with underneath minutes to go in the game on the road see what he can do JT already was the career touchdown pass leader at Ohio State and now it's tied Braxton Miller school record for touchdown responsible for 88 total no doubt ahead to that in from Weber down at the 30 yard line after a 5 yard game any times outside linebackers we see in one of them have to come off the field right now Eric Dooley he is not a hundred percent right now number five out there trying to play Derrick Rose near side to low completion to a slide in Maclaurin for a first down these receivers have been challenged by Urban Meyer to make plays like this go down and make a play on the football it could get Dooley out of their ways struggling with this right leg Samuel but this bag follows the Block in brick free First Samuel into Wisconsin territory it was Webber its backfield made it through a big block in there is a flag down now you see Webber helping him lead the way to back look nice block by Parris Campbell Weber takes codit take care of the coat addiction but there is a flag down holding offense fiveyard penalty got whatever he kind of grabbed Dixon and threw him to the ground that's what they had to have call near the a make good contact at the beginning but then at the end he just grabbed ahold of him and threw him down good contact then he grabs the jersey there there's the throwdown so for 25 penalty the gates at 25 yard game if you put those two in the backfield together a little bit of a different look and opens up the PlayBook because there's a variety of different things you can do because of how skill both of them are running and catching backers come after Barrett protection hold up for a moment and a safety try to scramble and has dropped down by sticky one more time crappy number 48 that Mohar yeah he kind of kids about he's a playmaker he leads the team in tackles he's all over the football but he can't we were kind of talking to him about what kind of athlete you are because he's made some plays this year against the past as well and he kind of got a poor Mouse himself a gun you know not that great athlete I have to do it in different ways nothing with a ball money between these white lines and the balls in play he has football speed I don't care what he on the 40 I don't even when he sits before the balls out there he make play Barrett now a lot of time it runs only three days he's got all day taking a down field shot for dontre Wilson who collects it finally finally the Buckeyes go downtown and connect but but it was a good job again you've got a broken play he just gave a little bit of a look and a hand wave to dontre Wilson whose oneonone with a linebacker the bonds trying to run with him and stay with a much quicker dontre Wilson this is a great throw in an accurate throw away from the defender over the outside shorter to dontre Wilson yes as long as the guy in because Julie was out interest he go after a backup linebacker there at exam 20th time go for the end zone again looking for dr. Wilson overshot it and banach get'em was out there government they had that mismatch that's what they ask they need outside linebackers to do is a lot of times they're rushing the quarterback in blitzing you see that a lot with tha want and Garrett Dooley but they're also asked because they have to stay balanced the drop in coverage I mean it it's a tough position to play it takes a unique talented athlete with some size to be able to play that position but that time Paris actually had Wilson earlier wide open if he would have seen him he was just looking off to his right they know the receiver motion into the backfield if Eric keeps it and I'm by GT Barrett on this drive it's been a struggle Turk passing game so hasn't cliff he's been a physical busy runner but you expect a leader like this to take over when a high of state needs the drive absolutely James on a line late the ball game he now has carried the football 20 times tonight potential hyoe state office here and throw down kind of manufactured different ways to make this happen further Samuel checking back into the game for KJ Hill and also we get carrot Dooley back into the game they clock is winding down both teams made substitutions we got a hurry just get it away there it keeps it cuts it back and his shot blocked down on the edge by Lee Hom mousou made a huge tackle to prevent a first Center maybe a touchdown that's a heck of a play to be able to not only make the tackle but Marcus ball that tight in has him blocked but he is a big man trying to block him he uses his speed to undercut the big tide in to be able to get away from him and then keep JT Barrett short for the first down Jim Leonard the NFL great who was with the scrappy xfactor folks goodie being said who says their best tackler the defense the fact that he made his folks look smart that time so Durbin on with a 31 yarder and he knocks it through what guys 23 Badgers 23 final four minutes of regulation coming up tomorrow morning 10:00 a.m. Eastern NFL insiders follow byes sunny NFL Camden right up to kickoff no money in a football Brandon Marshall and the Jets Cardinal very Fitzgerald and company six o'clock with countdown and the kickoff at 8:15 also want to watch ESPN app regressive pylon in getting an upclose look at Bucky Badger Brutus before mister course are going with Ohio State Wisconsin tries to duplicate what they did here in 2010 upset higher ranked Ohio State team at home while a take Annie and Alex Hornibrook you spent the entire Ohio State Drive growing is the empty test it goes back to lefur yeah this last ride was a great mix they were able to run the football the offensive line does a heck of a job throughout this he made a couple big throws they mixed in a variety of tailback to trying to keep everybody fresh here's that right side of the offensive line that fullback dive to Austin ravish for the touchdown to give it the time the lead the Buckeyes have gotten it even and now this is this is what you train all season for this is what it's all about for both these teams this is what you want table is set now you got to go out and do it Badgers have shown noticing a methodical offense before tonight but they have been plenty explosive 357 to work with plenty of time Clement Sutter step realistic a completely different running back tonight isn't he he looks like he did two years ago he's just a lot more patient he's fighting through some injuries tonight to it again last year injured most of the years but he is not at a hundred percent but the patient most importantly back in his running style missed a game in half this year with an ankle injury appears to be less than full speed right now the other thing is it's nice to be able to run where you have a little bit of room he has not had a lot of room to run the last couple games those goons were wale cut in fights for a fourth down across the 35 known as a Kinect guy but there he's showing a little bit of power he's got to got to pick up the slack if Clement and his hobbled most guys who go for me over back to running back you don't figure they're going to be a real physical player right tight formation and a toga Collier gets increased business if Iran cuts it back and you see the elusiveness that's more what he's known for a jog and yeah but again that offensive line on a first intent run controlling things upfront do a nice job there and you know you're pulling a guard you're pulling a tight end kind of an hback around the right side needs to collapse the Ohio State defensive front which is exactly what they did giving those Polar's enough room to come around and then look at that eight or nine yard gain again on first and ten inside of two and a half to play in regulation Clement is back in there you've got the first down then for Ohio State Territory when they are moving toward Andrew Endicott range the kicker who left him steady tonight to fill in for ganglion honey he's been all you can ask for and he win it with one more field goal clock becomes a factor now under two minutes Ohio State with two timeouts Badgers also with two timeouts they're going to take their time now with as much success as they've had moving the ball here in these first four plays I meant again cuts it back a flag comes in and what would be to figure the holding zone and that could be crucial they get Brett Connors I think the center here for a hold holding offense for 64 10yard penalty repeat first down have been some whole tonight that have not been called in crucial plays when they did spot Connors and for Paul Chryst that drive had momentum it had everything that you wanted because you're at Ohio State on their heels and you're moving closer and closer into field goal range now minute 38 a critical error by the center on the holding call and not only do you lose ground but you lose that momentum and at rid of the day it established on that drive and you have to believe that wonder Brooks going to have to put the ball up in this series first and 20 steps up as time deliver supports the little TV knock down at the 50 nice tackle by multicooker Cantor's get back a charge again Malik hooker is one of the better safeties you're going to watch watch how quickly he reacts to this and watch the closing speed after he sees where the route is look how quickly he comes in and collapses down on that but big yards there for Wisconsin again they're trying to get into fuel goal range here is that clock it's closer to a minute when it would down the sidelines a risky throw diving a tip picked up again by fondly his second interception tonight no South to Wisconsin drive and the young quarterback pays the price for that decision this is a clinic on how to play mantoman in college football watch how he trusts his eyes right now he turns around at that point he's almost a wide receiver tremendous athletic ability to go up and make the catch but it was him reading the eyes of the receiver wheelwright getting his own head turned around and then running stride for stride with wheelwright this and just exceptional they're going to take a close look to see if the ball touch the ground looked like his right elbow right arm got underneath the ball this is going to stand as a pick what any friend I know that all that good stuff to tell you about technique with the cactus and it's all raising at Ohio State's had a few of those this year hooker had one earlier too so right arm kind of like what we talked about with Dixon who had the interception see the right arm under the ball prevents it from hitting the surface it did pop up and that's what the crowd is booing about when they showed the replay on his screen here so that holding penalty that pushed him back made it first and 20 kind of room on schedule jerk as you suggested it was ended up being more than a momentum killer and that's being crucial with this interception stands look Carly collects it in the right hand grabs it in now as he control it begin appease could have popped up when his arm hit the ground they may not have enough to turn this over could be the play that sends us to overtime still Stephen Beckman looking at it Dave khatai did you see this if you were in his position well I saw it the same way you guys did I don't think there's enough to overturn attea left arm is under okay the ball might hit the ground but there's not enough there to change the call from what I've seen in my opinion we'll see if the interception has overturned it would be third in 12 or Wisconsin at midfield and if it is an interception involves on the 20yard line after further review and the process of the player going to the ground to make the catch the ball hit the ground he lost control 50 yard line I'm so Beckman's seeing it differently than you did Dave and it will be Wisconsin ball back at midfield a third and 12 so it puts 40 Brook still in a position to be able to get points on the board but now it's not just about Hornibrook Chris it's about the offensive line giving him a chance and you know Paul pauperis understands that he knows that Ohio State's going to come after him you wonder if they might try to roll them away kind of move that launch point a little bit to give him a little bit more time to get away from that pressure see Nick Bosa coming in all their pass rushers coming into the game Jalen home Sam Hubbard haiquan Lewis all into the lineup they don't call if it is kind of like a jido package isn't it there's a whole bunch of defensive ends in there iein state looks like they're in mantoman drop out rolling away from the pressure and now flip the shortcut behind oghuz wale it was Jalen Holmes in hot pursuit and now it's for very high estate showed man to man and then dropped out of it at the snap and played zone I felt pretty confident that they could give this young quarterback a lot of different looks especially in that third down package showing one thing before the snap drops to the other that time just great coverage downfield the sound ski in to punt dontre Wilson back has been an adventure tonight for him you'd think he would just make the safe play makes a fair catch it was a man right in his face and he does collected at the 13 yard line 41 seconds to play has to be hovered for long after the game with a 42 wrapup show the Urban Meyer and his play callers mid Warner I got consents to just play this conservative and look for overtime you've got two timeouts I think you call the first play and you see see how successful or if it's a struggle and then I think that dictates maybe your your your attitude on the rest of the drive hioh state is capable of moving the ball down the field pretty quickly with JD berry but it's tonight obviously it's been a challenge against this group of linebackers and against this entire defense it's been a very very good job of containing the big play from Ohio State you can have to move the ball 50 55 yards to get in field goal ran for Tyler Durden he said to come out I'm answering some questions here at the end of all forever who is hammered through a short game by C he that kind of intelligent that tells you at Ohio State he's saying let's get it to overtime and play some extra football night now Clemson on their home field needed overtime to survive that was number three number two on the road tonight if they are to stay undefeated we'll have to do it in overtime we thought it'd be fun tonight and it has been back and forth Buckeyes dominate in the second half but the Badgers put together that one touchdown drive the end of regulation it meant down back for overtime after this message and we're local ABC station overtime at Camp Randall just like the last Buckeyes visit here back in 2012 ion stayed at that point that you're ineligible between the postseason but stayed undefeated Carlos Hyde at a touchdown on in overtime and then Christian Bryant Pat it down a pass to secure it toss the coin here and no down whoever wins the coin toss will would like to go on defense first okay gentlemen extra period each team gets one timeout for overtime tears they do not carry over we're going to do a coin toss right now this will be the only coin toss we do if you win the cost you have the option of going on offense first defense first or selected by the field in which you would like to play Ohio State you are the visitor please give me your call so tails is called it his head the copies on the pot defense Wisconsin wins the toss elect to go on defense which in would you like to play at yeah okay she's taken away from the students leg I don't play that in but what guy offense will get the ball first and will get away from the bleacher creatures will try to head down to the other doctor he's a veteran who that couldn't make the right decision there with the see if this badger defense didn't make a scene here Ohio State has been very productive after halftime also something to keep in mind both these field goal kickers have been great tonight both sides three for three for both of them and so if you're unable to come up with a touchdown you'd like to think of that you'd be able to continue for both these kickers although those goal posts can look a little bit in there or in overtime much as thick as the risk tonight while Chris had a fail gegen oniy when he kicked that that clutch field goal the beat LSU in Lambo bonded out from long distance and then he injured his back had surgery this guy right here Andrew Endicott who again did not attempt a field goal in his high school career he's a senior a senior we had more tackles than field goals made in his career recovery and kickoff but guys on offense from the 25 if you hadn't told me that tonight I'd never know Wilson motions in they picks it back to Samuel on a reverse flip the tackle you know Brooklyn native muscles down inside the 15 thick of a block there in front of him to be able to give him some room to run there Maclaurin his sophomore at an Indianapolis gave him that first down looked like he might be short but he pushed that defensive back on the almost into the sideline whistle before its first down twice right tackle French who's had a rough night pass protection move full court office number 59 5 yard penalty remains for salad we were third penalty tonight for Ohio State it did mean flag for Prince is looking out there and he's seen a lot of number 42 and he can do that to tackled it's not just at Princeton struggling he struggling hit some really talented pass rushers a guy with a lot of quick twitch in TJ watt and Garrett Dooley first and 15 bear it from the pocket over the middle complete breaking freest James Clark who gets involved a junior from Florida down inside the 10 a good patience there he belt the blitz DJ watt and also Jack Fitch he came on the right they were picked up he was looking downfield into the end zone but ended up coming down and kind of checked that down good decision to be patient there by Barrett parrot keeps it and to get outside flag comes in as the quarterback is drops at the 5 it will be first and goal walk Stockton but let's check the marker got a hold by chamaco Jones a left tackle from Ohio State holding offense number 74 10yard penalty repeat second down it to penalties all night Kirk Anatsui in this series and overtime out there Alex James who's trying to chase JT parrot down and one of the reasons parent was able to get around him is Jones down to tackle on the other side talked a lot about press this time is Jose with the hole making a themselves in the series the second and 13 now what time is hit here let's at the Samuel the Badgers logging down Samuel still has the speed to make the corner and get back down inside the 10 it'll be third down in about two his acceleration to the corner and then you think he might just go out of bounds but then he turns his shoulders kind of squares up and picks up another six yards Meyer out on the field is 32 Mike Weber ended again do you think they're gay there didn't dare go for well and probably his own read at some kind where you gave Weber or bear it a chance to run the football depending on the read at a hurry play pocket Eric keeps it fires ends on fire truck scene Noah Brown stretched out and makes the catch in a dart from the quarterback people now state the lead they gave the action the zone read action which kind of froze the defense then he was oneonone on the outside there's his own read look now it's just oneonone he recognizes the back shoulder fade is there the defender Tendo never really even saw the football so instead of throwing it downfield great timing great job by both the receiver and the quarterback JT Barrett going to his guy Noah Brown he's important conversion around urban knocks it through and single is played a pretty good game but he said guy that got beat by Amaro Darbo from Michigan for the gamewinning touchdown the last game and look at the position where he puts this football that is something you work on and work on and in fact when you call the play in the huddle depending on where the defender is in relation to the receiver dictates where the throw is so Brown doesn't really know where he's going to throw the ball he hopes that Barrett sees the same thing he sees and that's why you practice hours and hours and hours of quarterbacks and receivers with that timing for his touchdown pass tonight for JD to go with the two running touchdowns that gives him sole possession of the alltime ohio state record for touchdowns responsible for they overcome a false start and a holding penalty in this series and now as you said earlier now the ball kind of goes back into the hands of Alex Hornibrook and this Wisconsin offense it's had a pretty good night pretty good night but they have had their issues done in the restaurant must score the fourth double overtime limit first down carry it immediately no gain as web of doing the defensive front that time when you see a play blown up like that it's all about the defensive line the linebackers may end up getting involved in making it tackles and that time you saw Tyrone Baker but it was really Michael Hill 77 and Raymond Jones the freshman out of Cleveland that impacted that play because of the initial surge that they got at the line of scrimmage when it looks straight back plus fires far side high ballpark real why see Columbus native steppedup the Badgers first and goal this is a big time throw from a freshman watch this he gets hit by Sam Hubbard almost as he's releasing this throws it to a spot and there's wheelwright as you said out of Columbus the toe tap to get them both down heck of a catch and a bigtime throw by Hornibrook here I thought he got he got cut in a half of it if young guy showing his toughness and his accuracy this Clement behind ramnish in the I formation he's got it but again penetration we have no game Chris Worley the linebacker cleaned it up from close down on NC slanders come here Worley coming around from the outside Landers being able to get in there just affect the timing of it the pulling guard unable to pick up his block but great penetration there I'll tell you Robert Landers has a great future true freshman it wasn't necessarily highly touted but he he was kind of great start to his young career three plays to get four yards in force double OT lemon goes in motion Hornibrook backpedaling backpedaling and has to just throw it out of the end zone throwdown coming up they tried to hide Fumagalli there on the playaction he was blocking they were hoping that the linebackers would just assume that he was in the block and then they released him late but Raekwon McMillan getting the leader of the defense picked him up and the freshman just gave up on the play and had to throw it on the back of the end zone women erratic German for no gaming that was fakers renting out the drop the running back it is fourth down Badgers down to one play all comes down to this heck of a play there by Jerome Baker with his speed to be able to chase down Clement and now you're Paul Chryst for the best play callers in the sport a lot of things at work now you wonder how did he give his young quarterback the chance here to execute and throw the football Ohio State will be coming after Lee Myers going to call a timeout so now you get Paul Chris trying to come up with a play that'll work you've got the Ohio State defensive brain trust Luke fickle Greg Schiano trying to put their puzzle pieces in place so hyoe state team then trails throughout much of this night a lot of youth in that group right there a lot of inexperience battling back and trying to secure a win with one more defensive play I think when Luke pickle and his group are trying to figure out is the play mantoman or tu plays on you play mantoman and you're at the risk of maybe some rubber outs or some mix down in this area if you play zone you're at the risk of Fumagalli and others finding a hole in that zone so they're trying to kind of figure out what they think will give them the best chance one thing you know they're going to bring some pressure after Hornibrook and Paulo Chris you call him one of the best play callers and Alex football he's got a white play called and his young quarterback he's played so well tonight and executed I'll say the stock away from their 20th consecutive win in true row games plan mantoman well game on the line 20 foot not Ohio State makes a defensive stand and survives in Madtown in overtime Nick Bosa in Tae Kwan Lewis got the corvex face repair it the touchdown pass in overtime to brown shows his mettle he has denies the Badgers an upset street fight that's what urban expected he got it that's exactly right I'm not the pressure we just talked about coming after Hornibrook but is really Prince is a combination of the coverage downfield and the pressure there's nowhere for him to go with this football he's trying to get PV but you'll see coming into your screen but watch when the pressure gets to him and look right now there's nobody open you'll see PV trying to work in and inside here there's just nobody open it was great coverage downfield nobody open he's forced to just eat the ball and Ohio State gets to him there on the last play of the game with Jalen Holmes we saw how a defense that came in so dominant that was reeling a bit in the first half played a much much stronger second half in an overtime they secured the victory go to Samantha with Urban Meyer and JC Barrett yeah Chris all smiles and hugs down here coach at halftime no smiles Len so what was the difference between your team in the first half at late in the team first of all this was great for our conference what an environment a lot of respect for our opponent that was a desert ballgame a halftime we did you know there was a lot of yelling and we just didn't play great but a lot of people don't play greatness Stadium on the road and they hung in there hung in there and that the young team is getting older they're maturing what is it about this place that makes it so difficult you played in a lot of Colorado zone they're good players and that's we start talking about places places without good players that's they have very good players they play very hard well coach they beat LSU they beat missed the state very good team we get out of here and win and go home last thing for you about this guy the development through I see that what can you say about his development through this game when things were clicking early yeah but he's a soldier soldiers a warrior and he's a guy that fights of adversity and I knew at some point he's going to go win the game for us like he's done many many a lot of confidence from your head coach thanks Urban jakey's you curing that from your coaches got to feel good for one but how would you describe your mindset throughout the story of this game I think you just keep on pushing we knew there was a good football team they had a great defense over there like coach said they got good players over there so it's give them credit as well and you know add a good game play force they had to actually prepare so we had to make adjustments in the first half I think after halftime we came in and just had to grind it out you've been through a lot on the scene but obviously you've got some young guys in this so when you have a situation like that have to help them push through when things aren't looking good early does understand that these are the things that we go through an offseason there's the grinding out the two days in the audience all those things prepares for moments like this and this is the time where you got to bring it out of you did your team getting better tonight absolutely I think mindset coming in a place like this with a great team in Wisconsin in a hostile atmosphere a great place for college football I think we grew up even more this week last thing for you when you heard jump around did you want to jump just a little bit we're just alike I did a little bit but I knew we had focus and go score so now but it's a great atmosphere here and I was a good team huge win congratulations JP so you Brett Hermann Maier as Sam said not smiling where you can see wow we just read it lips right there as the Buckeyes stay undefeated escape will be back on the road in another jazzed up environment next week in Happy Valley Penn State coming off a bye as the Badgers were climate in Wisconsin left it all out there and came up four yards short in overtime very Kirk again busy as a runner carry 221 times at a couple of touchdown after halftime throwing the ball 11 and 15 buck 45 and the gamewinning touchdown to brown yeah the gamewinning touchdown that put the Ohio State defense in a spot where they wanted to try to get pressure and this is the guy that I think he was trying to get the ball to but he's got a couple receivers going out trying to get mantoman trying to set up kind of a rub or a pick but the timing of the play doesn't work see right now by the time he's trying to work free this is what's coming in after him the play just did not work out Ohio State had a completely covered down field and given the Buckeyes defense a lot of credit they were challenged tonight against a well prepared offense by Paul Chryst his quarterback played well the running game was much better tonight but the Buckeyes came up with a big play on that side of the ball when the game was on the line and a similar finish their last visit here to Madison we mentioned that game four years ago they squirts out with a person in the defense makes the stand it preserves a sevenpoint victory on the road defenders just kind of run around looking for people to hug as a they really had to work hard against the determined and in a very very crafty Wisconsin offense to them yeah keep in mind I think you get a bye week after five games you take advantage of it by resting up and kind of trimming the fat a little bit and try to figure out you Phelps down to find out works but not and they were so prepared I mean they came in here not hoping to pull off an upset they came in fully anticipating that they're going to win the game this is a football team by the way with Wisconsin he played LSU Michigan State Michigan Ohio State it's for big time opponents and I think that's what came brought him into this game feeling that they had a chance and I thought Sam asked a great question to JT Barrett did your team grow up absolutely young team learning how to win on the road they've won in Norman now and now they win tonight one of the toughest and atmospheres in the country well Kirk was an interesting week in the top five it was Alabama emphatically but you had number two and number three in the polls having to go to overtime to survive you're going to give us give us your top four down yeah Clemson kind of has the feel of Ohio State a year ago where they have a team in a nucleus a lot of them are back from a year ago they just think they're kind of just not quite clicking so I dropped in down to four move Michigan up to three Ohio State kind of stays here at two and an Alabama if I could create a gap if I could go Alabama gap to three and four I would do that because I think Alabama right now is kind of all by themselves excuse first out and you have four yeah Huskies are coming very close and so give a shout out to another team your street cred brought to you by Allstate this week about Vandy it was a road win yeah impressive the head jersey janna they go to Georgia Derek Mason gets a big win and something we've been doing all year long with with street street cred it's something on Twitter it's a chance for us to recognize a team that's kind of a team of the week and with Vandy being able to win on the road in a game that not many people anticipate congratulations to Derek Mason and the Commodores with a big win it's their first SEC Road win in while we'll be back in this same time slot a week from now it'll be this Ohio's 18 again going on the road against Penn State the Lions has struggled but it'll be it'll be a whi that'll be another crazy environment that is Ohio State games gonna try to overcome but I think if you're if you're Urban Meyer and you're JT Barrett and you're the staff you've got to feel like going into another you know what it's like with Penn State at night and the White House you got to feel like having this experience next time you get put in that position there's there's confidence there with the youth now that they've seen what was out there now you have to grind through these games for 60 minutes and tonight they found a way to win we'll see what happens next week grind flu is a great way to put it states surviving as Barrett runs for 2 throws for one and the fourth sack of the night for the Buckeyes finally seals it in overtime hope you have enjoyed it as much as we have Ohio State wins did 3223 in OT tonight's game produced by Bill Vidal directed by Derrick motley for our entire talented and dedicated crew here in Madison and for Kirk and Samantha ponder Chris mallocing so long next week again in State College in Beaver Stadium for the Buckeyes and the Nittany Lions time now for the full wrapup show and let's go to Cassidy huh birth back in the studio
