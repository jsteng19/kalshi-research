============================================================

welcome to college football presented by Exxon and Mobil and welcome to a pictureperfect afternoon for a Big Ten matchup here at the Horseshoe Ohio State off to a perfect start number two in America taking on the Hoosiers of Indiana hi again everyone Bob with Susan here with Rock you eart allison williams will join us in just a moment the calendar turns to October the leaves start to change and Ohio State is at the top of the pole it's amazing Urban Meyer finds a way to do this year after year in spite of the fact that they lost 11 players in the spring to the NFL Draft how does he keep this program with this type of consistent performance I think two things jump out about this crew in particular very as fast a team as I've seen yet in college football and doing my preparation getting ready for this and secondly and Kevin Wilson the Indiana coach just made this comment to me moments ago on the field saying it's remarkable how urban has cut the entitlement out these kids are so hungry you watch practice it is as competitive and combative a practice as you're going to find but they love it and they love coming together on game day in a pretty special way and to be number two in America you need a quarterback he of course has one and JT farad number two right now in our Heisman ology our kind of unofficial poll that we take of our Heisman voters on staff and yet not getting the national discussion that you might believe you would and I love how he continues to grow his game Vick 10 Player of the Year two years ago and he's never satisfied this is what he does natural he's a tremendous runner and those carries up and down a little bit this season and that's by design to try to take some of the pounding off of the guy that can run through any tackle the anticipation is the passer this is where in 2016 is much further ahead than he was two years ago and he's always been a magician which is a 1 in this offense it has quarterback run in a plethora of speedy options to get the ball to JT's on it and the team in the offense has responded to him as good as their offense has been Allison Williams their defense amazingly has been that much better yeah when I asked head coach Urban Meyer how much credit his defense deserves for the success so far he said quote almost all of it because when you don't allow touchdowns you have a pretty good team not only do they keep opponents out of the end zone they score twice as many touchdowns and they've allowed so yes they are at the top of just about every defensive category the defensive coordinator Luke sickles told us we don't set any defensive statistic bowls we have one goal to be the best defense in the country and guys based on scoring DS they are so far they have been as flawless defensively as they have offensively it's time for football we'll kick it off in just a moment Indiana and Ohio State don't go away welcome back to Columbus you're watching the big ten on ESPN and it's time for ready for kickoff brought to you by Penn Sox and Brock where will your eyes be on States going to get the ball and Curtis Daniel is going to get lots of touches today Urban Meyer's charged the number of touches his home run hitters get and Curtis is as fast as anybody on the field today I expect to see him all over richer Lego I don't look up too many quarterbacks but he's every bit as big plus and he swings it all over the field the number one passing offense in the big 10 this game will go through his right arm and then lastly the one area that urban told us yesterday he still like the feet grow and be more dominant is his deal i they will get an opportunity against an inexperienced into the box true freshman o lineman for Indiana this afternoon and of course I you coming off of their first win over a ranked opponent since September of 2014 and they found a way against Michigan State in overtime at home last week 24:21 Indiana has a good sudo in the big ten for nineteen ninety one and an interesting move they won the toss and defer their option through the second half so it'll be the fuch odd to start with the football then we are underway at the Horseshoe Eric Campbell from the one Eric Campbell barely to the 18 the field position on the side of the Hoosiers could Chafee Barrett on the side of the bus 17 touchdown he's accounted for this season 14 of them through the air he's got speed and lots of spaces to distribute and one thing I love about JP is his composure we knew the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year is the redshirt freshman we shatter records you know you're good and the team feeds off his competency boys and leadership on a level according to Urban Meyer with Tim Tebow in this locker room high praise Mike Weber the redshirt freshman starting at tailback but you will see Curtis Samuel number four you will see dontre Wilson number two all over the field for Ohio State those down handoff whoever to the edge abound it's 25 it was blocked by Pat L on the center and the numbers the JT Barrett continues to pile up he could be across the board recordholder just about everywhere in the Ohio State he first down picked up the run game to start for the Buckeyes my clever out to the 35yard line part of the reason Kevin Wilson decided to defer and kick it off here is yes more faith in his defense of personality and that in six years their strength is their linebackers they're States in tackling and with their challenges up front you're seeing that the first two stamps is Ohio State moving and changing that line of scrimmage folded into the short area of the field if they pull out the center and that time might not have a pistol look right into the teeth of indienity a little shovel to the left and at the bent over backwards split right off of the facemask of liver recovered by Indiana's Patrick Daugherty so I you get an early break and they're on the fluff side of the field we're seeing this play more and more in falsehood boy you're just trying to get your player up to the second level but JT throws it before Webber is even ready it worked on that all week that's a play that I want to get my differencemaker the ball and your newest hands immediately so he can get his vision down the field but you still Ike talked about his anticipation he's a passer but those running backs he wants to make sure they make the eye contact before a play like that endoscopy on the spot great field position inside the Ohio State 30 Richard lega the junior college transfer has to deal with a hundred thousandplus in the crowd noise devine reading up the middle he is a hammer looking for a nail down to about the 20 C yard line a gain of seven right up the middle and that will take a lot of pressure off of Richard Lego wondering how he'll handle this atmosphere that will be his best friend because playaction pass at six foot six off of that inside run is what he does best right now reading again at the first down and almost had a lot more Brandon Knight with a good block on the edge of right tackle so it will be a gain of six quick pace here's divine reading finds a cutback Lane down to the six yard line looks to be good for a first down you saw the same concept with a quick hitch there but that time Lego gets his running back the opportunity to square his shoulders and remember this Allison get on it Jarrell rushing touchdowns allowed this season for this group offensively difficult to run into pretty stout tremendous upon dr. McMillan the sole of attention of their defense number five right in the middle Lego changes the play now in the shotgun quarterback keeper that loses about three to the eight yard line where it will be second down in goals her own Baker came through first for the bugs eight opposition rape zone trip so far this season and only one touchdown allowed by this Buckeye defense and that will be the last time we see that play call this afternoon well they gave him a generous spot back to about the six yard line and looked like you went out near the eighth second down and goal the bond reading third down and goal at the pool that's where the challenge of that first down play your margin for error you hear people talk about it all the time in the passing game everything condenses margin prayer plate calling does as well the top torretta he won't get that fourth and goal down inside the 4 yard line again it was Jerome Baker making the stop so the turnover by Ohio State but they step in inside the 5yard line and it will be Griffin oats to come on to try to give Indiana the early lead that's now 6 of 15 scoring touchdowns in the red zone you've got to be around 75 to be 80% you'd be sitting there in the forties of the early early run game you get yourself down there that ability to execute and first down failure they let down that drive the big 10 kicker of the year though puts it through from last season off to a shaky start this year five for his first nine but not that one through Indiana gets the turnover and they've got the three nothing lead interesting start here at the Horseshoe Oh laces place remember he he dr. Peck who he wanted for a kicker for a kicker that was five of nine coming in going to by the way that's a further kick yeah kevin wilson head coach loves mitchell paves the will senior slot receiver thought he could hold and oaks told the head coach i'd rather now the guy that I worked with an awful lot the kickers and punters spent so much training together I'd rather have the continuity with Joseph that time I got to clean the laces got to go out we're watching the record the game if Indiana can hope that Ohio State will turn it over to this year ago and this was a sevenpoint game the Buckeyes three turnovers to the Hoosiers Bureau the losers steal three points to start right back where we began with Ripa notes taking a deep the Paris gamble at the 10th Vica time goes to the 30yard line infinitum son Genzyme statement pardon me sunshine state showdown between number 23 Florida State and number 10 Miami at 8:00 on ABC Mark Richt track I on the games with their first true test against the nose won the last six meetings in one of the most bitter rivalries in college football can also be seen streaming live on the ESPN app and watch ESPN what's the win for the Knowles and the real statement game for Mark Richt in year one like whoever the two yards on first down Ralph green one of those fifth year seniors inside couple of 305 pounders and deep this the tackle on that I you defensive line rock that Urban Meyer said might be the most impressive pair of players that the Hooper's at but a physical and a week ago Michigan State played the game in a phone booth and tried to climb it if the big fellas and they didn't move an inch Iowa State wants to get the ball outside to the second level Curtis Samuel empties the backfield Marren he wants to default for Samuel underthrown and a crowd looking for a flag Tony feels seem to impede Curtis Samuels ability to fight back for the football but no flag out brings up third down and eight it's a windy day it's breezy Brewer down on the field earlier and this is hopefully under prone by jayz yet nine out of ten times this time I talk to the referee on the field before the games Big Ten plays are going to let them play they know there's going to be hand fighting outside but surprised to not see the penalty there when we typically do empty backfield again on third down 80 farad wide open and that bunch formation freed up market saw the tight ass just walked on a coverage bus by Indiana for a big birthday yeah what happens there is destruction of furtive finial the gamechanger even when he doesn't get the touch so much the influence vivianne a bus because there times to make sure that Curtis Daniel doesn't beat them I didn't come to the slide over Barrett on a caper into the secondary a gain of 13 there's a magician who talked about it in the open it's so gifted and skilled in a 2014 when they were at I'm unstoppable its visibility when you hear quarterback that boy oh he is so poised Tom Brady it's so poised and so patient in the pocket that they pass her through but to have the poise in the run game to ride that mess point as long as JT does takes a lot of guts and a lot of skill little zone read again and it's not bouncing it outside but nothing there for Mike Weber on first down maybe a yard and a half T grayscales made the stop at the 30 yard line so it's second down along again and there once again I think you see the strength of this crew the Indiana plan is to muddy the waters up front defensively and allowed tigre and your linebackers op3 tacklers for all their linebackers Marcelino ball number three scales number one oliver number two that guys want to stay square and let the speed at linebacker run horizontally playaction the slant clock fighting his way as Noah Blau for a first down Alex Ohio State's turn in the red zone a gain of 11 that's why ribbon Meyer loads deep there it's like you played this image like Kevin Wilson on the other side phrase JT that's waiting for all the Lamar Jackson deshaun Watson Ian please just get off the list that was a free runner right in his face Marcelino ball but Nickelback and he knows it and he never pushes and delivers a perfect capture run ball in that sunset at the top of your screen nearest man Katie Barrett is Curtis Samuel clock down to one they run a little option and this one snipped out nicely as Nate hop tripped up Barry lost a yard that's right in between the three best offensive lineman for Ohio State at F line in the middle Billy price as strong as they come they hop is no flop six 305 pounds Tefo quick snap and luckily a flag thrown for Ohio State they'll take the false start here and run Paul start offense all of the players were not set prior to the snap on your kennel T repeat second down and this is what urban miner likes to do you like to put down they're not going to just be a tempo team that lines up in one formation the motion they shift it takes everybody getting on the same page she doesn't want to simplify so much and make it look the same and easy on that defense he wants everybody moving but you've got to get set and you're right Bumble earlier you met us catastrophic one over the head of bear there you can see penalties just about the only statistic that goes against this Buckeye team this year and then lon Barrett wellprotected across the middle against Brown but he's bottled up quickly good job on the coverage by Sean Regan great through freshman running with Noah Brown and a big play here early you can feel it every time we're in this situation rock for the Indiana defense they're going to give up yards between the twenties they need stops in the red zone you're talking about the number one third down team in America add that to the list for defense coop in it's so good on the money down because there are so many weapons to try to contain including the quarterback run and it's a fiveman rush Barrett looks a zone almost intercepted on the carom hey Sean Riggins not a hand in on Noah Brown again and it is a red zone stop for the Indiana defense get cover it better than this nice for profit velocity I like the fourman rush instead to the threeman rush and that should have gone the other way Riggins doing what his buddy on the other side fav does better than any country in America and that's break up to pass to nearly backtoback pick away 37yard field goal attempt right down the middle for Tyler Durbin and we are tied at three the both defenses with important red zone stops here in the first IANA to get past the midway point of the first quarter tied at three the iron sky doesn't live for anybody in Urban Meyer told at Point Blank this to be the best team they face in through the first half of the first quarter you see the difference at the end basically they can write hit Monta Williams from the 1 &amp; 4 the sideline gets a block excellent return now to the 38 yard line our first chance to say hi to admin burger alright man thanks very much two field goals in the first order here at the horseshoe 622 to go an excellent field position again for Indiana at their own 37 hurtling into the heart of that Buckeye defense was divine ready Tremont Jones made the stop Allison would he have Richard leggo very calm to start things keep an eye on his emotion and how he responds if he faces adversity at times it's gotten the best of him he's gotten a little wound up as Coach Wilson told us the message today you have to deal with adversity you can't hide that's never been more true than today has yet to throw the football it's an all running play so far here's his first throw of the day and it is on time to Mitchell Paige well that was in control that's a big first down of a 40yard line of the Buckeyes that's a gain of 21 this is the advantage you have when you're six six and when you can get that interior run and get those linebackers moving forward you have the capability of throwing it right over their head went snap ready lost the gun let's just sum of just the scheme that Urban and his staff break Schiano luke fickle they knew that Indiana with their scheme would present some real challenges their run past options their playaction pass with a kid that could push it all over the field greatly inexperienced Oh for Mendes our town first opportunity I cut back from Mike Magette third down and six coming up after Raekwon McMillan one of only three returning starters on that Buckeye defense mavis top five firstround picks for Ohio State in this past spring strap the hungrier defense according to the coaching staff here now but guys with one deep safety they show up crowd becomes a dick toxic pull on the play clock I didn't get the playoff the way game you start down the little surprise Kevin Wilson over there was watching the play clock as well that side red right next to you Kevin ropes and it coats play caller opportunity looking at that play cloth to protect his inexperienced quarterback for the time save valuable five yard exactly the question I was going to ask you do you not I can miss environment for the first time maybe put that on the coast to call that time that this has been doomed then just are those numbers only one conversion Eve our season play clock down to four again now they have to qualify after the sidelines will avoid another game it was third and six now it's third and 11 it was merely third and 16 after the Indiana timeout they don't need to pick up the first down as you can see to get into what they consider field goal range for Griffin Oaks three man rush goes to checked out my project and now what do you do it's for sound and for your right on the field goal line Brock how much do you think if you're Indiana you can afford to try field goals today you're 6 to 10 on the season that players are old to watch your operation in the very first field goal get a little bit messy in heaven Wilson knows that 24 bullies is it going to really be day I like this phone when we talked to Kevin Wilson earlier this week we asked him about this specific situation fourth down in plus territory how aggressive will you be they're going for in just rule of seven from fourth day and now a timeout it looks like we'll be called from the Ohio State sideline so whether it was Luke's pickle downstairs or Greg Schiano upstairs one of the two didn't like what he saw will step aside come back in 30 seconds back in Columbus you probably couldn't have scripted a much more efficient start on the road for Indiana but here's a big play will they actually snap the ball on fourth down and a long for close to five you saw a great Friday offensive line coach Barca native guides that tells name is urging them and get lake or the opportunity to throw a show blitz flags down the play belong dead we see fourth down that takes the opportunity away from Indiana they're going to punt and it's right in front of you and you see the flinch and you know that he has a game Halle Berry was going to do pass and I have some oneonone opportunities and the jet the running back there knowing that he's got to cut down that in tried to get started early instead forced the hand of Kevin Wilson to punt five very important yards that moves you outside a field goal range and now on fourth down and nine they're going to give the football up get in with the intentional endoverend pick trying to pin the Buckeyes deep and it looks like he will do just that as they are able to flip the ball out of bounds at the oneyard line tremendous this is what you saw out of Indiana last week this is why they because you can take for the first time in some time it was execution in every phase and zip the ball cop the gunner in that case have been boxing corners he's running down the field that they say is half the job of putting himself insufficient and it was a pretty hard fought win against party last week it took every phase of the offense defense special teams and this is a different Hoosier team in the one Ohio State has dominated for decades in this matchup you're seeing it really in all three phases in this first quarter so the ball just across the chaulk at about the one foot line zone read the Weber and that gives some breathing room out to the seven as Jonathan Crawford came up a stick mike weber but not before he picked up about six yards a little bit like indian on the other side who wants that inside run to play pass that inside run sets a perimeter run an outside perimeter opportunities for so far a very quiet curtis samuel to through the course of this game my hunch won't be quiet non fray wilson the front man in a stack formation at the top of your screen not a part of the first series much offensively for ohio state but he is dangerous out here now read option again JP Barrett bounces it outside first out is this what makes them so difficult with the pen is all the weapons on the outside the inside run game that's a pretty easy read in the end goes to what you call an odd front a threepound front with very big bubbles riverbed lanes for JT the have the patient hold the ball and move the sticks and if 17 that equals JP Barrett's longest run of the season Wow it's like whoever gained at six this side the 30yard line in the end Willis made the stop you merit trying to turn the corner this time he's brought down at the thirty after a gain of a half yard who an urban is frustrated you see him come barking down the sidelines I think some of that frustration from urban as he's sensing I mean he's feeling the Indiana team that is plain incredibly fast this group is supposed to be the fastest in America at the quarterback run into the short part of the field he wants a hat on a hat and get guys so we tremendous energy right now the Hoosiers explain a little bit more of it on their side of the ball third down and four they clock down to five for the Buckeyes and the backfield parrot I thought tips and falls incomplete rashard pant on the coverage he got in front of James Clark and Indiana's about to get the football back that's tremendous team defense we saw us earlier with a wide open wide receiver for Ohio State at that time third down for the tough guys are the best in football they motion Samuel out trying to distract the senior Fayette there the redshirt junior excuse me he doesn't want to give me pants break up Dustin America doing it lucky style kick from Cameron Johnson and a fair catch inside the 20 yard line by Mitchell Paige back to ad man and a big game there and obviously a score that you would think would be raising some eyebrows for folks that might not be watching our game here on ESPN right now tied at three Indiana has the football back here about to end the first quarter Kevon reading bottled up and dropped down to a loss of the yard we've seen some check with me situation for both quarterback that time you're running a run play and some of the conversation I'm sure on the sideline yeah day let's get up here and just run the ball as well everything T know we'd be checked with me to get our temple going at that time the wrong time is they run right into the team of a corner flip and a smart move here by Indiana shortened the game they let the quarter end and the deeper we go into this game more police you have to think would be there for the Hoosiers they played a terrific first quarter on the road we are tied at three after one quarter of play here is a horseshoe number two might have a challenge on their hands all afternoon tied at 3:00 at the start of the second quarter Papa Susan's Roth fewer Allison Williams and the rest of our crew here at the Horseshoe and a very quiet horseshoe at that richard lego indiana starting deep in their own ends second down and ten here in the second quarter but did plenty to take the crowd out of the game in the first 15 minutes playaction they go extending the play at the needs of design reading so now it's third down in San Kalyan homes I was tracking Lego one second with Allison rock you showed us and film how Ohio State likes to use those linebackers around the line of scrimmage and have them dance a little bit of course the imposing fronts to collapse and squeeze well the message to Indiana's tight end to keep your eyes on that defensive end even if the linebacker is coming keep your eyes on the B gap you see how many times we hear that from coaches to have that awareness of what's going on around you and the eye discipline there isn't always just for defenders to be pro tied into alignment as well via four man rush Lego in the flat divine reading profit in Indiana will have to punt in third and ten is going to be no good one of 15 coming into the game on third and nine plus now one of 17 this season and that's mantoman coverage there are few opportunities without Ohio State having any threat of a run game in front of them to find a lot of open windows got to be better than the early down those of get Aeons first punt right on his season average 239 yards dontre Wilson averaging over 10 yards per return so far this season so he could set oh hi Oh state up with great field position wobbly kick they sent Indiana bounce out of bounds at the 33 49yard punt tonight at 7:00 here on ESD number one Alabama taking on number 16 Arkansas the tide of 117 in a row we're back Austin Allen leads a Razorback offensive attack this one has bigtime SEC and playoff implications you can also see it streaming live on the ESPN app and watch ESPN Nick Saban once again gluing the Urban Meyer does this keeps it rolling despite losing terrific towers on both side to the ball the most like two years ago going here to Fayetteville will be no easy task tonight curtis samuel and there have not been brock a lot of touches so far for curtis Samuel and dontre Wilson who you picked out as really the too speedy difference makers for this will how state often and there's that full folder right there right right next to Irv and I are in his hands and on it he keeps track of the number of touches talking head warner the offensive coordinator when urban is marking right there is how many times do i get my home run hitter at that and i promise you Curtis Samuel when the head man is in charge and he wants him getting the ball will find ways to get him into action the emotions into the slot on second down he buried under pressure and go down Nate hop got him for a sack that's a loss of a yard and now it's third down and nine how many guys a Billy Bryce and got F line the center in my guard tangle with that can match them manoamano in the Christ right guard there 54 October 700pound he is the strongest of any tough guy but if there's a guy in this conference to wants to not only in the weight room but on the gridiron go toe to toe it might just be Nate hop throw in the middle hard to push around Barun with the pocket collapsing again goes down again this time it's Ralph green a three and out force by the Indiana defense they're better on this side of the ball Tom Allen the defensive coordinator for the Hoosiers part of the reason this coach Wilkins the first coming out the game he likes with this crew is doing and there is more sensible leaf on that side of the ball than they've had in a long time Cameron Johnston bounces one had Mitchell Paige tells his teammates to get away from and it rolls down to the 11yard loss a field position lowscoring game between Indiana and Ohio State that will be expected Iowa State the Buckeyes get info and when you do that you are trying to confuse your opponent you're trying to disrupt their eyes which I like to talk about and you're going to see right here these four look at the eyes of the Hoosiers right here into this round combination they are seeing everything that's going on and then most importantly at the moment of truth right here these two Rashard faintly at safety to pass off that combination they do just that they forced the take away or the punt mr. Biggins one before on third down for the Buckeye and they start this drive to the Hoosiers with their piledriver the true freshman Tyler an 80 he's only 270 standing behind Richard Lego and coming in up the middle for about a yard that's right 270 he picks her head was a high school Wildcat quarterback the heal effective posture and how much fun that was for 190 pounds high school linebackers for artifact a big man that only picked up a yard they go underneath and that's a gain of maybe another yard that Donovan Hale this feels like the tape I watched last night of Tulsa coming into this building and playing very similar defense for 30 minutes he'll give up guys the two field goals the problem was proposed to turn it over twice by the pitch pickles and 14 points the other way incredibly conservative out of the Hoosiers here don't mind it on the road as well as their defense explaining they are down long particularly difficult for Indiana play go under pressure does not see the rust coming from behind the balls out that's a fumble who's got it it looks like it might be the dugout Taekwon Lewis gets the strip set and its first and goal Ohio State but covered by Jalen Holmes what did I just get done saying about Colson and their offensive what if they're do with SD things going right now in college football it's scoring defense the group has also scored four touchdowns themselves and out 12 takeaways on the season they play fast they play as the entire unit and I think we'll take a look here and make sure that arm if you're a Hoosier fan you're sure hoping that ball was going forward is incomplete rather than a fumble I don't think there's any doubt he's got the ball in his hand and his arm starts coming forward wouldn't you say the method incomplete pass and he maintains and when if he's getting hit there it looks like he should get hit early the ball move and it doesn't until his arm is coming forward I think you're right mr. wishes and here about a hundred percent on these typically right but the arms coming forward and I think the key there is Tai Kwan makes that contact right that initial contact the arm is still going back but the big strong leg oh they're six six 230 pounds maintains in my estimation control arm goes forward ball gets knocked away for the incomplete back even that this turns out to be an incomplete pass as we think it will doesn't the internal clock for the quarterback have to go off at some point there with the speed of this Buckeye defense how much time do you think you have before someone especially a Tai Kwan Louis is going to track you down from behind you got to get it out and that was a messaging all week for Richard and I'm a little surprised and those third down and long as you're still not seeing a little playaction pass that inside run right because you've been run in a little bit and you've been consistent had conviction to do so and I think between the tackles is where he's going to be most successful today after we're here the ruling on the field stands so the determination from replay was that this ball was loose and was not in his grasp and his arm is coming forward and stays with the key what was cold on the field if that was called incomplete on the field it would have stood I believe that way first and goal after the turnover playaction de Barras swings it right and exists but Hoosiers not cool there was a lot of moving parts in dontre Wilson wanted to run a long developing wheel rat he grayscales stayed all the Nathan Scott Tom Allen's Goodwin defense coordinators like Kevin Wilson Lady Jane he's also uniquely got five defensive coaches on that staff fulltime assistant there for Tom Allen they are not full their playing team defense and they're in the right spot at the right time Mike Weber turns the corner so what ultimately is ruled a fumble Cox Indiana 7th with the best teams do Atlee up six and now it's seven and it's a 10 3 Ohio State lead if you lose the spring game and you saw Greg Schiano out there with a wheelbarrow and TT Barrett working hard as well Ohio State yes it sucks down off the turnover and now how will Indiana respond short kick Levante Williams just inside the 10 pounded down at about the 3 yard line we've got today's a black trivia question what power five school has gone the longest since appearing in the AP top 25 I will give you against it is not Ohio State as they have only been in the AP poll 78 of the 81 years that the AP poll has been in existence then they don't glitch and that's going to be the job as Lego looks to the heavens of the Hoosiers right here to equally not flesh down just seven devine reading slow developing play looking for a cutback claim it's just not there and it eventually ends up underneath tailored homes and he saw the early run success for the Hoosiers that's because the early down runs except quick snap on second down and now Brock for an offense that is in particular struggling this season third down and long it is third down and ten again well the line three those possessions on that chart or is a thing where this drive is having zero success from first leggo looking for the default Nick Westbrook is out in front all the way down to the book on 26 he beat Denzel Ward what a huge play for the Indiana offense he sure did and I have no idea what Denzel is looking at there this is a team that plays basically two coverages on the perimeter Man or quarters mean he's on with still Man concept and Denzel let's Westbrook one right by them divine reading crab down behind the line another tackle for loss by Jerome Baker and you don't need much even two yards on first down is a win because that then allows you get to the rest of your PlayBook and typically more manageable third downs but zero or one or in that case negative on first down the real challenge like Lockett ten reading nothing that lost a couple more Robert Landers redshirt freshmen teamed up with Sam Humbert to make the stop and now it's third down and 15 leggo he's going to take a shot flutters one down the sideline it could jump all batted around incomplete intended for Donovan Hale perfect coverage that time by the captain Gary on Conley and now do you try a long field goal or do you go for it on fourth and 15 I still think you have a lot of trust in your field goal group and geureon is a difficult one to go oneonone with you're trying to quick snap it work the previous third down Arion is good there get oneonone opportunity now the timeout looks like we'll be called and maybe a penalty for substitution on Ohio State Ohio State per second a flag is thrown but it looks like Ohio State granted the timeout to avoid the penalty will step aside for a moment for 40 years talking to him in the kicker said I don't know come on booth what do you think in terms of the wind as to why they're not going for a field goal yeah the winds been changing at a moment's notice right now it would be into the wind but I'm telling you it changes second to second but we know Kevin Wilson talks to his kicker a lot he trusts up so they bypass what would have been about a 51yard field goal attempts to execute the punt perfectly down to the two yard line so thank you at man all right man thanks very much rock how surprised are you even with the wind that Indiana did truck point yeah I'm not they just don't trust that operation fully in the last time getting was on the field to the oneyard line this time to the one and a half year online music cuted beautifully your pumpkin situation in fact that the Buckeyes once again arid from the Enzo he wants two people looking for Paris Campbell broken up and Campbell turned into the defensive back on that play as Tyler green had terrific coverage and almost came up with a pick and you look like a Buckeyes on the corner six 390 pounds tremendous athlete can do it better than that you see the Buckeyes wanted to take some of those shots that Indiana is responded eret looking for room on second down in 10 gets only to the 5yard line so now it's third down and seven from the five and also the decision to bypass the field goal that continue to show you after they won the toss and defer their option in the second half but maybe IU has a little more faith in their defense than we thought they might against this Buckeye offer was a group that's given up only 21 a game he preys on Ohio State as you should being best in the country but Indiana no slouches on this side of the ball through the first quarter of the season well the coaching decision was designed to get you into this exact situation third down and seven from the five fourman rush Barrett wellprotected fires a strike that goes right through the hands of Harris Campbell or check that dontre Wilson it will be a punt from deep in Ohio State's own end just a little bit off then when you're playing zone coverage you've got to be precise today as a thrower and that was a little better anticipation from jayz but just a little off anybody dontre can't bring it home and you payoff that decision to punt it right here Cameron Johnston gets away a good kick at the 48 of Indiana of bear catch from Mitchell page 27 yard punt but great field position for Indiana when we return midway through the second as seemed like it was on the track that it seems like it's on now with Kevin Wilson much more competitive going toe to toe at Ohio State on the road here in the first half and great field position Richard let's go backwards past the jet get to the sideline and block if you're calling plays you're Kevin Wilson with this field position what has to happen on this series I've got I've got to push it down the field and you saw it on the previous Drive the big play the exposed to play that came out of it I would love to do it between the tackles off play back instead of second down run and now it's third down and nine Raymont Jones made the stop and there's a penalty marker down personal foul illegal block below the way offense number 76 15yard penalty repeat second down at the center in the left guard their West Rodgers in West Martin the two West is getting involved on that contact at the second level I'm doctor engaged you've got to find a way to not make contact get some no credit to Ohio State and then run defense started slow last ten rushes just zero yards for the Hoosiers now if Indiana wants a first down they have no choice but to push the ball down the field and you have to think the Buckeyes know that second down in 25 and they'll play conservatively with Magette so this is on the verge of being a major missed opportunity for Indiana starting at your own 48 yard line after you play the field position game to perfection conservative play calling in the penalty and now it's third down in a mile and the punk group will come out from inside their own 30 yard line Jalen Holmes brought down the jet for a loss of a couple yeah that's a familiar name a number right there with mr. Bosa and he gives the true freshman coy prompts the left tackle for Indiana or welcome to the big 10 football moment his poise trying to cut him down across his face both the throws that face into the turf and then Bosa was a more highly rated prospect than its older brother was coming out of high schools hard as Maddux to believe when you've got your older brother going in the top three in the draft incredibly conservative it's short in the game one possession game which is five to go but at any moment Iowa State speeds can come to life idiot with an ugly punt but this will get the job done as it does roll inside the 30yard line back to Adnan all right Advent thanks very much in Colorado showing up in the poll this week is what put Indiana unfortunately in terms of power five schools on the clock and not being a ranked team all the way back in 94 mining JT's on the clock here and I think you've got to run a little bit I know they've tried to lessen the workload with his run game take some of the punishment off but eventually been holding the ball an awful lot his first half expect to see him running instead he gives it and Krabs calling for a first down is Curtis Samuel if he picks up 12 now that's a similar effect and you see him ride that miss Boyd as long as anybody Lamar Jackson deshaun Watson the same class quarterback JP finds himself in they do it equally as well and it makes Mike Weber's job a whole lot easier zone read again again it's Samuel what the football and it took its charity hop for Ohio State J's Dutra knocked it out but the Buckeyes get the recovery dontre Wilson there to help Curtis Samuel Compton up second down and three zone read again again to give to Samuel and he gets to the second level down to sod law inside the 35 and out of bounds at the Indiana 32 yard line 22 more from Curtis ended that's three times now and at some point you're going to see some Allen's crew react in a different way and say make JT hold the ball instead of you playing as the patient gave it in there with the quarterback and letting him dictate you have got to take the running back away and make JP running himself clock under five merit runs the option and he's got room JP pirate down the table inside the fall stepped out right at the five first and goal Bukka we will obscenity play calling an execution you know if I say that up here in the booth you know that's exactly what the reaction will be on the field check through the speed option JP does but I think he still does back out of the pistol straight ahead Samuel a little jump top of the goal line he's in for the touchdown it's just no pain you gotta one of things I really appreciate about urban theme through the years I'm sure they would take another look and make sure the ball bounces the threshold of the goaline air for the three and I'll get stopped a few times you don't waver in the way you're going to a past and eventually Group F aerial coverage provided by Goodyear committed to honoring blimp worthy athletes who demonstrate hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff which very well might be warehoused a ends up and they are off to a terrific start this season undefeated number two in America and a 173 lead over an Indiana team that hasn't really pushed the envelope offensively yet the way that we expected they would have to rock in order to have a chance to win this game what's unique Bob to be about the Buckeye is not only everything they present on the field its to psychology as well Kevin Wilson city are looking at this game saying how can i shorten it right I can look at all the numbers even more the tape and Ohio State is so good in every phase how can I continue to shorten this game try to put the pressure on them but in so doing I think take it away some of your sting and what you do best offensively being aggressive and and utilizing your number one in the conference passing game which has been required for the Hoosiers 26 plays in the first half run offensively by Indiana they've only thrown the ball seven five and out of those seven three or four of those will put sweet huh put in check the bees if the ball out of Legos because you don't want to turn it over they smart not scared well it'll help the field position Devante williams watches the kick from Tyler Durbin booked out of bounds take off that about the ticking team the faulty place at the 35 yard line first down let's go back to that net all right Bob thank you very much coming up on the Alexis halftime before the Red River showdown as Oklahoma survives against Texas also other exciting actually now for Houston as their an option alert against Navy and Tennessee another deficit and they come back the insects pay them for highlights coming up to half up all right a dad thanks very much how many miracles could one team be expected to pull out I'll earn 80 breaks a tackle spins out of the arms at least for the moments of Damon web but he got him around the ankles and brought her down after a gain of 8 and I love the commitment to the run as much as anybody because ultimately that takes some of the burden off the quarterback but you got to play the entirety of your strengths and its strengths of this group to me with Indiana it's still their passing game it is Mitchell page of the quest for if it is Ricky Jones that have been really productive as your top three receiver 18 at the first down Sam Hubbard number six and red made the stop Sam Hubbard by the way as a senior in high school was a terrific defensive player at artificial molar in Cincinnati committed the Simpson at Notre Dame as a lacrosse player and eventually end up coming to Ohio State to play football there's a sue yard gain on the tops again soon 18 second down and eight and again look at the spot recognized with his short and some of the games in the possessions you get the ball to get in the second half because you deferred and if you could just find any level of courts going in fact I think the Kevin Wilson was considered a win again they stay with the run and again it's a dive straight ahead Raekwon McCullen came up in Nick Navy and now it's third down and six this guy is the sole million that I know from Luke sickle yesterday I'd love to ask these coordinators you cringe every time the way I've set it up all but I will down to the heart of Hillary and that's just the hardest hitter he is the heartbeat of ethnic think the group I'm not with the collusion big third down here and I you keep the possession going beforehand my clock at five and I get the snap off a timeout will be called and that time it was Kevin Wilson from the sideline and made sure the timeout was called you turn this game on and it looks like a game that has been dominated if you haven't been paying attention by Ohio State they get a touchdown off the fumble recovery down inside the 10yard line a great field position so often in the first half fearful gear for Indiana but not taking advantage of it and you don't most feel like just get this game to the second half but as long as you stay within striking distance like they showed last week against Michigan State played their best football when it mattered the most but eventually you got to start going it I know it is wending I know you've got a youngster even though he's a redshirt junior he's making its first start in a place like this you want to take some of the stress and pressure off of him but ultimately if you're going to win this game and not just stay close and Kevin Wilson wants to win I go into these things to stay close ultimately there's got to be more passing game coming Richard Legos began his career at UConn but then there was a coaching change there when Randy Edsall left so he decided to give Oklahoma State a try walk down there and redshirt it but realized his future was not with the Cowboys so he decided if he was going to be able to play quarterback at this level he had to go the Junior College route so we ended up at Cisco Community College in Texas and put up great numbers and on espn.com last year was the number one pocket passing prospect in all of junior college Evan Wilson landed it now how much faith will keep put the rest of today could have gone out third down and six but guys bring a bliss a little slipstream works to perfection Ricky Jones is loose a perfect play call behind the pass rush and in the first down inside the red zone for Indiana and look at the quickly strike in here one get right back to the line of scrimmage that stay in front and every third down that time the glitz perk a call leggo a bullet underthrown Mitchell Paige tried to scoop it up incomplete why you don't pay enough this is why you continue to have patient is why you continue to try to run the ball short and the pain that the frake here a play there and especially if you get seven going in home right now in getting the ball that imbalance in the run half game just wouldn't turn over in the first half and even that I thought it was called the wrong way losers wanted to do thank you look like if I'm saying Williams empties the backfield Lego let's run over the middle at the goal line it's Mitchell Paige patties in that's a Hoosier touchdown what a swing of momentum as Indiana gets it done with the passing game and once again the advantage would be in sixfoot Dixon seeing the entirety of the field and even my little five six receiver I'm like the pitcher throwing downhill Michels has a wonderful job and don't coverage of getting inside a Damon Webb converted corner very good coverage safety lose aside a page it hits it and catch it better than that huge points a minute to go before how 17 to 10 as Lopes at the extra point of seventh place 65 yard touchdown drive and Mitchell Paige the former walkon a fifth year senior is able to score starts with the projection just give the big man a little bit of space and you give that to Richard he's got an immense arm town Kevin telling us even more than eight set bill dropped in the sixth round last year by the Redskins they really feel like if Lego grows in this system we continue to play with even more confidence you'll see that emerge even more and pages the guy the Eastwood scratch golfer he's the former walkon he's the guy to Kevin Wilson and the staff love and wanted to get into situations just like that for Kevin Wilson was a walkon offensive lineman at North Carolina when he played back in the day and so in his six years in Indiana he has awarded 48 scholarships to walkons and some of his best players have become walkons cap Griffin Oaks beat Big Ten kicker of the year last year a former walkon it's a page a former walkon Richard Lego was a walkon as he wants book home state so he came on scholarship to Indiana but he even has walkon status and his history on 63 vital seconds though begins a Hoosiers you can't just breathe and think of halftime as Ohio State is going to try to their best to step on the accelerator but guys with only one timeout left returnable kick from the three Harris Campbell Francis backer down the block all the way to stick your glove Rashard back they put us out if what elite teams do Bob okay Hugh puts us in the face let's the buter 2/3 down rusev lit and even a touchdown pass but we are relentless in our competition they go toe to toe at every single practice in every phase it's asking for the culture that that guy has created here and I think you could almost sense Indiana feeling awfully good about themselves come let's do seven and you just know that the clean editor in Ohio State was going to respond Andrew sharp fat ends up injured after he saved the touchdown if it's desperation tackle on periscope seem to kind of jam that light leg as he went down bringing Campbell to surgery and that's a very important injury for Indiana you're talking about a quarterback that probably is the fact that they've got in the secondary last season 22 passes defense number one in the big 10 so far this season number one of the big 10 averaging two passes defensed per game so for IU he used to walk this off and for IU here defensively is much of a surge of emotion as you had with what your offensive group did you've got to try to find it here defensively and you have to be thinking three points we take another look I might have been the injury right there as rashard fat may have been stepped on and was their expense reserved defensive back the came back for Ohio State so first and goal at the 6 watch the corners tackle now you've got a corner out the previous touchdown in the red dome receiver do an excellent job of blocking down on the safety putting those corners in space Apple update spreading in fetal beer trying to get there one on one nickel group on the field for Indiana direct snap to Curtis Samuel and once again the Indiana defense didn't fall for the eye candy they bring him down at the five Toni fields night through to make the stop second down and goal at the bottom he Barrett tried to do it himself he's infertile wonderful job by the big boy the allamerican candidate your center pet helpline getting to the second level getting hat on a hat it was almost visit in the end it was surprise right there running into the short side of the field that's a heartbreaker if you're Indiana you played it close to the best we played it to get it to halftime 63 seconds for being the champion shows you why they are who they are why over Myers 54 and 4 in his career here because don't back down a little adversity hits all that makes you do is respond that much better exactly what the Buckeyes do all set up the Paris Campbell kickoff return down to the 6 yard line this college football season you can stream every game live on the ESPN app and on watch ESPN download the app or visit watch espn.com today on a football Saturday I want a college basketball beat nice boy there is nothing better than the ESPN app and the watch ESPN abilities as well nothing better than that guy they were saving the best in the business thirtytwo and one in Big Ten play fifty four and four you just start your preparation and start studying what Urban does in the every phase you feel it in the building as we did yesterday everyone is on the same page in a way that's unique in college football negative in Saban and everybody else chasing he's taken by Devante William how is it that you are able with a flag down on the far side of the field if your nick saban Urban Meyer to get 18 19 20 year old kids to be so mentally tough that you're right when they take that gut punch they always seem to have a response watching practice outside thinking team number 12 fiveyard penalty will be enforced at the end of the play first down Allen Iverson may disagree with me but that's where it's all cultivated and built he wants to practice Thursday they go manoamano to a Pete Carroll did and his dynasty at USC it's an urban wants to learn and has learned from the Nick Saban's and the Pete Carroll's in the best in the distance too many come here to watch it because everybody loves to talk it that's on the business plan of most college football programs we're going to completion we're going to work hard we're going to have to go out and execute it with the top talent in America and get him to buy into that competition that's the secret sauce risky will Indiana get with their play calling here at their own 30 yard line with 30 seconds and the timeout would you be aggressive here or would you think the ball to start the third quarter and say we'll try our best in the second half it's a run to the vine reading these houses in 39 yard line and getting the ball in the second half and the way that they have played this game you may play pass shot here this is 15 seconds remaining I would certainly take one to the field up top one on one instead it's reading and that will most likely take us to halftime he's right at the first down line to gain so let's stop the clock with four seconds to go in the half but if Indiana doesn't use their timeouts we'll end the first half so in the end it's a two touchdown lead at the break for Ohio State that was a lot of momentum swings in the last minute and a half of a football game we'll see what Indiana can do with the football when they start in the third quarter said back to the Lexus halftime report to the studio you presented by Exxon and Mobil you're watching the big ten on ESPN as we are set for the start of the third quarter a two touchdown lead for the Buckeyes over Indiana the more of a struggle maybe then that scoreboard would lead you to believe for Ohio State Bobbo shoes and rock Ewart allison williams here at the Horseshoe all right your take on Indiana their performance the first half and what has to happen in the second half of the Hoosiers if they want to pull off a comeback well that's a lot a part of your game plan you love you out possess the Buckeyes difficult to do you got them off the field on third down played good team defense but unfortunately unlike the champion Ohio State has been they capitalized on your mistakes and you just can't have it if you're Indiana and coming out the gate here it's going to be huge in the second half feel really the two key plays that Ohio State took advantage of what ended up being the sack bumble I thought you thought should have been ruled incomplete snap it wasn't and bolt to go Ohio State pays off those takeaways which they've done all season long and then just when Indiana scores and breaks through and makes it a 7 point game with 63 seconds to go you have another weapon and this woman Harris Campbell kick returners to set up the short touchdown run I think what it was thought was really a picture of what elite teams do well they capitalized when the moment calls for it and what teams that haven't been there before construct with struggle with that situation will perform and the point you made as well the moment that it feels like an underdog has made a big play against a calm cool and composed championship team that calm composed team they just have faith that one of their guys going to come back and make a play and what a statement to the culture here because even though they're even experienced a lot of new starters they know how it's been done here Devante Williams with a flag down grinds out a return to the 21 yard line holding receiving team number 29 yard penalty first down India looking at the long field to start off the third quarter Allison well other than a couple mistakes it's been a pretty even ball game that's how Kevin Wilson feels as I talk to him coming out at the half happy with how his defense performed pointing out that you know Ohio State had a couple of short touchdown drive offensively I asked them about the passing game a very run oriented in that first half they only threw it 10 times he just feels like that's the smartest option for his team and he said look it's a two possession ballgame we're in it like last week we're just trying to make sure we're in it into the fourth quarter well they're down by two scores Brock 25 Rush plays only ten pass attempts in the first half how surprised are you at that slam they're about 60% run on the season so they want to be run first to set up the pass but you play to get it to the second half and now you got to perform and they keep it on the ground to start the second half devine reading blasts up the middle for five and what's critical here and we made the point in the first half Bob is your first down run I love a run first mentality I think it's the best thing for the entirety of your team but you've got to have a little success that didn't set up the rest of your offense and take advantage of that commitment to the run reading again wrapped up by draymond two yards shy of the first down so on this you would think Oldham Courtney first drive of the third quarter for Indiana it is third down and two they've got the first down and more hard run right up the middle by divine reading a gain of 12 and I was Nicklin John by bringing tonight the right tackle there I love that look bring your tight end over Danny French 270pound guy and you commit to running right behind those two big men playaction come back round to the sideline boy you can't play it on Ricky Jones any better than Marshawn Lattimore unless you got a little too aggressive as the flag comes out pets interference defense number two all these places is falling the fumble Matt of course the referee told me on the field before the game he is going to let a little he in contact go and see the initial cushion job but it's hugging that arm down anytime you have heat the receiver and that time I think Marchand grabbing that arm impeded Ricky's opportunity to come back and catch the pass that's going to draw the penalty it's just great to see Marshawn Lattimore after two years of hamstring injuries back on a football field finally a starter and a terrific Buckeye secondary the middle goes natey and basically a bowling ball moving the pile for for a little line Jerome Bettis at the end of his career and I don't know what that means we're a team at first it was the 36 that is some serious dirty fly action they go long throw to the sideline and that is a great job by Nick Westbrook he became the quarterback he broke up what could have easily been a Gary on Conley interception he one of the things Ohio State did they mix their man in zone very well that time at zone coverage and you can see because Gary these eyes to the quarterback leggo this time the stock wrap works and that's the first down to Ricky Jones that pulled down by Latimore and I get it and I love the mentality Ohio State doesn't do a lot defensively I told you earlier that basically plays two coverages they play mantoman or what they call quarters and sometimes allow those quarters to still play me and principals or they back out as Gary undid and it's all about the face next when those face masks are looking at those wide receivers pretty good indicators man wide receivers screen to Mitchell page breaking tackle and dives inside the 45 down to about the buck on 43 yardline they have six and this is the balance you want I love the commitment to the run get the game of the second half try to shorten it and protect your defense but you can feel it you can feel Ohio State a bit on their heels with this myth natey wrestled downs right at the line of scrimmage Jerome Baker's doing a terrific job filling in for the injured Dante Booker Jerome Baker only played 90 total plays last year as a freshman third down and a big one here long throw down the sideline and the tote at by Nick Westbrook that's a big Indiana first half and this is arm strength this is into the wind and that is a small window of opportunity to zip it into that the league safety Malik hooker three interceptions this year and a kid that can really run I am telling you if you don't appreciate that girl unless you're at field level feeling how small that window was the velocity in the rpms to get it home back to divine reading even if it's secondary he's inside the 10 first and goal for Indiana at the 8th you just feel it look at the presentation to that he painted line look at the hands on the hips could get though in the balance reading again this time he is corralled for a loss of the yard to half jerome baker forced him into several other go high Oh State Buckeye teammates and there is Nick beau so remember was that first down run in a nice play there by goes to the redshirt freshman McQueen but it was a first down run in the red no lifetime it sets you behind schedule an elite defense down here so hard to penetrate it's a more difficult when you get nothing here the first down 12 play at the drive they go on a keeper and now it's third down and goal there's Nick bolsa again are you limiting yourself with these play calls to just one shot at the end zone I just don't I don't understand now I wanted you're playing an opponent that you think you can catch off guard I get it it's opponent in this house holder back run with that big fella nonideal they go up to the backfield a fade to the back corner of busting coverage for Ohio State and Danny brand with an easy touchdown and we've got a one score game again how about that response but Urban Meyer and the Buckeye fan saying no no no we are the ones who are supposed to respond we are the one when the going gets tough we make the play and that is tremendous but I don't like the quarterback run and I didn't you can't do a better than that that's Danny friend that's a 65 270 pounds blocking tight end who's going out to blocking his influence the entirety of that Ohio State defense perfect little pitching cats and water response from the Hoosiers only the fifth catch of the season for Danny friend but his second touchdown and they just do get the extra point up and through to cut the lead to seven four four four on third down on that drive Richard Lego and the Hoosiers before third down conversion good for seven terrific doubleheader here on ESPN because as soon as we're done with number two at Ohio State number one is in action as well number one Alabama number 16 Arkansas bigtime SEC of playoff implications hang in the balance that game comes up next after we are done with Ohio State and Indiana that game also can be seen streaming live on the ESPN app and watch ESPN 13 play 89 yards Kevin Wilson talking to his signal caller right there eight run success in the early down run game gave them an opportunity to convert for third downs including this huge one in the red zone for six safe to say that the Indiana Dean's through the decades that have been beaten up by these guys don't put a drive together like that coming out of the second half responding to adversity momentum that had turned going in the other way with Ohio State scoring before halftime through recent history those suggest that the matchup between these two teams would be closer than expected went down to the last play last year Maris mamble changed the game the big kickoff return to end the first half he fried pork turned the corner here he's got another big kickoff return but a flag down out to the 43 yard line if it stands holding occluded game number 38 in your penalty first down I brought back to the touchdown and how Indiana set up the Buckeye visa excellent play callers lair their calls you remember earlier in the game you hit a tunnel screen right up the middle and watch what Kevin Wilson does he is thinking and he is biting on that safety Malik hooker say not this time you're not going to get me on the tunnel screen in the 270 pound locking tight in phase four look at that beautiful execution and effort and you could see the state's coming down he said nope take advantage take advantage of the competitive spirit of times of those defenders in do so by layering particular plays well executed by the Hoosiers crying left this Samuel check that he was a lead blocker for JP Barrett a gain of a yard and a half now this is not the first time that Ohio State has faced some adversity this year they have outscored their opponents 228 to 37 so it seems like every loss for the opposing team against Ohio State this year's been a blowout but they had plenty of crucial moments in that opening game against Oklahoma and answered every challenge against the Sooners Barrett pulls it back and picks up a first half well this is to be the fascinating story line here because sitting down with urban yesterday and you just looked at JT's numbers only 44 rushes on the entire season not a lot of QB run an urban said very specifically its planned and it's a competition gross you're going to see 16 running more just trying to protect that body that investment right there it's 4 of 9 passes in the first half you can see continuing to see QB run 72 yards rushing now for JP xerath oh it's Kurtis Samuels he leave the Buckeyes in allpurpose yards that's imma jump cut for only one what in the world so these are the play call charts on the sideline down on that Buckeye Ivan Drago and a Husker uniform Abbas what are you not a picture any of the feet of the city second down and nine it's the fall to the outside that was Urban's charge to allison going into halftime option run and what I'm betting is that whenever they hold the card up and it's the brach Huard it is not optional and that's my guess I think that's a safe bet either that or they are looking for the biggest misdirection they could possibly come up with because who would ever expect well I will tell you this and one of five on third down is the most shocking turn of events in this game for me and here's one here third down and five Ohio State number one in America and this down addictions coming in and misses where Indiana has kept this game e one possession game interesting formation for the Buckeyes here a couple of stacked receivers an empty backfield Mike Weber at the top of the screen widest out to the right JP Barrett there's some pressure with a pump fake he scrambles for the first down big play made by the junior quarterback on the first half what did he do in those situation notable under the held the ball try to find that next guy to throw to and I'm going to continue to be patient and play it from this from the pocket and protect myself there's no more about you're in a dogfight now with a Big Ten flow that played you to the final minute final play a season ago if there's an opportunity for JT to run he's going take advantage wait ahead hand off in a creek return of Samuel brought down inside the 30 Tony field stayed the touchdown and get to your right guard Billy price your singer Pat FY I'm looking right in the middle look at Billy price just believing people at the mountain of a man your strongest bugeyed and as much as you're trying to get Samuel to the edge get him to the perimeter more than anything if he runs over Tony field you just want to give him a priest in some space and not for nothing that was a really good tackler for these people I mean that is oneonone in the open field against arguably the shifty is the most explosive Buckeye skill position player playaction a swing pass that gets batted down was that a backwards pass no official on the sideline says incomplete Patrick Doherty got the deflection that's awfully close but that's the right call destiny simply found in speaking of Kurtis Samuel I love Urban Meyer yesterday in the waste challenges his talent he said to young Kurtis he said listen Percy Harvin's who your skillset is running Gainesville when Percy got the ball the whole stadium held their breath that's the place he liked seeing they'll get to in this horseshoe ap Barrett quarterback draw a higher state does not have a yard passing since the first quarter I thought we talked a lot about what seems to be a run to pass disparity that surprised us for Indiana Ohio State has run the ball 29 times they've only thrown it 10 times in the game does that surprise you but there's not more balanced for the bump I do whatever it takes now you know whatever you take in I still think JT's greatest talent is his ability to run he's a magician off the play action off of it and if the defense can't stop it like this drive you keep calling little zone read this time JP Barrett is Rob's basically at the line of scrimmage he grave scales have you only trade off and life's about tradeoffs you only trade off as you're exposing him to more and more contact and you've got a youngster redshirt freshman and Joe Perot behind it you don't have three with a Braxton Miller to Cardale Jones and JT and also I think it's some of the plan and making sure you protect the number of yes JT takes right up the middle goes Mike Weber down inside the spin very close to a Buckeye first down it looks like he's a yard shy so it brings up a huge third down and one inside the 10 yard line I noticed you're running right foot right behind your center my guards now they go in temp up and a bobble snap JP Barrett tripped up it looks like you've picked up the first down well there is the composure of a quarterback that is 19 into his career as a start I want a little bit high disrupts the whole play and you're right how many times do you see an experienced guys panic in that moment of proof he goes right where he's at right where the marker is and there's been a commitment to the run game on this Friday first and goal ap Barrett shaking and baking to the end diving for the pylon out of bounds inside the 1 where it will be second down and goal what a response terrific drives on the bucket it is unique in a different run its quarterback drop its options if zone reads that time it is quarterbacks power you are 50 in your PlayBook as you should in a 7 point game past the halfway point of the third quarter leaping over the pile up the gold on it is my clever that's a book I clutch down you're Helmick stickers on this drive go to your Center and right guard JP Barrett the beneficiary this time Mike Webber as well look at the job that PAC helpline and Billie pike your register senior you're right sure Junior your two most powerful men with the point of attack and when push comes to shove you shove them around with those two in the middle one incomplete pass and 12 runs on an 85yard touchdown drive running behind pedals line and a big offensive line welcome back with a look at our AT&amp;T inside access we take a look at the skull session the LSU marching band skull session starts two hours before kickoff of every home game I would say John arena the skull session to pep rally over 10,000 fans attend the football team joins in as well then the players walk to the field and when they get inside Ohio Stadium who's waiting for them at Urban Meyer with a handshake and a hug for every player as they head to the locker room to get set for their next home game team John arena right there and the walk into one of the great cathedrals of college football hundred and three thousand remember playing here I remember one thing very vividly we got beat up and secondly the grass was so long that I couldn't see my cleat I was in the day and age where they wanted to slow things down not the fast track that he wants urban his elite athletes to play on today how about each of the two offenses with 13 play scoring drives here in the third quarter and that has eaten up over five minutes with each of those two drives Indiana starts the third quarter with a 13 play 89 yard touchdown drive and the Buckeyes respond with a 13 play 85 yards touchdown drive of their own now the heat back on the Hoosier offense Devante Williams from inside the 10 on the tournament corner and brought down at about the 27th week five Monday Night Football our matchup takes us to the NFC South Jameis Winston leads the Bucks against the Panthers in Charlotte 8:15 p.m. on ESPN our coverage begins with Monday night countdown served by Applebee's at 6:00 also streaming live on watch ESPN first couple hurt feed up football teams can new who ruled out today got a concussion you won't see him Monday night both of these offenses hurting and punishing the defenses I would get I'm going to see a very different response from its Ohio State design challenge on the sidelines if he line coach Larry Johnson Saul start false start often for a 54yard fairly creepy first half the things that you typically find with elite defenses in Ohio State this season coming in this game number one America less than ten points a game they line up and show you you have seen on almost every snap that same defensive front other than third down and it requires that D line play with a ton of energy and do their job up front divine reading God's Inc tacklers picks up a couple let's check in with Allison the C gap has to be closed first yourself in there and make them go outside that is what Larry Johnson told those defensive linemen and remember guys they like to place several guys up front so they have to be sprinting on and off the field well that time they couldn't get pressure on Lego but his bro wide of Ricky Jones with Gary on Conley they're in coverage so now third down at 13 and that initial penalty why were you so good on the previous 13 play drive he stayed on schedule you had early down succession aborted at all cost the situation Buckeyes bring up lip babe stop to the sideline oh there was the fade the brick Jones didn't stop and the ball sailed out of bounds about five yards behind him so Indiana three and out after the Buckeye touchdown drop that's what elite quarters do to you they get you getting outside and Legos right conversation there I think this Kevin Wilson as well trying to throw that back shoulder fade and that's what Ohio State wants you to do that is a low percentage throw on third and 13 which one is outside to win it more times enough Joseph Gedeon straight ahead kick this wobbly spiral returnable for dontre Wilson well covered by Indiana with late flag thrown during the return illegal block in the back receiving team number three 10yard penalty first down timeout I'm callin X field position but it's a two touchdown lead for Ohio State here at home aerial coverage and what a scene it is provided by Goodyear committed to honoring blood worthy athletes who demonstrate hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff and speaking of Goodyear about a look at this week's college football rankings brought to you by Goodyear Alabama or they follow our game against Arkansas brach always has a game it catches his eye and that's certainly a noteworthy one Houston trailing by a score against Navy in the triple option is Kirk Herbstreit said this morning can Washington to handle prosperity if police had not been in in decades and going to a venue the team they haven't beaten in a dozen years stepping back to throw JT Barrett looking for the deep ball and he's got a man overthrowing James Clark that's a touchdown a James Clark and catch up to that throw from JP Barrett and uh listen talked about the wind's really swirling here in the first half you saw JT when the grossly under throw a shot as well it would have been a touchdown and that one the ball just hot and you got an open receiver like that what you really love to do is put air on it and give him the opportunity to go get it instead of trying to be that precise only has 11 passing attempts of the game he is 1 for 7 for no yards and starting on 3 / 4 for 41 it will be third down along may a twoyard gain on second down midway through the first quarter the last time the Buckeyes Pat four positive yards and there's been some opportunities like that flight like to play with second quarter shot down the field and it's an area that JT has grown we've been sharp 14 touchdown passes 6 feet coming into today but that passing games is 41 yards 4 of 11 uncommon numbers which Virginia empty backfield on third a day Hoosiers bring a blitz JP Barrett as he lets go of the football he grave scales delayed his blitz just enough to find a lane to JT Barrett he sure did and that was a zone blitz dropping a defensive lineman right underneath the shallow cross so again a wellconceived defense from Tom Allen and perfectly executed from T great skills and his group defensively getting a high o state off the field on third down why this is a to touch going to be that play is pointed all officials not in position replay fourth down replay fourth down the officials couldn't get set to the quick snap from Ohio City huge opportunity for Mitchell page to do what Ohio State has done on the other side and this really flipped the field position with a punt return Cameron Johnston came into today number two in FBS averaging 50 point six yards per kick in to punt return touchdowns last year from the shifty page Iowa State's the number one of the pick ten and net punting three years in a row so that speaks to the attention to detail Urban Meyer they're always great on special teams as well rugby style kick and a good one Paige calls for a fair catch all the way back at the 17 yard line of 52 yard punt back to Edna all right Bob thank you very much well not seen you what's happening was top teams in the country Houston facing a big challenge against Navy this is Dylan Burton here the 2 yard touchdown run with the PHP was blocks and maybe as an eightpoint lead nine and a half left to go we'll have to keep you updated above definitely keep us updated on that one ad man because that would be a major shakeup towards the top of the AP poll if maybe can pull off the upset divine reading lines up behind Lego and epistle and that's the gap that Allison responded to that Larry Johnson charged his guys is right here accountability to upset a as you be physical they go playaction up the scene unable to connect with Ricky Jones I've shot a lot more in coverage and that's when you got to find a way to hit I know it is windy we probably not commented on that nearly enough some of the challenges in the passing game and the commitment that both teams the maids are running in second down at San Diego to throw again for the pump fake lobs one out of bounds at least well over the head of Ricky Jones now it is third down and ten nice finish there from Robert Landers getting home that's exactly what this defense is predicated on that front for squeezing the roam 15 the passer and they also feed by Kevin Wilson think committed to those early down run to early bounces who got yourself way up Lego has missed on his lap for offense my clock underpin but God's rush for and tried to split screen and it is read to perfection Sam Hubbard sags off the lot and blows up Ricky Jones after 2:13 play drives by the two respective offenses to start off the third quarter that is the third straight three and out and this is that tunnel screen that they ran successfully the first time the second time it's sort of touchdown pass off of it so Kevin Wilson trying to come back a third time and the guys respond don't bring the pressure they anticipate they win that chess match pretty critical three and out gideon gets away pretty good kick forcing a fair catch 40yard line dontre Wilson tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. NFL insider Sunday edition brings you all these early injury news fantasy updates and breaking stories and then at 11:00 the new Sunday a foul cap down crew takes it right up to kickoff great way to start your NFL Sunday both shows also streaming live on the ESPN app and watch ESPN got to be a few completions here doesn't there you've been committed to running it if you're still going to run it but Noah brown or Samuel somebody find an easy completion find your own little screen no completions and halfway through the first quarter and the way to get your quarterback comfortable and unlike oh hi Oh state the place so much press look at the South coverage outside dragging a tackler for about five yards his Kurtis Samuel Samuel is going to have to check out wheel off the shoe egrave scales with the stock and after shortening the game talking about how Indiana has done a great job time of possession wise they only have the ball 20 teetotal seconds on that three and out not the danger of pass pass pass like Weber he is stuck after a gain of a half yard again it's Pete gray scales man again Indiana has forced the third down tigré just seen it reading them on the trigger when linebackers against that don't refined success typically feeding the block and that time DeMarco Jones the rights Apple trying to come down and get a cutoff block if we can get his hands on them but the anticipation there of scales the study to know that I can beat you to the spot and execute and finish with the Buckeyes yet again in another third down situation as they have Prince the starting right tackle had to come off the field huge for Marcus Botha tight end emotion JP Barrett short of the first down by about a yard and a half Marcus Oliver he gets to stop at the 49 yard line and that takes us to the end of the third quarter so the Buckeyes take a twotouchdown lead through the fourth quarter but Indiana won't go away the final 15 minutes coming up from the horseshoe set for the start of the fourth quarter Babu Susan alongside Robert Allison Williams down on the field here in Columbus fourth and one for the Buckeyes right at midfield to start the fourth quarter and they will send out Cameron Johnston but kick it away to Indiana as IU Rock just got another third down stop amazing and you better play it safe here defensively and they've got there safe defense in the game Mitchell Paige let the town behind him and it looks like that may have broken the plane of the goal line we'll have to see are they going to say that it was down to the field of play no it is a touch back all that ball has to do is bring the plane of the end zone in college football for it to be a touchback and that is the signal from the official that's the nobrainer they're right on the spot I think part of the reason you punt it there is that they're down you had everything you wanted in your run gate you have you're running some power here with your quarterback and take a look at a couple guys take a look at Marcus Baum you're tied in he's in between here he has a chance to just ear hole as well as my freshman guard leading the way and neither of them block anybody I mean that's part of the situation you get everything you want everything you want right here is it designed and Marcus Bowa just let the smirk that's all over cross his face if the quarterback enforced the pun so the junior college transfer Richard Lego lines up at his own 20yard line down by two touchdowns to start the fourth I'll earn 80 stood up behind a lot and driven back by PI Quan Lewis one of only three returning starters on this Buckeye defense and a captain and he is he is the complete package honorable mention all big ten last year the monster he's a captain three tackles for loss in this game last year and has another one today leggo swing pass Devante williams cross down at the 21 yard line again it to great closing speed by Joe Berger a former walkon put on scholarship over the summer a senior former walkon getting fourth floor snaps go ahead stations come into the game here in the four things at play with your hair on fire tremendous energy and effort the last two series we put out they go on third down in trouble muscles it to the sideline to avoid the sack with Sam hover all over them back at the 6 yard line and it's another Indiana three and out and the number two defense are say the number one defense in America playing includes second ranked Buckeyes looking like it on these last three possessions again I love that look right there Larry Johnson defensive line coach one of the best in the business and they just run a line some he put it on his D line Allanson told us so he really charged those guys on the sidelines to step it up that time Bosa can't run it any better with his lines doesn't allow in his buddy Hubbard to get home backs against the bar oh man how many times the Buckeyes respond wobbly kick gotten away by get Ian fair catch by Wilson at the 39 yard line a 40 yard on the new offenses combining for five straight three announced it was updating you on Colorado and USC the sistema de Montes they're going to break bubble but then develop Lindsay little trickeration here and look at that booth whoohoo it's over the hesitation as he's 14 to 7 right now if the Trojans made a way through the 3rd a big straw right now Navy's last win over to AP top 15 was in 1984 less than two weeks after Ronald Reagan was reelected for a second term as president they're up by 10 against Houston five and a half to go buck Wow we will keep our eyes on that one ad man good game of the pac12 as well Bob with shoes and rock Ewart allison williams 13 and a half minutes to go in the fourth quarter here at the Horseshoe back to Ohio State on the offensive side 14point lead back to JT berry a gain of four so thanks a hard yard and lot of credit here to Indiana they're making Ohio State earn it remember 14 of these points came in first in gold to go situations for this Indiana be fair when our state has had to stretch it from 20 to 20 or drive the length of the deal they've had a very difficult time doing it and did the Buckeyes start to work on the clock 20 seconds on the play clock and they are lined up now to look over see how much time is on that play clock when they're snapping the ball snap it with about 15 that's on safety Barrett swings it right dontre Wilson makes the catch short of the first down it looks like stepped out about a yard shy it'll be third down and one you may come on it and this is an Ohio State crew that's come in and averaged over 50 points a game in their line six contests this season averaging 576 yards a game K which is 280 now with the dozen minutes to play in this play very let's you defense third down and one Flags down a run that's good for a first down to Curtis Samuel if the play stands we have to check the penalty marker and that last play by the way was the first positive path yards for Ohio State since the first quarter this I things in go against Ohio State illegal formation more than four players in the backflow Maxiell offense fiveyard penalty repeat third down now it's third down and six and Brock doesn't it feel now that we've arrived at the point in the game where Indiana has no margin for error even a field goal on this Drive makes it a threepossession game I don't know that there's any way an Indiana offense against this defense a championship defense of their buildings yeah to come back for three scores down but it is also time to just sell out in the lifts and leave yourself in oneonone predicament right I don't think so JP Barrett we'll run it here break the tackle flag down and again he has brought down it looks like shy at the first step hold in coming up against Ohio State Kevin Wilson wants to know where the balls going to be spotted before he makes a decision on taking or declining the penalty it will be fourth down it looks like in about a yard and a half it was a heck of a twopoint takedown by building price away holding offense we're 54 in yard penalty repeat third down McMahon I've highlighted him an awful lot he's right in the middle of your screen and he takes the brunt of the collision here and just won the point directly ten plus yards in football now it's fourth down in a yard and a half if you decline the penalty which you would think would mean Ohio State would be punting the ball they take the yards now it's third down and 14 we're going to get the Buckeyes at least a chance on third down and 14 to pick up the first down again who've not completed the pass since the first quarter and you're also looking at real estate like you're also looking at the win tonight and where can I get my offense the ball back instead of them punting from midfield with JP Barrett lines up in an empty backfield on third down and 14 only a threeman rush that ball kept intercepted picked off a Sean Regan blockers out in front inside the 15yard line the big play that Indiana had to have from their defense to get back in it and now they're in the red zone with a chance to make it a one score game I don't think Kevin Wilson envisioned that by any stretch when he's inclined or took that penalty that's Michael Barr the tide in their big man who's got five catches first touchdown reception last week in the ball a little bit outside his frame you would love to see him make that catch and help his quarterback out in the worst scenario for the Buckeyes and the very best case for these Hoosiers Bob who gets judged not to come into this venue it's been tough it's been a little bit inconsistent here offensively but all the while they played for peace down B phase and J CSA and I know I can put it on the frame there to help you buddy out only the third interception thrown this season by JP Barrett first and ten at the 13th design reading inside the 10 down to the six at the gain of about eight yards the ball may have come out did Jalen Holmes knocked the ball out all the officials are not saying he was down who's got it it looks like an Indiana recovery Devon reading may have gotten his own fumble back and Devine knew it you could sense it is out you could sense it by his reaction immediately look at him he's fighting like mad and some fortuitous bounces have gone the Buckeyes way at times that they're the effort in the energy for Indiana to get in the pile and dig it out how did he get that ball back this may be a reviewable play going on the field was a fumble recovered by the offense that plays that are further review obviously is a reviewable play but whether or not there was clear recovery by Ohio State is something that the replay booth can take a look at because boy they gave the benefit of the doubt to divine reading I think that he recovered his own fumble the Frog it's hard to believe that he was able to reach a hand under this pile of Buckeyes to pull the ball back out what tremendous effort there from Jalen the pursuit of that defensive line to get down to punch it out by no means is you just look at it there can you imagine the divine is going to find a way to dig that ball back out but you need that flu evidence it's clearly out you can hear the horseshoe reaction there is no doubt at the fumble is there a clear and evident recovery here by the puck back from any of the looks that we have given you when that ball simply disappears under this sea of bodies logic certainly seems to state that a Buckeyes at the bottom of the pile but you have to be able to see the football is that a clear enough blood boy it's just so hard to make the determination that that is clear recovery by the Buckeyes without being able to see the football logic an assumption is not part of the instant replay booth correct so the fact that the precedent was set on the field of an Indiana recovery of the fumble would be the determining factor here I'm a little surprised because usually that tugofwar is allowed and it was called a fumble correctly on the field and usually you have in that pile the players fighting like mad especially in this moment with 11 minutes to play to see just who comes out with it Gary OTT Connolly was the player for the Buckeyes after the ruling on a fumble recovered by the offense Gaines is called second down there indisputable evidence if a little Steven football to overturn the call that's made on the field correct what was the worst thing that ever happened to you don't want the bottom when you would put of the you really don't want to know there it was vacant a little picture they've got on the board in the field that was moving myspace end of the dealing with their there are so many people on our crew that want to know so after the fumble recovery second down and two at the five Mike Magette is trying to move the pile close to a first down he is driven back and they will mark him down at the for about a yard shy which brings up arguably to this point the play of the game third down and one inside the 4 yard line is four down territory do not go backward my estate bill had to not allow fourthquarter points this season defensible Rory rushing touchdown playaction Lego floats it incomplete now it's fourth down and I think for the first time I poked a little payment go to the quarterback I may have been the first little moment is Richard Lego and you can see the timeout being called here and wanted by Kevin Wilson was that play unfolded I don't think he was particularly comfortable there was no fool even Ohio State defense and four down territory fourth down inside the five for Indiana when we come back from a quick timeout ESPN college football is presented by Exxon and Mobil we fuel with new synergy gasoline from Exxon and Mobil energy lives here and in part by check into cash it may be a doordie moment for Indiana on the road trying to make it a one score game against Ohio State fourth down and about a half yard at the 4 yard line of the Buckeyes Rock you're so important the Kevin Wilson used one of his timeouts with the clock stopped to make sure they got the perfect play what would be that play if you were calling it from the IU side run it I trust you a 270pound tied in I trust some of the movement I got from my first and second down run game I'm committed to running it here and you've got Tyler Nate team and divine reading flanking leggo reading stopped at the five a championship defense rises up and gets the fourth down stop and it's Nick Volta he was the first there for the Buckeyes Ohio State gets to stop on downs at their own fiveyard line Wow this game of the season for the Ohio State Buckeyes and they still have not allowed a rushing touchdown and have not allowed a fourth quarter point to be scored on their defense and they get a fourth down stop to turn it back over to their offense with a two touchdown lead a lot of time left 80 baron readoption whoever gets up top stepped out of bounds at the 13 yard line Allisyn there was some frustration boiling over after ohio state was intercepted and some disagreements going on between some of the players and the coaches about why that intercept should happen but the calming influence on the sideline with JD barrett he came over to his guys didn't say a whole lot just kind of gave him a look like pull down we got this he's not the most vocal quarterback but he makes his presence felt Marvin Meyer told us that his leadership his management of other players here he is on the quarterback keeper that looks to be good for a first down reminds him of pin pheeba in terms of how he is viewed in the locker room and the leadership that has developed even through the adversity that he put himself through last year and I think this difference is Tim obviously Ward all in the tape and you felt every bit of heat those emotions and JD is quite the other way calm cool collected when he raises his voice everyone listen maybe 1/2 yard gain on first down for Ohio State back to admin thank you very much Bob on an update you know what's happening between BYU and Michigan State this is all Williams here punching this touchdown him so BYU 2047 is Spartans and danger falling down a 2 and 3 also Houston has as a Baptist I should say 46:33 Navy still leaves all right add man thanks very much little swing pass in the left flat to my clever way to cut back about three yards shy of the first down 2plays ago brock indiana or other ohio state snap the ball with 18 on the play clock that last play snap the ball with 15 on the play clock are you surprised that they're still going with this hurried up pace now third down a two they want to get their tempo going and it's a first down because the alternative on the previous couple drivers to not really work so it is that fine balance that you find with these teams these tempo teams in Ohio State's been pretty deliberate and I'll give Indiana tena credit for it and I'll really give their front those big boys right there mr. Docherty 58 we've seen Nate Hoff we've seen Ralph green that is the biggest difference for Union of Hoosier football team in this defense and why they've been much more stout today than anybody else has been against these Buckeyes they are much better collection defensively than Kevin Wilson has had into six years parrot with a nice steak again but pays the price a gain of two tonight after Washington State takes on Stanford SportsCenter at night with Gucci and Anderson they'll have all the highlights from the end of the digital series games college football NBA preseason NFL news injury news obviously big for tomorrow and Monday at UFC update as well so all that after 12:00 at night coming up tonight on ESPN infer without their top two corners again to really come into play with Mike leave some of spread it and throw it play action JT Barrett that ball batted down third down and eight with the clock stopped with 701 to go at the P grayscales that came on the Blitz once again look at the penetration look at that Indiana group not only in their run defense if they set the edge quite a big home and they're not having to bring the house but guys a four for 12 on third down Barrett running out of room Rose it away stops the clock again with 655 to go and will result the punk group coming out we can hear a couple folks in this stadium some of the frustration not particularly boo birds but you're looking to the group that is totally out of rhythm six is 17 on the day 52 yards passing and an interception that's unprecedented stuff in that lack of a consistent run game that lack of the Urban Meyer told us yesterday get the game to the second level get it outside get it on the perimeter and Indiana's done everything defensively to keep it on the inside advantage Hoosiers Indiana coming after the punter Cameron Johnston gets it away not a shortish kick compared to how well he has kicked the ball today only 39 yards Mitchell Paige with the fair catch it is arguably be Ohio State tradition script Ohio and you have never been here to see it at Ohio Stadium and a boy is it an honor if not the I John Glenn Jack Nicklaus back in the day of course the legend Woody Hayes Bob Hope out there to dot the eye and Earle Bruce dot FBI last week script Ohio is about as fun to much as any band routine you will ever see back to the offense for Indiana with 648 to go by food stores richard lego playaction underneath to his tight end danny friend that's the pickup of a thousand five and a half malik hooker who Greg Schiano codefensive coordinator compared to a young Ed Reid came up to make suck nothing doing for Devante Williams now a third down and what you have to think is all four down territory now for Indiana with six fourteen to go quick snap wide receiver hitch by Mitchell page now let's forth death Damon web read that beautifully and came up to make this done you write it to have to with 550 to go you already burn one time out trying to get to the right fourth down goal was about checking your deep bands to get the game the fourthquarter about trying to find a way to win and these situations have been so difficult this is world high o state scheme feed their collection of guys defensively in particular up front have made it miserable last task for the Hoosiers but guys rush for on the plan it is on time of the ball comes out Ricky Jones it looked like a tit before he got thrilled by Raekwon McMillan and now a flag is thrown one thing I think this can be is a targeting call his very late leg it beautifully thrown slant route an even better job a lot more to get his being Indian and rip it away after the play sports my lifetime duck died line interference Ohio State the downtown is first in tan Ohio State all that does is changed field position for Ohio State because the down counts that means that that is a fourth down play that comes up short for Ricky Jones and you can't do it better than Lattimore and I'm glad that they didn't call the targeting it would have been off anyway Rick Quan doing his job come in also in separate but we know we knew this would be about consensus on the perimeter that when push came to shove you couldn't shovel when he had opportunities at fourth and goal and short yardage situations who couldn't force urban guys around and then what urban loves about this group why he said they are where they are it's most pleasant surprise to Kevin Wilson knew it with secondary you're out of practice on Thursday it's one on one it's getting your guys grill and go out there and compete Kevin said we got to win contested situation urban self confident his guys could get it done and Adam Moore did in a big way on that fourth down when I was out of practice watching on Thursday Ohio State did not practice so I mean at all oh they are facemask to facemask bumpandrun they play game some robber games with their safeties but their corners there's not a lot of mystery as to how they are going to play opposing receivers they got ready when the scout team was running the Indiana stuff it was mantoman I'm a Katy Perry looking downfield walk to take a shot incomplete intended for Curtis Samuel who could not get his head turned around and look for the football Mystic fall tonight it is the Sunshine State showdown number 23 Florida State number 10 Miami at 8:00 on a DC with Mark Richt Brad kion mccain's their first real big test of the season against the Noles a game will also be seen streaming live on the ESPN app and watch ESPN out of sorts to the big deep breath right there just the passing game is out of sorts it's out of rhythm the run game has been very difficult to get anything consistently here especially a 41 drive in the second half when past the Mike Webber one handsome but gets not that about and that once again released the time being will stop the flock would 504 to go Chris Covington bumped him out in a rare blitz Indiana has been content to trust their big guys up front not really have to bring numbers for your age defender but guess what Indiana is right on it it's a miraculous completion for one yarder who knew that we would be talking about Indiana's defense today just about as much as we have Ohio State very vaunted number one ranked defense the boozers deserved that time credit in the first time in these last couple of series that Ohio State has even seemingly worked on the clock ap Barrett how about that run for a first down an absolute killer for Indiana giving it up on the ground JP Barrett on third down and nine a gain of 11 somebody's out there on the perimeter as well finally getting some good blocks on the outside and JP Hayes and other nuts enough I gotta sacrifice my body and it's a bit and I'm the extra guy in the Box down I'm the guy that can't be accounted for and I'll run for a hundred yards today it won't be pretty and everybody can talk about our struggles offensively but it's about when he games Aaron again to throw this time it's on time getting loose is dontre Wilson patty finds the endzone for a foot guys upset nice job here they're having some of that time the patient's an even better job of dontre Wilson to run through contact keep that route flat across the middle and then finally a big play from the Buckeyes offense the 18th Eric with his 60th career touchdown pass adding to his ohio state record as we check in again with that man Bob one last check in Baltimore this is Houston taking on Navy final play as the Cougars trying to mount a comeback they're down by six lathering the ball but trust me this is not to be cue the celebration may be his last when they were a Navy pop pimp team once again 1984 versus number two South Carolina look at coach Ken all fired up you gotta appreciate the emotion here tough one for Houston and also bad for Louisville as you say 46 to 40 plows can grab the Navy Bob back over to you what a shame boy what a win you're right at man and what a player JT Barrett is two more touchdowns responsible for today he has one rushing and now has one passing he has accounted for at least one touchdown in all 22 of his career starts and he's now only two behind Braxton Miller for the alltime record most touchdowns responsible for in Buckeye history and he's only a junior so he if he stays for the entirety of his senior season will shatter if he stays healthy so many records but back to what we just heard that results as Navy pulls off the upset now if you're Louisville how much does that hurt your folks in the odds of maybe that having that resumebuilding opportunity that now Houston who is still out there in front of you on your schedule is no longer in the videos but you've just got to control what you think and I think that story here for Ohio State as well as ugly it wasn't fun JT talking to Martha five tidings to frustrated about that interception late you've just got to control what you take and that means routing people I mean you have to blow them out and when you face the juice in beam you hope that they are unblemished from this point on and you go take it to them but I'll tell you I know that there's going to be some concern here in Columbus and I'm sure the folks in the team up north is watching this one and we'll watch the tape and the folks in the South are going to watch this tape and face the high state really the number two ranking I mean if Indiana could do this and frustrate and challenge that office and you know what is a Michigan anomaly what's Wisconsin going to do but I'll tell you each and every week with 1822 yearolds it's about perseverance and fortitude in this group children even when they don't play their best ball like a picture without his best stuff it gets still to be thin swing pass caught by Magette stays inbounds and gets to the 31 yard line a gain of nine of course next Saturday night these Buckeyes go up to Camp Randall to take on the Badgers in primetime so that will be another tough test I think legitimately they're on prints of line it's going to have to play a whole lot better and they've got three instances there and I think they show they've got some work to do in their passing game out on the perimeter there's a jet for a first down I agree with you we I think kind of get caught in the silo of the week that we're working and you see this performance well Indiana really pushed Ohio State five six weeks down the road is the playoff committee is anyone going to remember this being anything other than just a solid home win for Ohio State over unimproved Indiana Tate Lego steps up and that falls intercepted picked off by Malik Booker Joely cooker takes a pop and stays on his face he's got a cowboy he's got the endzone flags down if the Buckeyes defensive touchdown again that's the bit time at the Bucks have scored with a picnic for third so far this year if it stands after the flags were thrown that is now that was a penalty for a chop block during the return so that will wipe away Mele cookers touch that doesn't wipe away the interception and it is not see or knows I don't photon zone that case and when they do they are so away for loose safety so we're you seem to cut them block right there in front the Bourbon say these buddies open the guy around being like I'm expert here playing too late for one another all out to the and before even said earlier about about the committee and what they'll remember wheat renowned throwing the punch this in every computer said this would be mid 40 to 20 around 45 to 20 and may not have felt that way offensively and a lot more discombobulated for urban on that side not being able to really get into tremendous rhythm the 60 Minutes play out this is a 60 women team they find a way to punch it in you get awfully close to what people expected on the scoreboard Mike Weber flopped under by Robert McRae open out the back of was chris covington open analysis hill crock mentioned for ohio state it's about playing for the guy next to and that's what urban meyer calls the power of the unit he says this team has nine units for each position and it's something that he's really emphasized this year he's talked about it in the past but never to this extent in fact this year they rarely have key meetings they have position meetings led by their position coaches and he said by doing that it allows them to vet to develop a closeness and an elite chemistry on this key and you feel that you're in the meetings with the coaches the players whoever goes up the middle it's down inside the 15yard line drop that's palpable isn't it from the coaches that talk about the relationship they've developed when their specific position groups Greg Schiano jumps to Mondamin an NFL head coach now is back in college and he coaches the safeties he's in a position group meeting with those guys they talked about how much fun that is you know what's really difficult and in the entirety of that equation is to find nine quality assistants that can lead each of those position at this point to be buried on third down swings one to Mike Weber brought down at the 11 yard line but that looks to be good enough for a first down look he was brought down right on the line to gain let's do er they're marking as Chris Covington made the stop now they're to mark him down closer to the 12 so it's fourth down in the yard and that will take us down inside of the minutes ago Barrett follows webber up the middle for a first down on force of the one not pretty then Kevin Wilson is going to have plenty to be proud of with his crew especially his defense may hit defense to battle time and time and time again you know there's some work to do physically so with their group up front and some of the growth that he's got to get continued develop it offense hardfought Urban Meyer said it would be his toughest game in his right toughest game physically they have faced this season but they come out the Victory's Urban's done just about every time out at the Buckeye is 55 and four pretty good record in your book twenty and two is a starting quarterback as well lady we're going to win that's terrific win if it turns out for Ohio State so long from Columbus let's head to Fayetteville Alabama and Arkansas
