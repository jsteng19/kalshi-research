============================================================

they are wrapped up and ready for the rivalry circa 2003 to kickoff as with every crowd that's ever gathered for an Alabama Auburn game the fans that have been injured in hair stadium not only have been part of the story unfolding here tonight they're a part of history for more than a century southern skies have watched as the line has grown year by year step by step connecting to schools and the generations with a bond the battles fully engaged and by participating with passion in tradition our lasting memories may we're trying to go after whether you were faded for awards or fame in the future this is the game you will remember this is the game that you will carry forever as a cherished moment of glory or a nagging reminder of what might have been for this is a game played for prime inspired by echoes of bygone battle crimes a game where legends can be born or reaffirmed as it has been for tides and Tigers 67 times before for Alabama and Auburn 2003 this is the game and out of the South tunnel here come the Auburn Tigers and out of the North tunnel the Alabama Crimson Tide welcome to ESPN's robbery which presented by Pontiac celebrating 20 years of college football tonight the Alabama Crimson Tide takes on the Auburn Tigers all season ESPN Saturday night college football will be broadcast in high definition presented by Phillips and best five hi everybody Drake from the log with Mike Gottfried and welcome to the Iron Bowl there are none that are more exciting than this regardless of the records we need to start off by saying this has been a week of distractions here in Auburn because of rumors and innuendo that the head coach Tommy Tuberville might be losing his job after this game tonight as we progress in the ballgame this evening Mike will talk more about that Mike as far as these two teams are concerned they want to do the same thing they both want to run the football yet you think the two guys under center are the most important fellas in this contest tonight Ron they really do I think both these teams are going to come out and try to run the football Williams and Carnell both going to get a chance to run the football but both quarterbacks the team that protects the quarterback the best in the quarterback for whichever team hits the big play has the best chance to win this game it's going to come down to the quarterbacks the two head coaches in this one tonight the gentleman in question Tommy Tuberville good season here in Auburn Alabama and across the way from him brand new member in the SEC Mike Shula in his first season 15 seasons as an NFL assistant coach well Alabama leads the series the away team has won the last four meetings at last year in Tuscaloosa Auburn defeated number nine Alabama by a 10point margin 17 to 7 Alabama want the toss they deferred Auburn will receive and be on offense first this evening tease the ball you look at the colonel Williams one of the deep men along with Aramis should do one of the wide receivers number one and the arid goal for 2003 set to go burn in the short side of the field but I think try to bring it back to the field to the far right side and we'll take a day so it gives us an opportunity to introduce the starters and of course Jason Campbell the junior out of Taylorsville Mississippi a lot of pressure on this young man because everybody's been saying we'll stop your run Jason you've got to beat us passing and that's exactly the game plan tonight he's been criticized heavily here at Auburn but Jason Campbell can play this quarterback position it can't throw the ball very well crowd of over 86,000 jam packed into the stadium great anticipation as always for the Ironborn from annihilation Williams junghwan to attempt the extra point he's got it got free Wow is not even the proper exclamation point to put on this with one a way to open a rivalry like this great call Ron because they ran it draw on first down you watch they go set the draw Alabama really rushes upfield Parnell Williams breaks the outside and you'd think about the embattled coach and the players wanting to get out of this field to play for their folks they made a statement on the first plane Mike let's give credit to a number of people but manrico Crittenden through a key block to heck swinging Carnell Williams and here's here's the really interesting part of the story on him would you look at scoring the season big article in the paper the Birmingham paper yesterday Parnell grew up wanting to go to Bay to play for the Crimson Tide as it turned out he came here to visit his his family really liked Auburn but he had committed to Tennessee he winds up here on the plains and about 86,000 maybe minus a few Alabama fans who are really pleased that he did make that decision Yoast to kick it off what a beginning to our ball game two yards deep books and books will be shut back pounds just across the 20yard line so the starters offensively Brodie coil sophomore on a rainbow City this to me one of the gutsiest performers not just in this conference with in college football partially separated to shoulder in Game one it has continued to happen indeed here we are than in the final regular season game Ron LSU blitzed him and now you're going to see offer and flips him every chance they get it's up to you often the football his final regular season game of the Southeastern Conference of course they play Hawaii next with his shot Williams he says I have an answer takes it out across the 30 that's going to be a gain of about 13 yards in the play here are the starters on offense for Alabama Williams Tim Castillo the fullback Parton the tide in both and try on the sloop the wide receivers up front for the offensive line Justin smiley probably the best athlete up there Dennis Alexander a senior out of Memphis he is 18 cocaptain naked motion and they go back to Williams bounces it to the outside behind blockers Alexander and mathas Carlos Dansby is there to make the tackle gives us an opportunity to give you the defensive starters for Auburn Eddins McNeill Spencer Johnson and Reggie tour board Tolbert could really bring it on the pass rush the linebackers Williams Thomas and Dansby and actually it all starts with dance me he is the number one headhunter and that defense Hobbs a walkon and a Carlos Rogers at the corners herring and rose green are the safeties second down ban up shockwaves nothing to the right he takes it to the left close to the first down up around the 42 and a half yard line dance me and Thomas combined well Dave radar the offensive coordinator is going to try to protect Brodie crow in the passing game by running the football and then once you get the run going then the pass follows I like this plan by Mike Shula and Dave Brady one of the things that Dave Raider told us in our phone conversation with him on Wednesday was that Alabama needed desperately to have something good to happen to them early well it is Auburn who made something good happen for themselves Williams true gets it again nothing to the right size to spin off and Junior Rose green is the dance be is demand with the pressure that really up ended the play junior row screen benefited from Dansby getting in there because all of a sudden it spilled out the dance beat now Alabama's got the punt the football here and then the football game last week round when we watched the Sonny punish from Alabama Auburn Boston a little slow getting the off last week the fob Auburn's not on this play because too close to the 50 yard line can I go after his bunts tonight go free gets the boot away this is a high tailwagger get coverage stick at the Ford is gonna thicken Alabama heart and is going to be touch dead at the oneyard the Lord is demanded that's underneath that 57yard punt as Bo Jackson walks along the sidelines at Miller Weber great tasting beer because you can get in line and take what they give you or you can make your own choice Villa this holiday season no one will work harder or go farther to keep us all connected now mementos has seventy percent more and they come in a box why do I ran from enterprise because having the right car or truck makes all the difference sweetheart your how to do lists just got a little bit longer sorry picking enterprise will pick you up seven to nothing to Auburn on top on the strength of a Carnell Cadillac Williams 80 yard run on the first play from scrimmage now Auburn takes the ball over at the oneandahalf yard line and we'll get to the remainder of the starters and offense we got to talk about candle and Williams and in came the touchdown Williams Pippi so Mike we're still not going to be able to introduce you run a great job by Anthony Brian get the penetration and getting in the backfield to tackle Parnell Williams for the safety now get good field position you'll see he slam it and beat the block to the center I believe Denny Lindsey well no place to go for Carnell give credit to special teams they get the only points right there Brian Bostick with a great punt full Freeland I'm sorry full Freeland when he knocked it dead at the one and a half yard line and then on the very first play Bryant gets the penetration you see the reaction from his tip defensive teammates and all of a sudden that grabs momentum away from the Auburn Tigers as Bama will get the football back and it is now seven to two big punt now you get good field position if your Alabama so they're not going to Punk this one Phillip Yost is going to put it on a tee and and kick it away and Pro throw along with Brandon books of the two feet then we have seen a lot Michael a pro throw in the latter part of the season they really as a goatee guy because he said to Gabriel here's your skip I'm gonna kick this one out of bounds Ron Franklin Mike Godfrey to Adrian Karsten coming to you from a jampacked house here in Auburn Alabama these are the 68th meeting between these two clubs if you know with the penalty here Mike this is going to give them a scrimmage from the 50yard line position might be a good time to take the shot if you're alabama you've ran the ball very successfully three four times now playaction pass ray Hudson comes into the lineup the junior out of Bonifay Florida replacing Shawne Williams at tailback locomotion looking still looking to be tackled behind the line of scrimmage by poor boy and I have a feeling the way he was looking he was looking for a stopandgo and maybe the receiver ran the wrong route yeah Branagh I thought it was a good time for the deep ball you go after him right there Knight I believe you're right I think it was a broken pattern in Brody crowd did the wise thing and didn't throw it throw it look for an interception ray Hudson coming into the ball game I think he was injured on that last play ray Hudson Kenneth Darby has now come into the lineup hundred thirtyfour the redshirt freshman out of Huntsville Butler look at Kenneth they pitch it back to him good pursuit for the offered defense crickets will herring redshirt freshman out of Opelika there's Hudson on the far sideline came in for one play and been suspended for last week's ballgame and only one play in this Iron Bowl game and he is on the bench being checked over by the trailers that Darby's only have 33 carries this entire year in experience shot williams checks back into the line of the tailback third down line to make is the 40 you shall burn with blitz and here they come they pick it up gonna go on top here sideline and just a little too long for Fletcher good job by Alabama's offensive line they picked up the Blitz here's the Blitz Dansby number 11 coming he gets picked up Zac Fletcher the intended receiver Kevin Hobbs running step to step this ran out of room what a huge stop by the Auburn defense after giving up a safety on offense kicked out of bounds and get it at the 50 and they are only able to move one yard and this count is straight up in the air extremely short and now takes a huge offer and bounce the Tigers come out smelling like a rose after what looked like put have been disaster 16

Johnson the fullback Cooper Wallace is the tight end Daniels and McIntyre the wide receivers and up truck the offensive line paramedic Lindsey Vonn Rico Crittenden and Marcus McNeil Williams again tries to bounce it outside his full back from here to China helping those D'Amico Ryan's is right here to make the stop for Alabama and let's beat the starters on defense for the Crimson Tide Anderson and Odom very good at pass rush setting outside Anthony Bryan who's responsible for the safety a moment ago at Jeremy Clark are the defensive tackles the linebackers Roach in the middle Ryan's just sets the bar extremely high each and every week Derrick Pope also a very physical player and in the secondary Charlie pepper up and Anthony Madison at the corners Roman Hart for the quarterback back there in Charles Jones are the safeties third down they need to take it to the 42foot pass over the middle got a complete so often we'll go for two as it is home run tonight here on the plains an 80yard run from scrimmage and now a 64yard hookup between Campbell and Ben Obama no Ronnie Brown checks into the lineup to join the Cadillac Williams both tail backs in the game for the twopoint

off all whoops about the cocoa the to deep man just shy of the 30 on the touchdown pass what you get is oneonone tempura in oppa momma Manu and you watch pepra heat he slides too much this way and therefore runs the tackle and all of a sudden the speed Alabama can't catch him Anthony Madison in pursuit big plays here an 80 yard touchdown run from scrimmage by and lack Williams and into 64yard child whether before Alabama Crimson Tide and the Reese let's check back with you all right line of Kansas State can beat Missouri the Wildcats will go to the big 12 championship game to take on Oklahoma already up 7 nothing on the zoo Darren Sproles goes in for the second time tonight that's a 14 nothing in Manhattan that's going to be a tough team to defeat at home particularly with that on the line they seem to be healthy now yeah all of a sudden you saw them in the open they had everybody healthy offensive weapon in the pocket set the screen the polish tip and up down there's a flag at the line of scrimmage but the ball tipped by DeMarco McNeal where he read the screen pass and he was able to change directions quick on the dime we have an illegal formation guess the obvious offense up they had six players on the line of scrimmage guilty decline show with the third down they still got to take it to the 38 and a half yard line they had a good call DeMarco MacNeil read the screen also danceny was coming with some heavy pressure on Brody coil and exceed what the Crimson Tide comes up with here 15 to 2 sixty drills the pass of his intended receiver prodrome Carlos Rogers the corner pretty good coverage now offers defense does the job third time at Alabama will affect the pump here in this opening quarter row Freeland to kick Trey Smith is the deep man they think coming after this one coming right at the middle at Heat away it's a dandy kick another tailwagger but very long and affair cats called foreignmade at the 23 tomorrow with 8:30 Eastern as he s p.m. something night football Steve Spurrier in the Washington Redskins head to Miami to take on Ricky Williams and the Dolphins that's the Redskins to the Dolphins nationwide HD it all starts with NFL primetime presented by Miller Lite at 7:30 Eastern Ron when they go back over to the sidelines they're going to tell Carlos Dansby if you flatten your hands out who were to block that kick he had him straight up in the air hovering of their own 23 playaction looking to go long going for everything Charlie pepero got turned around looked like a stutter and go by taylor trying to set up the corner we're holding against be fair but filters behind now alabama's back on their heels pepra here's the stutter and go I didn't see holden he definitely got saved out Charlie pepra Mike shoeless talking to him on the sidelines past pattern very nicely run by Courtney Taylor but he's only a redshirt freshman out of Carrollton and it coaches it early on of the year they thought he is really going to be a good winner you can't Jason Kim he sits back in his pocket he has nobody rushing it he sets one side comes back all the way to the other side to Daniel's three men rush by Alabama interesting thing is a woman should do was standing just a few yards from him as if maybe somebody had fun the wrong route over there and they still were wide open enough to make the catch 20 yards on that pass play and here comes Cadillac Williams right side inside the 10 and he's down to the down on the sideline what do you got big guy watching and listening to the emotional level down here tonight Ron is unbelievable I've never heard or seen anything like it very honestly give a lot of credit to the 43 seniors 30 guys wearing crimson across the field 13 over here on the Auburn side who have never and before you think about what Alabama has been through four coaches in four years three in the last 12 months what the seniors are doing on the sidelines on the field right now really represents the memories that want to make the private plan for this game every year is even more history and it's it's the one that is the most important is Williams takes to the cross you can see inside if they score here the pleadings going to get worse because all of a sudden go back to last week when LSU got ahead they just ported to Alabama and they went after crawled the quarterback so this is a very important stop right here joke I'm looking down at his defensive play sheet Jeremy Clark has starter at Wright defensive tackle as the man who was down and the trainer's are out there with him begging pardon 95 Childress rather than Clark big Ahmad Childress 65 358 pounds of junior out of Nashville this Auburn football team has come out here to make a statement in this first quarter everybody wondered with all the conversations about the possibility of the coaching change and all if the kids would be distracted well they were the first two days of this week but tonight Mike is right on they have come out firing on every cylinder Cadillac Williams right up the middle going to be stopped after a gain of about 1 Jeremy Clark who's the man who's there to make the tackle on him five and a half minutes to play opening quarter it started off with fireworks opening play from scrimmage Cadillac Williams goes 80 yards for the touchdown then they throw to been home Amato who breaks the tackle as defenders ran together for Alabama he takes it 64 yards twopoint conversion was good and of course there was a safety that Anthony Bryant far as prevents the only scoring for Alabama so far for the back draw or does she take the punishing hit at the 5yard line Freddie Roach is the man who got to him first campus showing his size tonight a decent runner on the quarterback position Freddie Roach makes the play but this is a very big down for this Alabama defense if they don't stop him here hold him to a field goal wah this thing could get away from him get ugly Antoine Oldham jr. five 277 the preg defense against position he knows what has to happen here sets in the pocket looking still looking and throws this room into the ground actually it was very close to Kourtney and Taylor but I believe Derek Hope got a hand on that pass yeah he had a chance for that pass in Ron when people were watching a little bit ago and you wonder why Auburn would go for the two now if they get two field goal they're up by two scores at two point two two point every coach got that chart and that's what it says John Vaughn to attempt the extra point this will be about 22 yards from the left hash mark you see his numbers four of eight his longest 34 sit home and we'll take a break 4:07 left in this opening quarter in our new score Auburn 18 to 2 disciplined investing an tiro price it's not

race our situation a team to t offer just under four minutes to play in the as way Hudson the 427 comes back in at tailback Koya short truck no place to run and it's going to go down after a gain of about two and a half ed news is there defensively to put a stop on him you talked about the injuries in Alabama's offensive line have played together that much the tight end positions been wiped out you just they're searching for things that do on offense with the talent that they have right now now well Duncan it up last week we talked about Wesley grit breaking a leg that was Harry who could see him Thomas comes up Hutson weather and just devours me saw a football team last week a defensive football team of Alabama that played as well as they could play for three quarters wait for their offense to do something same position tonight both the three and third down conversions take it out just across the 41yard line coil quick past middle screen and it's Potro puts a head down and the little water bug is going to have the first down the Marco McNeal will finally make the stop on him and Myka question to you all of a sudden proto has evolved as the goto guy we didn't see him in the first part of the season it takes a while young guy you're waiting for him to come you think about maybe holding me mouth and all of a sudden you're not getting production out of your wide receivers and until you got a call on the guy that hasn't played much that's his 12 kids of the year got his first touch a couple of weeks ago touchdown catch against Mississippi State Sheldon Williams comes back in a tailback they pitch it to him here's the reversion is Potro again tries to turn the corner you're right they're trying to get the ball to playmaker what that tells you is right they don't have a lot of playmakers they're trying to find somebody to make a big play Dansby just sat there and waited for him there's Dansby he sees the reverse he breaks down takes on both blocks sits and waits for proto to come doesn't news contain so what bird Ollis South Williams at the top of the eye here gets the handoff big opening and he's going to take it through close to around midfield it'll be third down at about three Crimson Tide Travis Williams defensively you know one thing Ron that's a very good running back shot waves 244 carries coming into tonight 12 touchdowns very good pass receivers got nineteen perceptions he can go the distance well they've taken him out of the game of the third down situation and Ray Hudson checks back in this open crowd on their feet cheering on the defense becomes a blitz solutely timed it perfectly again Alabama's offensive line not picking up the outside linebacker Travis Weaver it's going to come right around the corner right inside the tackle ten seconds left in his opening quarter this is about to be the fourth punt of the opener for them I don't think we're gonna get it off though so when we come back to open the second 18 to 2

track being brought to you by pioneer didn't take very long Cadillac got it rolling first play from scrimmage 80 yards for a touchdown Alabama simply could not catchy and here's a safety on the very next offensive play Anthony Brian is the man who came through to make the tackle and in Havana litter this he bangs in two defenders rub together 64 yards later the big play had occurred they went 42 and made it and that's how we stand at 18 to 2 Ronnie Brown and a tailback the ball thrown to goober Wallace the tight end may have been her TV just as he threw my he got his strange plane he was hung

and here's the stem and off to the tailback Peterson try the right side so we're back injury to sedation Campbell he's three of five 123 yards and one touchdown and as you look in the HD monitor as you tried to throw slam down and he is back out on the field so a very good timeout if your almond a very good time Ronnie Brown continues to operate at tailback of the serious gamble with the Navajo turns and gives it to proud big opening gonna happen you've never touched the ground that's very much akin to that play with who was at Ole Miss and they came down on the defender rather than hitting the turf and continued to run a gain of 21 yards Ronnie Brown was kind of thinking about whether he was down or not instead of taking off very reaches his hand down here and he thinks some still be able to go it's back to brown dance step didn't work that time Mike let's talk about what we visited our just briefly mentioned off the top of the telecast tonight a lot of rumors at the beginning of this week and they have continued throughout the way the disband right here is destined to lose his job after this game tonight do you agree with that does it is this game tonight does he have to win it to keep his job or what's the situation I think he asked to win this game to keep his job because the way this thing is transpired it's a travesty the way it's been handled by the University of Auburn administration has been played to Daniel's to the 40yard line well when the rumors come out I know you can't answer every rumor but this is a rumor by the guy making a lot of money millions of dollars and he got this bands involved he got the players it affected opposes the families and the president didn't step up here he didn't he just let it go and so you hang this guy out to dry right here and you don't give an answer now the president's gonna meet with Tommy Tuberville tomorrow that meeting is set so I believe he's in jeopardy a blue the West or tied for the West three times his graduation rate is 68 percent now that's pretty good and it's getting better but here's the best part Ron if they fire him you know what they gotta pay three million eight hundred thousand dollars that's what they gotta pay him tomorrow if they fire him now I don't know if there's a lot of money around Auburn but if you got that much money can help a lot of charities around there but I think this president and the university administration is failed miserably in this football situation and still another example of why presidents should not have anything to do with athletics and handle academia that's a reason you hire athletic directors that's his job but he's handled it in effects recruiting the coaches told me they had calls from Georgia the state of Alabama guys they got committed that said what's going on here McIntyre in motion to the top of your screen and now Campbell with an audible hear and a half to hurry play clock is down to two Brown tries to bounce it around the corner hit by Derry hope and it's going to bring up second down and long I think these players have responded round they you talk to Tommy Tuberville the other day said it was a distraction first two days he said it's about the players it's not about us but these players have answered the president and the Board of Trustees tonight in the first quarter now if we got a long way to go but they've made a statement they want their coach to stay here well that they have it had happened on the very first play from scrimmage an 80 yard run by a carnale Cadillac Williams here is it's Derrick Hope number 6 the senior out of Galveston Texas came after him strong and made the tackle and they're going to miss this Derrick both because he's been the best linebacker according to joke times he always is a guy that makes place the vocal leader they missed him when he was injured that's his third sack Mark Anderson also moving around to help out mop up the situation third down in the very long way they got about 17 yards to pick up the first over the middle goddess compared to failure that is an absolutely perfectly run pattern because how many times you see receivers cut it up short because of pressure and he makes the catch and they move the chain you're exactly right this is a very good pattern against in theme Madison you see how Madison got turned that's because the robbed by Silas Daniels he set him up got him turn made to catch rowdy bomb continues to operate a tailback Daniels now with three catches for 45 yards and Campbell wants to call the timeout Leah now after such a disappointing season coach Trevor bill knows that his job is possibly on the line tonight but he would like people to remember what he and his coaching staff have done over the last several years here at Auburn men we haven't had a great year but I don't think you can look at one year you have to look at your program we've been here five years we we've won three Western Division titles out of out of five years which is a phenomenal for what we had inherited programs gotten steadily stronger each year and you're not gonna be great every year it's not gonna happen you're going up and down year so I would hope that we would not be judged on one year Tommy Tuberville visiting with us yesterday you know it's Alabama has gone through so much strife in just you know in recent months now this happening here at Auburn you know Mike we all love football and this state right here is absolutely crazy over football but sometimes I think the state of Alabama needs to back off just a little bit and do something other than be rumormongers as far as these kids and these coaches are concerned it just it turns into a distraction almost 12 months a year yeah I I just know this if they fire Tommy Tuberville it's a big mistake now there's a second part to this front Tommy Tuberville is going to go in that meeting tomorrow if they keep him he can't fire coaches because all of a sudden they're saying to him you got to fire the guys that are most loyal to you he's got to hold on to the staff that's the only way you win consistency that's what they're gonna say to him they're gonna say okay if he's not fired right now they're gonna say to him tomorrow I believe he's fired right now now depending on this game if they win this game they may not be able to fire him so they're gonna say to him okay get ready your offensive coordinator get rid of your lying coach and he's got to say no somebody's got to take a stand he's gonna get three million what's the difference oh my what a Mis night play of the drive check it down Ronnie Brown back into the boundary is is a holding call from where that one was tossed and that's gonna be the call Rodgers ready though our referee tonight

Lonnie brown draw play rece Davis look around you Mike talking about coach is supposedly in jeopardy maybe being a bad idea about Tommy Bowden and Clemson Jen Jess but going in for the touchdown I think his kids are making a statement there are 35 to 10 at halftime when their arch rival South Carolina and LSU held off Ole Miss this afternoon Bayou Bengals in the driver's seat at least for the SEC website all righty as you look at the Brandon Johnson limping off the field we'll try to get more of a report on him congratulations to coach safer than the LSU Tigers hard fought win over an

Alabama Christopher Bailey used to be direct to the cheerleading squad at Auburn now you're over here we're in Alabama leather sweater what happened well I cheered up three great years got a lot of

girlfriend here your father and I were grad was shocked so is your mom give me roll tide roll tide War Eagle Jana what are your thoughts in this whole thing Ron roll time okay ap now wonder if we

heart's still where my heart is and it's glad to be back I'm glad to be back complains where's your I cover both sidelines I'm going to the other side come on sik I didn't think so decrypting the intended receiver abran you know that guy did became a marked man at Wrigley Field I think we've been enough with that young man on camera and he worked it he might be in jeopardy going back to the hotel tonight they're all talking about it oh they must not have you know eligibility rules in cheerleading here's the throw by Brooke Brody crawl just out of the outstretched hands of Fulgham and that's the kind of play that Alabama's got a hand half I think they're on this big short drop this time gets it out in the flat nice pitch but not very much yards by ten Bastille attempt Kea Castile with very good hands a tailback in high school 19 receptions from the fullback position there's the comparison right Jason Campbell you talked about the big play he's had 152 yards Brody's got 19 yards I see he had one at 64 he had another one a 39 i believe obama no of course caught the big long 64 yarder with big plays Alabama's going to come up with one here third down Hudson in the backfield with him there's a flag pass his clock he's close to the first down but now let's check the market Alabama jumped around they've moved too fast coming back before the play dead ball foul ball spark talk to my Mike Shula a tough job coming in not having a spring practice I thought the great thing last week when we talked to the Alabama players I said what's the difference they say he might Sheila that's the problem because you hit coach from the shotgun pressure from the outside coil running for his life wanted to pull up and throw it but not going to be able to in tackled by Reggie tour boy the senior out of Baton Rouge at the 35 and it's about 5 yards short Auburn's defense coming up big I think they'll return this punt on they've got two pies back and one is number 24 that like the first time we have seen band game that we've done he joins Trey Smith and here is a driving driving spiral and this is Pat Williams from the 20 turns the corner still looking he's going

move for their stubborn watching stop now he moves bright by Charlie pepra that's the second time they bit charlie pepper bid on that route just goes right to his hands you know they benched him earlier this year because of drops then he became more consistent then he had to drop against Ole Miss tonight he catches a 64 yarder but that was a short pass that he turned into a long run Cadillac in at the line of scrimmage Jason Campbell had been over mono for a 50 yard pass to set a fun game winning and situation and on the next play this is against Ole Miss Indians own and you have seen the play many times before finally tackled right there Campbell Sprint's all the way to the sidelines look who was wide open and he drops we made mention and he hit that made amends in this ball game tonight but he just popped another what would have been a touchdown third down gamble gonna run he got a lot of open space and then it closes up quickly this beaned in the part of an Alabama defense of 11 yards finally Roman Harper came over to make the tackle good safety Romo Harper there's a protection very good protection Jason Campbell sneaks up in there Harper makes the short tackle with Charles Jones invested with the woman last week before that MSU game is the quarterback so to speak of that secondary nice shunt guide at fun to talk with look at those numbers right there boy miss Alabama defense been on the field a bunch in the Auburn offense totally clipping Cadillac hit behind the line of scrimmage and he's going to be not who was responsible for a safety earlier is the man who got penetration again we had him unofficially for four tackle blind branch just works on backfield makes the play you talked about Roman harp right like when you ask him where did you consider going he said only two schools he wasn't going far from the home it's for Prattville deep over the middle dares to and it is picked up by Alabama's woven Harper he doesn't matter with this talking about the poll comes out and Roman Harper johnnyonthespot following a 39 yard reception Brown had almost looked like he was bitching to them I don't know what happened it spilled out of his hands Tommy Tuberville comes right over to tell him that's good job ball just bounces out he he didn't put it away you always talk to receivers have clutched the ball bring it back into your elbow didn't put a boy was looking to see if it goes knocked out but you're exactly right it just became a hot potato play action here comes pressure from Dan Smith goodness behind the line of scrimmage by Travis Williams I mean whatever they're dialing updating is not working no Ron this is an offense that doesn't have any big playmakers and so you're not going to get big plays dance beat with the rust and all of a sudden you throw the screen pass and they're right there Travis Williams with a good tackle shot Williams you could see him trying to block on dance beat and dance we just threw him away like a minor leaguer second down and 13 he's gonna pick up three of those yards back and reach Davis let's check with you Ryan coming up on the Pontiac high performance halftime report president mark will join me in check it on that SEC showdown in Oxford this afternoon California Dreaming if you're approaching California nightmare if you have to deal with UFC and 112,000 118 in the big house and we'll talk about that USC team the team who my partner predictor or tonight would beat Oklahoma in the Nokia Sugar Bowl and at halftime I'll tell you what impact rivalry games have had on these days a minute 49 seconds until intermission foil another screen they go back into Hudson Hudson heights close to the 45yard line the ball has come loose twentyeight a great a great third effort and Rogers way with the football Carlos Rogers has had a big first half Hudson who was suspended last week didn't play in that football game gives good effort here but coughs up the football you know what his own man knocked the ball out it looked by closer who was coming down to block he does the offensive lineman hitting and knocked the ball loose Alabama showing blitz here they come right up the middle Kendall running for his life and just throws this one away well tonight's Aflac trivia question what player has the most touchdowns in the Auburn Alabama series answer coming up a little bit later on this guy down on the sidelines tonight both with attendance for the ballgame and every place that he has been this weekend it is caused quite a stir even among alabama faithful who stood in line to get his autograph yesterday dings this one out to Daniel's and Daniel's going to be slung down at the 34 yard line just wonder how long this defense can hang in there they've been put on the spot every week Joe Kimes his defense is bending a little bit right now they need to shut this down right here to have any chance in this football game till their offense finds themselves this Alabama defense has been on the here but 31 plays 50 seconds into innovation becomes pressure begin barely gets it away it is that is a spectacular effort by Courtney Taylor the redshirt freshman good for 10 yards in a first down Rickon on Madison he's in the suits me round just going to say Jeremy Clark was really applying some pressure but he got it away well how can you criticize a quarterback when he stands in there like that here Madison makes the hit on the bigger receiver Courtney Villere often has one timeout left and it looks like Johnson Brandon's gonna hit to the locker over early taylor by the way tweet that's whose 54 yards on the answer to tonight's Aflac trivia question what player has the most touchdowns in the Auburn Alabama series Sean Alexander from Alabama seven touchdowns six rushing and one receiving a pretty good running back that's a break in right Mike I bet a bunch of these guys that played at Auburn and played at Alabama regardless of the records that these guys have been the pros now they're watching this football game tonight Mike Shula talking with the official on the far sideline and what he's discussing I'm sure is that extra effort by by his running back but it cost him and his own linemen knocked the ball out of his hand and caused a turnover yeah at halftime they've got to find something to hang their hat on offensively but in fairness today braider Mike Shula they're gunning with but not enough weapons because their offensive line is patched up they don't don't have any big play guys Auburn's made the big plays they happened and Brody Crayola has had so much pressure on him this evening even if they had wanted to throw deep and they did have an opportunity and it was just barely overthrown but the protection also is paramount in the second half 44 seconds showing on the clock in the second quarter allout blitz and described Jeremy Carnell williams was the intended receiver alabama had the right call on right here take that screen as well as she can play him yep he did and he saw what was about to happen because she be doesn't tackle him he's gonna go for a touchdown holding against the defense the penalty is 10 yards in the previous pot we are well it's the only call that something made because you get fall passive apparently behind the line of scrimmage here's the pressure on Campbell and of course it happened right in front of your bird bit so there were a lot of helpers there calling on the if you gotta maintain boys you certainly can't get picked out in the ball game this gesture defensively they're giving it all they got Rogers reading has called the Campbell along the Charles Jones together a discussion about sportsmanship right now trying to calm everybody down 38 seconds left see if they go to court see Alabama coming up to play bump blitz coming off the corner that single coverage in the endzone volley tips away either a touchdown or certain threepoint Rondine had Tommy Tuberville thinking himself right there Courtney Taylor beats Madison but give Madison credit now he went back into the receiver Roman Harper with a great play let's see the ball comes off his foot and look how far Harper has to go and he cradles the ball to make sure that it doesn't Alabama football 31 seconds left from their own 20 Hudson on the draw play Hudson's going out of game very close to 10 yards Markovic Neil stop see fresh legs didn't play last week suspend it was doubt whether is going to come back and play this week Mike Shula probably knows the whole situation made the decision let him play shall we got a timeout with 21 seconds left we'll be right back I believe that this is a practical world and then I can count only on what I earned therefore I believe in work hard work I believe in education I believe in honesty and truthfulness I believe in a sound mind in a sound body and a spirit that is not afraid I believe in the human touch I believe in my country and because our men and women believe in these things I believe in Auburn and love it so we're back for a couple maybe three plays Mike I think this is a huge step shot Williams in the first quarter six carries 34 yards almost six yards a try he's got one carry for three rise in the second quarter I agree with you he's been absent steps up peep over the middle got a man the bottle struck boy that is Fletcher that Fletcher let it get into his body Mike Shula right here may just settle to kill this clock right here Zack Fletcher wide open Brody crown with a good just couldn't hold on Brody five of ten forty three yards Grosso of motion he's going to go long but here comes pressure and close this has to throw this one away he did have a man in the vicinity but McNeal was all over it he don't want to make a mistake right here you got a break Alabama did on the interception right you don't want to give it back to Auburn with eight seconds to go here in the Brody Krug did a wise thing threw it in the ground yep for short he threw it at the feet of a potential receiver Roldan Harper has saved their bacon twice you don't want to roll that dice too many times Shawn Williams the chod will get out of bounds three seconds showing on the clock you started with a bad snap now you have fourth down here's the bad snap early crow handles it gets the ball to shot Williams figure in two seconds they're going to not punt just show the clock right here on window everything he's got and this one is a long way down intercepted by armored and then so Rose Doreen it is halftime Adrian Karsten let's check the deal on the sideline well coach you played in this Iron Bowl before how do you like coach McQueen so far oh well you know it's just get off to a bad start we just got to tackle better the first two plays you know they did a nice job but we got to make a tackle the second touchdown same thing we had a guy on underneath throughout didn't make the tackle we're close on a deep ball we just fingertips and then we you know we have a screen pass with a fumble and a drop ball later on so we can't have those things when you play in a game like this that's where we got to keep our poise regroup we got a second half to go and see what happens you know I'm cutting feet from you I can see the frustration on your face I've seen it before last week as a matter of fact can you score yeah we got yeah we're gonna score we got to believe that we can score you know this that's what this game is about is frustration we got to keep our poise and keep believing it go out there and do it don't you appreciate it see in the second 30 Ron okay Adrian our halftime score Auburn 18 to 2 over Alabama now here's rece Davis with the Pontiac high performance halftime report performance halftime report you can see the intensity of the irritation spilling over with Mike Chu and this sort of encompasses what we see in rivalry games what does it mean to you to play in a rivalry game well you always have that burning desire to beat that opponent that rival of yours and when you get together with players in the offseason that are either opponents or fans or former teammates you talk about hey how you doing how are things going but the first thing that comes back to gee remember that game against West Virginia remember that game against Penn State you always want to talk trash against your opponent of your former opponent when you see them again those things burn a deep memory in your mind and you always talk about those games first out of the 40plus games you're playing you always remember those four or five games that are against your rivals my chief rival of course was Oklahoma and I hated Oklahoma with every fiber of my body but I respected him and that was the whole dynamic of the situation I can't explain it we didn't like him but on the field there was no trashtalking respect because they also were very good football no trashtalking the robbery not from Treve so you saved it all up if you didn't see how the LSU Ole Miss game ended assuming I'm healthy enough to tell you I'm showing it a bit men don't like to shave they'd rather light their shorts on fire or eat dirt Daisy fellas Nivea

Mark finds every Henderson 17 7 now Ole Miss gets it back to 1714 this is a 4th and 10 last chance and Doug buckler's bets on Manning's foot because he just got bulldozed by Chad la la LSU 17 to 14 Clemson and South Carolina Charlie Whitehurst and refined Ben Hall and Clemson is running rough shot over the Gamecocks he just scored again next to Fort Benning 4110 done espn2 Georgia Tennessee both come up winners both of those teams now hoping to get a share of the SEC title in fact Georgia has wrapped up no worse than a share of the crown Tennessee must beat Kentucky next week in order to get that game of the day Michigan Ohio State Jason Avadh got hurt pumping up the crowd that John Navarre finds brave and Edward nice job by the office by protecting down the bar and Braylon Edwards goes over the top and comes down with a touchdown research in Michigan up 21 cents story the game though guys Chris Perry the great offensive line nice hole the vision to cut outside the speed to get in the end zone 29 yards for the touchdown and Chris Perry Chris Perry was dominant but Ohio State knew the reigning champs and a lot of heart a lot of pride got back in it at 28 14 stopping when he was in for an injured Craig Krenzel bounce Antonio Holmes who scored a couple of touchdowns on the day right oh gosh scores here and Michigan you can almost sense things tightening up on the Wolverines sideline they've got an answer for that Chris Perry the phenomenal blocking by the offensive line the wide receivers Chris Perry cuts it to the outside he loves the left side he's in again for the school 154 yards you carry 35:21 Michigan you're out like big Pancham USC UCLA Keyshawn still allowed in that uniform Matt Leinart Mike Williams yard are you the trash talker Reggie Bush the freshman can talk if he wants to this SCT not telling this guys are freshmen they're young they're dynamic and they're talented and they blew out UCLA beating the Bruins for the victreebel for the fifth straight time first time UCLA has ever lost five in a row Detroit and it was not as close to the score indicates 47 222 the final there Apple Cup going on right now most successful class in Washington state history they've never beaten the Huskies 14 minutes 54 seconds away they can hang on to that ninepoint lead number one team the land Oklahoma gets BJ Simmons and Texas Tech the Senators got picked off five times today they see broadening fullwidth interception then you're gonna have Brandon average get some interception and Rodney pools gonna get another interception then Gator on Allen gets an interception that was the story for Texas Tech but Jason White had a good day for more touchdown passes he's got 40 touchdown passes over the year always six interceptions I ain't Trophy candidate 5625 Sooners headed to the big 12 championship game undefeated the Kansas State can hang on against Missouri then they will be playing okay state well is a twentieth time in 100 meetings at Ohio State Michigan had decided the Big Ten title and the Wolverines winning it outright for the first time since 1997 using a powerful running game effective in the air when they had to Chris Fowler Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit we're in Ann Arbor to watch the showdown preparation passion play calling execution Michigan gets almost a perfect score card against Ohio State and Chris Perry you got a feel for this guy he's been an up and down in career but he walks out of his final home game out gaining on the ground all previous Ohio State opponent that's not I tell you what I think the key that ballgame was in a start of the second half when Michigan come out and took the football and scored and answered the Ohio State touchdown at the end of the first half that was a tremendous job 28 to 7 and I think that put him ahead to win well it was a good effort by Ohio State to get back into the ball game but Michigan won this game with an attitude the way they came out of the tunnel to start the game along with Terry Malone doing an outstanding job of with a balanced play calling 19 passes in the first half 18 runs in the balance I think slowed down Ohio State's aggressive defense and that allowed Chris Perry to have all that room to run Ohio State typically the reason they're so good at rush defense is a crowd aligned and they attack this time they had to backup because of the play calling by terry Malone this was a scoring fest compared to that airtight defensive struggle down in Ole Miss we do LSU's defense was good they spoiled the Manning fairy tale is Chad level a one of those big ugly's that person shoves the guard into Elon he stumbles on his final blow they had a nice rally almost caught LSU but the best athletes LSU won that football game but after watching LSU tonight the Arkansas game next week is not a gimme for them we've had our concerns Oh an Arkansas is getting better and they're healthier you know another team today that I think with what happened today in Ann Arbor all of a sudden USC in the driver's seat they blow out UCLA two weeks from now Oregon State and USC that's all that separates USC from destiny and a chance against Oklahoma and the national championship we've all been talking about on the field USC deserves a chance and now we're hopefully gonna get a chance to see him against Oklahoma I thought today was a test of focus for both the USC and Oklahoma a lot of stuff going on the Beast both teams certainly handle that with flying colors dirty you're drooling already January 4th that's paper City thanks to you guys we're looking forward to it you know another thing I've noticed today guys that blow outs in rivalry games we're having one in Clemson South Carolina game yeah and if you look at Clemson they were rumored to fire their head coach Tommy Bowden and for the Clemson nation I think that's a huge mistake you've got a coach that runs a clean program they're eight and four this year he's been to bowl games in the past he'll go to another bowl game this year he's defeated your arch rival South Carolina four out of five times and at Lou Holtz at five and seven after today's game South Carolina gave him an extension and you're thinking about firing your coach sit back take another look at Tommy Bowden he's done an outstanding job he not only deserves to stay at Clemson he deserves an extension at Clemson Tommy Bowden's get deserves to give you a phone call after that it's nice mark you're right though and I think USC we talked about usc's offense so much yeah Matt Leinart is unbelievable but I was impressed with the defense of USC we all talk about Oklahoma's defense you look at Pete Carroll's defense and what they do there zone blitz package the athletes they have vote from two of the Wild Bunch to scoring in this game if you watched UCLA's quarterback they never knew what was coming next blitz is from the outside corner blitz the safety blitz is us ease defense really stood out to me as well is that good USC offense they even lost one of the starters on that defensive line earlier in the season in days L and they still had two guys scored touchdowns another one almost had a twopoint conversion the Cadillac was gassed up and hit overdrive early Williams and the Tigers all over the tide 18:3 will try to have squibbitt and he does this holiday season deck your halls and

Big East they've got Pittsburgh coming up next winter that game almost certainly will get the BCS bit Pittsburgh beats temple the other one we saw earlier on ESPN Virginia Tech falling it home to Boston College Hokies swooning again down the stretch this season they've got a second half coming up who just a little bit bent over had a tough day against Ole Miss last week dropping to the tential winner turned into Jim against Alabama GT is come duel for the soul where does reality and and pure vision begin a pioneer plasma display can deliver more than 1 billion colors taking highdefinition

universities of the southeastern cumference equipping tomorrow's leaders today in love perfectly groomed men but grooming certain areas can be a problem now there's micro touch for safe precise grooming that gets as close as a play yet is safe to the touch now you can keep the back of your neck barbershop perfect by yourself remove unsightly ear hair and embarrassing nose hair with just a touch sideburns and ears neat and clean so 18 to to our scores we head to the third quarter here of this iron ball the 2003 edition my dad freaked put yourself in the place of the alabama coaching staff at a halftime you know what did you say to the office I'd like to have a couple more receivers so it saw some great speed but with what they got to do in the second half somebody's got to make a play together get to ball two Pro throw but they got to go back to what you said shot Williams there are no only two scores behind right here still can stay with their game plan here's the big thing Ron I see in this stats one of eight on third down conversions tonight's halftime stats brought to you by Pontiac high performance so you see the numbers total yards three hundred and twenty four for Auburn 109 for Alabama yes to kick it off and you're looking into the eyes of Tyrone Pro throw number four whoops and here's the kick this is going to come to Brooke set the floor oops sometimes you look back in a game and you've had a couple chances to put a team away and you don't get it done then the speed of the kickoff return team scores the touchdown Bostick trying to make it an 18 to 9 ball game that he does Brandon bras this is the thing it's been missing tonight for Alabama big plays he makes it a little move there then Springs the outside now he beats the kicker and everybody else and gives the big play that Alabama needs so if you were not with us off the top of the telecast tonight Auburn as you take one more look at this long 96th yarder offered on the first play from scrimmage Cadillac Williams with a V and now Alabama opens the second half with that explosion and just like that we get a 9 point ballgame Adrian Karsten let's check with you exactly the type of thing Tommy Tuberville was worried about in a very emotional locker room does moments ago run the seniors with tears in their eyes didn't want anyone else to speak again except their head coach and when he did it was about concentration making a play 3 big drop walls to the to the gun for a touchdown grande not to be too pathetic but his last words for me as he came out of the tunnel down in the deal was it just ain't my year brother it just ain't mine one wasn't his play but still can be is here I'll tell you one thing the Alabama folks that have not had much to cheer about so far tonight are up and making a lot of racket across the way that's the first touchdown return by Alabama since September the 18th 1999 at Legion Field against Louisiana Tech good kick kicks it away from the 16yard lines runs into his own man a woman should do it he that's going to be almost back to the 40yard line tonight's game track being brought to you by pioneer and here are some of those plays that were talking about in the early going rumors things that caused bocas not to be there for all burn early this week that Williams on the first play from scrimmage at that opening the scoreboard Finch what Dansby look at this play here boy he took pathologist school D on why you don't come into his area blitz coming right at the middle hit behind the line all of a sudden now Ron this is a football game the Alabama fans sense of defense sense that they finally got a score by the special teams Marco rhymes up on the Blitz just ran by Marcus McNeal and Mike these are the points that you were making in the first half when you said Alabama needs big plays on both sides of the ball they really do so they open special teams big play now big play on the defense second and 14 short drop pass is completed but tackled immediately is Daniels and he goes for a very short gain on the play Ronna I want to go back to twopoint play because they kicked the extra point a lot of people may have gone for the two to get it in eight point game they decided to one point they didn't want to chase at Alabama so they went there now nine down if they would have gone for the two they'd have been one score and twopoint play away from get getting tied up third down a 10 sample the powers away Williams intended receiver that ball was thrown so close he almost picked off the umpire at the same time if I'm Tommy Tuberville wants to get I want to get my defense on the football field right now my specialty and let me down my off finish this little jittery right now I want to go back and let my defense nominate Alabama's offense Kody bliss comes in to punt only the second punt for offering tonight they're coming after a gets it away and this a driving spiral whoops from the team tries to go back the other direction and 52 on the kick and seven the honor to return take a timeout now mentos has 70% more box right now all goodyear tires are on sale that's right all of them and when you buy for selected Goodyear tires you get up to $75 cash so hurry in pick out a winner we could go on and on why Maglite is one of the world men don't like to shave they'd rather light their shorts on fire or eat dirt Daisy fellas Nivea soon as the pain of shaving with moisturizers and vitamins Nivea for men half shave balm soothes it improves Nivea for men more evolve skincare this holiday season no one will work harder or go farther to keep us all connected college football is a onceinalifetime opportunity it's not all about you know winning games about you know having a real a real college life and making new friends and meeting new people and come back for your my senior year I got a bunch of buddies who will be with me this season it's a great program it's fun the fans are into it I really just wanted another year to experience the college life NCAA football a lifetime of opportunity so we are back circle Ashley they're together Yale wrote I she has have something to cheer about here in the second half he gets the handoff William threatened Tomatoes it opening 30:35 23 yards from the start of the second half 96 yards in the kick Reapers a blitz on first down and now the offense showing Mike that they are energized coming out of the locker that really are whatever Mike Shula and the coaching staff said to this Alabama football team they're a different group here in the third quarter Hutson Malcolm's in a teal bag he gets the hand on heard support runs over that defensive back and is close to another first down a junior Rose Green came up it is asking now for the license plate on the truck the Junior Rose Green mate makes the plain you just watch the sidelines Ron and you can tell Alabama's players are in this thing right now they're congratulating each other they're stepping up to the line they're making plays Auburn little we're a little stunned right now Shawn Williams right up the middle another big opening and he crashes into a defensive back and that's a pickup of 13 yards Carlos Rogers finally made the stop and this is exactly what the Ranger the offensive coordinator wants to do right now he can if he can get the ball shot Williams's hands and just keep running the football against offer and they'll be in this football game with a Chance of women now Hudson comes back into the lineup good onetwo punch he will take it for a couple of yards and Neal makes the tackle and for those sitting at home and say well why that you've got to continue to make sure that all burns defense stays honest you really do because you get in long yardage situations and you get in trouble both these teams Auburn in Alabama when they get beat they have bad first down place and of course the other thing you've got to do if your protocol you're going to make sure you know where number eleven is because Carlos Hensley is an offense record for short top pick pass into the middle got it from playing the next Fulton and it will be the 24yard line it's good for 15 football coaches can't stop the momentum like basketball coaches with timeouts but right now everything is going to Alabama's way Fulghum with a good catch a wellthrown football by Brodie Croyle besides the running plays Mike shorter drops moved the pocket just a little bit to give him just that extra second to get a passion good balance right now in a play : shot Williams left side not much doing on this play at gisu number eleven Carlos Dansby is the first man to get there to make the hit Carlos tans being a very good linebacker the leading tackler on this football team he's got six tonight unofficially with us Mike played Center for Alabama this year they are so short on tight ends have had the keys in for party purposes it's an 18yard game he ran in a great run great bulging he's going to work inside on Kevin Hobbs Kevin the house boy down and fold him is so wide open great route and crow has a open receiver to get the ball to biggest difference here in the second half he really does he's deaf time to look up and find an open receiver and dial it in look at this this drive 76 yards total 109 Williams bouncing she got the minute counterplay up in sidewalk blocked by that offensive line shot Williams reaches in the end zone about this eight plays 82 yards three minutes 48 seconds Bostick with the extra point attempt he's got it so we'll take a timeout oh six left in the third quarter at our new score 18 216 offers margin but to reduce we'll try to have squibbitt and he does the Bears have to get out of Rogers along the sideline deep trouble a trip feeling okay mr. Shimono let's go over the order first one is seagrass okay Terri Luca can you hold on okay now no I think that's a great idea I've got your fax the numbers I'm sorry the logitech cordless keyboard and mouse no cords to tie you up slow you down or hold you back great what will you do with all that freedom Hey I love you same here you know me too when you can't say it show it the nokia 3650 camera phone the new love letter a Thanksgiving weekend tradition with a new twist Annika Sorenstam joins Phil Mickelson Mark O'Meara and Fred Couples in the skins game first so we're back and boy I mean the faithful from Alabama they are hooked and making a lot of noise how about these numbers first hand shot Williams 8 carries 43 yards on that drive four carries 40 yards and a touchdown he's been the difference now if you're Auburn your defense is shaken your special teams shaken your offenses shook up you need somebody to step forward and stop Jason Campbell's that man Robinson to kick it off that lack Williams one of the deep man and he will gather it in at the eleventh Cadillac running over people as he crosses the 30 to the 32 that last drive Mike they just really blocked the offensive line robbed William starts outside he can see there's nobody there and he gets all the way to the secondary then he runs a little misdirection play he's in the secondary and herring makes the play now the past holds him wide open the Hawks go down a good mood then shot wings takes one in the end zone and gets a scheme a little tiger shot getting a breather across the way first down for the Auburn Tigers gamble set to the pocket got his past to pay for danger going to be a bottle 5 yard game Madison was that I really believe everything's gonna be on the back of Jason Campbell right now because they're having a hard time running the football but Daniels looks his own that he injured that wrist you see him immediately coming to the sideline to get the trainer's to look it over Alabama's keeps they win this football game this defense has been no reason Daniel's five catches 52 yards the leading receiver tonight banging away and crunch the 42 the fortythree rece davis all right Ron US Postal Service gonna take us down to williamsbrice stadium in Columbia where South Carolina might as well mail it in Charlie Whitehurst finds Wayne Coleman blighters has thrown 21 touchdown passes this season that ties a bunch of records they're opening up a can on the Gamecocks boy I'll tell you what since Whitehurst has become their man and he got him in an irregular way they have been really tough on offense they have great wide receivers in homes not to hit the Midway mark of the third quarter that has been an interesting affair to say the least this pass phone complete to Taylor Courtney still in bounds at the 50yard line I like what you know the offensive coordinator is doing right now he's spread the field with those Alabama's defense got up a little bit on him they stopped making tough to run against him he's spreading this football game he's working on these corners since Johnson was shaken up Jake slaughter operates at fullback let's Wallace the tight end in motion but he goes with Cadillac and run it back into the boundary cuts it back at the first down what would a quick button right in between two defenders and swatter with a very nice blonde from the plug and you're looking at the grade back here Carnell williams who's a lot of people think is going to come out this year he said he's going to stay in but I think the coaching situation will determine whether he goes or stays well they're all kind of rumors at the brandon jacobs if he comes back possibly with transfer catholics got a hundred yards in 12 carries that get a hundred and ten mr. dick Orion from the room there's a good job at Butler Ron had setting up the corners Carnell Williams now they lost the best blocker they have Brandon Johnson Jake slaughter as you said Ron stepping in there doing a pretty good job good moves Bank Parnell Williams Ramsey Robinson probably got a little seasick event because he was going right and left couldn't get his balance to make the tackle Carnell went right by almost nine yards per try short drop Singh's apply to the committee got a complete that's good has become their favorite goto guide the Richard Preston and Ron I said that Jason Campbell's got to step up you've got to stop the bleeding you talked to by the Alabama the defense stopped the bleeding for them Jason Campbell has to stop the bleeding for Auburn you have to you have to be a counterpuncher otherwise Olmo will pop to the other side and you can't retreat Courtney Taylor is an impressive looking young men Paul this either but he continues to push the my about 3 and 1/2 yards Roman Harper who's had an outstanding game tonight got a fumble recovery also came up with a pass interception for the Alabama Crimson Tide is the man who made the tackle a nice young man when you talk to him you'd be proud for him Roman Harford represents University we did play the free safety and the Flex playing at strong of the oval position better playaction handle okay you have to be impressed also with the fact that offered as I mentioned you know port detailer they seem to like him a lot but Daniels has really participated in caught a lot of balls tonight McIntyre over mono with a 64yard so they've spread it around a lot of receivers ain't got great depth at that position big third down I think they need to touch and not a field goal here I know they're at home but I think that's important for a counterpunch to come back to Alabama nice play of the drive foot past the line of scrimmage can't call to be waved off because the ball was tipped in toin old and they're going to call that off put that back in his pocket I was tipped the ball was tipped therefore there is no the circuit Lincoln 25 thank you right Oh Ronnie holding them to three points Oldham steps up he's six foot five he's like a basketball player now he jumps it's his hands on that football Vaughn to attempt the 32yard field goal and this actually would be his career from this distance

it was total domination for the Auburn Tigers and your points welltaken a couple of opportunities to put Alabama way Auburn didn't do it and right now although they righted the ship a little bit last Drive still they're far but their score away ticket fare caches signal for and made at the 23yard line at 10 Castile Adrian Karsten let's go down to you Ron once again I think this picture proves that we have taken our coverage of primetime college football to the same level with high definition is the level of emotion in the stadium tonight next week I'm taking my TV down to Wake Forest for Maryland game at 3:30 Eastern then college basketball ESPN HD gifts on December 2nd with Illinois North Carolina the entire ESPN HD schedule is available on espn.com the search HD brought to you by Phillips and Best Buy once again Ron highdefinition is up and it's very good all right a good guy thank you about to go under five minutes to play Shawn Williams nice job defensively by auger and he does get a guard out of it but the Kevin Hobbs is over to lead the attack and make the tackle Kevin Hobbs was eaten by full gym but on the running play he was right up there to make the tackle both road the man at the bottom of your screen we mentioned here the touchdown pass if it's Mississippi State they've tried to make him their goto guy quick pass got that one completely that's galoot pray on this Luke and he'll have the first down that's the first catch for him tonight when you get Shawn Williams gone that's helped Brodie krub because now all of a sudden offerings not getting to the quarterback no pass rush because they're so they're so concerned with shockwaves they don't want to get on the blitz and run by him playaction slides down we mentioned back in the first half he will have shoulder surgery on December the 4th be told us to at the surgery as quickly as possible but Mike I would I don't see any way that they would allow him to participate in spring football after the Panna surgery is going to have to have on that shoulder yeah I agree with you and I think Mike Shula didn't know when you were talking but he's so aware of everything else was going on this program but he's got a good quarterback here for a couple years yep it's back to Williams running back into the side of the field and there's just nothing there Thomas was the guy that really messed up the played on Tereus was there and in Reggie Torborg came over to help out the quarterbacks been the key the night when you look at the comparison here Jason Campbell I thought came up big on that last Drive got a field goal but Brody Coyle has owned the second half he's been right on third down and to keep it going they have to go just across the puts him in the game at tailback ground coil straight back in the pocket got a man and druid be crazy Hudson had a step on the linebacker and if he's able to lead him it see the pass of the ferret to he's going to catch it for a huge game and no doubt they had what they wanted look for the return here again run guys back Carnell Williams Trey Smith he is the shorter of the two backs Parnell Williams the deep man they're free lunge kick wheeling hi good coverage King William's signals for the Bearcats and makes it at the 25yard line when I stayed with college basketball's feast week presented by eBay Monday night RDSP at 2:00 and 7:00 Eastern it's Roy Williams and the Thornton Carolina Tar Heels taking on the Davidson Wildcats even on Tuesday night at ESPN it's 9:00 Eastern number three Michigan State battles number five the Kansas Jayhawks Kansas of course will be retiring and Nick Collison's Jersey and hands on in that ballgame college basketball damn before the shotgun roll it's the pocket gets the pass complete to gamers and then he is thrown out of his reach Davis time to check with you again all right Brian and Taco Bell's going to take this to Seattle for the Apple Cup Washington State up five five on Washington Tony pick at the Corey Williams for the touchdown with a buck ten to go here's the two point conversion no good Washington State on the move 38 seconds left they're down by one through dozen state four field goals tonight rivalries bring the best back if they do and if well there's some people there poll people all over the place with your fingers crossed on that when pulling for Washington State particularly breaks it loose at the forty and Charlie Jones made the tackle but it's different Freddie Roach Patty and he just blew right by he gets his legs turned in now number 24 Darnell Williams watch when he hits his hole those legs are moving in its own Road lower body yep Roach trying to pull him down you just broke right through the tackle Williams again nothing to the rightside bounces it back into the middle he wins him from the named Eric gain and most facts that have stayed on the right side have been tackled from no game makes him lose he cuts back he gets the ball the right side stops comes back to the backside Madison does a good job of keeping him leverage and keeping them inside Kent left with a net 80 yard touchdown run from scrimmage on the very first play tonight second down you could see how short the yardage is the yellow line just inside the 45 and catwalk further Jemaine has the first down took the wallet in his time is out there Charlie Jones and Garth combining on the stop but the damaging thing right here is not only gaining control but they're just wearing that clock out we're down to 118 in the third quarter pulling momentum back in their direction but also keeping the football away from Alabama Arnel hits his helmet he needs a breather integrand the running back coach signals from Ronnie Brown England Cadillac 17 carries 146 yards and the touchdown but that's a pickup about five and a half yards David Scott first tackle that we've had him in on tonight number 23 senior out of Homestead Florida I must say this again Carnell Williams has been a big part of the second half but to me the guy then right on is Jason Campbell yeah he is from bullets in the east bone strikes way he needs it he he has really showed a lot of poise to Mike they were under some heavy duress on an opening offensive series of the second half game clock under 25 seconds go straight ahead now Lonnie Browns my turn to move the pie out the end and the change yeah clock is running twelve seconds down to eleven that probably is going to be the last play of the third quarter yep and Auburn is unsnapping the chinstrap full fingers go in the air

tonight the emotions have run both directions enjoy got some help in the safety of the units mistake there JC Campbell's first big mistake in this football game didn't read the safety charge Owens had that measure and the time Nate broke the huddle you could see him flying across to help out Anthony Madison here he comes into the picture and he just cuts right in front and Madison didn't realize it but he was helping just run the wide receiver out of bounds Daniels of course the intended receiver by the way glad to see him back in that injury to his hand was no more serious than it was chard Williams we'll make it to around the 25 tonight's game track being brought to you by pioneer or to open the second half in 86,000 on their feet Brooks Brandon takes it to the house for the touchdown and shot Williams a run Alabama here too open things up in the third quarter something they did not have the entire first hand really black Williams continues to perform his magic and now is over 150 yards on the evening Shawn Williams right up the middle squirts through a small hole rece Davis what do you got for Rana got the Africa Cup for you 22:19 Washington State dust loggers in maxheap who

chance to put this game away three big plays here Cooper Wallace Italian wide open didn't bring the ball back in fumble it then the throw of the year and Roman Harper makes a great interception they've got some points there then Jason Campbell with a big mistake here turnovers in the red zone will get you every time Mike you get no points say every week we talk about how high he raises the bar big play right there he's a good linebacker and Rodney's talked about you've been reading all these highlights of past years somebody's going to make a name for themselves in the school minutes this great rivalry game they're down gotta take it to the 26 Alabama shows blitz here they come off the corner and right at the middle but they missed him in sample traffic too far for slaughter for

Campbell flush down the pocket here's the throw he's got to make that catch he may have looked back up until the lights or something you're right you got to make that catch took his eyes off the

presented by pavia vote for this week's ultimate Pontiac high performance play at espn.com / Pontiac and in part by a diamond disc forever show her how much you love her upon night we still got 10 minutes in 26 seconds left of it Alabama Auburn set speed drillship talked about somebody stepping up making the name for themselves we'll hearing a walk on earned a scholarship picks that football off I'll tell you he really had to do a great job of concentrating it was a tough ball to catch took shooters reaction with Brody let's talk satellite runs it back into the boundary they treated rather rudely Madison comes over to make the tackle of it lay in some words up Ron you talk about this rivalry I was on a plane to Atlanta with private Rowland guy a be seen range high school had to be about 18 19 years old from Mobile Alabama on his way to Baghdad he had his uniform on he said I'm an Alabama fan he said I hope to find out the good news on my trip out there but we salute all the servicemen and women we're gonna want the heroes in the Atlanta Airport when I was coming over I ran into a group of guys we have a dead ball personal foul I guess the offense 15 so the major penalty stepped off against Auburn I ran into a group of guys who have been in Baghdad been there for almost a year headed to to Huntsville and I got to visit with him someone asked every one of my said what's going to be the first meal you're gonna have now that you're back home and they said steak steak and potatoes good the SEC second to Platteville for the first down eight a long way 22 yards Alabama shows blitz poke coming right up the middle candle ones out of the Blitzen in gets the pens on to Taylor and he turns a negative into a positive situation that stops the clock at 9:42 you talk about a big penalty that was a big penalty they had Jason Campbell getting flushed out again get squared up and throws the ball to Courtney Taylor so third down lying to me he's down at the gala Bama 41 yardline Campbell from the shotgun boy look at the pressure off the corner they misty now gets the pass away inside what a catch by McIntyre ball is behind me Ron you're right but what a play by Jason Gambel in the football Alabama had the right thesis on the pressure Jason Gambel watch the low snap now the pressure on the corner now he moves and he throws the ball to McIntyre for the biggest first down of this game the question about that Antoine told them was good pressure so awkward continues to move the football trying to settle things down offensively and we'll give it to cut our burger turns it up spin moves 27 yard line Anthony Madison puts it into his trail head Luck has been special many times in his career but in this ball game tonight 21 carries now 464 yards and depending on what happens in the coaching staff maybe his last game home game here at the Auburn poke not under 9 minutes to play you see that average almost eight try and they'll get it to him again and there was a flag down that may be holding against Silas Daniels I believe my if they call that Silas Daniels just made the biggest mistake because he didn't need to block he just needed to shield Anthony Madison that's what it's gonna be Ron yep from the fiveyard line that's where the whole takes place Silas Daniels right here against Madison and you see even score it anyway so again another mistake by this awkward football team you could see cooks trouble shaking his head like he told Adrienne coming out of the tunnel not my year not my year Ronnie Brown comes into the ballgame to give Cadillac Williams a breather on course down to give at the crown is still another tackle for Alabama the emotions of the week Tommy Tuberville buddy his staff the staff doesn't know anything talked to a couple those coaches they said they don't know nothing what's going on but eight coached this football team this week got him ready 501 yards right side pollicis longer sees all the way to the one foot Ruhlman Harper saved the touchdown which you can see those offensive line but they were turning their legs as well and Cadillacs going to come back on to the field and replace Ronnie Brown good move Ronnie Brown with good effort but you figure Farnell wins should have the first shot to take this in the end zone slaughtered the fullback out front blocky get shoes pinned up also with a bit block in the play so a seasonhigh for carnal Cadillac Williams a hundred eightyseven years John Vaughn to attempt the extra point he's got it so we'll take a break 7:27 left to play in her ball game and a new score Auburn 28 Alabama 16 as you see slaughter with the block Cadillac Colonels the Auburn Tigers now have moved out to a 12 point margin we'll be right back we'll have plenty of talent Newton taking this snap and going deep for Whiteside freshman to freshman and broken up by Toure Francis with seven seconds clemson will be a team to be reckoned with wherever they go bowling whoever they draw the postseason they can have a handful this is one of the hottest teams in America and Tommy Bowden has become the first head coach to win against to 200 win coaches in the same month his father and Lou Holtz both fall November 2003 and hopefully very early next week he will receive what he deserves offensive Tiger Rock Dave I got a feeling that he will receive just that I got a good feeling about Tommy's situation in happy ride after a blowout win over their instate rival 63 17 our final NFL live is next percent of our series all Clemson all night tonight in Columbia with Bill Curry Heather Cox and the rest of our ESPN crew is Dave Barnett don't forget more postgame coverage coming up the Auburn faithful they're out of that state of shock that they were in to begin the third quarter hey young kids watch what's happening right here he's a guy that is a star but what he's saying is all you folks down there in the trenches I Love You Man because I didn't do it by myself and no he's a great running back Ron but he's a smart guy yeah he knows who's got it starts with that goop up front season high for him tonight this ball game is what that thing is going to try but a good bounce comes up to proko and he will take it to the 38 yard line let's talk about Parnell Cadillac Williams first play from scrimmage tonight he goes 80 yards I need to just eat Electrify this place than last touchdown scored by harbor to make it 28 to 16 and you see the numbers 23 attempts 8 187 yards and the two touches his careerhigh is 202 against Syracuse that was in Oh too enemies is down at the bottom of that stack but Williams was able to get back on the football now Ron the clock becomes a factor and you got to throw the football we'll herring with a big interception set this all up the backside and use again reach Davis what you got for us got the end of the game between Clemson and South Carolina 63 to 17 this finally finally mercifully from South Carolina brings it to an end question is is this the end of the Tommy Bowden era they carried him off he made it hard for it but they want to chase him out of Clemson guys yeah I hope he made it so difficult that he she's beat South Carolina Hudson comes in at tailback past knocked away keep defense furro thought of hand was in his back but the official didn't agree why Mike Shula is on the field he wanted interference hits it was a back ulusoy it won a death called Trey Smith back beat for Auburn quick quick series for the Alabama Crimson Tide of the mic coming up Freeland booth not quite as long but a wobbly spiraled Bearcats is called for in made by Trey Smith so let's take a timeout now we've got 554 left in our Bobby Williams the other Williams in this game 18 carries 94 yards and a touchdown but it's Auburn with the lead 28 16 under 6 to go soon as this game goes final complete highlights and Tommy Tuberville postgame news conference live from jordanhare stadium speculation is that if the Auburn Tigers were to lose this rivalry game Tuberville could be fired but seems like they should be able to hold on to win this thing but he'll be talking about that many other things potentially his future at Auburn gonna keep it right here on ESPN news no I met him when I was working Mississippi nice guy mmm probably doesn't deserve all the talk that's going around Clemson South Carolina 14 nothing Clemson over South Carolina Charlie Whitehurst to Ben Hogg rumbling and that made it 21 nothing Clemson Whitehurst with that hand in the air for good reason look at the Tigers 63 217 your final Clemson has now won seven of the last nine meetings with South Carolina it's the Tigers eighth win this season their most victories since 2000 nailless now for the postgame extra gentlemen great game take it away well it was a 63 17 game we the Iron Bowl not played in Birmingham anymore but it will never be anything but the Iron Bowl according to these people down here Alabama fans showing a little consternation now boy they really came back early in the third but Auburn retrieved what had been there early and this guy right here for the major part in that reversal of fortune Mike I just want to say there's nothing when you talk about nothing like this series Scott Johnson our director and I got up and walked early this morning and we do this particularly for this ballgame and it is amazing the campers the SUV's just tents all over the place and people are up we were out just after seven o'clock and they're up cooking some people's party enjoying the little libation at an early time to make sure that their I you know welloiled before this ball game starts but I they're friendly they're into it so the major step off but the point is neither one of these teams came close to living up to this year's expectations but they're here in record numbers tonight they were all over the place on that Thursday when we arrived and it's just this is such a half of it and it's an amazing thing and you think about that because other rivalries where the two teams are down a little bit they normally suffer this we've never done truly great state and and they love their football step it down at 18 Williams again he's gonna fight his way up to around the 23 yard line for Alabama now would start with them they have a bright future they really showed a lot of determination in the second half they came out team after Auburn and this bike shoes got him on the right path you see the port's losing season in the last 45 years look at the coaching changes in what heavy it's also the third in the last seven third down over I'll give it to Williams again he'll take me close to the 30yard line Rowland Harper come over to make the tackle the timeout has been called by Alabama you can see defensive coordinator Joe Kines coming up there saying hey let's call the timeout stop the clock at the 423 mark take a look at the West MSU now in the driver's seat after having defeated Ole Miss today identical records but of course headtohead competition six and one in conference play Ole Miss Falls to eight and three on the season LSU ten and one overall then comes Arkansas Harvard LSU still has to play Arkansas and that games in Little Rock I believe right yes Alabama's bowl games next week they got a ye Alberto go to a bowl game and Rob we need to close the book on Tommy Tuberville his next game folks is tomorrow morning when he meets the president the university good boy president Walker I don't think there's any way they should fire this man and I also said it earlier Tommy Tuberville shouldn't fire any of this coaches because there's no blame to go the expectation level of Auburn was too high this year newspaper made them the number one team in the country and that was way out of line well there was certainly off the mark poorly handled all we care Cody bliss back to punt for Albarn and again Brandon Brooks is the deep man case you missed it thing of beauty by him to open the second half of the ninetysix yard kickoff return spirals not going to turn over but still pretty good distance and he runs away from it and it'll go dead just inside the 30yard line rece Davis let's check back with you at the studio hi Ron 361 straight game BYU scored some type of point hadn't been shut out since 1975 in the second quarter they missed a field goal didn't really get another shot Utah shut them out when they win the Mountain West for Urban Meyer that streak show streaks over don't forget everything coming up on College GameDay final good night while it may be cold yeah somewhere on assistant at Kentucky right now that's the lot of you we should take some pride in this some comes in at tailback quick pass short drop got a complete and that's pro throw and he gets bumped out of bounds right there in front of the Alabama bench and as we discussed last week the most difficult thing for Alabama and they do get to play the extra game because they're going out of the continental US pick over and play a wife that is their bowl game but then the helmets at the pads go up and they don't get to continue to work which is very important I mean that's that's almost like an extra spring training for these teams that do get an extra two or three weeks there's a negative and there's a positive because Mike Sheila can call as recruits and say yeah hey join us we got opportunities galore play right now Koya runs up into the pocket and now just throws this one away and what he did neither got a full flight now this surprises me a little bit it was beyond the line of scrimmage unless we had an illegal receiver downfield I'd be surprised and grounded because he was beyond the five yard barrier most people say tackle box but actually it's five yards outside the center it's determined that the passer was outside the five yard zone there we go there's no foul you mentioned about Rogers and each every game they heard the booze one more time really every time we've ever worked a game that he was the referee and it's been handled just like that extremely well tonight whose final regularseason game the season almost picked off Kevin Hobbs cut in front on that women pretended for Fletcher he had seven points six for the touchdown they would attacked on the extra point if he could have just held on gone of course down by 12 points we'll go for it at the 351 mark a listen to the warbird faithful they are standing chill on the defense flag is down pump it once going to go on top of these got available and that is Fletcher and he'll tuck it in for the touchdown let's check the marker at the line of scrimmage I think it's going to be movement on the Alabama it's going to come back so we race a 59yard touchdown reception we have the illegal motion against the offense the player was moving toward the line of scrimmage at the snaps yard penalty replay yeah the motion going to come in motion Fulghum turns up field you seem right here turn upfield and that's why the call was made and the officials got a choice right there nope got no choice you have to throw the flag on that and seven here comes the Blitz they kick it up runs up into the pocket now gets it away and has it complete across the 50 inside the 45 is Ray Hudson still life in this Alabama football team Brodie crawl with an alert play to get the ball to Hudson see what herring was all over him coming in on the Blitz SportsCenter coming up next immediately following our ball game regi talk to the quarterback tonight if that spreads and closes heat sack of the season recruited to Auburn as a running back under three minutes to play coil he's got a man open heat and he goes to him that is Fletcher and you could see blender head about three steps done to be fits it back I think the mistake Jack Fletcher made as he did didn't run didn't open it up now he stutters and he's looking back he needs to turn it loose ball way over tanto 10 of 25 114 yards in two interception those of members on Brody here comes the blue heron right up the middle they picked him up beep got it right over the middle and that is Folsom well that's a great throw by voting for 26 yards Feeny comes over to make the tackle there a lot of time on this clock yet for Alabama from the shotgun quick pass attractive your screen that jr. does a good acting job here ball hits the ground second and ten to twenty four remaining oil Spencer Johnson and here's the impressive thing like they said for a drops impotent coverage they still get the sack they got two timeouts left left a lot of a vote time go up sometime here you can see Croyle is very frustrated they had to call the timeout so we'll take a break 153 left we'll be right back hey Dad what's up help me stop smoking you're quitting you're my hero and that a superhero yeah you'd look funny in tights when do you start now this is gonna help me fight my cravings NicoDerm CQ just one patch gives you a steady stream of Medicine all day you step down gradually until you're free I'm really proud of you you're not a superhero you don't have to be you've got NicoDerm CQ it's not

your body it's your watch James Bond movies three gift sets one bomb the entire DVD collection 2816 rivalry week I don't think this disappointed anybody they're down you gotta take this ball down to the 14 yard line they scrimmage from the 35 coil sets a screen Hudson nearside Blanca in front cuts it back into the middle Rodgers saves it touchdown 140 one left that's a 27 era game a great fight call by Mike Shula Dave brainer the screen was right there rerouting they're knocking on the door with enough time yet to win this football game it looked like Evan Mathis came out of a stance understandably so I tell you tor Borg has given him fits today yet Evan Mathis is pointing to the referee that maybe they're making a sound over their dead ball foul what a great call here ray Hutton just turns it upfield picks up the first down caught him in the Blitz sever the penalty it moves it back to the 40yard line first and goal Alabama 1:13 left on the clock they're going to make some magic happen quickly for the game Jean it's Timor Leste nur yep Lieut couldn't hold on the ball bounces up and you can see Lance Taylor making sure he had his toes just inside the line extra point attempt up and good we've got 63 seconds left in our ball game but it's a fivepoint margin again you may deploy lance taylor talking about number 39 ball comes off Luke watch him looked down catch the football and make sure his feet are not out of bounds a big play by Lance table of the seniors a lot of heart on this Alabama football team on television it's they given it all here on the field you know 63 seconds left we all know what is about to come every Thursday when we go to practice fields and it happens in practice fields all over the country special teams you spend the extra time

his dad and touched by Alabama before it was 10 yards Thurmond Ward got on it let's go as the injured player for Auburn meanwhile the discussion goes on with the officials we had encroachment against the kicking team on the kickoff that penalty is declined because we had the illegal touching the ball and not yet don't in yards when the kicking team touched the onside kick see worse touch right there before it goes ten yards one thing you have to watch when you're on side kicking this football as you stay on bounce there's the ball touched in nine yards it looks like Lance Taylor who just got that touchdown pass is the man who was just well use about a half yard to quick as pets go is being helped over to the bench so close all I mean so close here's the reactants my Tommy Tuberville the frustrations all week around we talked about nobody from the administration stepped up they helped him but the players stepped up tonight good thing ever Campbell takes a knee tonight our player

Cowboys home make a dent in the scoreboard what's the great one doing in the great outdoors we'd like to invite you to the Rose Bowl and we'd like to invite you to SportsCenter now with Scott Van Pelt I'm Karl Ravich the color the pageantry of hockey outside Melbourne it's got nothing on the frozen tundra of Lambeau and it appears as if the BCS now has a uns and a seat back in it doesn't it yes it does on this day of great rivalries in college football the nod goes to Ohio State and Michigan good thing they played in the big house because they needed one it was the 100th edition and Jim Tressel is Buckeyes literally marching in number two in the BCS let's get it on this is gonna be the biggest event in the world you know at this time it's not gonna be 112 thousand people anywhere else except in Ann Arbor twelve thousand 118 in the big house most ever for a college football game and early on Jason Avant oh it's ugly gets leg gets twisted under him he was in tears because his day was over Braylon Edwards and Chris Gamble reminiscent of Boston Woodson years back swing it landed haymakers and how about an 18 play drive from Michigan capped off by Steve Brest in the former high school quarterback he takes it an option style Lord Carr loving it a dominant drive seven love Wolverines next drive John Navarre nearly picked by a Jayhawk passed balls harmlessly incomplete very next play Rayland Edwards the Whitworth 130 on 7 grabs takes it 64 yards to the paint 14 love Michigan Navarre Oh in three against Ohio State 278 passing yards two touchdowns he was geek next Wolverine drives Navarre Edwards again 23 yards it's 21 nothing and Navarre ties elvis grbac for the most career touchdown passes Avon cheer and his boys on third quarter Michigan up 217 Chris Perry he takes it 30 yards for a touchdown it's 28 7 Michigan he was knocked down and out a couple of times he said no way was like coming out of this game third quarter Buckeyes mount a comeback Craig Krenzel for Santonio Holmes who sat out the start for disciplinary reasons he's on the field now he's in the stands and he's in the end zone his second touchdown Buckeyes cut it in half then Krenzel gets drilled leaves the game with his shoulder injury he would come back though later was that the right call though Scott McMullen came in and filled in more than capably looking for Santoni Santonio Holmes how you gonna leave them that open eight grabs a buck 21 all the way down to the go blue to Lydell Ross takes it in and here come the boys from Columbus again down just seven folks in the big house nervous folks at 99 Kuchar excited later in the fourth Michigan up seven key third down Lavar who had such a big ball game to Tyler Echo's only grabbed huge third down conversion moved the sticks and now Perry who went for a buck 54 takes it in for the touchdown Lloyd Carr what do you think of this running back pretty good huh Chris Perry was absolutely sensational perry's of firstteam allamerican and in my judgment there's not a better back in this nation in Chris Perry late fourth Buckeyes down two after a couple of ineffective series for Krenzel it's McMullen pass tipped intercepted by Ernest J's er Jim Tressel finally loses to Michigan Mike Griffey from the Rose Bowl committee has an offer we'd like to ask you a question guys yeah they'll accept Michigan their first win over the Buckeyes for John Navarre he was over three now he's got a win and he's excited it means a lot we stubbed our toe a couple times early in the season and and we kept we kept hope we still had the Big Ten championship in line and and we went we won seven home games and we continued went out after Iowa gaming and we just did a job the last four weeks of this season three times he beat ten teams that were ranked in the top ten of this nation he is an unbelievable human being and the way he has handled all of the things that were said about him and written about him I can't tell you how much I admire him and I've had some great quarterbacks here I mean great ones and John Navarre is one of them he's one of them and I don't want to keep going on it because Ohio State's D gave up a season high for 48 Michigan out 14 and three against top ten teams under Lloyd Carr three oh no this year outscored their top ten foes by over two touchdowns this year averaged over 410 a game they were oh and two against top ten teams the previous two seasons including a loss to Ohio State last year as for the Buckeyes their title dreams died and Ann Arbor we came into this game you know knowing one thing for sure that if we would have beat Michigan we we would have been you know Big Ten champs they beat us there Big Ten champs and that's I think that's the thing that hurts the most right now is uh you know we we set a goal every year to be the number one team in the Big Ten and we didn't get the job done today to take care of that we sit here we haven't won an outright Big Ten championship since 1984 you know and it's a difficult task to win one and that's why you have to tip your captain to Michigan for getting that done this year and but that obviously remains a goal of ours what guy fans have served this bitter pill before Ohio State has now lost its last four games at the big house when the Buckeyes headed up north ranked in the top five two states back 23 years the gameday gang was in Ann Arbor they break down the ballgame with so many implications well the milestone meeting in this series when the maize and blue nation will never forget for preparation passion execution nearly flawless especially senior quarterback John Navarre no player in any game all season carried more pressure on his shoulders two years ago it was Navarre shedding tears and a turnover Phil loss to Ohio State today any tears were tears of joy the reality was is that I was gonna be defined by they came and so I worked I worked harder and it prepared harder and so did this team and we all rallied around each other and show what we're capable of it's one of those games he's gonna be remembered he won't look back at this game for a long time and talk about the players and other people who had great performances in this game so it was no way that I was going to let some injuries hold me up liyan Kirk watch from the field as Chris Perry was part of that big effort and part of a very big drive to start the second half I think was the most important Drive of Michigan's football this year by far what happened is Ohio State score just before the end a half and then the Ohio State scored but then Michigan had to answer they answered it with Chris Perry and a beautiful drive of three runs and two passes Perry was sensational but then the nice pass by Navarre here got him into position we'll watch this run by Chris
