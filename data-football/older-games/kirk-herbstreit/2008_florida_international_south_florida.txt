football primetime matchup is presented by city hi everybody I'm Doug Bell welcome to southern Florida Miami to be exact it's exciting to be here a brand new stadium brand new Aero football at Florida International that's FIU the Golden Panthers we're excited to be here on ESPNU when you think about it if I use only been around for seven seasons South Florida only twelve seasons a football yet their 12th in the country it would make major headlines if FIU pulls off the upset on this opening night in their new stadium let's go down to the field and Melissa Knowles how does this moment feel can't describe it in words it marks the beginning of we set to doing that to build a championship football program it gets during our players eyes here in the locker room and most stars that Scott highs will ever going to be and let's start doing something special good luck today cutters women buck thanks Melissa hey when you think of South Florida you think of Matt Grothe he's a guy that during his career has won 20 games and lost only eight but what he did this offseason he lost 20 pounds so we could have more energy effort and efficiency usually you think of him running well last week versus Kansas in the third and fourth quarter he was 21 of 25 with two touchdowns in order for the Bulls to finish strong like they haven't the last two years they need a great effort from that Grothe Doug back to you all right buck thank you look forward to you getting back up here in the press box here's what's on tap in Miami tonight new digs new attitude we'll talk about what lies ahead for FIU the coaches Krip inside yet coach Cristobal what is his office look like and yes USF their humble beginnings as well as always the buck stops right here at FIU Stadium major excitement South Florida brings a host of fans across the state not a long drive by any stretch of the imagination in FIU has their fans and coach Cristobal told me yesterday he wasn't sure they would know how to act this is the first time they've ever been in their own stadium it is a gorgeous day in South Florida hot and muggy as you might expect fi you won the toss decided to defer and here comes South Florida bogan returns it and gets knocked down at the 26 so the Bulls coming off an impressive victory in overtime against Kansas last Friday night in Tampa we'll take the field Matt Grothe having his best season a talented young man who played in Lakeland High School football and is taking it seriously this year as far as just physical makeup he's lost almost 20 pounds and his game is quickness first and ten now Burke Grothe James Taylor lives up to his right Roby with lots of time to the outside of it for hiding Cedric Hill now let's look at South Florida upfront their offensive line Greg Gregory their offensive coordinator says this punch would be special makeup of a shooters their best life at left guard dial not bad backs and receivers Cedric Hill is a load at tight end on may be a bogan gets his first start on the outside second down now better you never know what direction South border will come this offensive Greg Gregory sometimes shotguns sometimes under center tight ends look tonight andalorian schmidt left tackle just a little early but I think stop board is excited to hear a lot of excitement of stadium well just like the last year the Florida Atlanta game this is almost a trap game for South Florida they come into the situation with the hostile crowd and a lot of Florida guys it's a lot like a family reunion only in a bad way Jim Leavitt told us the expected major passion from FIU even though they've lost their first two games they've won only one game in three seasons under Mario Cristobal but they are for two kids against Florida kids grow female and second down and long over the middle wide open is AJ love if you look at the Panthers up front a key fitted line that actually looks like a major college she could design according to the defensive coordinator he likes what he sees in these guys the backers they Huntsville Dominguez we saw him last year makes a ton of tackles and it is secondary their pass defense has really been good Gator and Mitchell on the corners third down in a yard for the Vols look into a hole a huge one is our tailor balls loose fi he comes up with it now initially he were to kind of place you have to have defensively in order for you to be successful if your fi you and that play right there was a very good run of mr. solicited by Taylor does a great job of hesitating walk there and then he takes off behind his big mad hunters but there's a good song hit inside and he gives the ball up looks like Anthony Gators was the one that hit him initially the ball comes out Gator does a good job of hitting them then the fumble recovery comes a scrum under there Doug don't know who go get that rotating quarterback for the Golden Panthers Paul McCall will get the start we will see Wayne younger tonight through the ground game million waves on the left side goes nowhere to tend up when Paul McCalla jr. from a Hollywood floor that's just down the highway gets the start tonight Brad shooting Doug the problem with Paul sometimes he overthinks Mario Cristobal where's it time aside lines one of the few coaches in the countries do that he's growing a beard and I love sitting down and chatting with this man boy does he had major enthusiasm excited about what the future holds for this young football program back to the ground game rheems on the delay draw get some positive yards gains five for FIU upfront an offensive line that actually is getting better Brad cerini on the river can watch this anchors that line at dinner catch the receivers they haven't had a opportunity to do a lot role and McGill accounted and very fast on the outside what you would expect from kids who play their high school football down to this state and we also see py Hilton the freshman rather great punt return last week they're expecting a couple weeks ago scuse me they'd really like py Hill third dad out back to the ground game and that will bring up fourth down if he picks up two for South Florida up front yeah Bowie and Selvi the book in and everybody's good as anybody has in this country the mom premiere the games we've called Park he has been all over the place double did you tackle and then Jerome Murphy trying his best to throw the slot at Mike Jenkins and Trey Williams and so far so good we'll talk about Ben mop and being out throughout the game and what his impact that has been on the South Florida defense FIU trying to get on the board first a 52yard attempt from Dustin Revis he decides to put it's a nice bounce and fi you will down that at the oneyard line beautiful plant Oh perfect play a little reason I thought they would do something on third down to give them an opportunity they didn't do it South Florida with their second possession talked to the first time another back of the one the Bulls in full force their fans making the trek over from Tampa 12 in the country they have that other side cat it's like they're isolated on islands but the South Florida Bulls are used to planted hostile environments they will make plenty of noise now Grothe from the oneyard line backed up Haley lined up behind him that's well plant sure it carries it out to the 2 yard line let's get down to the field at ELISA I'm here with the athletic director for FIU Pete Garcia see how does it feel to finally have this day here well it's very exciting for the whole community for the FIU university is something that we work very hard to get and to get to this day it's almost an unreal feeling what did you like to face the number 12 team in the country right now South Florida and you're another game well that's what we want to be eventually so if you want to be the best you got to play the best thanks Pete you're welcome Doug Melissa Thank You Pete Garcia earned his roots at the University of Miami which is just six miles away in Coral Gables as the mario crystal ball that's the connection and they do have a vision see you've got the completed pass to trim Capello the tight end I do think he caught it it looked like it was behind him but he did a good job reaching back and digging it out just play here they're going to work the playaction pass and this word Grothe has really improved see right there he got his hand done to me he looked like he pulled it in better look on that camera good hand good hands thoughtful fellow a completion of 14 yards so first in 10 more managable now for the Bulls from the 16 yard line back to the ground low planter let's see Doug they're always set and grow fee up you can see after every play he's going to roll out he's going to do things when they get him at the shotgun he becomes his own read guy but when he's under center he will still roll out and give the defense the appearance that you have to keep a couple of guys back to make sure you respect him second in seven now and I will say the loudspeaker here at FIU Stadium it works to perfection wow that is loud Grothe do it behind his intended receiver Carlton Mitchell I was not a good pass in Leavitt pregame as always a ritual he runs from sideline to sideline working up a lather no other coach does this buck I mean he he is into it usually though he's running full goal he must have something on that ankle or knee is something because usually he's out there he's sweating like us he's played already an interesting man Grothe pulls it down show those quick feet he knows where the first down marker is it gets out of bounds after making the first down that's what makes Matt Grothe the weapon he is it is and there's going to be a flag on that play Doug looked like it might be a late hit thing would grow see is that he also now even though he can run very effectively does what he does a very good job of now she's looking for the second and third guy even when he's scrambling after the play was over 15 yard penalty first out Denis Hennigan Big East officiating crew he's the referee with a call he feels the pressure there then he just decides okay can I throw it and whenever a quarterback throws that ball up it puts it up like he's going to throw it the people has to respect that but he knows it now being his third year playing this position he realizes if they hesitate I have a chance to go first antennas growth he looks the sidelines and Greg Gregory setting up that screen that was great for suit cover up and make a stop is Anthony Gator and as we watch tape but this kids impressive he flied around the football here's some very physical guys in that secondary Gator is one Jeremiah wood the spoon at six to 215 another big hitter but what I like about gay the two times in a row you forced the fumble on the last plate on the screen you usually had this first guy to have to come at fourth contain it doesn't get blocked but does a good job of pressing and making a play second down for South Florida you think about FIU now their first game in their oncampus stadium only the seventh season of football FIU flag down before the snap it will be procedure against South Florida that'll be get Cedric Hill who can't believe they called it on it was actually movement forward just before the snap he's the most important guy missed often is talking to Greg Gregory he just does so much he can be a wideout he can play H back tight in Doug the other thing you told me something interesting we're either in Broward or Dade County according to where we're sitting and you're on one side of the 50 M on the other so that's right the county line runs right down the sidelines of FIU basically a few feet back in this stadium old Tamiami Stadium longtime high school facility and now it's the home of the Golden Panthers and it will be busy on Thursday Friday nights as well from the high schools broken throws it up and out of bounds that he picked a nice pop took a shot from Jonathan Bettencourt we had a lot of time but the one thing that I saw Doug is that man covers it had everyone covered and they did a very good job of having one guy in the middle Paul Galliano always says we're going to have one guy in the middle we're going to play cover two they play a lot of cover tunes for international does and they want to pressure you but they have to get those front four guys playing well growth is off to a fine start and when you look at his career it is an accumulation of a young man who is getting better with time as most quarterbacks do over the middle and there's a catch a beautiful throat accreditor Hill AJ live on the receiving end going up and hitting it great job by AJ love I talked about Jeremiah withers Wetherspoon being a big hitter but AJ love had no fear and that trophy has way too much time and here we talked about that cover to look but great job weatherspoon looked like he didn't know to go for the pick or hit the guy and see when he's in decide for me that hesitation does gave AJ love who has probably been practicing the best reporter in a Greg reverie on the team of Chancellor a big play that was a 31yard pickup back to the ground it goes working his way forward seven yard pickup that was Richard Kelly when you were get grossie now he may look a little different to you and a great Gregory told us after the spring he was about 218 pounds that he flatout told him if we're going to win a title you need to get in better physical shape now he's under 200 pounds he's got the quickness back this is the Grothe of high school and I'm surprised grow through in karate chop him he's a black belt in karate but he took it football again teller got his pack fi he says they have a stump or two signaling that they still have it and it appears the Bulls will stay on it Kelly picked up seven his first carry 18 on that John able of running back to South Florida Kelly's not he went on the depth chart but getting the chance to play took a big shot at the end of that run that's the one thing I told you watching you guys play on film Marshall McDuffie was the one that knocked that ball out they do a very good job of coming up really trying to strike you Florida International does most Lacher is off the top or inside the five Marshall McDuffie saved a touchdown clear you called it yeah I mean they have a stable running back for skin fresh backs every couple of Laura Taylor Ben Williams mold plant sure well and you know Mike Ford is hurt right now Felix the place talks to the left and it comes back to the right you see those guys are out like right there Jeremiah Witherspoon so what what do they do watch the McDuffie have to come over and attack and make the play you see once they went inside and lost contained what they knew they were in trouble they better think Marshall McDuffie for saving that touchdown there was a 13yard pickup so it's going to 7 yard 18 and a 13yard carry back to the ground by taking a nice shot with no fletcher all off the football again and once again the panthers say they're happening I think they do haven't gotten the official signal no they say Florida still has it the line judge came in Tyler Kasich came up with that ball for FIU but the live judge is calling the man down before the ball came out we're going to take a look right here great shot right there by Jeremiah Witherspoon ball comes out after his arms hit the ground but look Jeremiah Witherspoon I told you he missed last year because of academic issues the ball doesn't come out so he hits the ground good look by the camera crew they're going to want to look at this again I know Mario crystal ball will and that's a smart challenge for them even though they won't win it according to our camera look well they will look at our replays in fact Todd coulis our producer who's celebrating his birthday today is getting the call now from the booth the makeshift roof that is because they don't everything finished in the new stadium and they will look at this replay right here and his elbow is down before the ball comes out at least that's the way I see it by the same plan here Doug I mean you you took a shot from Weatherspoon and almost kept his balance that's what Moe plasters does a very good job but it looked like his hand and his elbow were down before the ball came loose what I will say about Florida International this is a totally different team than I thought two years ago they will come up and hit you the problem they have offensively they've been pathetic and that's what they need to improve because their deepest place so much as so long that it keeps up on the field and in a hot day like today or when you're playing Iowa or Kansas you really don't have a chance to do much Mario Cristobal was an outstanding offensive tackle at the University of Miami and it was an interesting story as he told me yesterday in his office and I love being around him he just is so full of energy they would FIU called and wanted to interview him for the head coaching job he said he went there as a courtesy his mom her house is like four blocks away he said how could I tell my mom I didn't want to interview at FIU but he said he really had no interest was very happy being on the UM staff went there and he said eight hours later Pete Garcia the president had her convinced he could win a national championship here well and I bet his mom said hey she can make you great food every day if you want to come walk home walk from practice to come and see me that's a great story there are a lot of connections between hurricanes and FIU and now they're going headtohead in recruiting circles mr. ball longtime assistant coach Tiger Clarke Bernard Clark with an outstanding linebacker he and I played the eastwest Shrine game against I've known Tiger for long and Pete Garcia who Melissa interview before the game was the director of football operations for that tremendous run in um Wendy Shannon out trying to bring it back where it was but Chris ball was part he blocked for Gino Torretta when he won a Heisman and he laughs thinking about that Sugar Bowl when he went against Oakland and curry in Alabama being his Miami team 34:13 he could out those guys were really good the referee is having a little problems communicating with the new stadium and so now they've gone to the phone and now they're back on the field now the runners forward progress was not before the ball came loose or international discharge timeout that's the other thing about review you have to have indisputable evidence then they've given me splits right here he's going to be down your stop there went down ball comes out please pretty clear to me judge but once again I think for crystal ball they've had opportunities after the football this was a chance for him to talk to his defense may be shore up a few things plants are should have scored on that had he not gotten hit or made a move Mike Ford in the game now at tailback for South Florida the big Hoss from Sarasota got hurt high ankle sprain last carry the first game fins off a tackler in a touchdown boy he looked good on that one Mike Ford his first touchdown of the season and he is a absolute load Alexei was what if Alabama has him and who's able to back that they have now now this is a run where you just have some athletic ability he's got struggle with an ankle great spin move mate three guys missed outside very good run by Mike force that is why they're so high on them here he's been hurt since the first game of the season but he brings another dimension to the South Florida offense of a field goal or the extra point now if it is gold it's 7 nothing South Florida on a knee with an extra point he was the young mantis kick that field goal in overtime against Kansas the ground game just you enough FIU the Bulls on top ESPN you college football is presented by city whatever your story is your city car can help ride it because city never sleeps forever being in South Florida Miami and right now South Florida from camper the biggie on Council for international from the Sun Belt 7 nothing a year ago we were at Fort Lauderdale Broncos South Florida came across to play Florida Atlantic another Sun Belt member and I just love the intensity of these robberies it's almost like you watch your watching their high school careers take place in front of you the Broward a County area which Howard Schnellenberger says was saving Miami good kick get ahold allow and that's what we're trying to do is contain gy Hilton first time that exciting youngsters touched the football Doug we're going to take a look at the touchdown you're going to see Matt Garrett's on the end do his job perfectly well stop right there you see all those defenders outside there's no way Mike Gore just scored the touchdown but when he makes the spin move everyone's outside and they all miss that you can't have that they were so intent on stopping him over for shoot angle allowed Matt Mike Ford a chance to score six Palma call again in at quarterback he saw number 40 Y Hilton in your screen and Hilton the first time he touched the ball when his fi III return to punt for a touchdown and Lawrence Kansas first pass attempt and it is taught on the outside of junior Mikheil true freshman 14yard pickup very good play call also dug what they really did a good job of is working one way py hill you see him come back out also they run a short side of the field a boundary bootleg which you don't see a whole lot usually to see going to the light side of the bill good play call by Bill a got ties to Purdue so you're going to see some things of the Purdue bubble screens you're going to see a lot of those things they want to help the spread get going they have a score any touchdowns by oil which is often try to figure on getting hit up of them are led coming up tonight on ESPNU as always lots of action sweeper Drake Fresno State against Toledo then 11:30 Eastern is Tuskegee against film in a battle in Alabama it's hell it's football primetime presented by video ESPNU tonight buh who these games also available on ESPNU HD lots of travel for a team like Florida International and Fresno State who you'll see tonight FIU 3rd on that list for most miles that will be traveled this season they are road warriors these youngsters if the reversed about to make a terrific crop is grown Murphy boy Murphy is so quick leading pathway we saw why right here and the pinion up see Spence just so fast that you can't run plays sideline to sideline i know what they're trying to do but that was a great play about your own Murphy of getting inside doesn't get block like that by Greg Ellington even if he is the speed of the South Florida defense is just so fast Murphy is this not right out of the West Virginia game last year that crushing tackle one of his thigh also forced the fumble and speaks late in that list Virginia gained a year ago under the gun and throwing it too hard that py Hilton was Paul McCall boy that quarterback clock is ticking fast and he was just a little too hard just a little too early we don't save George so he's named a whole lot because they're blocking great first step you remember James Worthy in basketball high ethics great first step George them look at that off the one that was Bowie Plus Selby can't have it as well but selfies always get in double team they expect Bowie on the other side who has a great first step as well to make some plays Carlos manera on to punt just got it off under the gun that goes off the side of his foot that will be a short punt it will be excellent field position for the South Florida Bulls we're talking about FIU but South Florida has also come from very humble beginnings that's only their 12th season of organized football and for the first 10 years the Ponderosa was their home that story is next South Florida a beautiful campus and they decided they wanted football and that was the coach's office for the longest time Jim 11 higher than 1995 and there he is dressed as the beach stud during the basketball season as he raised money for a friend of the program who was suffering from cancer competed past without side great again that was a nice throw to a jail of 13 yards that's what a beef stud looks like you forever young stud a young calf that's a beef cap on Tim Levitt as we talked to him the other day really has no desire to go anywhere else loves playing in Raymond James doesn't want us raise money for an on Stanford Stadium what you have at FIU very content has a new contract in his hand that virtue will keep him there for the rest of his career Brophy would all they decide to hoof it the most quarterback out of pound after picking up six yards Doug so far before interior lineman haven't provided any precious or Florida or national you talk about South Florida having what they have there at Contra Raymond James but right here you can see no pressure he can fix that he has Mike Ford also exercised notches so they almost like playing them we're going to let you scramble a little bit they come up and strike you but that's given in six or seven yards Grothe now and second down back to my Ford for good he is a big pad back here's to be healthy Quentin Newman trip him up at this kid done when you watch him and as we've watched him on tape go home boy no runs downhill we say he has fresh leg been out for a couple weeks just good blocking by the lines you know white Derby push him back but also some individual effort by my sword he has a great ability to neck and get those extra yards after he's been hit third in short the ground and another first down Mike Ford Cristobal as I Fenton office yesterday bucking talked to him and he an old offensive lineman himself and he just kept bragging about the Southport office is lying if he said they're really good they've been tested Doug and we've seen him over the last few years I've had a chance a couple of years ago to watch them against Louisville their comingout parties and I've watched a lot of these women like mark dial and Jake Griffin grow up my schoolers so it's interesting to watch how their plan now so much better even than when they were younger guy myford getting some serious lease third straight carry this time over the right side Scott Brian I'm a stop for FIU but the key would calm for there was how they finish we've seen them over the last couple years play well early on but that's the one thing yes Jim Leavitt you talk to other coaches around there how do you finish and they haven't done that over the last couple of years and that's what he talked about we have one more big second down for guilty who has all day opened jesse hector he'll never be more open and who was there in the middle to field 19yard pick up what all you folks in remember jesse has two senior at florida state his young son Jesse Jr is playing outstanding and this is the great play they'd like to get him over the middle of the field and then make him work up inside that's just thirteen consecutive game with a catch they have so many different weapons you can see with total yards is going to a lot of different people a lot of different balance also duck that last drive was 99 yards remember this is very impressive as well they're just eating FFI you inside inside the tackles buck I mean this is this looks like mitt against boys the problem is you don't come away with point on the other turnovers and you give up touchdowns and your defense is on the on the field so long so what happens they start over pursuing missing tackles right there Michael Dominguez thought he was in position doesn't make the play but when you're on the field this long it's hot on it right now Nesfield sir brandnew night for trip himself up on the field turf cristobal on the sideline trying to get his troops revved up a bit first of all where's that time blocking we were thinking and brainstorming Howard Schnellenberger is oldschool and actually wears a blue laser as well but I can't think of another collegiate coach Joe Paterno occasionally wears the tie but that's oldschool right that he'll go school and that was the guy that he admired and read about look to for guidance that's what they did he wanted to have a little class he's trying to help this quarter national team come together they're three for three after down conversions and a skits batted down but the flag comes down as well Robert Mitchell why he made a nice play but I think his right hand was on the receiver buck let's see if he hooked him a rubber Mitchell is a stat stuffer he has all the set he leaves the team of tackles holding number 79 the date night I don't do that after distance to the goal first out when interception one fumble recovery one sack but right here you also have a penalty to go with szostak I thought you know that didn't really look like one to me he put his hand back there's right hand he didn't grab Jersey and usually when you grass cloth they call it did a good job of coming around I thought Doug and making the play Mitchell is very long is long arms and some NFL scouts are looking at him the man from Melbourne very active has a pick already this season three blue jerseys for five or standing around as well the first quarter goes by very quickly as factual ate up most of the time on the ground for a year in a country flex their muscles and they report tough here comes fi you just finish 20 of 2008 a day to remember South Florida trying to make it a day to forget today's game on ESPN at ESPN u is brought to you by on ESPN highdefinition to find out more log on to espn.com what a day to be out in the ocean today resp new college football primetime presented by city Matt grupe to the air and knocked out of bounds by Jeremiah whether spirit of citric Hill talked about the versatility of Cedric Hill which is one of those guys that just does a very good job of making himself available in any situation he playing look at the stat track South Florida 12th in the country wearing their Road white ford international playing their first ever game on their home field wearing their blue south florida will call a timeout it's third and goal from the 3 yard line let's go to Lowell Galindo and my god prayed in the ESPNU studio I love Thank You North Carolina boy they are looking very good we did a couple of Carolina games a year ago and Butch Davis told us he thought he was two years away he may he may have it right now well remember there was talk also about him potentially leaving he said I'm not going anywhere he's got they've got some serious talent in Chapel Hill doesn't decimals maybe not the deepest theme of the ACC but those front guys lungs are helping and what he wanted glass you're Doug with speeds and then we talked about let's get speed here again at North Carolina Jamar Taylor lots of speed the fake the Taylor trophy into the end zone it echoes it for free looking for Federer he'll he'll say can up on that play no should tall we talked about bootlegging and Cedric you know just the chance to go to the middle of the field and work across it at the tight end and the quarterback this is the area you know you usually get a chance he'll just couldn't come up with it growth II felt pressure there by Scott Bryant had a chance to get it out just couldn't such a hill couldn't come up with it 20 yard filled all the tests they got my honey boots it through and it's 10 jumping South Florida when our knees got the nod its Kansas Jim Levitt kid it was just a hunch and a hunch and a sniff it air get impressive start for the 12th ranked team in the country the South Florida Bulls for the Big East they flex their muscles and basically just steamrolled FIU and their inaugural game of their brandnew Stadium spin oppressive it really has drugs with the one area you have to look at Florida International is they're often ranked the hundred night total offense in this Princeton double a hundred seventy yards per game South Florida is going to get that probably by the hat maybe usually do so they need to get some office firepower going here quarter in an asset they have we're going to have a chance Justin TG a senior from Palmetto Florida handles the kickoff duties and he boots it through the in zone let's join local endo in the studio for a sports interview in game update well thank you Tennessee had an opportunity with it 17 nothing down inside the 3 yard line and fumbled it away and it appears there chances are out the window as well Georgia at Arizona State tonight the primetime game on ABC of course he told you about Florida LSU Auburn tonight on ESPN and Alabama clobbered Arkansas short completion for FIU maybe from puffing on officers get going coming rushing the ball they're only averaging 61 yards to gain and I keep talking about if they could get to that five yards per carry average but that's almost like a hill in a mountain from them they're only averaging this year 2.3 yards per carry we talked to Bill leg about it because the fifties don't always give you true indication but I think in this case they do because they just cannot get anything going on the ground second down Paul the shuttle path goes nowhere to Julian reigns Tyrone Mackenzie comes up to hammer him we see that some teams that don't do a very good job of running the draw you go to the shuttle shuffle pad but that's in the area right there where he's not running away from anybody the defense can just come and get you right in you are the South Florida defense is so fast but I think the one key person they're missing this year is mofat Ben Moffat was a big playmaker for and as they could in the league play let's see how well they'll continue to play they play some really good games PC up and Kansas we'll see if they can continue out early bird on the sidelines longtime defensive guru watching hissy fit it appears that he gets a nice spot it's an 80 yard pickup looks like it's going to be a first down a river first down for fi years second one other game for but I think when you look at that that's the kind of thing they have to have Paul McCall is a better athlete than you give them credit for we think wally waite younger being the guy that could come to him and be athletic but right there he saw I have nobody open let me go tip that first down 10 for for South Florida two for Florida International first down on the call trying to generate something positive here fiveyear key to himself goes forward for a nice pickup George Selby was so out of position on there him a call saw that and was able to get back around to the other side lost his shoe on that would buck yes top of your screen watch selby come down 95 and he tried to stop and redirect McCall sees that that's the play you want to see when Selby you get it let him go free he doesn't go free so often that he's ready to go and when he gets turned around against V he's a double and triple team this year does he wanted to get 20 sacks and more is going to be tough for him but his offensive coordinator Wally Brennan said he'd find his best football just one sack on the season for the allamerican but he has been triplet gall back to the ground and boy Julian rain he took a shot picks up four I was a jolting head as he hops back up readjust your tip straps talk about a physical game and you'll see the real feed if you want to play football especially when you're planning a Florida kite kite game the speed and the fear but also these players this wasn't talking going on it's a popping as well bill mcclain number 97 got his first start today while he burner said he's finally stepped up his game and there's salty on the outside and gives big number 95 a sack with a little help from his friend on the other side but that was all 95 yeah McCall may be hurt though what's George Selby ones man blocking of just a chance and that's over the top Chris Robinson comes over and just pancake Sabbath tell me that push released off the line able to get by you so fast he got it to his job blocking them and I don't know if Palma calls should be in the game he looked like he took a shot second sack on the season for George Selvi he really got bent head over like a pretzel back to the ground it goes and Julian Reid's another tackle by Chris Robinson it's time for the buck stops here and West Miami buck well you talk about quick first step you see them coming off the line just getting the people before they even know he's there look at how quick he is but also this year he's put on 10 pounds dug and muscle so boy you can't push him around like you said last year sometimes late the bruising we ditch this game right here look how you read the Rex quick high motor guy great work ethic by Jorge Silva quickness is his game Paul has Piratas over sutures man Alonso Phillips Jerome Murphy with all over Philip I like mushrooms I do too and makalah still not slide light from that hip he's still limping when he runs off the field can't quite gather up stuff and throw the ball but Doug you're right this South Florida bull deepest we've seen them over the last couple years make players go wrong Murphy who could shoot all this Carlos Rivera another punt this time good punt from the junior fair catch it to 20 that's herself world starting to get a 40yard punt no return the Sun Belt Commissioner is next the girl went out with FIU in the inaugural game at FIU Stadium 10 to nothing let's go down to the sidelines Wilson halls with the Sun Belt Commissioner Wright waters Melissa Commissioner waters what is the opening of this new stadium means the Sun Belt Conference oh it's huge Melissa because what it does is it demonstrates the confidence that the University of the university system has in athletics and and we're more than just a game it's about leadership and teaching these wonderful things that are only available in athletics what other new additions can we expect in the future I think you'll see us cry at this point in time try to continue to get better and better at what we're doing and we've got good members we have members that are dedicated to the right thing and now we just have to get better at what we're doing and let's make it thank you that thanks Alissa good things happening the Sun Belt and for South Florida Grothe completes another's half to the outside it's the been bushy with a few natural idioms you met from Mobile Alabama the programs will allow Duggan may not see him more sneaks out to the left side gropey once again with all the time in the world you see out there making the catch picking up nine yards the problem with the defense is now the defensive front is really not getting any pressure so Mack Brophy can just sit back and take his time and find open receivers Grothe looks so quick after losing all that way the ground it goes you want peeler sit no gain there that was a good stop by the FIU defense especially up front arm I will accept the tough word is going to tussle on here yeah and you're expected and you can see here the angle of the pond is right in their face I was going to feel before I couldn't even look back that way to the right in your face once it goes down to be better who she was probably in too because Cedric Hill the tight end was hurt on that previous series nothing fancy Jamar Taylor first forward for another South Florida fresh down shot Bryant on the top to the Golden Panthers Jamar Taylor and night for door both sophomores and sort of the power back here to speak on that's a great onetwo punch but then they have three or four other mold planters says they put me in the mix Benjamin Williams says hey I want to play some and then Sean candidate has two rushes on the season so they have a plethora back what they do on first down Dorothy lie open Marcus ed was on the right side remember all season long ESPNU is your source for college football information Monday 7:00 Eastern watch whirlwind oh my god treated Tom luginbill the dis size of polls presented by 76 find out who's overrated who's underrated then Tuesday 1:00 Eastern Lowell hosts coaches spotlight presented by Liberty Mutual find out how all the teams are doing from their head coach their weekly trip shopping and my partner Charles Arbuckle a big part of that show on Tuesday we did 23 coaches this past week yeah I watch in amazement and I'm one of those crazy people that love to hear the coaches press conferences and it helps me as I prepare for a game the Thorogood showed off that quickness thought about riding inside a baby regular good what a 16yard pickup into fi t territory whether Stern out the staff or FIU this is where he's even better you know you want him to use his legs but now he has more speed and quickness and then he was thinking let me get down I don't know just a decent fair the pressure up front he sees the opening to playing man so he knows there's no one to account for and just does a very good job of finding those openings that ball could have got knocked away oh you're going to love it you need to tuck it you do the puck Chuck my cord over the right side I know cords excited about playing again was disappointed with that high ankle sprain working his way through we have again we're live in Miami Florida West Miami to be exact it's the first game ever in the zoo r5u Stadium 12 for South Florida against FIU dumbell along side former UCLA Bruin Charles Arbuckle and Melissa Knowles down on the sidelines now Florida dominating this game look at the total yards I mean that's that's not even funny Taurus Johnson and Anthony Gator a kid rushing up to make the stop very good play by ntral gator and also pours rocket behind toys Johnson guys they didn't do a very good job of picking up in that diamond set going to see here to set up the screen outside if three receivers out front none of them got their block busi is the tight end that's using with Cedric Hill plays when he's healthy didn't get his Rockhampton Gator with a nice play on that screen powerful Mitchell in for USF lower part of your screen dirty looks and him all the way finally gets pushed out of the pocket this road forever long till FIU Seabiscuit's pesky Scott Brown was in there good sacked by there Beatrice also but it took them a while once again Doug to get their growth he has time good pass bro initially the way is too much time and then he's able to move around and they're finally able to bring them down you know that's the one thing about FIU they must put pressure on Grothe good sack there by James Jones Anthony Gator is down back at the 25 and the training crew runs out along with good fist of all to check him Cristobal he told us he's offering these kids an opportunity for something special you know you come in you're going to play right away yeah and as we build a new stadium but every year we're going to add to the stadium it add to our facilities you're going to be part of something was early here quinoa Hilton is a prime example that he was recruited by a lot of people even though he's a little bit undersized an exciting player both to a god returner and receiver but what they like about him is that he wanted to come in and help build this program Gilbert Alvarado into booted away for South Florida and Jeremy Dickens is deep for the Golden Panthers and he's going up this one bounce South Florida will let this roll inside the 10yard line they counted not so FIU struggling already now at the 9 yard line the topranked South Florida Bulls on top of Ford International kidnapping 506 to play Allstate resents burg would onlocation it today we look at the new beginnings the FIU Stadium exciting stuff here on his beautiful campus into the first time there was chill gating outside Sydney did and how about the head coach you wearing a tie not many people do that 14 with Ferb would at burglar would not net verb would is all over the place checking out all the new stadiums around the country all the traditions and they're starting a tradition here at FIU McCall throws it out of bounds and takes a good pop by Craig Marshall and how about that tie could have started last year before they played Penn State they have always admired guys like Jim Becker and Brett ride Joe Paterno so it hit me out of respect a show of class and it kind of stuck well well we talked about it earlier he's trying to build something here trying to have guys hold on to some kind of tradition and I think that's the one thing that he wanted to give the game given him so much the thing they need now is getting there with hoops to fill the stadiums more guys that can help him make big plays especially on offense timeout by Paul McCall as he comes the sidelines again bill leg there's the offensive coordinator at FIU he's been at Purdue or had been in Purdue the last five years and when he did not get the head coaching job he left yeah and as Mario Cristobal told us hey it was a blessing he shows up looking for a job and he was the experience we needed on the offensive side and obviously it's going to take some time it is and now they need players to make the plays that you want to see a mate and I think that's the one area he has two quarterbacks whether you say if you can morph it into one body just make McCall and younger the same guy well he likes me Panza was about him being there and the huddle talking to his god he just doesn't have a whole lot yet us bill right there off to the left old offensive lineman from West Virginia let's get out of the sidelines of course at all you guys thought Anthony Gator go down a couple plays ago he came over to the sideline and he took a knee they were giving him water and what the trainer's told me is that he's just dehydrated it is hot out here guys it is so hot that some of the fans who painted their bodies may be reconsidering because it's melted South Florida yeah it is hey and duck you know let's think about Bill leg he came from for doing before Purdue he was West Virginian have mark bulging so he has seen some talent over his years and that's what they need here for done in action late for hole favorite Don Nehlen at West Virginia back to the ground and going nowhere with its game tackling all the white jerseys around the football can't tell you made that back there's too many of them alright and I'm still worried about McCall I mean he's still messing around and that's where I'm surprised we haven't seen weighing younger who actually and percentages have the better passing percentage than Paul McCall better legs so neither guys really stepped up you're going to see the shot that he took from George Salvi actually this is just recently but even before this that was my Craig Marshall Craig Marshall Russian knocking it really hit them every single chance they get I'm going to be in that ice bath probably tonight certainly tomorrow there's a completed pass we'll come up short there will be one out of four now and third down conversions a complete half Eric purchase Berg is tight in Carlton lawyers on the stop for USF so another punting situation for the Panthers one another one of those outer Staters Carlton Williams out of Valdosta Georgia we called his name a lot over the years as a strong safety position the real key with Florida International getting something now defensively it must make plays because they've been on that field so long and they're a lone liner of a punt killed at the 40 man Marcus Edwards he dodges a bullet this keeps going gets it up to the 37 yarder that was a 40yard punt in a 16 yard return espn.com is your day rate all college sports content from ESPN check out all the way to video and audio highlights podcast live streaming games log on to espn.com today coming up they have low the window coach Gottfried love to hear from the coach is inside rocky times in Knoxville oh boy the blue birds are out for Phil Fulmer ECU's BCS hopes have been dashed and priors first career start at Ohio State brought back memories has been shown looks a lot like it does he does yeah he plays just like dy and Troy editor sub out school playing you know Kyle state today gain of two their for South Florida they've been very conservative today buddy in between the tassels hey pass plays northeast rambling a bit pushes Greg Gregory described to us his outfit is unpredictable as you look at the top quarterback teaches Duffy belong to that elite company I think he does I think the one thing would grow fee if he can continue with the interception the touchdown ratio being where it is on history is 36 touchdowns 30 interceptions this year better ball security movement by the right and left tackle I'm not sure who'll get nabbed for that Sam Bradford though in my mind he is he's a leading candidate for the Heisman right now with Sanchez at USC probably took Leo a glacis Jerome Gresham the receivers he has chased Daniel I really like him but I think Mark Sanchez out at USC because of those weapons in the ad and the defense that they have at USC rosy halo 4 he can run a mile he decides to shut off that quickness and he's going to run out of bags left the smart play no need to take a hit up to the 26 yard line he just looks so much quicker now he was quick last year George in the air he got nicked up but even the best shape of his life but he also is poised and knows how to slow the game down what's the move that he makes right here he has the ball up and it makes the move on whether schools give me Robert Mitchell and it's a subtle thing with him but it keeps the ball up and allows it to happen like that he doesn't average a lot because a lot of those are sacks he loses yards there but still one touchdown 103 yards on the season but what I like about him resistor the little subtle moves that he makes gets people out of position blancher in the backfield too tight in let your moose for just keeps those legs churning positive yards picks up five that's the ugly five yards I plan but he does that plaintiff it keeps the keep moving time but you can move in those feet confer the stable of backs I think this is the game for them which i think makes sense does if you can get a lead and also let all your guys play it in the backfield they need to have this later in the season they need production out of their running game as well as their passing away from a trophy and second down growth in with time to the outside at pester tripped himself up got the first down and this is a good play again look at the time macro key looks inside and comes outside you have Robin Mitchell trying to cover jesse has to just stumbles and falls with the new turk they what they have to do is flick out there you've got to start watering as you get that rubber that from the top down sometimes you'll run and you'll see guys slip down timeout FIU and we have a panther growling from the loudspeaker all sorts of new stuff here at FIU Stadium you look at Jim love it and love it you know here's a guy with that just an incredible run here at South Florida but if he told us hey we really haven't accomplished anything yet I mean people really give us more credit than I think we deserved well and I traced the people and realize this you think of South Florida and when they've been they have everybody now knows him it's like East Carolina everybody's like oh well you know he's trying at it they've been around for a while but now people know that they can come up and play this is how South Florida is W South 42 over their future schedules the Florida Gators Notre Dame 96 players of the roster from the shake FIU 83 and you see the recruiting budget for South Florida the lowest of the bps but the coach told us they are branching out trying to recruit more nationally happy what he's done it competing against the big three in the state they're speaking of the Gators the Hurricanes and criminals they've gotten their share here the last two or three years they really have and he said that's been the key for him getting even more people it doesn't hurt them being in the Big East and the exposure that they've gotten pf2 think Miami Virginia Tech in those schools especially Miami in their own area move out of the Big East and allow them a spot there first instead back to the low plant you touch back hard to bring down Jim Leavitt talking about recruiting told us relating some of the kids were doing a little bit better but we're still bottling that big big call tradition yeah well I mean you look at those two schools Miami at Florida State where they go they left them you know they're landed Coast Conference so that allows them to go to Big East now with some real powerhouse teams losing the biggest last year they're struggling left this year not go through flag down and he throws it away SIU I think as we counted the players I think they had 12 minutes of field but looks like we'll check it up it's trying to get a player often actually got off before the snap and he did not so it'll replay second down little cross up there the coaching staff I mean I'm not blaming on the new stadium but the coaches are on top of the trust they're really dope respond they had the sweet built and yeah but the players are on top they were working out things wouldn't the communication put aside lines at up top earlier stadium is still a win even if it's a work in progress which is my socalled growth II the Oh picked off by Anthony Gator who's back on the field after leading with cramps earlier and Mac both he was trying to throw that ball away but Quinton Newman was bearing down on me out of Cocoa Florida Gator was a nice effort on the tail end and on the ball he tried to get rid of it but that go far enough and Gator look at this going through the sign your name here Gator Anthony Gators my name probably should have had that one it you know what those opportunities to go away against the 12th ranked team in the country they'll make you pay Rosie look at all the way left on one guy and put off the helmet of HEA love well he locked on love what about grossie we watched a lot of tape doesn't go through those progressions he locks on a guy and that's what he improved on but at certain times Doug you're exactly right if the prey is going to a certain place watch his eyes they stay right there they don't move there's one two three defenders in that area not a good area to throw the football sure someone else is open two three defenders of cover and somebody's open somewhere else so South Florida with a side on the field goal grant Gregory who's in there now he'll be the holder and vodka what do you think of this new era a new stadium here in Miami I like it I like it this is a nice University when we drove over the building's there but I like what they're doing here putting some finishing touches on it and really doing everything now they have 16 luxury boxes worth the one in the middle 15 had been sold this will not be sold is there saving for the person who puts their name on the stadium and for the time being we're using this is our broadcast position we're out with the fans great way to call the game and hence hub will be here on the leather couch watching the flatscreen we watch it low galindo coach Godfrey do their halftime show 26 yards and a flag is down to the play he missed it Brittani with a myth and they ran into the kicker FIU so that will be a first down with just 10 seconds to go and bonanni is hurt he's down the green boy they really ran into him well you can't give up opportunities like this you have a chance here looking at the replay he barely touched him dove look watch through me he just flies to try to go get the ball he doesn't even really touch him there's a riot Johnson who comes from the side to try to get the block I mean he barely touched him that's a great acting job I mean it looked like he didn't even really come close to touching maybe his foot Jim loved it now the spot they move that up just outside the four yard line the South Florida uses a timeout of the b47 about a half a yard for the first there's ten seconds to go again as we broadcast here the first ever broadcast from a brand new stadium FIU Stadium in the first phase what we're in right now seats 18,000 there's 1400 Club see those are in front of us we told you about the 19 suite and the Panther Club is on the first floor and it was packed with Panther supporters earlier today phase 2 will take place over the next three years the new field house which will be in the end zone and it will include a huge weight room 13,000 square feet and you see where that open space is that's where the coaches offices will open out they'll each have their own individual patio which we great from recruiting oh yeah and in the weight room Pete Garcia Mario Cristobal they wanted one bigger than the you did you built one over 10,000 square feet so they said by golly we're going to have 13,000 and they're going to put that in it that'll be closing as well and I think they'll have another big screen on the other end where the coaches offices will be you look up they have the structure kind of going up at the top right there those steel beams that are reaching up looks like it will be the perfect place for another big screen in right waters the Sun Belt Commissioner so excited about this Florida Atlantic as a stadium in the works Troy has a wonderful facility you know the Sun Belt and now with more Bowl tieins whitewater's has worked very hard in that area things are looking up for this so Thompson has some impressive wins already this year it really does and that's what you want to look at and then play like today Troy played Ohio State top realtor bonanni shook off that injury I think you're right buck I think maybe a little Academy Award acting on that one at 21 yard field goal attempt now for the young man the hero a week ago and it's yfi you've blocked it Robert Mitchell got in there the block their ball one second to go in the clock tactic this crowd revved up really doesn't like I was just thinking right when this plate happened that's where they had angle the last time and instead of Johnson coming off the end Robert Mitchell does he does a great job of laying out go and get the football and again we talked about Mitchell earlier in us on Scout deliver this guy look at how quick Israel exactly they look for players like him if he gets in the campus and so that he can cover but special teams is where a guy like robert michels you got to get drafted or drafted later to make a mark you're always looking for guys like him that's how he's caster was a gunner I mean was a great special teams guy in plays forever because of that ability blocking doing the dirty work nobody wants doing the dirty work nobody wants to do that good job Robert Mitchell get excited buckles here one of my love the rush the end of the first half the first half ever play to the new FIU Stadium Jim loved it not happy although his team is up K to nothing Ellis joy yoga window with Sports Center you welcome back the ESPNU college football primetime presented by city it's South Florida on top of for international kid and nothing hi folks Doug Bell Charles Arbuckle welcome to FIU Stadium the first time they've ever played is brand new stadium FIU sway inspired football offensively they continue to struggle South Florida with great first quarter buck slow down second quarter yes again I think the real key Florida International piece that can play really well the problem is they're oftentimes giving them anything you have top floor on the other hand the print a methodical game just trying to watch the ball down the field and then we'll keep for them it's just making plays on the ground you can see my Ford getting outside coming back inside for a touchdown a real key play for them and enjoy itself getting a second back on the year that's where McCall John McCall the court if I got hurt and you can see here the block you go another good play by Robert Mitchell and we're against the numbers a really domination by South Florida 218 total yards 240 first down a whopping lead for USF well you kind of expected when you look at this up broad international team their hundred and nineteen for a total office of NP SS they have to find a way to force important make some positive gains and that they can't do that their defense is going to just wear out Justin keke will kickoff herself for to his last kickoff went to the endzone and now he's super he's got a heck of a leg and so siu will start from the 20 yard line and palma call thats existent relating to see wayne younger perhaps the quarterback change will generate a spark fi you need you're looking for something Doug I mean this offense and the seed fence is wishing for it they'll say man we need some help anywhere and if it's not going to be weighing younger the Palma call has to find a way to March his guys down the field the junior out of Hollywood Florida took a couple of nice shots in the first half wearing that rib protection I guess he knew what was coming Selby let him out of his grasp that's just a horse collar loses his helmet mate Allen on the stop hey the buck stops right here at SIU but well you got to talk about FRU bigtime hips like sir that's what you need to have Jerome Jeremih weather school is one of them and then also just talented people flying around they haven't put pressure on Brophy except with a couple of plays and here's one as well making them move and not so comfortable that's why the score is 10 nothing and then also a great block by Robert Mitchum your defense is having to keep them in the ballgame and their plays and special team offensively they've really really struggled through Lamacq Aveo the left tackle for FIU is down on the turf up at the 27 and if there's he perhaps took a chop from behind so they're examining his knee and again Mario Cristobal out on the field with his injured player as he always does and he wasn't even supposed to play this year really him he came in and spring a junior college transfer had had to play right away so they're checking a locked avail you know this is the first game at FIU Stadium and we should mention for South Florida buck tickets for today's game each College in Division one has allowed one premium game where you can raise the ticket prices a little bit for FIU this is one this is their inaugural game 51 dollars per ticket for South Florida that's three dollars more than a year ago when they went to Auburn they had to pay 48 bucks for a ticket of course that's the Southeastern Conference but that's a premium price for this game that is the show their support well the Bulls fans they travel very well they'll bill they'll come and watch the South Florida team and they've been accustomed to some winning ways here in the last couple of years once again not quite over the hump from Jim Levitz perspective of getting to the Big East championship and winning that title they have respect for Florida International regardless of the one loss record they are Florida kids and Jim Levin knows that he says I expect a lots of energy from them there for the kids they'll rise up play as hard just like FAU did a year ago and that's what we see should ask yeah and we did that game we talked about it in depth with him about Florida kids all you know they have the understanding of how they play and how they are going to play against each other as you look at Jim Leavitt the student section which is full behind him eventually that will be the FIU student section as they continue to build onto this stadium but they have the biggest student section in the Big East at Raymond James Stadium 12,500 one students that's a lot of people and they come in full force last week at Kansas some got a little rambunctious set some things they shouldn't have said it really a period at some of the Kansas supporters and Jim Leavitt and other people South Ford have urged the students hey as we build this tradition let's calm down not everybody just a few yeah it makes eventually that sounded like some of the few were even older more mature people wasn't always the student and I think that's where Matt growth we came out and spoke against with Jim Leavitt and some of the other players say we don't need that we need to seal some class against people that come in and play up you see Levites the shirt has turned a different color a darker shade of green and the looked up that lather about 4:30 this afternoon to the ground it goes best run of the day by Julian dreams after 10 yard pickups I mean that's the biggest run of the year is hunting back and Doug I'll tell you what else is nice about this seems Jared buoy trying to get over there and everybody out of position so to speak for the South Florida team what good sug quarter international is only now by 10 points if you get three points to score a touchdown they're right back in the ballgame but Carl from the gun back terrine what was the exchange was trying to pull that out of reigns but it actually brushed against him so at the loss of two you know when you think of Bill wag you thought of sidelines an easy gig over offensive lineman can't miss it you get Purdue block you take a lot of screen yeah a lot of bubble screens every kind of screen of that high screen double split screen ahead of fetal out of that permit model we really haven't I mean we've seen more than zone replay foot from them with the quarterback in the back but not a lot of screen we're trying to implement that there's the fence what they were trying to do though half size say football nice pass that's red either display that's a tenyard check out following their law secured to bring up third down and two and a half now these are the kind of plays here where you have to come up with first down in the first half they did a horrible job good job right there by makalah throwing it low in a way if the receiver doesn't catch an elephant it's a incomplete pass good throw by McCall with the hurt leg that he's playing with 1 out of 5 third down conversions for these FIU Golden Panthers with the velocity run right of the chariot Cooley I mean I was held with a helmet bail denied so much dancing Byron's also if you have that outside Russia coming in and Jerry at Bowie you got to make one decisive cut watch how many clues he makes okay one two three four five now the street this is way too fast so bully and Selby both in coming to hit you at that point greens have to just turn the ball up the field and go get some positive yards he has coaches probably telling they can't dance see he's telling them right that you can't go up in there and that's where you get that first down the leg is offensive lineman he's up in his face well I may get upset when they don't get a first down he played at West Virginia for Don Nehlen his first recruit right yeah the first time it was actually drafted in the USFL by the Birmingham stallion last year it all started to the win at Auburn biggest whip rats in the program's history and then North Carolina they were ranked and they clobbered North Carolina at home the nation started taking notice in West Virginia on Thursday night buck you and I ordered a Saturday game we watched it benefitted company number two in the country oh man for they go to a BCS bowl and it looked great the first of three straight course losses the biggie and we saw him the least a couple weeks before this when they play Florida Atlantic and that's when we kind of said hey are they for real they got exposed late in the season this is what they need to do is close seasons out play better later in the season Marcus Edwards decided not to field that punt and FIU moved on it that's a five and a half yard line a 49yard punt no return Jim Leavitt no smile today so Florida trying to get something going here in the third quarter leading to nothing again welcome to FIU Stadium Doug Charles Arbuckle and Melissa Knowles and Melissa we're standing outside one of the premier sweet premiere place isn't it it's really a nice view out here but I want to check out inside go inside how many fellows you're at off that screen is awesome it is not only the flat screen off and let me tell you what

update I look out for you saw somebody he could feel one of those BCS poll Berea they do Utah maybe a Boise maybe a BYU East Carolina got knocked got bumped off today that he's been shot me at NC State look at the Jessie Hester after struggling last week against Tulane congenital couldn't waste the soups third and short you know South Florida it's just funny to watch them because you said it earlier that is not really the hot Howard office that we shot we see some of that has to do with Florida International making plays when they have to I think if he gets top he is he is short of the first down here deep it's of speed border the national press me to jump right off when I watch complete Iowa and Kansas even though they struggled offensively it got beat really badly this is not the same for than an acetate from a couple of years ago their only issue if they don't get to while Hilton to come back with a long punt return there are offenses doesn't give them any opportunity Colorado back to punt booms one high to the sky py Hilton backed up and let's say go out of bounds at the 47 a 39 yard booth no returns FIU trying to get some momentum on the offensive side today's

something going offensive leaving they'll be right back in the game South Florida after they'd be West Virginia year ago did not play particularly well and beating Florida Atlantic it'll be a fourth down situations they pick up three and perhaps another letdown today after this simulating all the kids the great game against champions were late there that was a prime example Florida International you throw a two yard route there's no chance for you to get a first down but South Florida on the other hand two big games back to back the Central Florida game another bog runner for them the last against the Florida and now they have got to come back and play a rivalry type of game again Romero has been busy steel Wilson it's really pretty six yards on the punt and just three on the return nice play by Alonso Phillips Mario Cristobal the third season here of building this program at fort international his hometown of Miami and as we do every week here it's the coach's crib inside the office a new coach and there's the shovel that blows our ground right here for stadia don't ever tell you guys to get out never you don't have to go home but you got to get the heck out of here enough and look at the books I like that there's this diploma from the U and the last game ever played at the Orange Bowl a year ago they played FAU it was and the book on the outside robert michels hit of thegame paul Galliano said hey look we're going to look at film I was at Rutgers before I know how to played in South Florida ball team the real key is they're coming with pressure with Matt Brophy isn't expecting and that's why they're struggling defensively offensively excuse me for South Florida look at the excitement by the defense and crystal ball I said earlier if they can make the play in special teams or a turnover pick pick something like that on often this game changes right away Dorothy wear that shield will keep himself over to go and he did Russell down by quilting new man the former wall guy there has been a pleasant surprise for this fib fish and he's revved up there has been a shift in momentum Allen has been but you know when you talk to Galliano he said look we watch the sexy film we watch Oregon Rutgers FAU our game last year we've got to figure out a way to make groceries feel uncomfortable it's a bit of a bother right now as he bounces that one that is incomplete looking prevent baby of bogan Hogan Knows for making a gift go grabs but that was in the turf now I'll tell you this if you're kicking the py Hilton you better have to cover this kid can really clock py has not touched the ball on this Saturday afternoon in the inaugural game at FIU Stadium the crowds getting revved up look at Delbert Alvarado then as usual punt formation has a booming kick py Hilton back in 32 his first touched Dodgers the first half of in runs into a stone wall that was a good shot by Corey Grissom 64 yards clawed for the return I will wake up the freshman hi Chris Robinson cleaned it up very well hello welcome welcome he won football they're revved up at FIU Stadium they like their team to soar and really make it interesting after the offense now drug dollar Charles Arbuckle back here and West my auntie Giuliana lien has been to work house workhorse tonight raff I you let's go to the buck stops here well what you have to have is great play and pressure you're going to pressure Matt gropey you better come from all sides great job there by Robert Mitchell and then also again whenever he runs you have a spy usually but everybody has to rally damn at gopis Mario Cristobal has to be happy with this defense of special teams not so much within office quickly and it caught we fumbled that around a little bit prior city almost dropped is it there's a USF player down and we'll check that I think they hit each other you see Bruce Ross smile premier 53 and the Carleton Williams that look like looks like the other player yeah we will check that Carlton williams and Bruce mom premier are down and Premier got hit right in that right in the neck area you know sometimes get that stinger and it really shocks you but we don't wanna guess what it is we will check both players a double catch then and you went down immediately grew smile Premier Carlton Williams hope he's alright both players are still laying down on the ground and the medical team taking a look at those two young men mom premiere a senior from Miami was excited about coming here and playing that's a good sign if he moves his right arm and his feet are also moving and the crowd in the end zone night saying some things perhaps they shouldn't if the two young men are being looked looked at an area sitting up that's a good sign that the mom came here sitting up actually that the mom premiere is still down Carlton Williams being helped off the field and he is moving gingerly to the sidelines it is a beautiful evening here again West Miami were close to Coral Gables where the University of Miami is located and if you're familiar at all with the Miami area we're not too far from Doral where the wonderful Golf Course is located and they play the big World Golf Championship event there it's just about 10 minutes or so from where we are this campus at FIU just like the one in Tampa South Florida its sprawling here's a lot of acreage yeah and there's ton of students and it's beautiful but really it really is I've been very impressed with our stay here in South Florida as you talk to Chris Duvall who is building his program virtually from scratch Don Strock the great quarterback from the Miami Dolphins and Virginia Tech was the original coach and they ran into a few problems along the way with the ncdoublea and when they made the coaching change now crystal ball trying to rebuild it as we look at the top 25 there you see Georgia will play later tonight on ABC Kirk Herbstreit was on this morning College GameDay in Auburn Alabama and takes the private jet the ESPN jet out to Tempe Arizona where Georgia will take on Arizona State tonight and Auburn and LSU six and ten play tonight on ESPN I think George will do well out there and Arizona but the one thing and it's been mentioned and I did I thought about it earlier this week but it comes more to fruition it's very hot even at seven eight o'clock at night and then you can see some of the other folks South Florida number 12 Ohio State that struggled today a little bit of destroy Wake Forest at Tallahassee that's the espn2 this evening a huge game is Wake Forest tries for the hat trick three in a row against Florida State you know you look at South Florida as we look at the final five and Fresno State on ESPNU later tonight and South Florida in my mind obviously today for the kids against Florida kids one of these cross state rivalries certainly the FAU could just so fired up to play South Florida but I think the Bulls I know Kirk Herbstreit said and I think you said it also I think they're the favorites in line to win the Big East I agree I think they really are Bruce mile from there is still down there trying to get like the EMT out yeah they are now they will come out and they will put the collar on him and they will lock down that head in the neck area and put it on the board we have seen his legs move in his arms move which i think is a very positive sign in recent years they really become more cognizant of not moving and making sure everything is stable but he is moving his legs as a precaution here comes the rescue team out onto the field we saw the Auburn youngster same thing happened a week ago in the Mississippi State game and they carry him off Phil went for xrays as a precaution had the sprained neck and he will play tonight against LSU some of the things they worry about or some of the delayed effects of any kind of trauma looks like to his head where the area where he got hit he's been moving his legs are moving but they just want to make sure everything is okay both coaches are out there Mario crystal ball and Jim Leavitt again that's Bruce mom premier the senior from Miami and they are taking every precaution when it involves the head or neck region they will not take any chances whatsoever and now is the time that you say a prayer and you hope everything is okay with this young man senior out of Miami Edison High School and one of the young men who were so excited to come back here and Wally Burnham the longtime defensive mastermind of not only the South Florida defense but those at Florida State when they want a national title back in 1993 absolutely loves this kid and you know he's he's one of those kids that is Wally said he just comes to work every day I mean he's ready to go he said he and you don't have to worry about it said his motor just never stops and he's always asking questions of how to get better you well again as they put him into the full preparation in the hands of the medical team they will take him immediately to the hospital where he will get xrays and the players you look into his teammates eyes and even those eyes are the FIU players and you were obviously a great player in your own right Charles when this happens I mean you have to go back out yep it's one of those things you know you hope the best your teammate but you have to go out and keep playing but the other thing is you know even though you're competing against another player you still have concern for his family and everything else so it just concerns you from that you know from the football fraternity perspective all right it's second down and eight 643 to play in the third quarter will be back to FIU Stadium in Miami in just a moment Lowell thank you very much back here at FIU Stadium in Miami Florida and just moments ago Charles I mean this is really what it's all about this new team's coming together to say a prayer for the moment what it should be about we heard before we went to break a bunch of fans yelling some things that they shouldn't have been yelling which was totally uncalled for and if you hear this broadcast you know who you are totally insensitive and I like what these folks are doing all the players and all the coaches from both teams come together this is what it's all about folks well I agree and that's terrific I mean it's that's sportsmanship and even though you want to beat the other guy I mean you have respect for the man across the line of scrimmage Bruce mom premiere now packed into that ambulance and will be taken immediately to the Miami Dade County Hospital and his family now is his mom is walking onto the field right now they're being escorted by South Florida officials and she will crawl in the back of that ambulance well and go with her son she's getting all the details and there's the medical staff telling her what they know and the dog just once again you know both teams all coming together and that that's his mom Anna and the play one more time mom premieres 53 and gets hit right at that awkward angle Carlton Williams also was shaken up he has since walked off the field so his family is concerned they're there and they're letting them know what's what's going on appears his mother has decided she will they have notified her they will give her a ride obviously to the hospital or at least she can follow and she's decided to do that his sister Jordan is also with mom Anna and again at this moment the game is totally secondary to what we hope will be an excellent diagnosis Jackson Memorial Hospital is just a few minutes away and Bruce mom premier will be taken there and there's also a trauma center nearby here and that is also at the hospital so that is an excellent place for him to be going as they strapped him down on that board with his helmet on and we said it before buck but I think it's appropriate to say a quick prayer and and hope everything is okay with the young man and he will be taken off and we hope to have a report before we go off the air tonight certainly we will follow Bruce mom premiere to the hospital and keep our fingers crossed as we resume action it will be third down in three or FIU is they trail the 12th ranked team in the nation here you see the South Florida family the fans action you can do Paul McCall as the quarterback has gone the distance one out of seven third down conversions for the junior from Hollywood Florida cokecake know where to go and even know man when he grows up and I was a bad pass it get stripped off South Florida will take over at the 48 Jerome Murphy on the pick great pressure by period moon he just stayed after we talked about george snell v so much and you got it Jerome Murphy has to just go shake jarred buoys hands he almost has him there for the sack he stays after it keeps that pressure going the call you can see him throwing off that back foot he really can't settle even when he's in the pocket because it wasn't hurting fix the first half you see him throwing off of that back foot easy interception you have five defenders in that area so the field position game has now changed in favor of South Florida that was a bad mistake by McCall back to the ground it goes for the claws will go down Jamar Taylor finally just goes out of bounds it's a first down picks up 14 yard race play design also Jonas Morel Morel was on the outside as he N and when that fake came he just went so far inside and missed the time of total crystal ball talking to his quarterback telling him you've got to throw that out of bounds you need to put that ball away back to Taylor looks like the same play break the tackle Reiter is rarely seen by Jeremiah whether Stern who came close to grab a face mask that was a 20 yard scamper Doug so much time is prepared to stop macro fee that you forget about the running back see everybody goes with gropey and you see it that hesitation a good blocking right there just enough such a chill over there there could have been a hole right there on Carlton Mitchell but everybody goes one way with Grothe and it opens up holes and lanes for Jamar Taylor on the other side back at their effective same place three times in a row and again he bursts for four nice gage Dominguez on the tackle picks up six that's 14 Claudia stay and you know who also are there Cedric Hill watch number nine he's been discreet going to lead guy right on the but he committed and strong for running back three separate plays what's it good for hey why not just keep going at it as your murderer until you stop it we're going to run it now reg reg reg he's going back to little army days in the hole first of all Day 2009 yard Greg Gregory spent 16 years the offensive for datatron Florida at army when the cadets will run at that bone and run it over everybody that was their most successful spent excited to be good the other day when we talked about the risk only Jim though finally they stopped it a little different formation but the same play and finally they said not that play again no Ryan Martinez comes up with a 5 let it down I like this Drive because finally South Florida after getting a turnover decided hey we're going to run the football they found a way to attack that beach at the line which has been sold out against Matt Grothe and they're using him as a decoy in a sense every single time second cannon goal marked error the Bulls are really touch identify you in the mouth right now Marshall McDuffie saves a touchdown and I mean this is just down and dirty well lit in your face get out of my way football left giving credit to Jacob Sam J Griffin Matt he knows and Ryan Smith the guys up front are really key in that play mark doll also he's gone the back side but I tell you they just come off the football and just pound it for international there's the wishbone look from Gregory Mike for try first second touchdown haven't seen the signal off the football fi e says they have it they certainly have the football right now no signal line Martinez came up with the football but it looked like he was dead it if I knew off Mike Ford lost it he's pleading his case that he was down on the turf the initial vantage point from here's I've looked like he was down and they will review this play let's watch it box right here that angle doesn't show it the ball he he's fighting for extra yards and then when he reaches down hits his elbow he's down on the ground and the ball Bend comes out he has the ball even after he goes down here yeah watch this replay and it's blocked off but watch the continuation and the ball comes loose there is already laying on the ground behind and his elbow who are all down this will give you a good definitive look I think he goes down there he still has the ball then it comes out after the fact yeah that will be overturned I think that's pretty definitive right there he's laying on the ground and now the ball splits free but a case in point you're always taught as a receiver or running back trying to hold on to the football for eternity we had coaches that will come and try to strip it out even when you're on the ground because back then there was no replay once they call something it was stuck and I think the players now sometimes depend hey you know I can show you the ball but if a guy comes and knocks it out and they don't find a definitive answer they call it a fumble on the field it could kill George it's right there in the 77 Jake Griffin legs you could fit he has the ball then the ball comes out like he was just fighting the stretch a little bit more really not allowed to push great effort by Florida International again of forcing him back inside but there's no one there some of that Doug is not playing for the last two weeks speed of the game and it was a few minutes ago when Bruce mom premiere the linebacker for South Florida was taken off the field we saw him taken off by ambulance but they did bring in an emergency helicopter outside FIU Stadium there it is and they loaded la première onto the helicopters have taken immediately to the trauma center which is nearby so the medical staff and their local hospitals were right on top of it but that's great news the sooner you can get them there get the xrays and find out what exactly is going on the better especially when you're dealing with that's final column injures what you think perhaps aren't that you know his situation and anything with a head or neck trauma they have now been taught this really take care of it as quickly as you can because like I said before some of the aftereffects and the longterm effects are predicated on what you do initially coach's challenge is taking a while they're still having those issues they're having an issue with a hat I have to actually go to sidelines to get on a telephone because the headset is now working upstairs with a replay official first game of the stadium involves obviously some bugs in the system don't you think if they don't get it right Jim leverage is going to run over there like his pregame strength well I'm not sure how they would want to be the one to tell booth I'm not sure how they could not get arrived because it was pretty obvious that he was down on the ground when the ball came loose and our officiating crew is a Big East crew that Dennis Hennigan if you watch a lot of Big East games and we call Big East games he is one of the top officials in the league looks like he was clearly down see the ball right there isn't even out yet and there finally comes free and he has been sprawling the ground for at least a full second Douglass leave this also it hockey Lee had a call last week and he got in lambasted by San Diego fans they should at least he came out and apologized for and I give the guy a lot of credit for that it's not easy doing this job we've guys you know they get it right but when they don't people let them know but clearly here you have a challenge of in effect where the ball comes out way after he's already down I think it's going to be reversed it'll be fourth and goal for South Florida and Jim left he's waiting to run I'm telling you soon as they make the call if it doesn't go his way he's running over here that last replay we showed in our guys are put together a nice group of replays for the replay officials and again the ball came free after he had been laying on the ground he Griffin he was already mochi hey he was down that's Jake Griffin the Senior Center he's been around the block a few times and they're just a making sure Dennis Hennigan to love it he's not the hash mark now if you go get closer and closer but it clearly showed that he had possession of the ball it comes out after he's on the ground and I think you're right bug Mike Ford injured in the last carry of the very first game down Florida got antenna Steve Martin his first action sensing I think there's a little rim rust Jim my group talking to Carl Franks who is a head coach at Duke in North Carolina and now has settled in as the running back coach at Southport I mean Jim Levitt has I got a staff he really does put some people together to really help him and they also help and recruit you guys have experience in other places and they've done a very good job of getting talent they've been working Florida very hard but he even said we're going to start expanding one up in the Georgia now who's watching some other places Jim Leavitt the only head coach in South Florida football history let it tasting and once again if you're watching this game on ESPN HD which they have here these premiere Suites and it is an incredible way to watch a sporting event it gives you more of the camera you can see more and those folks with HD can see that replay in attendance pool as clear as a bell and again but I'm not sure why this is taking so long I mean I know they were having problems communicating upstairs but it's pretty obvious in our replays that he was then yeah I mean I keep looking at it I can't see wise wouldn't be that way and finally we're going to get a call here after if you the runner was down before the ball came loose there is no fumble on the play Florida's ball fourth bound at the 1yard well Cristobal didn't like it but when he sees the replays well and also what it doesn't do justice to the Florida International folks it took so long if they made a decision sooner that would've helped hi great Gregory Ward Army coach has to add that risk oh look look out tight they are the offensive line Rosie keeps it himself that was fourth down if I said they stopped them they kept it out of the end zone Cristobal is I heard up backwards flanges where the show pipe in the helmet the coach wants to play I'm surprised him getting chefs Martinez oh wow but that's the Incipio he really told you well the temple combs room coach Cristobal I like it that was Jonah's Mireles only 350 pounds and put him in the quad things up and he did really got underneath and submarine and you can see all those big guys finally the defensive tackles did a very good job of getting pressure Matt Grothe a strong guy maybe that 20 pound weight loss hurt him instead of help them on that play so from the half yard line are you throwing out of their own end zone as they completed a rare salacious call McCall the Greg Ellison five yards hiccup that's a huge plays when you attacked us what the heck let's go down to the sideline look at all the awesome Jocasta clothes first of all in that time he told me extremely pleased with the way his entire team played during that first half but particularly the defense now he wants them to take advantage of these kind of opportunities and learn to control the ball let's see if what they learn Melissa second down is when it almost a bad snap and then the call fought better than to hand it off and it keeps himself that that could have been ugly Doug I just don't quite understand either when we thought we'd see Wayne younger nothing against Paul McCall but he's not able to run the football he's caught there he made a great spot good one hand catch but he's really cannot run if he has to and in this area where that defense is coming after you with Gary at Bowie and George Selby this is the danger area for this Florida International offense he saw Bill link on the sideline he's the guy that looked like the old offensive lineman the big guy there call it in the play on third down now if I you the call has plenty of time keeps it himself it will be fourth down six up five about six inches short Leon Wilson on the top of the bull so what Selby goes down and he's limping off see the problem on that play the reason why guys got hurt Tyrell MacLean got hurt also they were hitting each other it was so many white jerseys around that that's how you used to get hurt we call it friendly fire and football guys on your own team when they come in and they come to hit you they may sometimes close their eyes and pound you instead of the ball carrier they bring out to change then they will measure and just inches away I think you got to kick this football away you can't take it and your quarterback doesn't have any legs you can't run now you're going to see at the very cell layer George Toby what I said about friendly fire look at all these white jerseys around and somebody a lot of times these guys are applying for the football close their eyes and they don't see and they just itchy we can fit up in that top tell me you see him on the sideline checking that ankle out manera his seventh punt of the day a 35.3 average so far the first stick not a bad kick out to the 50 Neil Wilson to Percival and he loses yardage on that return I was a 35yard kick a 4yard on the negative side return all season long the FC your source for college football information Monday 7:00 Eastern is Rosalinda coach Godfrey time Louisville the best in recruiting it's called inside the polls presented by 76 and they'll all and my partner Charles Arbuckle coaches spotlight presented by Liberty Mutual Tuesday at 1:00 Eastern remember your place for everything college sports is ESPNU dotcom video audio highlights podcast live streaming games and a whole lot more ESPNU dotcom Matt Grothe and the bold on the reverse Dante via program with the four o'clock restrict the great from if it gets tied up at the 34yard lines on who else but Robert Mitchell a 19yard pick up but even he that heck of a game well Dante via bogan they're supposed to have the best hand but he showed some speed right there though getting around the outside and you know what I like about the last Drive and so far now they're not allowing that Grobe to take those extra hits we talked about it earlier with Tim Tebow you expose your quarterback to too many shots if you run them too much and too early in the season becomes the Blitz on the outside coming in to make that tackle is Jeremiah Witherspoon and down on the ground is Ryan Schmidt on get left tackle he comes up how would actually hop it on one leg looks like you got an ankle rolled whoo boy then bulls are really going down here in this third quarter and he'll try to just shake it off and stay in the game he's trying to shake it off but if you're the defensive lineman and they actually are throwing the football in this instance Jonathan Jackson the freshman ought to be thinking I got a god I can't protect against me if I'm coming off the edge well he set up this game or the first down 15 euros in German Williams 20 ours on the screen pass those Araya Johnson on the stopper fiu but not before a big game good job by Protheans is waiting for Benjamin Williams because everybody is coming after him they really didn't set up a true screen he checked it down got to go with the top and allowed him to get down the field and that's the end of the third quarter it has been an emotional third quarter with Bruce Maas right here South Florida going down and going to the hospital and then the big goal line stand a fumble recovery gets Cristobal all revved up with one quarter to play it's the start of the fourth quarter FIU Stadium in Miami Grothe to the outside and first judgment evaded the first tackle Evan Anthony Gator gobbled him up picks up one with Taurus Johnson as a guide at the pitch slay player form and I was expecting to see him play a little bit earlier and really get a chance to watch him but if he doesn't just the ball early because he tends to kind of coast and get upset that was a nice catch for him but man he can make a big play for you to me grossie see those eyes through the shield within the proton wideopen fountain just Cedric Hill reason he couldn't get it there went Newman was coming off and really stopped him from throwing that ball to feather Jill let's find out the condition of the allamerican George Shelby Melissa songs off the field limping toward the in reserved quarter when he came over to the sideline they examined his right ankle they loosened his shoelaces did they had him stand up and try to put some weight on it he limped around on a little bit and then he sat back down now they've ice it and taped it up so I'm not sure if we're going to see him come back into the fourth quarter yeah that does not look good that's usually what's doing you get one of those high ankle sprain you keep a shoe on keep it from swelling off and if there that I forgot I part of the ankle now third down here comes the Blitz everybody in the kitchen hey rookie first out of there I checked his hand for the three yard line late flag late hit as they pounced on the quarterback Anthony Gator on Scott listen to this is what he brings to the table for me they last week he did it with his arm and now this week he's doing it with that the declarant leg on the ground he has a maintaining London to make people miss get real late hit right there Jonathan Betancourt Ellis that was really late yeah that was uncalled for it that would helmettohelmet late and trophy is hot but he was a fiery competitor to the penalty different they're not a whole lot world international with more in South Florida and a timeout FIU so you want to they want to make sure they have the right guys in Jonah's Morel big thriller 50pound defensive tackle they need to get in there he's a run stopper remember coming up after our game it's Fresno State 25th ranked pulled on take it on Toledo at 8:15 and in touch in film and I've got games because he hands kill them but they love their football they're passionate that's a good rivalry by the way third tonight Tommy you college football primetime presented by Citi want to get football on today tonight called 100 the Carl Frank talking to Matt Grothe Frank's this was C Spurrier for many years and then was inherited job at Duke and they're not listening that North Carolina but up met just Duke one of the very experienced and talented coaches on this South Florida staff loved talking to Carl Frank and he just good oldfashioned football coach many customers the midnight oil watches tons of tape loves it shot that video you're the coal I've been William that's called running behind your pads I mean he just laid the bull and when you run behind you pass Ben Williams has been hurt watches look at the legs and look at the legs right here hey it got Bryant by surprise he couldn't even get his pads underneath them to stop Benjamin Williams with a low center of gravity at 5:17 two pounds delivered the blow he's a teddy didn't score my court now in for Ben Williams there was movement first from the FIU defensive front and the Pattillo was drawn off by South Ford I think it will go against FIU neutral zone infractions number 93 on the deep ice I don't guess after this is critical second down Ricky Booker knocking to make it go to the other way can't do that in college now maybe you could have got away with out in the NFL but not in college when you jump in that zone and again for the double type or his second touchdown of the game tonight for gold on top 16s we got a Tucker act is the official well Paul Galliano was saying that these were the two guys he was worried about being Mike Ford and Ben Williams he thought they would be back this is good oldfashioned power football here the white jerseys pushed the blue jerseys into the end zone you're going to get six points every time on that mic for the young man from Sarasota and he came out one of the common running back from this state originally founded Alabama the extra point is good Mike Shula you really like Mike Schur and went to prep school I want to come back home to Florida now he is a bona fide star for these sound portables so just a stone's throw from South Beach the game brought to you by ESPN highdefinition and I'll show you what there's nothing quite like South Beach but who's out there man cutting rug I think they still called cutting rug okay Rick Baker our staff guys last night they stopped doing that they stop calling it that if you got asked to go was way what he saw that what Rick was doing last night there was dancing well there's no smell few meeting today it's funded in South Florida South Florida bold Nally 17 nothing he's short of cook yet got everyone so excited py Hilton is what he touches everybody gets turn he has the ball just a friendly bump at the end from Lewis gasps yet but right here this is the excitement that everybody here at FIU has for this young man great speed got a late hit there walks a little bump by Lewis gets it one thing about him is that they need to get him the ball in space and I want to see them use him like a dude Burt Reid at Florida State or Preston Parker you got to get him incorporated new quarterback Wayne younger now checked in 1302 to play in the football game first time we see this young man go Beach to the outside flag down they'll bring that back elzar hold will mop the vial 30 had a whole bunch of Jersey on reference yeah watch 51 but junior Marines finally with some running just a real good burst got away from Jarrett buoy you're not going to see though that was a takedown right there at the top of your screen but Reims finally decided to run the football effectively and when he got that opportunity there was a takedown by Martin Vail that they didn't really even need so that nullifies a very positive run and one more look there's the FT one right there on Carlton Williams I mean he has him grabbing him and he's keeping with the WWF Oh whew that was a textbook hole that's the kinda show preseason meeting here at home and back to the banner goes degenerates who goes nowhere Selvi is not back in the game looks like he's crease of the evening the allamerican who rolled his ankle Marshall in there getting some time now they took off my veil again for a hole he had Jerry Bowie on him and Bowie just got around he reached back in almost 4000 second of 15 now Wayne younger got a lot of play a year ago they broke a long losing streak with a rant against North Texas with Season Finale regula nice game and that's what he brings the table exactly has wheels they want him to be more efficient in the past the area but this is what he can do for you and for a South Florida team that likes to run and overcommit sometimes he makes the difference now whether we talk to up with Bill leggy says stay in choice down third amid is second and short they haven't been that way most of the day and that's why they've struggled to gain yards with playing younger on that play Doug he gets in third and six which is more manageable than third and 15 just to play from the sideline only four first downs of the night and a tough time with the snap gets close to the first down Joseph Sabbath Joseph with a stop fiveyard pickup talking to Phil leg the velociter coordinator talking about close quarterbacks they both have strengths that I'm trying to get one of them to be a complete guide like just melt the two of them to one body but you can't do that no and that's always the difficulty when you get to a new situation you don't have a quarterback attorney for the office that you're trying to run looks like they're going to go for which I think is why at this stage of the game it's a must and it appears that he's got the first dent it will be very close but I do think he's searching Africa bar because here right on the mark here in the Premier suite ESPNU premier suite and that's what he brained Wayne younger he waited he was able to get around and he was able to show how he could move over to the side and get that first down there's another player down and look again there is no press box here at FIU Stadium they will build that at a different time and so we're in a Premier suite right just 50yard line and I guess it's for now the ESPNU premier swinger they were going to bring us some popcorn we're going to be like the fans we've actually been highfiving the guys there's a USF person here FIU so we've been into the game trying to call our game flat banks flying around us but we're okay and there is no cover we weren't sure because there was rain in the forecast but thank goodness it did not rain because we've got a little wet yeah please go to cover it was been hard to go in and call it inside but we'll be back another injured player this one not serious fashionable that ESPN you college football presented by city whatever your story is your city card can help write it because city never sleeps this city stays up pretty late at night saywhat especially at South Beach back to the ground game after the first down from the younger they go to Julian rain there for the fast track Florida has nominated from the getgo that's what we expected especially in the rushing department and we expected those kind of numbers overall si UD starters mightily on offense yeah I just thought on that play Doug they would have let Wayne younger make the play fake to Reims to pull it out there was no one on that backside he would have been still running having helped pull that bar out and a bit for the moment whether he made the break he's going to get rid of it is hot now he's junior feel his first catch true freshman from Miami Wayne younger can be for you move around and while we're in the break I'm going to tease George he'll be taken off younger keeps it himself and gets another first down that's two in a row first time tonight they've had two in a row and the allamerican leaving on the cart next weekend peace take on the cares not a good thing they've bought quite a few players a lot of guys have been shaken up throughout the whole day well he gave the student section the signal that he was okay we shall see those ankle injuries there's not a lot you can do for it six first down to the night and I replay by yet Jarrod Bowie just jumped too early and then a late flash came here yeah fully off died and yet the holding penalty to so these should offset all day number 78 on the offense offside number 90 on the defense the penalties offset first out those are the kind of penalties that kill you if you step by you you get them off sides you get a free plate Jerry Bowie comes off he's ready to go and then you hold them on the other end of it just does not help you Dustin ships him enough God so first down all over again Wayne younger Oh comes in that'll be passer officially holding by Jerome Murphy looking for Greg Ellington haha I was pretty obvious to Doug hold it here but then you also have it down the field and push and you can feed you all Murphy he got beat and when he did he tried to fit tried to stay and all he could do is push his receiver down this makes you think like I said I thought we would see weighing younger sooner and he's brought a spark to this offense they have struggled to score so I can't they need to come away within these three but for sure if they can get it stuff FIU has not experienced enough at the touchdown so far this season and a flag down I think Bowie jumped the gun a little quickly the area Julian Reed faculty well that's the judge'll with the collar could be a costly nice for the corporate bull that's what we talked about a lot of guys have gone out Bruce mom premiere we don't know what the significance of his injury is but George Salvi ankle Terrell McClain looked like he was limping with the lower leg ankle or shin and another slide this time the right tackle store FIU moves so that'll be motion again Alice jegi enjoy LJ again he moves too quickly he's a little he's flinching his little gunshot so he's been jumping him well the other thing is you can almost say well it's a new quarterback but he's been in for a while so it's not the quarterback you've got to hold your water and you got a positive thing going here now stay Wayne younger can make that first guy miss he's been doing well at that so stay in hold your water coming up a little bit later on we'll turn a game in progress Fresno State against Toledo on ESPNU our primetime Saturday night contest for is NFI City that game will be kicking off momentarily injuries are part of it a year ago the week 17 a country injuries really a huge part of that threegame losing streak for South Florida younger shows the ability to get out of trouble in their report equate younger and we are sold some good news The Associated Press they're here tonight covering this first team ever the FIU Stadium they reported that before Mont clean air was putting put into the evacuation helicopter that his hands were moving the reporter reported that to that is very encouraging this we saw some movement here so that's good to hear that it happened also table but getting back to that last play Wayne younger after one thing they on him to be they like to get rid of the football a little bit quicker hasn't carried offense early in the games falls forward for a gain of two as you look at the sidelines in South Florida not only sufficient 11 but while he burned him if he puts a career Vader and he's been in his business only for 42 years he's old school man he's always Cokie coaches every play what does Bobby Bowden save object answers they act alike you can't talk over for the game even they have their game face all during the week they joke and laugh with you on game day you better leave those guys alone Wally and revved up a desert him and Mickey Andrews and the same staff which preserve from nine years Miller had his man and just missed it speaking of Birnam he told us he said hey I told our grad assistant chef those darn things off he didn't say jars by the way it's time to go to work I don't even know how to turn on a computer I still used to grease board hey what did I say Doug a few years ago he can write the book on how to stop the spread who came to visit of Ohio State Colorado Minnesota with a whole bunch of other schools they want to know how to do it he said the main key stops the quarterback you stopped him on those top I so read drive plays or die plate that's the key he go right amok one day I'm telling you let's get rid of 40 yards deal by you on the board it gets plenty of leg into it and it's no good wide right the shutout continues for Wally Burnham and the 12th ranked balls is Miami's they lead a 17 nothing Jim lemons Bulls 12th in the country have dominated this affair tonight and love it now talking to Wally Burnham some costly injuries for the Bulls we don't know how serious but they lose their allamerican who leaves with an angle sprain George Selvi and their senior linebacker Bruce mom premier has been taken to the hospital we've heard reports from the AAP that things are okay that's all we've heard with Otis say anymore as they come games are Taylor fiveyard pickup I guess we should say encouraging news with a movement of the hands reported by The Associated Press you know Duggan I'm talking about East Carolina losing earlier today you have to look at what they lost Quentin Kopp Patton the linebacker that makes a big difference or Selby misses any significant trial that can really hurt the South Florida Bulls I don't think people realize how important a player can be in and Bruce Mountaineer we don't know the extent of his injuries are so they've lost them some bigtime players on their defense second and long now Robi will keep himself out will continue run to the clock picking up three remember coming up immediately after our game we will check in with Fresno State and Toledo all presented by city and I can't wait to Allen Fresno State very good I've had a 12 now on third downs the South Florida Bulls it is to have Mike hoard back in the lineup tonight he is out of an ankle sprain the last two games didn't even play against canvas good looking for would be black and using the area of a hold and I think that will be called on Jesse fester I think also Ryan Smith he was out there holding Quentin Newman and he goes right over to the officials and try to plead his case will get growth he there and lost 18 pounds since the spring way to get in better shape up coming in T state knocks off East Carolina today that's on the you next week at at NC state without cell V and others who knows that they're going to be back that's a traffic for dangerous game for South Florida and kind of what I said before how they finish the season is really important where they start off song the last two years but haven't been able to put things away late in the season if they're going to win the Big East title they've got to be prepared to really get apply it to the outside they're going to go back out of bounds at the 31 a flag down back at the 38 yard line and I tell you what though even if this comes back he is exciting to watch The Legend of T y Hilton he was Allstate football all stayed in basketball when he was 12 years old Jose Canseco 3 Jose Canseco here at a softball game charity softball game buffet family picked up a man picked up a bat hit a home run at Canseco said whoever is listening needs to sign this kid to be his agent he said I want to be lazily become famous I mean he came to Phi U because he wanted to build up helped build a program good one thing he does well he's catch and go and look the Block in the back you saw it in your screen but he has the ability to get outside and really make something exciting things happen he ran from the other side of the field and had he been able to get by one player he would have scored has that block in the back not happening so quickly the thing that I want to see with him is this is the ball in his hands an open field haven't seen it no we haven't seen a new player returns that's it I mean it's a short throw but let him run he's got some Eric net captain Eric Metcalf was just like that you give them a little crease and he's done good where am on med 8yard pick up one more nonconference game for the Golden Panthers at Toledo and then they get ready for the Sun Belt North Texas licking their chops they lost a fire year ago they'd lost 23 in a row the Golden Panthers that knocked off North Texas in the season finale they're anxious verify you to return that GFI powder to the rear younger has a strong arm to go sometimes too strong a couple of throws and with hot that's the one thing they want to work with him on his ability to get some of that touch on the football coming up next Fresno safe Toledo and they will delay the start of that game to 821 Eastern Time and we'll get you there as soon as we can to add a 12 now on third down FIU golden lane younger came in as a 13 minute market is fourth quarter and just life with it to the outside and that will be short of the first down that's a prime example of what I just talked about the play and you give the guy something when he Jesus easily catch the ball and turn up the flue you throw it too hard you can't do anything with the bubblers basis parson he just was the past but he has no chance to turn it was such a hot another keeps it himself and gets the first down picks up three guarantor for de Jersey at this time she want help them agree neither I know he's been injured and coming back slowly build Eric said that I would think with his explosiveness you'd have them in the ballgame right now he's FIU kids 83 from the state of Florida almost all of them from South Florida you know there is a pride thing going they do not want to be shut out that ball gets patted down as big Chris Robinson for Lilo's motor guys but always the motion and a big play earlier special cleaning real nice tackle Wally Burnham is really coaching him up on the sidelines and he's getting an opportunity to play in the rush in with George Selby out so he's getting the chance to come off that edge and he's Sean your head George's go but I'm going to play my game as well ey Hilton had about two steps on the defendant that's one of those passes where if you play it and you've done it enough in the game you put air on he tried to rifle it in as opposed to letting py run underneath it he had two steps and all you need is that if he puts a little air on it that's six points younger look at that wristband let's decide live then get these guys in the right formation trying to get FIU on the board their first effective touchdown of the year can it come in the final minute from the overshoot Greg Erickson of outside the other thing Wayne younger had had some solder problems but he's really good it's either going to be really really hard or it might be high so they can have it back pretty from an outfit to standpoint for FIU what a struggle this season you see a glimmer of hope Wayne younger is going to give it a little bit of a spark and let's see that they're going to give him credit for saving that at the two yard line 60 yard punt that's one of the night and hustle it down there to save that ball was alarmed though Phillip boy walked the tight wire in this and save that football from going to the end zone great hustle play oh nice oh I'm not sure I'm not sure there I foot didn't touch the end zone he got away with one there well he had it first and then he tried to be dramatic and kind of show a little flair and fall over you should be defending it down but right there through the line from Dancing with the sod back to the ground game in Mike Ford trying to knock off that rusty South Florida gets ready for a road trip to NC State Tom O'Brien is they'll approve as they go along and they were left for dead after the first week of the season you know after South Carolina just plaster them you didn't take most Carolina State would come back and beating for you but that's usually a rivalry game between those do Jorge Silva is back now on the bench which is a great sign went in to get that tape a retake job on the ankle they probably also want to xray up they have that capability here just to make sure there's no structural damage got the shoe off all smiles so perhaps that's a good sign for South Florida I was just looking at the mohawk of Aaron Harris that is a freshly cut mohawk I remember Matt Grothe last year yeah had the mohawk look going I wonder how much you pay the barber to do that are you just getting one of your boys is me I hope you don't pay much go ahead take a lot of flour if moms at home baby why should you do it five pcs in your hands you gotta have confirmed South Florida with the movement forty forty on the South Ward will go to 3 and Oh God and I know Jim Leavitt and he will not be pleased with this performance very sloppy yeah at times dominating and you go back to that Candace game in the third quarter against Kansas they were unbelievable hitting on all cylinders that's such a capable of yeah but clearly not close to that tonight the focus tonight clearly wasn't as strong and I think Florida International had something to do with it also does with how they play defense tonight my board another flag is down everything have become very floppy robber official another stop I'm carrying everything we were talking about that growth evil Rock and he left a little tough on the tire he's got a little curl go there to stop and trying to match the ball and if there's the dump of promo little Aloha Aaron Harris made a mohawk tough to Pro Hawk I mean that is freshly cut huh yes talking to George Selvi he'll be all smiles she'll be a guy who reminds me a lot of Jason Taylor now with the Washington Redskins not sure you can dance like Jason Taylor but you know an undersized heap in the man that gets behind that quickness but most people want now that can really come off the top if I use not get shut out we're on the board with a safety 17 even kidding Ryan Martinez wraps up my course take it any way they can get it they've been won some point you can see Mario Cristobal have to be happy with the defensive effort tonight these guys have really stepped up Paul Galliano said our guys are going to fight hard this is how you do it good pressure now that looked like the office was the defense they just came off the ball it just really got into the end zone did not give Mike board any running lanes on that play so never coming up it's Fresno State in Toledo and as soon as our game is over we will toss it out to that one Jim Leavitt and Mario Cristobal boy they are still coaching and when you sit down to talk to these guys I mean you feel like you can go out and play yeah I mean there is heat they'll make you food up there in motional guys we talked 11 on Wednesday and we talked to crystal ball yesterday in his office and these guys then they're passionate they love the game so much and I think they are the perfect coaches for their respective schools well it doesn't hurt if you think of Mario Cristobal and some of his influences Butch Davis was at Miami now North Carolina Greg Schiano who's built the program from scratch at Rutgers he played and has been around Larry Coker as well the South Florida chooses you could punt or kickoff they choose to kickoff why not Justin teaching really versatile py Hilton another return loses the football put your benefit more and got its identity the tough guy I like to let's join the studio for sports in game update a funny to get their first offensive touchdown 50 yards on the play rocking this Carroll because he leaks out at every time he touches the ball he seems if his makes could happen and right here in the middle of the pool in man coverage who catches the ball and just goes with a great block right there but he's just an outstanding player to watch and if they can ever get him the ball of space he's going to be a tough guy to bring down so when younger FIU looking to get in the end zone and South Florida calls timeout Wally Burnham tells everybody all 11 to get over here I touch them to man coverage and he almost gets stuck but gets it over the top and then the block here great by Ellington good job of the cut block on Nate Allen rappel saved it touch yes he did he didn't give up on the play Mario Cristobal what to touchdown the worst solar wait Wally Burnham wants to keep him out of that end zone to the worst sort away this is what I what we talked about it at halftime Doug why not go with laying younger especially when Palmer cause it didn't up you know nothing could gets in he just couldn't play he couldn't run and you can see how well this team has responded with laying younger even when he's missed off some passes he was only 2 or 7 before this drive started now free of eight that was a huge play to tyo in looks good we keep 8py Hill the tower I set the age backs it up or going nowhere as a Mon man repeal and company shut him that again well I'll tell you who really made to play key on Wilson he popped a hole he comes in or just roots to pull back out and doesn't allow a man mad to even get anywhere and if he leaves his people defenders just converge on second down from the one and a half closing another minute to play Ned goes right in the middle of the teeth of that South Florida deep it Doug again I'm gonna tell you he on Wilson watch Keyon Wilson here in the ISO block he takes it on and just destroyed and that allows the secondary mates to come and help them that's a good ISO play by our linebacker just going in and that's the same play they call before it's man on man I so block between the pull back in the line back chalk it up two times in a row here on looking on that back Walia Berta most good Florida State for nine years of 1993 another national championship Brad Scott took the South Carolina job left the FSU staff to quali burn him with him spent five years of South Carolina and when Scott was fired Burnham found a home in South Florida and this man is one of the outstanding defensive minds in the nation and you mentioned about already Ohio State Colorado Minnesota came this summer to view tape with Wally Burnham when we saw a Colorado against West Virginia yes they were no has Doppler spread spread is one of the things in perfect for Colorado knowing their play on West Virginia's before testing up now the Cartwright forcing him to throw the ball and not letting him get out faith Wally Burnham has written a book on it that's what so defiled Sherman two men Turner go against again if they go that same play Keyon welcome 42 information is gone why dream into the end zone FIU has their first touchdown of the 2008 season that time it's going to going I so lean block it get outside and they use their speed on the outside which is a smart play dog that inside was not going to happen from our Turner gets the lead blocking green scores fence all right buck they need to get the extra pointed and kick the onside kick they got an opportunity well there may be a tie this thing if all those if the stars are aligned Revis died for the extra point difference for that for example did eight and now you're going to go do the onside kick on cockpit you're able to get four twopoint conversion look the last few plays they tried to go inside look at this good blocking outside more kill and Turner with a good block on the outside and the hole opens up because they were so focused from the last two plays on the ISO leaves block Green gets it in for six so the good hands people will come on to fear for South Florida and we'll see how much if I use taxes beyond fact yet if we talked about it in the first half of the game stay close sooner or later you get the ball in the hands of t y he'll be the big things usually happen it finally did he score horse or gets close to scoring and puts them in scoring position and now onside kick anything can happen duster Revis will try to put the Mojo on this football home he's aiming for the left side of the South Florida front line the right side for his defenders and we saw him practicing this yesterday in the walkthrough and earlier today you try to hit it on the top of the football and get that topspin let's see but what good balance to cover the air all the other opportunity is South Florida down we'll get the football analysis the fifteens are huffing at each other a little bit hump it in profit and the ball has to go ten yards before the picking team can touch it but it also looked like they were all sides before the kick even took place so if that's the case then they decline it South Florida gets the ball you're going to see here the kick and it looks like the flashlight away you see the flag up in the air from the officials so that's clearly offside South further declines it they get the ball to run a couple of plays and ice the game first ever game of these FIU Stadium new stadium new attitude new era is the slogan the billboards all over Miami they've got a big TV ad campaign and that's the face of the program Mario Cristobal the firstever Cuban born head coach to division one football number 31 on the kicking team death penalty will be his fourth from where South Florida recovers the ball then after the play was over personal foul number 21 on South Florida 15yard penalty that will be first out vo Wilson came in late is shelled at FIU player rather blue Lucky's not feel Huxtable dr. Hutson levy on him Leavitt and he wants to get an ass not to get out of here is it impossible maybe some of the better players go down coming up Fresno State Toledo you know these are kind of games where you get a lead and then you kind of coast and that's what I think South Florida did that defense is kind of one on cruise control lost some players a lot of things happen in George Selby goes out boom premier just hurt and wish they'd lost their mental focus late in the game yeah I clearly lost their edge you're right and that's the one thing that Levesque stresses you have to finish the job they did not do a good job of that tonight as goofy goes down no timeouts left for FIU so they cannot stop the clock in South Florida we'll go to 3 and Oh with a very tough road trip next week at NC State but does Florida Atlantic water international Central Florida they all look at South Florida's routine we've got a beat in order for us to get to the next level few years ago that won the case so now everybody is going to give them their best shot especially the teams at home you see East Carolina losing the North Carolina State and state rivalries are always tougher when you don't come prepared to play the full game Jim Lebanon to South Florida Broyles were favored by four touchdowns and they walk away with a 17 to nine victories a football straight foot in golden testers of SIU our final floor once again South Florida 17 to 9 for more information log on here home for the finest of college sports at espn.com the preceding has been an exclusive presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports time now descended of Fresno State at Toledo that's BEC on ESPNU
