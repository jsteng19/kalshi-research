============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ESPN on 83 tonight in Chile so water it is a bedlam series winnertakeall for the big 12 title Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart part of ESPN's rivalry series presented by Jiffy Lube Oklahoma and Oklahoma State ancient rivals in a series where the weird and the wacky seems to happen with regularity Oklahoma made the jump from seven to three playoff rankings trying to join Hudson Alabama Iowa and Michigan State all who've already won this afternoon is a sooner win enough to secure their bracket position in their finale welcome to so water Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit commonality and Heather Kasich will join us on the sidelines part of this game is everything bragging rights payback if you're Oklahoma Baker Mayfield trying to make a Heisman case and of course the conference title and perhaps the playoffs as well incredible to think you're in one of the last weekend's of the year it all comes down to this let me think about if you're Bob Stoops and you're looking at your team right now you're talking to them there's 16 minutes away from accomplishing nearly everything that they want to accomplish a conference championship and if everything goes well securing a bid in the top four to have a shot at a national championship and I think Mike Gundy as well he would have told Mike Gundy in August you got a chance to host Bob Stoops in the Sooners in bedlam to have a chance to win a big 12 championship and forget about the top floor it's about winning a championship and Mike Gundy has his team ready to go and for soups his fiery quarterback Baker may feel the chance to make his closing high his Heisman statement and a guy who's got 33 touchdown passes he's got a scare he got a cheap shot at TCU it was nasty and it looked very scary at the time he was able to continue to play they held him out the second half against the Horned Frogs the Horned Frogs almost came back to get them he's had a great week of practice this week he's been cleared everything that we've heard from Bob Stoops on the field even prior to the game and said they've not held him back at all so let's he get dinged again I don't think there's a concern for the sooner thing that I really have been impressed by with with Baker Mayfield it has been at times you'll see him work within the confines of the office where he's able to make reads and show accuracy throwing the ball downfield a sterling Shepard and then there's other times where he's kind of like a Johnny Manziel where he find time he trusts and believes in his confidence what he can do as a playmaker hearings waiting and waiting in over seven seconds for the defense to try to deal with them and that's one thing too Glenn's been to the defensive coordinator from Oklahoma State said we've got to be able to control him as much as we can and not let him escape and make plays and I think somehow JP run as much as we talk about Baker Mayfield to me he's the key tonight running the football to set up Baker Mayfield here the pokes hit the quarterback a lot they take the ball away a lot Oklahoma State's offense led by a quarterback Mason Rudolph who went to Norman as a true freshman and upset the Sooners a year ago well and now he's back for an encore and is having a huge here a quarterback that when you look at the big 12 you see quarterbacks have an ability to throw it downfield he's as good as there is JW all also gets in Morgan option attack quarterback when you see number two Rudolph in it's kind of what you expect for the big 12 they spread you horizontally and then they throw the ball downfield James Washington number 28 to guy to keep an eye on JW Walsh will come in in short yardage in goal line situation these last five weeks in the red zone they have been incredible and it's because of JW Walsh their ability to run the football with him will be key to kind of offset what made sit Rudolph in that passing game will do was one of those 17 seniors will be extra emotional tonight the Pokes underdogs on their home field trying to shake off the playoff chase to the winner goes the big 12 title coming up so what the Goblet was coming in the big 12 in November edited living up to expectations how big is this game for the state of Oklahoma bedlam is looming Laden the big club championship is on the line John thank you welcome to senior night here in Stillwater JW Walsh the quarterback knew he'd be emotional part of a 17 man senior class already secured their second ten win season and Emanuel onfo a junior but a high NFL prospect getting the senior treatment tonight from Lagos Nigeria to Houston to Stillwater next up the NFL this has been the Nissan pregame rush kickoff coming up but now we'll look inside Nissan's Heisman house this is the chip aloof rivalry series the motion confusion chaos that's bad the best name flattering ripe with recent drama and I but for decades bedlam and the Blue Bloods from Norman fully distilled water how to start while chasing championships the sooner nation filled demand dominantly preserving deeper hatred the rivals dressed in deeper orange for the folks passion always overflows fighting uphill the pendulums top villain the Sooners silent less violent bravado by taking 8 straight now my gun started meddling from quartercentury have states talking big 12 supremacy hungary to revamp the cowboy undergone field the sooner you buy baby swag embodied by life with consent opaque amazing the playoff brackets beckon but tonight is bedlam anything could happen and probably will and the sooner the Cowboys get together you never know Oklahoma has just taken the field they've actually had a better record this series here compared to Norman they've won five out of the last six historically of course this is onesided but the Cowboys have had their moments and they've had some big wins in recent years under my gun dbob suits eight and two headtohead against the former Oklahoma State quarterback there's the Sooners quarterback tonight Baker Mayfield's first taste of this bedlam series began his career text a second then red shirted in Norman a year ago watching as the Cowboys stunned the Sooners top receiver Shepherd has had just a monster stretch run of course his father played here and he understands his rivalry and it's been a part of the Oklahoma Sooners football family for a long time can imagine what's going through his mind as a senior Eric's striker another senior he had to learn what bedlam is about he comes from Florida but he will be targeting those Oklahoma State quarterbacks tonight you can bet on that doubt about it he has to have a big night along with Charles Tapper to be able to try to slow down Mason Rudolph at the Cowboys pass again the Cowboys dressed in all horns tonight on senior night and about to make their entrance with the night club light when lasers and all that stuff this is the theme for whom the tour was opened by Baylor's lost last night in Fort Worth they got the great news that they can walk off this field tonight champion for the big 12 perhaps make a late case for their playoff suitability I knew that they have put a lot of money into this stadium and I didn't realize the whole stroke line here is they get ready to come in it's pretty sweet you better know your way to reveal as we get back in your way through that fog behind that's pretty cool through the paw here come the book the Yanks to the rain moved off thankfully still hovering near freezing at kickoff but none of those awful conditions that really played a part of that TCU Baylor game down the road last night to Tom Rinaldi on the field Chris thank you very much coach misting right now what conditions for Kent how does that affect the game plan you just got to be smart get two hands on the ball when you can and secure it but not too bad right now how do you coach the game to play in the moment Bob while knowing what's at stake well you know just do what you're what you're asked to do don't try and do more to me that's the key play within yourself do what we're asking you to do and play hard good luck to you ppreciate thank you Chris so soups who has the upper hand in this rivalry in this counterpart Mike Gundy for Oklahoma State in his 25th bedlam game as a player assistant and now head coach Heather Cox with him Chris thank you so much coach the landscape changed dramatically last night making tonight a winnertakeall game how does that affect your mentality well our guys are ready to play and this is what we work for yearround I'm sure both schools do I know our guys have busted their tail you put yourself in a position if you win you win the conference I don't know what you can ask for no long season other than that as Chris just mentioned it per to believe this is your 25th game as a player or a coach in this bedlam game what makes it so special in your mind well we don't have professional football in Oklahoma during this wink everybody who wears orange or red it's a lot of fun for everybody we know there are coaches we know their players they know us it's just a great rivalry let's get coach Thank You script a rivalry heatheravan divides the Gundy family his Mike's brother kale and assistant on the Sooner staff he said well if they didn't need any extra inspiration but they got it last night knowing they could be conference chants for the web anytime you can play your last regularseason game and you've got a chance to win a conference championship I don't care where you're coaching that's big and Mike Gundy that lost for Baylor opened up the door and now they're again 60 minutes away from having a chance to surprise a lot of people I don't know how many people back in August would have said that Oklahoma State had the chance to win a big 12 championship for that matter how many people have said Oklahoma has a chance to win the big 12 championship in the winner of this game will be the conference champ both teams came off subpar seasons a year ago the fan being intended to in the end zone a photographer apparently got knocked down the pregame run out so you can see you some security personnel surrounded photographer giving some assistance there while Oklahoma has won the top so they they have done so I believe the last six games and it chosen to defer to the cowboys who get the football different night different strategy two weeks ago we had them in Waco against Baylor and because of Baylor's ability to score a lot of points they won that toss that night and they wanted to try to get Baker Mayfield in that offense out of the field as fast as they could they tonight they're put in the defense out there 35 years ago Dirk there was the famed ice ball we bought midweek there might be a sequel but thankfully the the ice storm has sort of moved the way the temperature is 34 the scylla chances of precipitation the wind is going to swirl around but there was some fears that a repeat of this game way back in 85 when Mike Gundy was actually a recruit visiting watching this game old Thurman Thomas managed to speed his way to a big game but the folks got shut out somehow navigate into 13 points a field goal was kicked by Blackburn this game the suitors want it but but thankfully no Ice Bowl to tonight's goodie right early in the week it sounded like we might be heading in that direction there's a lot of talent on those teams especially Oklahoma you go back to 1985 some great players Force Gundy says he does play the car that the Sooners will never fully respect the Cowboys they know they've gotten their attention in recent years that upset of Oklahoma as a three touchdown underdog a year ago in Norman or they were 14 points down with five minutes to play a rally to what an overtime was a huge boost propelling this team forward and I think the loss by the Sooners and then the loss in the bowl game really has fueled their revival this season so bedlam had a big impact on both teams a year ago about it I mean when you win a game like that from my gun you're it propels you into the offseason creates some confidence and I completely agree with Bob suits in Oklahoma they were humiliated in that game even worse in their bowl game against Clemson Bob made some adjustments did something he doesn't very often do it happen to let some coaches go brought in some new coaches and I think the Tennessee game early in the year in Neyland Stadium and not feel the way they had to come back to win they can reestablish some confidence that they lost a year ago and it's been a magical year so far for the Sooners we'll see what happens there within the last game of the year conference title on the line Sooners trying to navigate into this playoff Nick Hudson to kick it off Chris Lacy and Jeff Carr teeth for the Cowboys kicked ribbon through the end zone so we'll see mason rudolph the sophomore out of Rock Hill South Carolina not a highly coveted recruit out of high school but Mike Gundy spotted some things he liked this guy what a twoyear career he's had so far yeah and it really sits there by week he has been on fire he's taking care of the football he's thrown for close to 1700 yards since the bye week 12 touchdowns one interception and that will have to continue he's got to be able to take care of the football tonight against a very aggressive an athletic Sooners defense but on senior night the senior JW walls number four it's the official start one of the unusual backfield formations we'll see kind of the inverted which bum look and that's the Litton in motion Walsh is going to throw on first a complete system are so eight men and he has a game to the 35 yard line so Rawls who is a very competent passer opens up firing her he has a great deal of experience but one thing you don't see a lot from him this year is he doesn't throw the ball a ton no he has 29 attempts on the entire year when Oklahoma has been told all week when number four comes into the game you're thinking about the quarterback run game and the zone read and triple option look at a first play for Mike Gundy comes out throwing a football to try to set a break some tendencies against the Sooners defense this is 24th completion but he's thrown up 11 touchdown passes hasn't thrown a pick yet so as we said very confident flag before the snap it's a false start on the Cowboys all start offense number 73 fiveyard penalty % if you and I Chris opened up the season a year ago our first game together actually on Saturday night and they played in in Arlington against Florida State the defending national champion I was really impressed with JW Walsh night that night he was running and throwing and doing a lot of different things fired in his injury and since then Bateson Rudolph has taken over but he still has a package usually it's been short yardage in red zone this is unusual for him this year and Walt takes off fast upon to number the battery hit immediately by big Charles tapper the senior defensive end they're going to be very alert for this quarterback run Daniel 7:4 is in there Charles tapper is a senior and a veteran that is really one of the guys that get this football team focused and helps create energy on the defensive side of the ball he will be a handful on the state if there's one area that to me in this matchup is a concern for them it's the matchup in the trenches the Sooners come in with a lot of confidence Oklahoma State's to try to manage things upfront at the line of scrimmage second and 13 that's Jeff are the freshman goes in motion they hand it off left side Rennie child's the junior from Houston knock down quickly by Matt diamond it will be third long very different feel it's an offense if you watch big 12 footballs there's used to seeing tempo you're used to seeing quarterbacks with three four wide receivers in the game sometimes five receivers in the game and it's speed ball they're trying to get the ball spread out and get you out of space this is not only is in a different field with JW Walsh but the tempo is very different from what you're seeing from Mason Rudolph and now the Cowboys attack Kris Carson junior from Georgia number 32 the back to the left of Walt on third and 10 straight back fourman rush Walt fires over to half far side and it's a adrenaline on the part of the quarterback as they they start wash little bit of a wrinkle but now they have fun yeah an Oklahoman will mix up their coverage the Sooners Bob Stoops and Mike soon fill it I get a defense if they can get Oklahoma State to that third and a third long situation they won't mix up there look play a lot of zone but that time on third down if they brought striker late and they played mantoman coverage he had an open man he just overthrew it herdsman that finer in the punt Jeremy Shepard was the return mammoth short bounces in front of him and is down by the Cowboys at the 30 that's where Baker Mayfield will take over the junior as we said from Austin began his career at Texas Tech left there sat out last year beat out Trevor Knight for the job 33 touchdowns 5 interception as you said earlier coming off that big shot to the head that mild concussion against TCU last week makes great decisions with a football to come into an offense with Lincoln Riley bringing it over from East Carolina only have five interceptions on the entire year and he's a creative guy he will do a lot of different things but the most important thing is he's a great command of the offense but keep in mind as much as we talk about Baker Mayfield to me it's the offensive line and the running of t ride is the key tonight to the Sooners the rhyme is the left of Mayfield a fake assume they fly off the Jarvis faster who's got some space across midfield shoved out by Jordan Stearns but the Sooners are rolling already that was the problem for Oklahoma State last week against Baylor was not so much the receivers on the outside who was in slot receivers against the safety that time the glass important Stearns a wild one matchup at 17 on that play now Mayfield shoots near side Neal makes the catch down near the 25yard line as he beats Kevin Peterson so Baker comes out firing yeah Baker Mayfield again again great feel for what he wants to do with his offense Lincoln Riley putting him in a position with all type of the buildup in the game instead of easing their way in they're just coming out with guns blazing throwing a football attacking this cowboy because this is not using their way in 17 yards 22 yards and now Mayfield want more but he can't escape down will be chased all night the sack master on a Houston remember this is an Oklahoma State defense they gave up some big plays to Baylor 396 through the air to Baylor they also struggled against TCU 445 yards against TCU so right away you can see Lincoln Riley has confidence in both the Ronnie in the past or right now trying to go after that secondary first team sack for aqua 37 for the cowboy is often so on second and 13 Mayfield on the run flips it across the middle the ticketing huge got their prey flowers delivered it knocked the ball loose Andras the freshman's receiver but that is a great hit and Baker Mayfield was fullblooded coverage he was expecting mantoman break ours looked like he was thinking back and in right there enough ends up climbing up his head against Mark Andrews just perfectly but that's on the quarterback Baker Mayfield he can't leave his receiver out to dry like that they confused him by mixing up the coverage play clock running down as the noise arrives on over 13 Mayfield and perfected know when the throat through now rolls and aspires a long shot incomplete on the near sideline so Oklahoma gets 39 yards on its first two plays within the drive stalls kid when Spencer in the Oklahoma State Cowboys secondary line of credit on those last couple plays they did a really nice job of mixing up their looks you could even see Baker Mayfield back there we've seen him when he gets confused at times and when he doesn't trust it he usually like to buy time and dance around but the Cowboys did a good enough job there chased it out of that pocket Austin Seibert a very solid crew freshman picker has been perfect from 40 to 49 but that one never got held properly looked like he kicked the laces and it comes up short now I'm with you it looked like they did not do a very good job of getting that ball knocked it down but turned away the Layton's need to be turned away and that was not my quack up here one of the spotters Flores Fowler's spotter he would he would not improve that at all that was not good so the Sooners move the ball quickly but come up empty in their opening possession and the Cowboys go to work next in mental second possession for the Cowboys and JW wants the senior not there the start of this year is back out there Kurt for his second series we'd all had an ankle squeak against Baylor but was said to be healthy has been practicing this is not about that we don't believe one thing so I think it's more maybe they feel JW off some style gives the Sooners defense maybe a little bit more to deal with empty backfield for wall no one open this is what he brings is skill set tonight first down run before my Thomas Thompson take a look at tonight's chickfila impact players for Oklahoma State a team that usually relies on throwing the football again JW Walsh usually just read so James James Washington David Clinton in the passing game Washington more your vertical threat Linton is more of your receiver over to slot Eric striker with a pass rush and back Sanchez number 15 is one corner and Jordan Thomas the other has got to have big night Mike Stoops telling us that's the key to the whole game person goes in motion wall hit Matt diamond penetrated and dropped him you know you see zone read so often and you're reading this guy right here watch how fast he collapsed down on the back I think he confused JW Walsh JW Walsh was anticipating him staying with the running back but by polling it got to get mad time a lot of credit just because it his intensity and how quickly he collapsed down that's speed of which he did it was able to do that I think confused Walsh on the ring you got Charles Shaffer Charles Walker and striker will get most of the attention but Matt diamond having a fine season as well the jr. puts third and seven play Cowboys wall has plenty of protection from the pocket delivers and Frank across the middle completion and James Washington the big play for senior for the Cowboys moves to Obama's 45 yard line before Jordan Thomas wrestles them out and this is Oklahoma's answer rush three dropped eight but to look at the patients right here to find the throwing Lane nice job letting the receiver Washington clear it took a great job of the offensive line also protecting but JW Walsh a runner showing the patience making the right read until his receivers cleared over the middle that's 23 yards on third and seven because it feel for this guy he's been a loyal role player this year to get the start on senior night Chris Carson running right with bulldozers gore about 7:00 on first down you got to love the guy just because of everything that he stands for and if you've watched this Oklahoma State team play at his second half he's been very similar to what Baker Mayfield has been as far as just providing a spark when he's come in in the red zone and short yardage when he makes the play and he scores the touchdown he's celebrating with his teammate the team seems to feed off of that energy this has been very different tonight from anything that we've seen for him this year as I said he's been playing quarterback in the past but not this year delivers fast on wanted and makes the captain is enough muscle that he's the son of a legendary high school football coach he wants to be a coach when he was a third grader before he gets to work he told me his dad had him out in the backyard running the beer and he was in to write a paper at school talking about the decisionmaking as a young guy for him he said the important is sufen he runs the beer right or left but he was focused on the third grader I love it first I'm from Oklahoma's 30 goodlooking drive here then walk back we can occur again for the end zone only when the head of Washington the John get a hand on it had some room he had will Johnson the Nickelback beat what they're doing is doing a great job of protecting him when he gets back to throw the football and then they're using crossing routes which is occupying the defensive backs you're right he gets away from Washington but it was the other safety Stephen Parker who went over the cloth cross the middle because of another wide receiver that he was following and opened up the middle of the field perfectly a little bit more arrow into that and that's a touchdown for the Cowboys so there's oppressing those receivers on second exam walk fires near side and immediately flying up to knock down a child a couple of Sooners including Georgia Thomas you see this play so much kind of a look fast just get the ball outside these defensive backs are getting more more accustomed to it watch Jordan Thomas number seven fight off of his block and right away just get up there to disrupt the rhythm of that play in a nice job not just making the tackle the first he had to get through that block which he was able to do now it's third down along again they're very much in creamish field goal range for Ben Grogan who hasn't pick one of the last five games keep an eye on third down Sooners so impress your Wolfpack FEMEN delivered into traffic the catch is made at the 26 but knock down immediately is Jeff gar their striker their striker they're bringing him late they're disguising it up into linebacker and he's doing a very good job here early in his game on third down up being able to time that blitz time the Blitz and be able to get after the quarterback and get him off of his spot Ben Grogan takes a chip shot in overtime to cap the upset of Oklahoma last year's bedlam game has been literally used this year especially the last five games from 43 which with equal is not good Steven drives it just crew so Oklahoma misses their field goal Oklahoma State makes theirs and jumps on top three nothing Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart stop by a store or visit us at walmart.com to share wonder every day Nissa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy and Dr Pepper Dr Pepper in college football it's a oneofakind tradition oh you should know by now that just in case you don't and to get the watch ESPN a stream every game line downloaded her for the watch espn.com they college football with you none of the eyes of the nation on this game tonight Oklahoma playoff position number three all the teams around the Sooners of already won Notre Dame trailing early at Stanford the Irish trying to state their case cowboys and Sooners in their regular season finale playing for the big book title rogon computed away and Alex guac to five and rock is free and across to me feel a foot break down after four that's the kickoff return Oklahoma fans have been waiting all season for Ross returned a couple four touchdowns a year ago he hasn't got loose like that all year though now and give the wedge a lot of credit for some great blocks to open this up did something you work on and see if he could tired if he's injured but watch the blocks up front I chop of getting a hat on a hand here it just opened up and defeated off he's able to split it up to prise the ends up getting caught there from behind the preventive touchdown by Jones at the corner and st. looks like his ankle maybe he got caught underneath there but boy what a great job here's PI pylon cam here great job by that wedge they open that up completely to give Ross that creep that he needed Mayfield they were going to have good field position if it has a score 90 yard returned by Alex Ross a junior from Jenks Oklahoma it's been really a sore spot as he continues to be attended to down there near the goal line just have not been able to break loose and many of the same players involved bob suits not sure why it's taken this long to have a huge return but it's a good time for it yeah and for him he he has been a tailback he's had a lot of carries before P Ryan came along and he's been for the most part on special teams so when he gets his opportunities that's a bit in especially being from Jenks playing in a traditional power in this state having a chance to be able to have a big moment here hopefully he's going to be okay and be able get up he's disappointed about not reaching the end zone but after a frustrating season which has seen Oklahoma 112 in the country an average kickoff return distance Roth breaks out and finally helped to his speed 39 yards Kirk had been their previous long return this year Connor Knight had a great block on that play Jackson you lose another great block this could be one of those when you get into special teams film room give me about four or five guys that did a get a perfect child at setting that up and again Ross has a speed to be able to almost take it all the way to the end zone the kind of a player of course can switch momentum immediately quiet down they could say D enough for the Cowboys as driven 44 yards and nine plays for their field goal Oklahoma has been devastating in the red zone they've been in the red zone more than any team in the FBS this is their 60 seconds red zone trip scored 40 touchdowns to 14 field goals you expect to see a big number 30 savaii Pierre I'm in the situation and of course the way they attack on that first series they threw the ball for the most part here I didn't get his hands on the football because of the way Lincoln Reilly decided to come out throw the ball yeah I'm with you you got to believe the big fellas going to get the ball down here inside the 5yard line 230 pound back to the right of Mayfield they fake it bill and throw touchdown pass out of its slot sterling Shepard a senior from Oklahoma City with 11 touchdown this season you know if you're going to go play action down inside the 5yard line that's a great time because you and I and when Spencer and the defense they're thinking the same thing and watch what it does look how it gets the defense up and now you've got the opening right there and Baker Mayfield is able to put that ball right where he needs to play my second Oklahoma career charts in receiving yards with his 70th catch of the season that slant said about the kickoff return put so you on top just a great play call Lincoln Riley first and 10 playaction goes to one of the best receivers in country and early in this game they're using here on board that decoys throwing the football get two Cowboys defense just fans got you covered tomorrow morning for week 12 in the NFL and o'clock Eastern the insider Sunday edition all the news then on Sunday NFL countdown a couple of special guests Thomas Davis Josh Norman and then defeated Panthers doing again is guest analyst all throughout the show the streaming live on watch ESPN Cam Newton taking in the iron bull today couldn't get the Tigers over the hostile home against the Crimson Tide option to kick off Roma a oneplay 4yard touchdown drive to claim to leave this is jet car the two in the freshman looking for cuts it back is not down across the 30 weeks college football rankings brought to you by chickfila we mentioned it Clemson a harder and win at the road against the Gamecocks in nut white as close as that score would indicate a burn battled Alabama for a while Notre Dame just kick the field goal a trail and panel haunted by a point yeah Michigan State really really impressive with what they are able to do with so much at stake there against Penn State helped an Alabama game pretty competitive over play pretty well in that game for the most part if Oklahoma win you don't see any changes and the committee is top four I can't imagine Oklahoma dropping out I think they win this game they're going to be in the top four so Wallace is still in the game he flips it complete fair to Brandon skipper no relation but it is curious now that an all three series he haven't seen Mason Rudolph do they say wasn't feeling the effects of an ankle too much not not to keep him out and I can see him down there I watched him warmups it wasn't it it wasn't as if he thought why something's something just doesn't seem right he seemed like he was okay wonder if it's a strategy thing that they filled it JW Walsh and the way he can attack gives him a better chance bolts throwing again over the middle complete inside the 40yard line an accurate throw to Austin Hayes it's all junior at a San Antonio because it's his own he has to hit that football throwing in there at a hurry that's a soft spot to zone behind the linebackers and between the safety in the corner he puts that ball right where he has to put it get A's a chance to secure it down low away from the defender Walsh Kirk you said he attempted only 29 passes all season long seven four nine tonight already there's 77 yards empty backfield again on first and five receivers from off as a Sooners pressure the back pedaled and delivers for a short gain on the far side the first time we've seen Oklahoma bring more than four they did bring the pressure and they was able they were able to get through with JW Walsh and his athletic ability it's a real strength of his he just bought a little bit of time and that's a win for Oklahoma State it's it's not a sack he didn't throw an interception and didn't have to throw it away pick up a couple yards and just showing Oklahoma then hey I see your pressure I feel it and I welcome it Oklahoma State wide receivers against mantoman they can make you pay for it when you blitz him I missed a freshman dealing with Buzzbee they wouldn't spread the ball around this offense and now Walsh looking to throw again delivers near side Sheppard again knocked down inside the 30 Jordan Thomas it's right near the marker and it will be a first down Heather Chris and Kirk I can confirm from Oklahoma State officials that they are holding Mason Rudolph out right now because they're keeping an eye on him after he did sustain a foot injury in last week's game yes my admit he wants to run game that they're also protecting it just keep firing him throw the puck senator one seal in the Cowboys reclaim the lead boy a little slant go here by steals Zach Sanchez is saying that he got pushed in the back if the plant can go oneonone matchup definitely has a push there with a slick turf Sanchez goes down but that's what that Sanchez was upset about so 70 yard drive in five plays it was just on fire Brogan for the PhD as Oklahoma State reclaims the lead bedlam while as we expect severely Cohen cassadee Hubbard's news dr. pepper championship drive update number six Notre Dame at number nine Stanford Shawn Kaiser will fuller 73yard touchdown Irish right now on top 20 to 14 in the second Chris Erbe back to guys Notre Dame ten points to claim the leave Oklahoma fans to be keeping an eye on that they'll feel more comfortable about their chances if they win the Irish lose but for now your immediate concern undergone Cowboys have jumped on top ten seven road drives if they're raw you sent the big return and appears to be okay we're coming from that but takes a huge shot ball comes out cowboy covering say no fumble they're ruling that Ross was down a huge shot was delivered by Devante average the linebacker and Assam jawing between two teams not for the first time in this rivalry it looked like Ross his name was down and then the ball came in they're going to obviously take a look at it if they need to have a bigtime hit I mean in heavy hit right there that need is that the runners forward progress would stop for the ball the forward progress will certainly stop sip and even set me how quickly it goes down look at the pollution you see the balls there this might be a better angle she shattered his facemask there's paint flying everywhere content there's a good look at it right here watch aber come in and just lower the phone right there at knee goes down right away Richard Jordan is the big 12 replay official looking at this you're right that was a filing at least when the heat goes flying at the helmet and they said yep there's some collisions going on down there Obama keeps the football from the 23 and finally they see samajis here on whose gang tackled after one year game Kevin Pietersen so when it is a for progress situations really not reviewable Dave Kataya our rules expertise here once they set forward progress replays out of it okay okay big hit paint flying out there dance literally absolutely huge hit there's going to be no former progress after that shot Iran in a yard was first area now play action second down delivered over that had a beating Westbrook so third and long now for Mayfield you know that we've made so much about Oklahoma since that Texas loss in their first five games 144 yards a game on the ground and last six games they have been running the football 292 a game on the ground it's been Kieran and drill mix it together and Glen Spence on the defensive coordinator from Oklahoma State knew coming in he say they have two NFL running backs we have got to low up against his line of scrimmage in this running game as scary as it sounds we got to make Baker Mayfield and him group the riders and Rosita Cowboys showing pressure on 39 and bring it may feel if escapes looking to throw now touch the ball runs across the 30 short of a first down driven out the Cowboys bench and bounces up from that big shot and some Johnny he's an emotional feisty guy step take up deliver that shot well they do a good job of showing pressure and then watch look at this look at all these guys at the line of scrimmage you see this in the NFL and then some snap of the ball three of them drop and four of them come so they're able to sit back and play zone but they create confusion with Glen Spencer's walk by showing you seven guys up close to the line of scrimmage and by playing zone they're able to locate the quarterback and scrambling and then lowers at the boom there with Seth Jacob Seibert the only true freshman to handle both the place kicking and punting duties whose disease and Jalen McCleskey calls for fair catch so Oklahoma State answering the big special teams play by the Souter for the touchdown drivin and some huge hit they have come into this football game and there defensively and on special teams and they are playing physical they're taking the fight to Oklahoma they're not saying we're intimidated by the ranking and all the tradition the heck with Oklahoma football they're they're welcoming this challenge in aid of emotion his leadership a big part of that on the offensive side of the ball can such a break star tonight can a 12 through the air remember this is a quarterback game coming into the night only had 29 attempts on the entire year it can add to afford that the last series of losses took a touchdown passed apparently this is his game tonight on the reverse the fleaflicker walls put the down feel closed in the coverage and it's broken up almost intercepted by Stephen Parker Sooners ready for that trick while Stephen Parker was back there waiting Marcel Amon does a good job of trying to sell this watch him right here and you'll see Parker just sit back and kind of wait on it he thought the whole time but watch out evening kind of sells it Logano is going on now he goes but Parker's just back there waiting was almost almost like it was a fair catch for a punt he high points the ball of an agency to try to keep him away and distract the football Barker made the pass if way to break up the twopoint conversion pass attempt by TCU the Horned Frogs were going for the win last week and off the Carson and just one's right over Dominique Alexander the linebackers is a very aggressive and said physical star for the guys in orange no doubt about it they have come into this game you can imagine when you can't do a rivalry game and you hear about all the cloth all week about what's it take for you what's it take for them to me so much about emotions and momentum when you get into these rivalry games but you got to give it Cowboys the mic betting and staff a lot of credit for coming out and playing with a certain mentality early in this game family is actually at 12 guys in Vincent huddle their judgment runs in their play clock is still running down as it's too and we'll sort this out they had to hustle oh man I'm healed Oklahoma State that's firm aerial timeout of the half it'll be a 30second timeout JW and that last touchdown drive yeah JW Walsh is just panic field and how great it is to see senior day a guy that has it he's been more of a short yardage to read some guys it's Drive the last time they had the ball four here's the big one when he picked it up in the air and relied on his receiver to go up and make it play on the football Juwan seals a highly talented individual coming out of Port Arthur Texas six but 198 pounds goes up and makes the play and gives the Cowboys to leave aw Polish man informaiton Rudolph and off to a great start Walsh was sick last week had a fever really couldn't flavor it wasn't a factor at all in the loss to Baylor even though Rudolph was hobbled and really good food but all the end of the game it didn't go too long because he was subpar but he looks healthy and ready for his senior night moment a night that's right remember it 1330 median like this you always have the quarterback run game and that's something that Oklahoma is well aware of with number four back there if you also have oneonone opportunities out on the perimeter giving these receivers Sooners have not been a great third down defense this year they bring pressure walls deliver is incomplete they really forced the issue tried to find Glidden on the near sideline but he was defended over there by will Johnson so for now the adjustments Mike Stoops has made for a defense it's been playing wardens own the last three or four weeks and rushing three and dropping a rushing for dropping seven here with Walsh I think they feel he's less effective by bringing the Blitz that time they brought Parker and also the linebacker Alexander trying to disrupt his rhythm and make him throw the football a little bit quicker than he's ready for sonot area on Shephard rejection scampers out at the 34yard line if you check in with Cassidy Hubbard for an update hi Cassidy hey Chris Taco Bell's studio update Stanford responding quickly Kevin Hogan Michael rector who breaks the tackle and takes it in for six 2120 Cargill now 12 Mexico in the second second harden don't believe that they can make a playoff case even with two losses if they can beat the Irish need some help Afghan if they go on to then remember they got USC and by the way congratulations to play healthy and UNC beating UCLA after everything that they've been through losing helping to Lipsey Sarkisian go to all the injuries of the big win today for FC so here on with his second carry pot blue Sivaji pierot to midfield they will knock him down 68 yards that's why you gotta be the big fella yeah that's what you're accustomed to seeing from Oklahoma and I was surprised how quickly here I was able to get to the edge I think that's the mistake by Oklahoma State defense that was too easy for him to get outside he had really didn't rely on that much blocking on the outside but it gets to the edge in the corner and he shows you he's got some speed he sure does man Seibert knocks it through Oklahoma reclaims the lead he's big he's tough he's strong and you're right he's got tremendous speed and flexibility no doubt about it watch the big fella right here yep Brown right here who makes the block but watch out easy he bounces I would have thought a little bit of linebacker maybe scraping but he's busy that's not he gets caught up right there and look at this you don't have anybody to floss with it's the right guard the right tackle and then you have the receiver and the defensive back on the outside and he's in mantoman coverage watch teenie Westbrook right here eventually use the corner hunter realizing Sivaji Pierre is coming down the sidelines as he westbrook hustles all the way down field to pick up that key block to let him get into the end zone the perils of man coverage on the corners and failing didn't even know the running turn in mantoman coverage by the time he realized that he runs coming down to Solly a peek teeny Westbrook does a nice job of helping me finish off that play and getting Pierre on all the way to the end zone but there's a mistake by Oklahoma state to allow T Ryan to get to that edge that fast both sooner cut sound I would have been one player saw the alex ross kickoff return would set up the Mayfield is Shepard for you our past and then beer I'm 68 yards to the house in 11 seconds back and forth folks we promised you some fun tonight in Seoul Hunter had a few lead changes already a great start to this game came out throwing the ball as you said using Iran as a decoy but is too great to use as a decoy for long yeah no doubt about it true software really does have the look of an NFL ready running back right now not yet eligible for the draft of course yes cars just stick a knee and the Cowboys will take over hey Chris let's go back there watch this and watch TV Westbrook when you've let it let this roses CD CD Westbrook down the sideline out here watch him and what he does that confuse hunter he's acting like it's a deep ball coming to him right here Hunter's thinking it's going to be a bomb and looking looking he's going I'm going to catch you Hunter's trying to go make a play on the ball little does he know that here comes the ma GP run running down the sideline and into the end zone that's like a shortstop trying to fake you know like the balls cover the little things a receiver can do pump is great so what a wall so the Cowboys have to do to answer that one play text and drive drop inside they get inside striker with Raymond Taylor but Jordan Evans the linebacker knocked him down Dave I got saw you I thought it a good job good job I see it that was great myths a big series for Dave JW Walsh because the momentum for the most part when we talked about momentum shifts and rivalry games momentum for the most part in this first quarter his favorite Walsh in the Cowboys with the big run by here on Powell does Oklahoma State respond to most on second and nine delivers a short pitch gets made there by James Washington is referred and about three Zach Sanchez on the tackle I think a matchup here that it's going to help decide his football game is Oklahoma is mixing up looks but they're more willing to blitz and lead their defensive back mantoman per wall she had some opportunities to make plays in the past and can his receivers get after the Oklahoma secondary and mantoman coverage who will win that battle on the perimeter is going to go a long way in deciding who wins this game Otis has not been a good third and short offense they've started with the offensive line creating crease so an empty backfield for Ross Sooners are keeping an eye on the quarterback now the emotion again walked it face off at the straight rod he's going to be knocked out right near the marker at the 35 by Charles Walker see where they spot it you know tapper and striker get so much attention but the night that you and I had Oklahoma if baylor charles walker was the guy that i left that night number 97 really impressed with a sophomore 62 297 pounds really really quick for his size and he gets it does a good job of getting off blocks which he did right there to force him short of that first down he bumped washed out a yard short so final 30 seconds of the first quarter seiner in punt formation Shepard's bear Koch at the 23yard llama ten seconds to play in the quarter Monday Night Football on ESPN rivals in the AFC North Ravens against the Browns all starts with Monday night countdown it's buck then kickoff at 8:15 also streaming live with a watch give me an app you call the big series of the Cowboys they could not stand the momentum and now Mayfield here on a company go back to work the last time they had the ball the big run by P Ryan they were able to steal the hedge and open up the outside running laying there for pirata to back look now is Joe Mixon member 25 joined fear on this has been used with increasing frequency and effectiveness by Oklahoma here I'm gamers straight ahead knocked down by Chad whitener the middle linebacker what will be the final play of an entertaining opening quarter in the bedlam series here in Stillwater back after this message and the word your local ABC station great first quarter Saturn and Football on ABC presented by Walmart part of ESPN's rivalry series is Anna by chippy Lou been terrific rivalry in recent years upsets crazy plays if you've seen your share of crazy events in this series a lot of you you're in so water a lot of fun to watch watch these two teams on the field together especially when there's so much at stake the winner tonight ends up securing a big 12 championship bid and if you win more likely is going to finish in the top four Mayfield on second fifth now escapes the pocket and cuts it back across the 30 it'll be third and short set Jacobs and Vincent Taylor stop them it's only one quarter into this game but a big big plan for Oklahoma State was not just loading up this Prentice hockey Ryan in the running game but but trying to do the best they could against Baker Mayfield and his creativity and the different things that he can do how elusive he can be for the most part we're early in his game but they've done a pretty good job of corralling him and not letting him get out and make only their 13th play and they feel who had secret completions to begin the game only has one sentence in each three the buyers complete at Shepard but he's wrestled down very quickly by Kevin Peterson and the spot will determine whether this is a first down or not it's close your Kevin Peterson is a field corner but they move him over the slide to get a oneonone matchup with sterling Shepard pretty quick coverage there and it's strong throw a strong arm what about my Baker Mayfield spot to me look pretty accurate gave him a first down it was very close and that knee came down where the ball was do back look mixing this first Gary needs a block from a field cats one that is often running this mix them turn for a long touchdown for the Sooners 66 yards bigplay running attacks with a little help from the highest mechanic that's why what a great run what an athlete Joe Mixon is to be able to cut this back and keep this play alive but I want you to keep an eye on a quarterback right here watch what he does and watch him even after the block when he does he opens that up right there but they don't mix it out in the open field has some serious speed for his size in 220 pounds Gundy said I got two NFL pound running back they got a good band and the each has scored in the long run right there a deep cleaning block from the quarterback by the way it was a may I watched him the whole time unthinkable a great job here by Nixon has the quarterback going to make a block boom he does but he's not done he's so excited now he's trying to race Mixon trying to get to the end so this is what this team loves about this guy he wants to be the first one there to celebrate let Joe Mixon know how much he appreciates his beatup Mayfield's Energy Sooners now up by 11 early second our Pacific Life game summary they look at the the onetwo punch some of them uh call this no thunder and lightning but I think you got you got two lightnings and they're voting to dip our backs yeah I think they're both thunder and lightning by themselves and you can see you kind of bottle things up you don't allow to get out and then in the blink of an eye a couple big runs and they're both in the end zone and got a little point lead line drive kick by Seibert is fielded by car on the bounce freshman works his way down the sidelines Oklahoma State and only given up a 42 yard run that was the longest all season those two touchdowns Tom Rinaldi on the sunna sideline well Chris normally when you make a run like Joe Mixon just made to come back and you're the star of the sideline but Baker Mayfield got just as big it's not an even bigger escutcheon after the block he threw to help spring mix in two Sooners being celebrated on the sidelines after that huge play and you know Tommy honestly we talked about intangibles of football teams talked about the leadership of football teams that that's what he provides those are things you're watching you just don't really appreciate how that team feeds off of his leadership off at the end defense right go down Holsey this has six playing ball yeah he does so the cowboy Fowler urgency here any child this short scan on first down and that's where the main people went out against TCU they had a what seemed at a comfortable lead but but striker told me that believed right the defense felt the absence of this guy not just the offense I'm telling you I think Bob Stoops feels it you know it's think it's much as they 85 last year to where they are right now there are a lot of different parts that have made this a special year but he's right in the middle of it and you're right the team feeds all for that because you know it it's authentic its genuine all twosecond down bro incomplete here comes the flag that Sanchez is all over Juwan seals little too much all over him one last thing about Baker Mayfield it doesn't hurt to have two NFL tailbacks behind you it is line up to get you punk faster defense number 15 that's a good quality place at the spot of the foul automatic first down Sanchez 1alpha this secondary guy had a pick against the Horned Frogs last game won't be the last pass interference we see call tonight not in this conference time if we talk about a big series earlier for / JW Walsh in this offense and now after those two big run you can get feel this stadium they need something positive here on this Drive it's been Walsh acid not running which is a complete role reversal soon different pressure Walsh gets it away it's a low throw and mccleskey catches it about the 44 yard line it will be third down I talked about looking at students Chris I talked about two or three series ago about how this football team Oklahoma's defense their adjustment and it took them in a little bit of a while to adjust to Katie Walsh being in there instead of Rudolph but they're lifting a lot more playing a lot more man coverage that here there is we have an athletic guy in Jada B Walsh you don't want to give him room to work you want to try to force the issue make him want to throw the ball and don't allow him to be able to get back there and make plays or his legs second and seven they bring five again hit walls as he throws the completion navel on the sidelines there and it seals and then move the chains we just talked about that here comes the Blitz with striker there Ben C is coming late he was able to do that the athletic ability goes right by the big tackle because good speed but they're disguising it and bringing late here they come again well what's in the pocket and yes he's going out of bounds striker was in hot pursuit he throws it away no no this is an offensive line that has struggled for the entire year to protect the quarterback even on Walsh's athletic but watch striker not give up on him he's right here and watched the speed watch the relent and attitude I'm not giving up on the play keep in mind Walsh is an athlete he can get away from pressure but if striker as a defensive an outside linebacker he shows you what kind of speed he has an offense that had eight net rushing yards against Baylor the lowest total in 20 years a a 23 so far tonight Jeff Farah short game Gundy was a filmmaker if you get just somehow squeeze out a hundred watching arts are you feel great about that well it's going to be tough to do even though JW Walsh has an ability to make plays because of the way he can run there's a mismatch in the trenches the Oklahoma defensive line and you add the linebackers what they can do to the line of scrimmage they can push it back and it brings the linebackers of those both safe teams to be able to come down hill running game to beef up if they're going to move the ball tonight I think it's going to be Walsh creating or making plays oneonone on the outside they got two backs in that blocked the Blitz on third down Sooners bring it walk circle back and has to just fire away so the Flint is that Mike Lewis is dial it up or effective here it is again and you know who it is it means that this is what you hear coaches talk about in college football today against the spread looks we don't have to have sacks but we want our we want our secondary to be able to at the defensive line to be able to affect the quarterback so they're affecting him means forcing him out of the pocket before he's ready to be able to make a throw and just have to throw it away what striker is having his way with this Oklahoma State offensive line and pass Pro signers to boot it away the empty position for the Cowboys increases pressure on their own defenses the Sooners go back to work from the 20yard line up 11 Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart routine by Coke Zero all taste zero calorie try a new game day tradition Cadillac and Jiffy Lube experts around every corner to help you lead query behind the roots of this university is Oklahoma A&amp;M tremendous facilities now don't vikins getting involved after a huge bedlam upset in 2001 by the Cowboys and they backed it up with another win in 2002 and mr. Pickett said I kind of believe in this football thing here next thing you know he's to get a nice new stadium with his name on it Sooners front of 20 Mayfield puts it the touchdown line last time this is mixing getting free again if flag comes in as Mixon makes his way across the 40 Kevin Pietersen forced about part of this run may come back it's like a hold by the receiver downfield blocking but how about the moves again by Joe Mixon to the open field this 25th reception holding offense number 5 10 yards from the spot of the foul replay first down we've got the senior receiver drawn Neal but Nixon and Pierre on but particularly Mixon can be an effective receiver out of the backfield absolutely there it is right there Terron Neal at the top there against Peterson clear hold right in front of the officials so big game comes back throw you still first down at the spot foul so it doesn't erase all of that game first down and about six I think it's appear I know they feel pump fakes and is dragged down short lost their quick penetration by Jeff Jacobs you talk about Mike Stoops bringing some blitzes you've seen Oklahoma State also they're taking some chances good job up front that time you know we've not said a man you all applause named that much tonight but always a factor has great athletic ability but the Blitz that time ends up getting home with chef pink of the junior with first sack of the season he was just in yard they feel pressured against it across the middle catch made by Shepherd do Cameroon and a blocker and the edge and is hammered hard at the 40 yard line by Ashton Lampkin but a nice game watch the two linebackers right here you see pressure here and by glinting them look how it opens it up right over the middle an easy throw Baker Mayfield is kind of baiting them bringing him towards him and him dumping it right to certain Shepherds 17 yards on that third down play and now here I'm just his third carry I would make a strong argument in an era where it's all about offensive receivers the Sterling Shepherd could be the best receiver in the country because of everything that he does as a receiver he's got it again Kurt wait Spurs blocker and gets to the 45 now there's other guys that work flash here maybe why do you say me to babysit I think he is a professional he works in his craft he's a route runner he can do things from the slot he can do things from as an outside receiver he played so much football he knows how to set up defense the back he will be a superstar at the next level his muscles forward down inside the 40 it's another healthy first down gaining upon yo he's just one of these guys that takes his craft very seriously he works he's already had a great career but he wants to keep raising the bar I love to see guys that never settled they just want to keep getting better and better and better they've never had never gone up in his online and the last four weeks he has 565 receiving or building FPS has been more productive the last four games the shepherd house on incomplete far side Neal couldn't collect it clear down it what's interesting is when Spencer has moved Kevin Peters said number one again I talked about him being one of the better corners in the big well here's Glenn Spencer it moved him over he said we're going to keep him on top of sterling Shepherd he could have kind of shadow and follow him the matter where he goes it was confirmed he was looking forward to that challenge the last completion Scheffer was the Sooners first conversion on 3rd down 85 here and with brink what do they look at the Pierre on he's got plenty of room and first down easily that inside the 30 both backs effective receivers yep that's what his made T Ryan Moore be complete back in Lincoln Riley's offense last year he was a true freshman a powerful runner now he's blocking for mixing and blocking and pass protection catching the ball on the back here to the heck of a job Bank it to him flippin ears on Baxter block down terrific play by Peterson that time and it's a loss he does a really good job here you know you know how it is in the big 12 in the defensive back you're out on an island almost the whole game whether you're out wide you're in tight to the boundary you're over the slot can you play out in debate can you play on an island and they rely Cavan Peterson to do that now it is late in the year to he's nursing an ankle he's not 100% just trying to gut it out here in Mayfield delivery spark another all the nielsen it's about with you bring up a good point about it being late in the year that this Oklahoma State defense not just dealing with ankles and knees and injuries like this of all the notion of koi but the last four games 366 plays 92 plays a game they've been trying to defend the temple on the big ball I don't care who you are that will take a toll on you physically and emotionally trying to be able to stop these offenses the paddle people they're going to make some noise make it form a field from his urban flow now boys twisting proper this is ddos for the crossing route plenty of room to down field watch and he shut down first and go Oklahoma how about the crossing route with Danny Westbrook against the ball who I talked about how about trial of sterling Shepherd here's an unselfish attitude and gotten away with one watch him block right there he takes out the defensive back Ashton Lampkin who is on him covering him ball was still in the air when Shepherd made that block got away with one there Sooners back in the red zone going to really stretch this lead then they feel right open it too easy Dimitri flowers Oklahoma just rolling that everything Lincoln Riley calling just about is working when you have a place some of these superstar players it catches the defense's eyes you see him come in motion by coming in motion like that you see the defense flows and then just simple just goes right out their defense has to flow respect Shepard coming in motion because of the speed that he has the play making ability that he has the defense close with it and another great call there by Lincoln Riley on first intend to be aggressive with a playaction pass Oh start offense number 45 yard penalty will replay the try we kick the point after Lincoln Riley that thirty twoyearold offensive coordinator at a Muleshoe Texas guy with really an amazing brain total recall one of those guys it probably could be a wizard in finance make a billion dollars but chooses to use it for football hooking does a heck of a job he did a great job last year at eath Carolina was shamed Parton caught the attention of Bob Stoops Bob Stoops made the move to go in and bring him in and it is really paid off for this Sooners offense and the team Oklahoma has run 26 plays and they have 28 points says Baker Mayfield but in the ball throwing blocks for Owen touchdowns boomer sooner of 2810 Tuesday night the new cause the fall playoff rankings khazanov AT&amp;T will be released we shall see if Oklahoma keeps navigating tour to win here if the committee sees fit to change anything in the table for number one Monson winning Alabama over Auburn today better dame and Stanford still battling we'll keep you posted on that one 23:21 irish at this point trying to make their case share our it be a big win for Notre Dame and while Oklahoma 21 unanswered touchdowns on each of the last three possessions and there is serious urgency now for this cowboy all goes Hudson we've taken Esteban by just car to the left wrestles down at the 25yard line as we check in with at Cosi truck our bear crystal leak with the athletic trivia question he made it through a cold morning on the gameday set that bear in 1918 1988 Barry Sanders had that great season 26:28 rushing yards who finished second to Barry Sanders that year in Russia Wow he's the best player I've ever seen in cockpit ball that's the greatest year of ever seen as a running back I know your affinity for that season so I figure that my story a little Barry Sanders blessing amazing only under that bear but in the meantime there is a change in Mason Rudolph as you credit get the straight proof from the Oklahoma State sideline and said nothing's wrong with him this foot injury serious he hasn't started and Phil now hasn't played but now Kirk they gotta throw the ball their figure and Rudolph short completion at Glidden who now just drops the ball never had it never did complete the cash striker we've been there and not a great mobility from the quarterback that time was their night and it looked like the ball it kind of was moving down through his stomach down between his legs you're right I think it's a great call by the official right watch the footballs he never had it trying to wedge it between Cateye there he's doing everything you can I don't think that's considered control on the cats when you couldn't escape it with the leg so Rudolph let's see if he can spark this team let's keep an eye on his mobility because that's been the issue play clock at five sooner smelling blood but back off only rushing three almost intercepted that Sanchez made a break on the ball intended for seals that was almost a fixit Zac Sanchez has three interceptions since he's returned from that ankle injury in the last couple weeks at 2:00 last week against TCU does a really good job of putting his foot in the ground and reacting to the football he is an aggressive corner and in think t'v guide and make so many big plays for the Sooners and to see him back healthy make this defense very very different on the back end see if they pressure Rudolph Kirk on third and 10 here Streicher got a running start close down the pocket hit the quarterback in it's intercepted Jordan Thomas with a convoy through the end zone and the Sooners are smelling blood as Stryker hit Rudolph and Thomas took the pic to the house Thomas gets the interception but Eric Stryker gets the offense he's been delaying these witnessed the entire first half here he is wait wait and then gets right through Carson the back goes right through and pushes him into the backfield and I'm not seeing a Mason Rudolph gets hit as he's trying to get rid of that football but even if he didn't Thomas in great position all over eight men the receiver see how he's waiting comes in late uses speed goes right through Carson pushes it right into the backfield there's Jordan Thomas with the ball skills making the play and taken to the end zone striker just overpowered the back there and illadvised throw perhaps and Thomas is his fourth bit Kirk and how about the progression from an overmatched freshman in this game a year ago picked on by some cowboy receivers that's got to feel pretty sweet for a guy from fine Texas I think the entire difference in this defense from what I've seen from where they were a year ago to this year is just a year a little bit wiser older more mature on the backend with guys like what we've seen from Parker and Thomas too for Sanchez Ahmad Thomas and missed the point really town a group in the back the point one of the few things it's not going right for the Sooners at the moment 27 unanswered now for something else happens you're better get back to the barre answer a slight trivia question I like the question Barry Sanders monster here at 88 you have any guy who was second in rushing honey was going to go from us sooner maybe if there's a tiein to this game but I guess oh okay it is Darren Lewis Texas A&amp;M and they are only two years later Louis led the nation in rushing at Oklahoma State's Gerald Hudson was second to Lewis so I inflict Yeti hit a great year he'll a thousand yards short the victory that's what I call you a runaway rushing title you said for every he's here favorite college player well he's the fence that I declare yourself but for the question he Thank You mr. Polito got thick and it's going on here James Washington to star receiver not one of the normal returners were there trying to get anything a spark going and after Rudolph came in and threw three incompletions in the pick6 looks like he's not the quarterback and Gummy's going to go back to lost but I get it be honest Rick I'm a little confused in earth you are the way the quarterback used here so well I mean again for people that aren't familiar with Oklahoma State Mason Rudolph number two is their starting quarterback throwing for over 3500 yards they they've run an offense where they spread you out throw the ball a lot and Jay Toby Walsh has been kind of a changeup he have two different offensive systems that makes it really tough on defense as he glanced 5week to stop them because you can throw it with Rudolph and run it with Walsh and tonight for the most part other than the last series he spent all day Billy Walsh walls now back in loop the down field for Washington under curry comes back a Mexican TV falls down it is support from the quick straightness down put into the lead 72 yards remember we talked about the mantoman matchup the oneonone matchups on the outside whether you plan man or zone who will win those battles we just saw an interception by Jordan Thomas for a pick six and here on an under thrown ball Sanchez does not see the football and the big fella James Washington comes back and makes the play on the football Washington's 10th touchdown receptions guy was tremendous vertical leap acceleration guy that Gundy said he used to be satisfied with like a catch with 20 yards maybe go down now it's all about yards after the cut end this guy yeah man free coverage meaning Sanchez is alone with Washington by the time he recognizes these two footballs too late a just back to the ball a little push to push him on but coming back to the ball and not only that good safety in the middle of the field Thomas was supposed to be kind of playing center field so if the play is made he's got to make the tackle right there but get Washington credits coming back to the ball and then to speed to be able to get to the house like Bob Stoops is over there speak that the official feeling that was may be worthy of an offensive pass interference there in Washington you look at Walsh's stats Curt throwing the ball 14 of 20 so almost as many attempts here in the first half as he had all season long 205 and two touchdowns like they're still behind by 17 yeah and again even though he's known as of a runner he can't throw it we've seen that earlier in his career but because of how they struggled all year on the offensive line when it comes to running the football you just knew when it was Rudolph or it's Walsh if they're going to stay in this game if they're going to be competitive they're talented group of wide receivers by James Washington and David Clinton they're going to have to make plays and oneonone opportunities that's exactly what washed it did right there they're not going to be able to run the ball much at all they run for 23 yards tonight that's the bigger concern for the Cowboys is Oklahoma's offense is rolling and moving the ball and will again 26 plays that's all they've run so far the low total for them webinars of play 34:14 wrong field on the bounce and we'll also have the big 90 yards return instead of protection nice across the 35 so Baker Mayfield who comes from Austin has a girlfriend is a former soccer player here at Oklahoma State they leave her master a senior and was a defender here that he's gonna cheer for her boyfriend but she's a true Oklahoma State fan through and through sitting the 50yard lines tonight here surrounded by Cowboys fans happy preferred guy but not for her team so conflicted tonight so she looks bored with the whole situation to me cold dawning she's ready to call tonight employment the boat from Austin actually turns out her parents live just down the street from Mayfield Lake Travis area in behind the quarterback they fake it to him maybe a little pump fake no pump fake good pass the ball and he says is it lucid myth you maybe that's the most explosive guy but he got away a set up moving his hips and avoid in the back clamps absolutely he is very very tough for a linebacker for anything's defensive linemen they're getting into the backfield you got one thing to get there you get a conic corralling buttocks around you you can first him Gary for four yards off but knocked him down a couple of guys are going to be points on Sundays for honk on colliding there Evan called aquas name much so far in the first half though halfway here I'm again cross midfield will be third and four with Baker Mayfield and that athletic ability like any quarterback who can create there's a fine line between creating too much and being a guy that's been going to be bad to hate you need to calm down a little bit and you know stay within the confines at office be smart execute you want him to be free willing you just wanted to do it when it make sense you don't want to do it every single time he's back there mixing motion to the clock five receivers empty backfield on the third and three Mayfield stepped up picked off first down taken and bacon to the Cowboys forty I mean he's almost like a point guard when he gets out there who's got a great handle and you're trying to stay with him he does a really good job of just it's kind of a herkyjerky movement and that's what makes it so tough for an oncoming linebacker in the open field so it's one thing to cover down sterling Shepherd and the receivers it's another thing to be able to deal with him when he has that ball his hands will be analogy at the point graph breaking event off the dribble enough he can shoot it to be right again almost a huge plug coming across to just grab him with chef Jacobs to prevent another big game what I love about this offense is they'll stretch you out with with these great group of wide receivers which was different than a year ago that all they really had was Shepherd but they've got a good group and then they can attack into the middle to be a shepherd Neal throws a block and Shepherd down inside the 25 first down that's just good recognition by the quarterback he sees the soft coverage and just pulls the balls and gets it out that was a run pass option meaning he could hand a ball off to P Ryan he had two lineman polling for the run play but he saw that he had to match him he wanted and just fired it and they up to the top and picked up the first down you're on the right side bounces off a backhoe like he does still going here so the end zone touchdown beer on 25 yards most of it after contact is how Iran does it he went right through the middle linebacker bad white or the sophomore who has stepped in this year for Ryan Simmons one of the leaders in his team whitener just got a young player he's been plan against a lot of backs this year stepping in for Simmons but he's never seen anybody like some on JP Ryan and the physicality of P Ryan what he can do running the ball no drama on that PA chief was ciphered and Oklahoma continues to be frightening ly efficient on offense 33 poise now 41 points and watch him run right through the middle linebacker right there and then the safety takes a poor angle me yeah you want to keep it track we talked about before the game yards after contact with semaj P Ryan because he gets through linebackers safeties aren't real sure and take him on headtohead so they may come in in a different angle he is such an impressive back and here's the pylon cam showing you they get into that end zone but that drive was really Oklahoma if you had two quick stuff to the outside the Shepherds got to respect that you got to get your numbers right out on Shepherd and then you've left yourself short into the inside then they going to run the football because you're short at the inside so it's a kind of a kind of a back and forth game between the office of the defense in Oklahoma has had the upper hand with the effective balance of this offense it has a plant fall against Texas but since that game they're averaging more than six hundred yards in 51.0 defensive coordinator in the country right now and I'll include Kirby smart saving anybody they could be tracking long way to go they could be tracking though for the city finals who wants to see this offense across the field right I personally wouldn't mind seeing them play against the front seven from Alabama that might be fun to watch a lot I don't mean us but somebody if there's anybody that wants to see them right now no it's a little pushing thing again because this is way knocked out at the 25 we'll get back to that did you looking ahead perhaps before see Cassidy hunter thanks Chris let's take a look at who's getting the dumpers out of my Wells Fargo and on third and one from on right with a plunge over the top the cardinal scoring on all four their trips to the red zone they retake the lead they're up twenty eight twenty three in the third Chris Erbe back to you thanks good with a palo alto here students and we don't care what Notre Dame does we don't care about the resume we're going to make our own statement tonight they're causing argument to that playoff committee you're a 41 team the world 72 halftime tailor short game yeah what I was going to say is the matter who matches up with Oklahoma the thing you have to deal with is they have it all you have a quarterback right now playing with confidence that can run and control they're going to stretch you out with formations they have a great group of receivers I think you have two NFL running backs they can run they control and you get a quarterback not turning the ball over only five interceptions on the year that that's a lot to deal with balls on second down it's a shot again throws it into coverage and it's intercepted again by Jordan Thomas one of the house already based on the sideline and drops at the three so desperation for walls another takeaway and this thing is really fitna good ugly now we talked about oneonone this is just a great technician and Jordan Thomas Chrissy talked about last year as a freshman he was picked on for he has come in long way is long and athletic but now experienced great body position there's no way that seals can get inside there and get to the football because of the way tom has positioned himself and look at this JW wall should play action and just throws it up hopes did his guy can make a play on the ball but being thrown to the inside it made it very easy for Thomas to use his body to shield the receiver from getting to the football excellent play again by Jordan Thomas he's picked off each quarterback that's the first pick of the year Walsh and now Mayfield a machine with really smelling blood trying to put this one away before halftime perhaps he Ryan again gun DS team has lived off takeaways and points off turnovers nobody better in the country at home the points off turnovers for oak state coming in with 82 7 he felt he needed to be what two plus three in this game and instead they've thrown a couple picks a great point Chris they're plus 15 on the year second the country coming in to denied and and felt that they had to win that aspect and tonight so far and one of them a fix there and not just to take away from how they catch them in so quickly so may feel taste again still running this guy finally knocked down hard but Mayfield's showing his is elusiveness again yeah and he actually had Mark Andrews to the left for a touchdown in the marais t1 but because he had pressure and he had to start to create if he would have been given maybe just another second maybe half of a second the preowned freshman was breaking free to the middle on a post for a touchdown that by the way is exactly who is looking at but Oklahoma State got to just in time what are you doing the third and forty watch be Ryan you watch Mixon the quarterback runs Shepherd I mean pick your poison good luck I always bring some pressure it's mixing on the handoff Gus brought down is even bursting free Seth Jacob saved the touchdown and it's fourth down they continue to bliss that done Flynn Spencer give him a lot of credit they down 41 to 17 but they are not losing their aggressive mentality they have been blitzing those linebackers all night and sometimes it's worked out other times they paid for that risky mentality but they've not let off of that stand aggressive approach it says forget about a field goal attempt a 41:17 they need three on fourth down play clock at seven we're not going to get a playoff they're going to have to spend the time out here this is a performance that's something to behold from Texas our from from Oklahoma since that loss in Texas it's really been tremendous I mean it's been a defense that is you pointer that is so improved from a year ago and an offense that there right now is clicking with a play caller that's in rhythm I mean this football team is we get to this weekend and next weekend the final time we have a chance to see all these teams you know you start to say who the top four who is the best resume who in the top four and this is one game where Oklahoma Oklahoma at this point has made a very very strong statement to the committee and evaluating this football team on both sides for the ball that's what makes Oklahoma so dangerous it's not just the offense of Baker Mayfield the defense and how much they've improved on that side of the ball makes them a complete teaming it's going special teams as well talk about seams you want to be judged on what they do when they're at their best when they win and not on the quality of the loss which I think too many people focus on yes Texas not equality loss for a playoff contending team but how good are they when they're at their high know at their fast I think we're seeing it that to the timeout they are going to trot out Austin Seibert the freshman kicker for a 40yarder missed earlier from 47 it's a better hole this time they scissor it spun away and this one is not Korea by cyber 44 17 minute 14 before halftime Cassidy st. Chris back and forth between Notre Dame and Stamford Josh Adams the freshman just explodes for a 62yard touchdown they couldn't convert the twopoint conversions it was 29 28 Notre Dame with under four to play in the third back to you guys thanks no CJ Prosise in the game they just go to Chatham for a big run as the Irish continue to try to overcome injury and they have done that as much as anybody the freshman now stepping in for Prosise has meant so much for that often John Saunders mark may Mack Brown will break that one down for you the Capital One halftime report is coming up so krama builds their lead we're going to get the ball to begin the second half with the Cowboys in this big 12 where it's so tough that the break serve to get stops only a minute 14 for Walsh Kirk but you just feel if they got to try to do something here well they've got a couple timeouts 13point second quarter for the Sooners and it'll be a touchback remember they scored it in Vista play when they got the ball up a oneonone opportunity to James Washington made it play against sac Sanchez so see what they decide to do obviously the big six majority Thomas was part of the veto and see things with where points then plays run it's scary good Thomas up they say throw my go for the hat trick in the first half throat my way again say could you take a hostile crowd and it's a hostile crowd here for bedlam you take him right out of this game with a quarter like that striker right here remember the calejo yep good spot and he'll back away into coverage wrong lob the ball picks his way up the middle just dropped the ball looks like they have recovered it I don't know if he Jesse Robinson the right guard I don't know if he accidentally hit the ball as he was running c64 there well he may have acted though offensive on but fumbled the ball off the hands and you just got to make every play if you're Oklahoma State at this point Washington couldn't can grab it yeah that ball is a little bit high and to play the James Washington is one of their top receivers knows that he's open he's got to be able to make that play able to get some separation from Zach Sanchez and the timing was good he just unable to hold on to the ball you have to kind of keep any hope of doing something on this rod they've got it convert the third and five Streicher creeping up again Wallace gets the ball out it's completely Glidden who does get it first down to the 44 good 43 seconds left Clinton has had a very very quiet night fact then maybe his first catch of the night he's give him with 50 catches the most productive receiver the Glidden again bobble that one just collected it before going out of bounds at the 46 homuth sitting back and wall she's just kind of taking the soft coverage and saying you know we'll take some some yards we'll take five six seven eight ten yards at a time here if you're going to sit back and in softer man coverage and one skip to the line of scrimmage striker an active guy in the first half got a hand on it striker is one of the more interesting players in college football he has been known as a pass rusher here he's athletic times it up perfectly he's really built like a Nickelback and I think that's what he's grown into is the versatility to be able to play out in space play man but we know it was a pass rusher because of that Sugar Bowl against Alabama and AJ McCarron I think she's going to be a counselor at the next level certainly a versatile athlete is clearly great in space too he comes again running star in the face before Quebec across and his sidestep it but best record is blow in the play up again and that's what really makes him unique is his the way he's able to time this up so he said the right tackle here Crabtree doesn't have a chance not only because he's so quick but because how he's he's a step or two ahead of the lineman before he gets out of his stance forth then he told me he loves to do he loves to watch those wildlife films where the cheetah is running down the gazelle he thinks it himself was a cheetah like with with great speed per city when he tore at first half if I could see that so I got a chance to see that in person it's exciting and he he says he hopes you get a chance to go on a safari someday because he kind of sees himself as a predatory cat is the career that he's had in Norman watch the first half that he's had he's been all over the place relentless attitude you could tell as a guy who's played a lot of football how focused he has been he's been delaying that same blitz all night long where he's at the second level and just before the snap he cheats up and here Thomas with the interception but he forces the back course and back into the quarterback Rudolph at the time for the interception but talking there to charles tapper between tapper 91 and striker 19 oklahoma is in great hands as far as leadership and guys that can get after the quarterback striker definitely a vocal leader part of that group that said never again after they lost oklahoma state and then he's got embarrassed in the Russell Athletic bowl beaten by Clemson 426 the leaders of the team got together the end of the season and rededicated themselves very rough offseason for bob suits they got further galvanized and a racist video was distributed by a fraternity at oklahoma that the team bonded together who closer together by how they protested that and Stryker was at the forefront of that Cowboys have converted every fourth pound attempt this season so far seven four seven make it eight four eight as Washington is wrestled down near the 30 with 22 seconds left by picking hit by picking up striker that time it gives JW Walsh throwing to Washington again soft coverage by Sanchez just give Walsh a little bit of time and Washington has some room there look at the bottom he's got that false coverage again at the bottom Walsh with another completion that slid his third on the drive driven out so 17 seconds as the Cowboys have put themselves into position to get something out of this possession if you're Mike Stoops and Bob Stoops and the defensive staff they're saying hey let's not give up an easy one like we did earlier to Washington keep everything in front let's give them those eight to ten yard throws let's let that clock kind of work itself down we just don't want to give up the quick home run quick touchdown now strikers at the top backs out now as wallace from the pocket looks for Glidden lee in the endzone its overthrown the 29th ass attempt for Walsh in this first half matching his season total coming in yeah a guy that is known again we talked all night long it has had a career where he's played a lot of football but this year has been regulated more to a short yardage in red zone quarterback a good changeup to Mason Rudolph but when Rudolph unable to go tonight he's had to and it carry the low as you're right 29 it's a pimple the armor starts coming in but yeah he's that whole season to be ready for another throwing around third and see with 11 seconds long step and they moved the chains he gets down into the red zone but just five seconds four and they'll spend the time out use the last timeout and try to get some points on the board so they're able to move the ball down the few started at their own 25 we moved it 56 methodically in 10 plays and they'll send out Ben Grogan try to cut this to a twenty four point halftime deficit rogon one of one so far tonight after not having made a field goal in the previous five games they've been so good in the red zone they really haven't needed him much look at their last five games they did they've had 23 opportunities down in the red zone and 21 touchdowns you're talking about 91% of the time JW Walsh leading most of those drives in that area so it really hasn't been needed that much from the last five games Grogan little used the very solid inside of 48 a pen from 36 the timeout taken by the Sooners not so much maybe the ice but just to be on the lookout for a fake maybe I think he's I think he's the Bob's to decide cinemate without 22:7 here okay music so Bob 11 beer is sponsoring the good hands field goal net from Allstate making contributions to University's general scholarship funds for each field goal an extra point kick today all satan has contributed millions in funds Cowboys have been a great third quarter team and a great fourth quarter team big edges over their opponents in both quarters in the second half so they have a whole lot of work to do this would help a little bit I suppose it may be psychologically then they got to go about getting a stop and the Sooners get the ball to begin the third quarter so Brogan 36 yards does cut the deficit the 24 after a tremendous first 30 minutes for the Oklahoma Sooners in 359 yards defense get the touchdown Mayfield throws for a couple P Rhine and mix it at each run for one and Thomas with Bob Stoops Bob with the exception or even up those points on the last Drive commanding lead what please sir most yeah you know everything has been solid run game fast game offensively take care of the ball had some big runs by semaj and Joe and defensively really there's two jump balls that were there didn't make a good play on it message to your team to stay aggressive Pettijohn absolutely I mean we've got to continue to play hunter John thanks so much coach your regular starter may thunder on that for all but one series what can you tell us about his status and how you'll use your quarterback from the second half well we didn't really like the way he felt he didn't think he didn't really feel very good so we got to go with JW before the game you told me the importance of the running game how do you ignite that with JW in the second half well we got to try to stay with the game plan you know they've got us with some big plays here in the first half we got a tackle better and then stay with the game plan on offense I think so much your time back a few other thank you Tom to the turnover department at man 24 on the scoreboard Capital One halftime report coming up from the studio sefa the final 30 suitors up 24 Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Walmart part of the SPS rivalry series presented by Jiffy Lube Chris Fowler back with Kirk Herbstreit we just saw the Oklahoma coaches in the hallway Mike Stoops with his folder still ahead down focused a job to do telling your guys at halftime look this is bedlam long history of crazy stuff and Oklahoma State remember is the only team in the country that's three times come from 15 plus points down the win outfit it's a tall order but they've done it before well they've been down most of the year in fact five of their 10 wins they've had to come back in the second half a little bit of a different feel for what they're facing the team that they're facing and also being down by 24 it's done Alex Ross who sparked the Sooners early with a 90 yard kickoff return brings this back to the 26 as we check out the Pacific Life game summary in this big playoff that's exactly right there critics started early with a touchdown pass to sterling Shepherd Baker Mayfield I think you good with what he needs to do but really the big play ability the backfield come on here I'm with some big runs so it's called Joe Mixon get in on the act and also the defense with a picnic for comments pressure from Eric striker picked it all the way back for a touchdown and the Sooners really big first half on the road here in Stillwater see how aggressively we can wildly continues to call these plays and hand it off the here on short gain there the Iran with a 68 yard jump on his second Perry closing in on 3000 career yard confettis five yards away Pierre on from getting to 3,000 in his first couple seasons something an Adrian Peterson was able to do here yeah Oklahoma there's some great running backs this year in college football and logic Kieran is right in that mix with the best of the best you've got it again here on the touchback and is wrestled down this really has been the year of the running back and beginning of this season so much the focus was on for Annette Derrick Henry of Alabama but he might belongs in there with with Gigi all the other guys you can see five yards away from prek and Suzi's is it a chance to even surpass he dreams Peterson 3029 just to be on the same panel with Adrian Peterson pretty remarkable accomplishment there's a third name Mayfield straight back deliver the stripe at its block whose Shepherd the normally reliable receiver in front of Kevin Pietersen and the Sooners go three and out your eye this is not something where you sustain that's the matchup we look forward to all week Peterson again Shepherd the balls underthrown just a bit but with Shepherd his hands and how dependable he is as a catch he makes almost every single time so full mistake they get a three and out they get football they're often lucky makes the fair catch at the 26 and you heard before halftime Gundy telling Heather Cox he didn't feel like he wasn't specific but hidden filth Rudolph felt right and was good to go again with the foot problem of the Baylor game and Chris not only does Mike Gundy lose Mason Rudolph who's thrown for over 3500 yards but but as we've seen in the second half of the season the combination of rudolph taking maybe 80% of the snaps and the way they throw the ball over the place and then JW Walsh comes in into kind of a change of pace it was it's been very effective and now it's just JW all and just tendencies with him at quarterback in Oklahoma I thought settled in and started to figure out the attack with what they're trying to do with all all just takes off goes to head across the 34 a nineyard gain right away they're playing with a lot of urgency in tempo here yeah they need to and that's really what he's known for is his ability to make plays with his legs he's been asked to throw the ball for us he made a great point earlier he came in tonight 29 attempts on the year all 29 attempts in the first half so the first half he matched his total for the whole year child I tried to bounce it went backwards in his slam down by Devon tape on backup linebacker but savant a bond played behind her striker and sometimes opposite of him the way he does here but he has tapper pose just a really nice job of getting off block and holding their points with Mike Stoops and any coach it's all about being being able to control your gap that time it's exactly what the bigger bond in Charlestown were able to do on that right Cowboys just three of ten and third down in the first half need three here comes pressure again striker again hits Wallace as he throws he gets it away first down catch is made in front of Zach Sanchez there by Washington so late go the left tackle 73 is going to be seeing 19 it is in his nightmares after this game he is such quickness suddenness to get around him but how about JW Walsh being able to hold on to that ball just long enough to be able to get the ball out to Washington get big cushion there on third down Washington just got underneath that for the first down the first time handoff parts on the short game hundred eight pound of difference between tackle and rush in there select Cohen striker and about a 100% difference in quickness I mean when you think about great outside linebacker or defensive end type of guys who rush to the quarterback in college football you look at a guy that's a lot of times is 245 255 maybe 260 pounds Eric striker does it just was Hall feed and athletic ability and that relentless attitude that he plays with they got two guys two strikers side they pick it up and out of all pot down beetle buy steals in front of Sam shows who got beaten on the play the Cowboys are in business Zach Sanchez is proud of the top corner on this defense but he really troubling times here tonight he JW Walsh it's ironic I think they maybe felt they came they would come into this game and striker again this time it's the big tight end and holds him out think they felt they might want to try to go after Thomas seven but they've been having more success going on the other side against the veterans action Sartain breaks free rich strong run down into the redzone another first half for Oklahoma State so they get the three and out and now threatening which is pretty much what they had to have happen to make this again yeah absolutely and he shows nice patience there's on a zone play just kind of wait for that crease to open up and accelerate through that for the first down I can see many openings putting some running game at Sun they're able to capitalize first in again hit immediately that time Stephen Parker from his safety position ball came out they now flag as long as point in their way like they have it this will sort this out I think Erik striker looked like he was involved after the whistle I don't know if that was personal foul or what he's trying to fight for the football well after the wheel is that the runner was down prior to the fumble during the run personal foul face mask defense number 19 will be half the distance to the goal automatic first so chicken see if in fact it was a fumble but the call stance striker has moved to Cowboys inside the 10yard line another Lauren look at that they're at strikers definitely got ahold of him he's down he's still going for that football but his left hand has a hold of his face Matt definitely down well before the ball is ripped out Cowboys they person goal at the eight a motion person walls keeps it the other way and bangs down inside the by whatever Mike Gundy said to his team it definitely gave him a belief that they could come back into the football game and trying to get a stop with Oklahoma getting the ball and start the second half and move down and link to the field again some points on the board to get into 44 to 20 to 27 and of a sudden that sideline starts to believe a little bit remember familiar territory for the Cowboys all year they've had to fight from behind as you said the opponent is tougher and yes little bit bigger but this is a great start for Oklahoma State second and goal wrong with walkers but a lot of traffic is nowhere to go Jordan Evans clogged it up will be third down he'll lose a yard short Devin did a really good job along with the rest of the Sooners there another play by the balk tape on but it was evidence in the middle flowing nobody on the line and were able to get up to him we call on third and goal here dude you must wall sit there at the end zone yes I with his athletic ability I try to get him on the edge with an ability to run and throw kind of the option to do one of the other from the pocket bat it down Devante bond is it a terrific series here broke the pass up now it's fourth down and he something got broken yeah he went to granted Shepard left one on one against Thomas and he might have had a chance there but instead it's the athletic bond that goes up and knocked that ball away he doesn't make that play that ball get through and I think Shepard got separation that time from Thomas he probably had a touchdown changing fortunes in the last couple plays as Gundy elect to try to cut this to a 21point deficit Grogan 2 for 2 tonight it's a chip shot Sokol Mustaine pecking away but after a 70yard drive not what they wanted Curtis the Allstate bus will Shepherd us down the road after this ball game you know to the Allstate it's good sweepstakes chance 100 thousand Fox was the VIP trip the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game out in Arizona as well as weekly prizes interesting that Gundy chose the short field goal instead of going for it from about four yards away trying to further cut into the lead it still 21 for the Sooners a lot of faces defense two three and out they produce to begin the quarter mean Brogan brought back to the free Alex Cross took a couple of tackles closes the 30s we check back in with Cassidy quite a brewing quite attending brewing between the Irish and the cars old Sean Kaiser into the touchdown sizes up it's under review with under 30 seconds to go tied at 35 we'll keep you updated Chris and hurry back to you as we thank you threw up the TV stand the p80 eventually decided in the final minute that's a pretty effort by Notre Dame Pro sight that so many other guys Credle good howl out them yeah if they're able to hold on that would be a great win they feel trying to get the offense back on track after the 3round delivers a strike across the middle and catch made by Shepherd first down at the 45 remember we talked about the versatility of Shepherd watch him move in from the right over the middle right over top of the linebacker and a really good throw is actually a safety Stearns a great throw thanks shots sitting in the pocket though at the drop of the last series but he has six catches tonight and the short touchdown from a field early the versatility is when you can beat man coverage the way Shepherd can and then the recognition of zone and where that soft spot is in his own coverage the way he did right there wowp Ryan is down on the field when the Sooners couldn't see what happened to him here with the ball and was tackled roughly in there looking at that they labeled it's been bothering and Vincent Taylor looks like brought him down and another one of those situations where his leg looked like he got caught underneath Taylor and when he brought him down take a break Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart stop by a store or visit us at walmart.com to share wonder every day the 2016 Ford Explorer be unstoppable and chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich Pilon cam view of Oklahoma's big place tonight ma JP Ryan did sort of hobble off on his own trainers huddling around him he had a left ankle problem last game let's focus on that lower leg right there did not look good as he was brought down and at last Carrie and with this big a lead just want to even if he feels like last week he went out and came back like seen him able to just take the rest of the night off may feel puts at the shepherd and get the block on the edge in darts out first down inside the 45 tom clearly and a lot of pain down here Ford right in front of the demon I am the helmet down in frustration as you said it's that left ankle which is early heavily safe the problem it occurred last week throwing a lot of pain medical staff around him right now pounding the bench right now in frustration as much as physical pain is clear I thank you Tom we got with a high pain threshold fear on and again that same ankle bothering him the good news is that the Sooners say on track here win the game they wouldn't play until New Year's Eve that semi finals with New Year's Eve so almost five weeks for all these guys to recover and get healthier well mixed it made a nice first down gain a shepherd is not done after only a yard on that catch by Jordan Burton it'll be third short last six weeks for this oh you offense you know P Ryan and mix in and Mayfield and sterling Shepherd get most of the attention but I really think gruesome lies being moved in the right tackle the true freshman the all offensive line is also really settled into become really becoming spring for this offense I got out play that afternoon again spectacle and not been a case the last six or seven weeks Mixon didn't need much it didn't get much whether it's Vonnegut it's going to be in fourth in about a yard once a mile a logging the middle also a nice job with those linebackers still bringing them quite a bit with the pressure that time they kind of crossed created a little bit of confusion and doubt it happened so quickly middle that offensive line unable to get up and make a block on the linebackers see what they call they need a full yard and again it's Mixon not here on play clock winding down may feel roll that has a water room Baker Mayfield down inside the ten quarterback they can all kinds of plays and he pops up limping at the end nursing that ankles he gets back to the hole a great call watch flowers right here just collapse down most of the defense came down worried about their either being an inside run or maybe a quarterback sneak and here at the end of this play he got caught up there with flowers chasing him or what remember did they had to take him off the field last week because of the head injury at 27 yards on that fourth down scramble he does not want to come out of the game you can see that Mixon hesitation but still powers for for about three I feel that just sit out all of last season it takes a lot to get him off the people know exactly the volunteer especially at this point in the game and at this point in the season here at 44 223 could be really good to see P Ryan over there running and if you don't you need the use of the rest of it tonight back he's over there running good time for the postseason sure is meanwhile Mayfield's got it rollin out of just know where to throw blob goes into the crowd there Aqua was pressuring him throw down but you're right about Baker Mayfield not want to come off the field like anybody but especially him especially after everything that he's been through as an individual throughout his career and have this team so close on the brink of a big 12 championship after Bob Stoops and his Sooners for eight and five just frustrated close again remember a 12 championship to add to a 21point lead on third down play clock one down at one Mayfield didn't spot it but Bob Stoops did step away this time out casting upward for their studio update Sanford on one with 30 seconds to go and Conrad you Coquina him stand for the 38 36 win they marched down the field and all their timeouts to set up that 45 yarder Chris hurt me back to you yesterday Thank You Hogan a terrific game for the Cardinal at last ride aided by a hand to the face penalty against the Irish with a heartbreaker for Notre Dame and you could scratch the Irish from the list of playoff contenders Cassidy has sitting back doing all these great updates watching all those games a great job in the up there where is Oklahoma town third down they feel hesitated briefly breaks away pants scores you know I Baker Mayfield limping around stays in there and scores and they brought up Lin from out here with Burton he almost comes up with a big play and they took a chance by him stepping off right there once he stepped up he had his speed in the awareness to get into the corner there's a great look at it right there Horton Burton the junior college transfer came so close to making that play in the backfield but great awareness by Baker Mayfield he puts more points on the board I think that quarterback actually enjoyed the big hint from whitener at the end of the play I'm in rare form for to run for one as a reminder to get you ready for week 12 tomorrow on ESPN the insiders at 10 o'clock Eastern Time and then Sunday countdown Josh Norman and Thomas Davis of Panthers joining the gang has guessed it's over on ESPN also live on the watch ESPN app Baker Mayfield in his final game this season certainly getting consideration from the Heisman voters and will have to remember this performance when they fill out their ballots and then he'll have to hope that he appears on enough of the balance to become at least a finalist it's not the winner of the trophy and he said it would be a very cool experience is to be considered he begins to weigh the different quarterbacks circle talk more about it is the second half a full three different kinds of players they feel bringing a lot of tangibles to go with the arm and the running ability is drawn heels now back paternalistic for the cowboys and he is bunt down back down at the 28 this is the statistical part of it if you look at may feel versus the recent Heisman winning quarterbacks is completion percentage as good as just about any of them passing our three comparable total touchdown right there this is Mayfield stats with some more time to play in this game versus the other guys through 12 games yeah and not only that Chris I think when you look at each of these individuals they all brought a little bit something different to the table beyond the numbers and I think what Baker Mayfield he brings back that you've seen it tonight again we talked all night kids like the last few weeks about it but the team feeds off of his energy they believe in him all complete past and sometimes when you're talking about a Heisman Trophy for me personally when I vote I'm looking for those kind of things I'm looking for the leadership I'm looking for the intangibles I'm looking for a guy that just has a way of his team looking to him say okay go make a play we believe in you and Baker Mayfield has been doing that it started for me when I saw him play against Tennessee in a hostile environment against the volunteers and they had a hole they were able to dig out of it come back and win that game in overtime that's when I started to really said well this number six got a little bit of a different feel to him at quarterback for the Sooners at a couple picks in that game in Knoxville they climbed out of a 17 nothing Walsh makes his way through heavy traffic in his knockdown it'll be sir dad and that's when Bob just really felt like he realized and maybe the team realized and something special about this guy and I think the combination of Lincoln Riley coming in as the offensive coordinator I think there was a new found confidence for Bob Stoops Lincoln Riley there he is right there coming over from East Carolina accommodation of Lincoln Riley calling the plays Baker Mayfield had to sit out last year after transferring from Texas Tech we knew about P Ryan and mix in the backfield to say it's a perfect mix right now with what they're doing for this offense Wolf's needs three on third down and delivers a long throw the fifth is made a bar far so eight men who hasn't really been active tonight he's a speedy wide receiver but he's been contained by the sooner secondary and he is a big body at six for 210 pounds one of the more physical blockers you'll see and I don't know if that ball touched the surface or not they've done the fact they're going to stop but looks like they are a previous play is under further review Richard Jordan is the replay official at ball through his arms did appear to touch the ground let's see if it aided in his control of the reception look right there bring in Dave Kataya the point of the ball did seem to touch the ground Dave what's your take on this it's a tough look but it does look like the point of that ball touches the ground and it does move but again I don't know that if that look is definitive enough for them to change this upstairs maybe we'll get to get a better look here zooming in Dave this is the best look at if it lost the part of the ball right there you can see the point in the ball appear to move but again I'm not sure that's going to be enough for them to change it maybe it's a big review for the Cowboys faint hopes here it'll be fourth and five if it is overturned as opposed to a first out of there 46 you know Dave for me when I take another look at it I'm with you guys you can see the ball you can see it touch but what do you look what do you think they're looking at next door here Dave what are they trying to judge on these replays that none of none of these replays yet make me feel like okay I could definitely without a question of it out I can make a call here on what happened I agree with you I don't see anything that's 100 percent here it doesn't matter that the ball touches the ground which key is when it touches the ground as the ball movers as Chris said didn't aim after further review the ruling on the field of a completed catch stands as full if four fans that's I think confusing the ball can touch the surface the ball can touch the surface but it can't move if that ball touches the service you see surface you see any movement or that ground as Chris said aids and catching the ball it's going to be incomplete but simply the ball touching the ground with no movement is still a completion again I think people's automatically see the ball touch the ground and they just think it's incomplete that's not only okay you're a hundred percent right I don't think anybody knows what it catches in any level of football what we see in college of Minnesota so it isn't first down now they flip it on the end around here the McCleskey but he's got nowhere to go and of course hitch mister stryker what did he get ahold of there the side of the helmet he's right in front of the referee I can't imagine he grabbed the facemask he got ahold of something to help bring him down near his fingers appear to grasp the side of a helmet he was called earlier for that face man take your pick did he grab the horse collar and the Faceman Dave Davis crowd booing because it wasn't flying granite there in plain view but another bigplay babe my striker even if you didn't get away with it woloson checks it down at the parson out of the backfield when he knocked down Dave what's the call there because that I mean we all think that's a face man any part does a helmet opening including the ear hole beside the facemask if that's grabbed and twisted it's it's a foul now did he grab the air hold possibly let's take a look at it right here might have a good shot it looks like he grabs the top of the face mask which is a foul okay it doesn't have to be the facemask any helmet open including the top of the basement thank you we're here the shield on there the brats the top of the shield counts third and eighth loss for Washington and Sanchez in a jump ball Washington wins that battle again and the closer down inside the 25 and isn't it tough night back fan Chad's been a rough night and almost all of all the pros have been with underthrown and he doesn't come back to the book almost at this point is JW all she's intentionally doing this but he is underthrown the deep ball and Sanchez has struggled to adjust back to the ball and again Washington make the catch on it and shows is a much better corner and he's showing in this game and you know he's not going to feel great about his night even if pursued right now Oklahoma there will be a 30second timeout footing part of the problem for Sanchez as well on that play but you can see Stoops even up 28 here late third quarter sill so coaching with intensity and and father this defense has given up that kind of downfield throw it back Sanchez is one of the better corners that you'll see in the big 12 and I think that's the toughest ball when you're left alone out there to play mantoman in college football anyway when the ball is up in the air and it's under thrown and the receivers tracking the ball the entire time it's easy for him to locate the ball and go back and get it it's very very challenging for the corner to be able to see the ball because you're thinking the ball is going downfield so you put your foot down and now you lose your footing and you're on your back so it's a tough ass for Zach Sanchez or any corner for that matter but I'm very surprised because again he's there better cover guy compared to Thomas on the other side they go on the state they may have had a better chance to go the other route tonight but instead they've been picking on Zach Sancho going first down along with the pump fake want to look down didn't hold the trigger and now just throws it away look at this Oklahoma team and presuming that they hold on to this for touchdown lead here and do get in the bracket how would you think opponents would like to attack you where's the weaknesses I'm visiting your team right now on this defense anywhere well I don't think there's a weakness on the offense I mean you're going to have your hands full unless you can beat them up at the offensive line it's still an area especially two tackles with two freshmen you could you could wonder against the team like Alabama how that would match up I think defensively you got to try to attack them through the area your athletic in the secondary that's what you're going to try to make plays on it first person tries to bounce it like that that's why I ask you would you look at it play like that and think that maybe we can you know win some jump ball get some shot plays you know Chris last year they allowed about 276 yards a game through the air and they were young in the back end even though striker and Tamara got some pressure they gave up an ordinate amount of big players this year only 190 yards a game through the air so they've improved a lot but if you ask at me where do you try to go after them I think definitely excited go through the air trying to make the big play Paulson third and four swings it out and then flying up to make the play as will Johnson as he drops Carson for a loss it will be fourth down the line 17th against the past last year and improves up to 30 they've held all these high power passing offenses well under their average yeah no doubt about that that's a great job there by will Johnson the Nickelback getting around the block bite by Clinton and when you're asking these things I mean Oklahoma's won national championship with Bob Stoops they've been to the national championship another one with with Bob and he feels this defense might be wanted to better ones at East Coast so we're kind of trying to figure out there aren't a lot of weaknesses on this OSU team is my point Borbon a where fear walls delivers strike oh just deflected having a chance to make a play with Austin Hayes and giving the folks a little hope there but turn it over in the final minute of course why did hate the Thomas get a hand on that football or in a haze diss profit I think a man just dropped them I think I think Thomas waved his arm but you're right that way they threw his hands there's a match of the five dinners your third or fourth receiver against the safety and oneonone coverage and you hope that he can feed and there's nobody back behind the help it's his oneonone living on an island that time Hayes made a great move to get open and away from Thomas ball was perfectly thrown by Walsh was unable to execute hit the points on the board with this day indeed a desperate man with a credit three touchdown margin instead they a fail as you see Pierre I'm back in there they failed to convert on fourth down for the first time this season was terrific news beer I'm losing a little gingerly maybe hit after he lost a couple yards he must be feeling fine to go back in there with the game for touchdown margin he's got blood on the right side got an ankle it's taped up kind of fits his personality had the same deal last week where he had an ankle and went out looked like he might be done for the night ended up coming back tough guy durable guy the Cowboys got a field goal early in the third quarter but in Oklahoma responded with the touchdown 15 minutes to play in bedlam suitors five four scores expect Baker Mayfield to take care of the ball and make plays as a passer he's got a couple of touchdowns the one early to Shepherd this one the flowers you do some running but what about some blocking down along this big block on a broken play and then I love the sprint down the field be the first one to congratulate Joe Mixon and this is what we've seen him do is creating a spark lowered his shoulder right into the linebacker whitener and just being that guy being the point guard in this offense and providing that leadership and tangibles just always always out there for Baker Mayfield in this team after blocker runner leader all of it tonight and I may feel this shepherd again in his favorite target makes to catch at the 35 first down ninth for Shepherd tonight he makes this case for allamerican teams up to even be allconference at that position you're right and in the big 12 they look around this conference here I know for each almond dachshund of course to get hurt the end of the year for TCU and Shepherd you believe as good as anybody if I were having a draft right now I had to pick a receiver sterling Shepherds the first receiver out of cake such a premium on the guys who can get super vertical all the time he maybe isn't at the top of that list the fear on pinions to come back in and empower it through some leg pain you know who he is he's Hines Ward you know he's a guy that can't do everything he can get downfield he could get protocol if he has to what I love is when he doesn't make a catch he's blocking you know he'll he'll he'll do a crack block and blow up a 245pound linebacker he's just an unselfish guy he'll be a great teammate just the guys and he does everything recognize his man recognizes his own cover to cover one whatever you're playing he sees it because of the experience that he has and just got it he just really has a knack for making players sooner is using the play clock nap it was won and his be Ryan again for Shepherd grew up around this program his dad was a sooner player and they one of the favorites of this position late Derek Shepherd part of that championship team in 85 and sterling was was recruited by Bob Stoops not because his dad played but because he believed in this guy and Brian Bosworth presented with him a gift last week on Senior Day but a journey he said he felt the presence of his dad that night going on and had another productive game as said earlier with the last five weeks now in FPS nobody's been more productive at the position and Shepard as a whistle before this third and three play Caillat again come in and talk about it delay game off the timeout prior to the file for delay again Oklahoma has called timeout it'll be a certain there'll be a full timeout I really want to work the clock but keep thing going stick it right here frozen missed here in Stillwater whatever the weather is going to be off the lake there in Cleveland when the Ravens and the Browns collide Monday night on ESPN countdown at 6:00 surf I antabuse and then the game at 8:15 kind of nice the Cowboys fans you arrived here with high hopes Baylor goes down at PCU last night and they got excited because the conference title was there for the taking tonight but it's been Oklahoma's it is emphatically grab control third down and a lot of time to discuss this play and they decided to get it to Mayfield on the keeper a lineup gets midfield and just slide down on this now wet drug and I move a six yeah there's the read again and my lay 56 has no chance of being able to get out there and to Baker Mayfield is reading does a good job stays inbounds picks up the first down keeps the clock moving flowers comes around the corner to block somebody there wasn't it W the block now they all collapse down on the zone read now Oklahoma started to work this clock and they can forget about the tempo we're taking a four touchdown lead we filled up under center just for the sake of variety Kendall appear on an election loser you heard I'll be honest I'm really surprised you got to love his competitive spirit very surprising some object Iran is out there now it's remember there's not a big 12 championship game that any did this was it I mean this is it so you can you can understand it and he knows his old body better than anybody I'm just for touchdown lead you're looking at probably a top four bid more than likely I got the time to get rested up respect the fact that he wants to be on this field to secure a big 12 championship to 131 so he's over 3,000 career yards combined in his first two seasons Shepherd we catch made stiff on as to break free hustle down at the 46 let me third down well ask the ball game except on the west coast late local news most of these ABC stations have SportsCenter busy day in college befall on the discussion as you move within one week of the playoff selection committee's final verdict the bracket of four teams to play in the semifinals New Year's Eve in Miami in Arlington Sooners have so far 11 minutes to play made a very strong statement about their worthiness no doubt about that snap it of one and Mayfield flips it in Shepard drop that one so he's had a couple drops tonight to go with his ten catches and the Sooners will find Mayfield 17 to 25 and I think of those 8 8 any completions about 5 have been dropped a couple by Shepherds couple by Neal Seibert boots it down there and everything working for Oklahoma tonight let's just get it to 2 and stop Wow complete Dean yep offense defense special teams Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart broaching by Pacific Life for life insurance annuities and investments to specific life the power to help you succeed Dr Pepper Dr Pepper in college football it's a oneofakind tradition and Jiffy Lube experts around every corner to help you leave worry be high all the emotion of senior night for JW Walsh seems like a long time ago the 107 leaves the Cowboys and Oklahoma went on a tear we have continued to exert dominance here after halftime stretching the lead to 28 Cowboys pin back at their three a little crease knocked down by Jordan Evans and Alexander you know the defensive line from Oklahoma with tapper and Matt diamond Eric striker we know about we've seen Devante bond tonight tonight as well DJ Ward's had opportunities Charles Walker very very talented group good mixture of size and athletic ability and experience very very tough up front the second down run once again gets away and threw a tackle there first hand of the 23 Parker actually stopped them JW still out there playing hard is going to be a coach like his dad and by showing loyalty never considering transferring even though Rudolph had beaten them out they'll always be popular around here and I think Gundy feels will one day be a terrific coach for the rest of the high school level or couch but be interesting to see what choice he makes because of his dad his background and talking to the coaches this week they think it would surprised him to see him want to coach in college and with his legacy and what he's done here in the last four years should be a great addition car drop down now like gun do you play is four years here then when right into coaching at a very young age we play caller at a very young age much like Lincoln Riley is on the other side tonight Gundy already those in years on the job he can't believe how fast the times gone 48 years old down yeah you and I were talking him this week and I said you know I don't know that this year's a little bit of a surprise to him to get to ten wins but he's got a really good job of maintaining consistency if it with this school what he's been able to achieve about long downfield as a man hangs it up in Washington couldn't collect it if all hung up a little bit too long the Sooners recovered Washington's comeback it made a lot of catches against Sanchez this time he goes by him a little tumble boom but that Sanchez he's not going to like the film when he pulls this one out he's lucky because the ball hung up in the air and allowed to safety Parker to come over and help out but if JW Walsh threw this ball on time and didn't put so much air under it that little double blue there by James Washington left 15 once again standing there lost to coverage he's got a rough night tonight both six of 15 and third down Wallace needs 10 topics and now fires and he's broken up again closing with Stephen Parker that's a good series for the safety in his for town I think Parker has the skill set of a corner but he plays safety 61 200 pounds out of Tulsa and I think his emergence this year along with will Johnson these are the guys that when you get against these big 12 offenses you know about the corners in Thomas and Sanchez put in the inside when you have Stephen Parker that can make plays and has ball skills it's a real asset to this defense that Steiner has been way too busy tonight where the Cowboys hopes to win this game Shepard backpedals at the 36 8 26 to go with the Sooners took at the LG v10 moments of the week but again last night that sloppy wild game in Fort Worth TCU outlasting Baylor and overtime Devon waiting for the back so a touchdown pass Clemson's got past South Carolina and that Kois as close as the five point margin the next stop the Tar Heels and Charlotte will have that one for you have a tight battle on the Iron Bowl and picked Eric Henry running the football Oliver hung around yeah this was probably the game of the day Stanford a Notre Dame back and forth back and forth and number six and number seven go down with Baylor and ohter day and losing Buckeyes big win over Michigan not included there but it could be a really important day for Ohio State coming off the home loss to Michigan State as Mixon cuts it back because with Notre Dame dropping out yeah I say lurking around what they were eight there so just really need another ups that are too to put themselves back perhaps into contention damn it puts them and you think Stanford as the two teams kind of waiting to see if they'll being upset at that final weekend whether it's North Carolina and Clemson or is Alabama and Florida which doesn't seem very likely as a recent area Kirkland you don't see one of the Big Ten teams whether at Iowa or Michigan does the winner and indeed not being directly I think they got a lot Oklahoma is secured their spot tonight I think the winner the Big Ten championship game and of course Clemson and Alabama if they win their championship games the thing is if you have somebody stop board one of those who well Oklahoma's done but one of the others were to stumble it to teams just based on all these losses that are piling up in the top ten the two teams are going to be at the discussion will end up being Ohio State and Stanford now remember Stanford still has to play us and attacked all championship game and if they if they were to lose that I think the only team left might be old Urban Meyer an Ohio State hanging around out there free play pathways jumped up side and Westbrook just over his fingertips but they feel do we had a shot downfield the penalty is going to be against the Cowboys and should give Oklahoma first down here Baker was disappointing wanted that deep shot is offside defense number 94 fiveyard penalty results in a first down Jordan Wilford jumped off this was the defacto comprar championship game in the big 12 with a plane nine games through roundrobin you and I'll be in Charlotte for jumps in North Carolina with our crew can't wait for that it's a sellout it's going to be fun Tar Heels just the one loss say they are completely overlooked and they feel disrespected but nearly lost the South Carolina the the other two soft nonconference games eroding some of their credibility but it's been a terrific year for the Tar Heel the Mixon next to cut six free and bulldozes down to the 41 muscles been number one in all four editions and if you figure I stay there you think they'll still be number one I think they were I think you have Clemson Alabama Oklahoma and Iowa I think it's going to hold hold serve here going into that final weekend Michigan State sitting right there at five chance to play number four winner that game you would think will be right right where they want to be in the top four which is mixing again and bound at 35 Bob Stoops still electing to keep his starters in again not having one graphic we didn't have one part of the graphic we didn't have you talked about no longer having the big 12 championship game so there's nothing to worry about they're playing for the big 12 championship right now and these players don't want to come out of the lineup they want to keep playing Bob's got his assignment he and Mike Gundy and their staffs of course will head out and begin recruiting tomorrow it's about a nineday recruiting period that you get the benefit of using if you don't play the final weekend and they will hit the trail hard looking for the next crop of prospects mixed in bulldozing straightahead Pacific Life game summary looking at what was the decisive quarter in this gaming 30point quarter for the Sooners which included the pick six from Jordan Thomas some fireworks from the running campy Ron and mix them along touchdown runs in the first half Stoops and Kirk Ferentz interestingly of Iowa each in their 17year with Frank beaver retiring after this season his Hokies did win at Virginia to secure a bowl but a terrific moment is he buried he didn't leave dabbed a little bit you get to put the laundry really celebrate it was carried off the field his 29th year when he does retire ference and Stoops are next ten year at one school with 17 years and perhaps both headed for the playoff the fire could knock off the Spartans next week all right I wondered about that with the Frank Bieber's stepping down it's amazing Bob Stoops 17 17 years 178 closing in on 179 Baker Mayfield he's a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award which should be awarded at the people award show in Atlanta this year or the first time that makes it fast as it gets the first down driven house inside the 15

and still they're still going to Nick your life to leave if you're one of the paddle people there I think you're required it's Thursday it's still banging away down there I don't think the students are phased mixing breaking free sometimes businesses will tell you that that that noise which is loud down then get going perhaps not as peppy as they they have been at a time when you're up 28 with under four minutes to go it's kind of a well we got a job to do here we're going to look at a keep out everything on this wall here really more sure than anything else does it lets middle day they're still in here Oh breaker from stricken I appreciate it we need the can of guy you can find this group with the champion guys and witness guys out here bro dude on the right broken is paddle that he was no shirt banging on the wall at a twenty eight point game you're criticizing mixes all I said I swatted it's incredible it is incredible it's a good word for is that an assignment or they just do that on their own it's part of the club there's a president of the club it began have been at 90s of his fraternity did that I don't know but though but none of them is left center what is that a reindeer Oh what is this what's going on there third new yard if not the play clock again and it's mixing that's it flag it down he's knocked out he ruled a touchdown we'll check the marker Angus all sides by Oklahoma State it's waiting front of the Oklahoma band they're getting all of the Sooners p ryan gets so much attention the Joe Mixon a lot of times gets forgotten off he said I know I'm wrong that penalty these last six or seven weeks since that Texas loss you watch Mixon long with he ride in the backfield together make sure he the ball getting into the endzone looks like it did from that angle I was the night of these two guys Curt mixed it with 136 into P Ryan 131 and yeah I mean it he is just a really nice compliment and what they've done with their scheme and how they attack now they kind of mirror each other in the backfield you really can't get any kind of hit at all what might be coming next cassadee along with a forward wrap up show after the game as you see really satisfied hugs from lincoln riley is the new component to this oklahoma team the plate cholera came over from East Carolina just 32 years old and for the Sooners this is a sweet celebration they're their regular season is done the field are headed for the bracket Kirk and at the team that had to climb out of the hole of Tennessee strikers Barbour one contender's first lids to look you know it's all about that the hugging down there is Lincoln Riley hunters hug in the offensive guys he talking to defensive guys this is a very hungry football team there's offense hug and defense here with striker and Mayfield it might seem like something of course they're hugging each other you don't always see that a lot of times you'll see the offense on one into the field hugging each other the defense on the team and I think the 85 year a year ago really made him appreciate winning that much more car is knock Sam it's a group that it was splintered it came apart at five loss season but they came together after the embarrassment in the bowl that you talked about earlier galvanized in the spring and then after the loss of Texas which was mysterious they just where they learned something after one script but look at the look at the scores look at the huge production offensively since that one loss and they paid back the Cowboys serve for an upset loss in Norman last year in a big way and their continued to enjoy it dancing around at a topline they're going crazy over there right now great this was already kind of bad but the look the loss at Texas taught them about appreciating playing with an edge playing with a focus that they didn't have that day they've not looked back since that game either they're going to go now to 13 and one these bedlam games when it's a top 25 matchup they've been knocked off and surprised over the years but when with both teams have showed up with some hype it's been the Sooners who have dominated the Cowboys down through the decades oh yeah we got some organization going on right now with the Gatorade roll up we got a minute 36 to go yeah I don't know if it's time know that yet oh there's a brother Ron Ronny made it in Iran Youngstown bricks for a polka we need Youngstown State tailor breaks free and fights hard out near midfield and Bob took the headphones off Gatorade now get sterling shepherd there you got Zack Sanchez Dominique Alexander here two cups look out hit on a swivel play they got him way 25 degrees out it's got to be a great feeling for Bob to you know 17 years is a long time in one school in the modern climate of this sport we've already had a championship and said lost another championship game the urban liar in the Gators he came back and he got reenergized yeah feels better physically than he did a year ago no doubt about it wait would you tell to coach her oddity did he lose this woo oh well did Trevor Knight the two quarterbacks couldn't get their OC incompletion he's got to play along here cowboy down field and Mike Stoops has come down out of the press box with a carryon luggage slung over the shoulder there in step with the Charter home all smiles for Oklahoma a 25 point victory over their rivals from Stillwater and 11 and one season feeling very very good at the recruiting trail tomorrow about their playoff chances coming in at number three even before this high quality road win a TNT strong performance looking at the backfield of Oklahoma tonight's pretty good evening for P Ryan had the big run that really got him going averaging almost eight yards to carry Joe Mixon with P Ryan having an ankle injury got more and more of an opportunity in the second half almost 10 yards of carry and a couple touchdowns himself and it's big solid night again for Baker Mayfield Chris Carson junior running back for Oklahoma State is the player who is being helped off to the sidelines Oklahoma State look at the stats Kirk in hundred and fifty yards they weren't terribly out gain had six yards of play here and JW Walsh on senior night with unable to contribute much his stats will look real good but where's Oklahoma putting this thing away in the second quarter really yes any child cuts it back and the Sooners first contender this playoff to have their business concluded make this a bedlam feet down to claim the big 12 championship their first since 2012 five and out is here against teams ranked to the AP top 25 is suite 1 for all the veterans in the veteran coach Shepard a backflip to Bosh away tonight that included 10 intercepts oh yeah touchdown be careful let's get on to Tom Rinaldi with a satisfied coach student Chris nice very much an absolutely thorough victory in every phase of the game Bob what message do you think this sends to the committee well hopefully we were already in a positive position in the light in the top three and we can only move up I would guess and really proud of a players and system coaches really did a great job 8550 going to go to where you are right now Bob what was the key to this turnaround it was being coming together the way you know they've worked really hard they we've really pushed ourselves in practice it's been a fun group really they've got a great personality for men and great willingness to listen so it's been a great group fun group to coach Baker Mayfield a great performance what pleased you both the block he threw or everything else he did you know that guy's special he just stuck so many he's just so entertaining to watch and and there's no holding him back you know so he had another incredible night out here enjoy this one Bob I Tom thank you let's go to Heather with Baker all right Tom thanks so much Baker Mayfield congratulations big 12 champions for the first time since 2012 now your coach Bob dude this tossed all season about singular focus gain Lovato how did you guys keep that focus and keep your mind on the task at hand today it's been tough but I mean it's been a week to week thing and our seniors and our captains done a great job of keeping everybody else focused and focused on our goal which is first to be filled and then we're we accomplished that right there you have been on quite a journey what makes this team this run everything that you've done this season is just so special we're really close a lot of people don't know that but we're really close team and you don't think that a logical college program and people come from every background but we're really close to it it's fun when it's special like that and Baker it seems like everything's falling into place you check off another goal tonight but your season is finished for now you have one more week to wait and watch the other teams make a statement what is your statement to the committee for that December 6th ranking we already had a nice little ranking in the playoff spot but I think we just made a statement so I don't see how they could leave us out and you guys always talk about being so team oriented and how important this team in the chemistry is that there's also a certain individual award that's potent out there it's called the Heisman you've talked about how important it would be to four how special it would be to get to go to New York what would that mean for you that's like a dream come true that's something you watch as a kid you grow up and you see you get that award show every year and you watch that but I mean I'm only going as far as the team goes so I mean hats off to all my teammates and the coaching staff for getting us ready in winning well congratulations on another gutsy performance speaking of the team Tom Rinaldi is over there with mr. Shepard has it thanks a lot Gerling how special is this so special I was telling the guys before the game I came in as a freshman on one one haven't had the feeling since and I'd love to have it again and boy it feels good your dad played here we played in these games we went on to win a national championship how special is this moment given your family's legacy as part of a single family yeah I mean I throughout my whole career is all I try to do is you keep the legacy going and I think I've done a pretty good job of so far what lies ahead now hey we got to get prepared we got some tough team that are coming up and we got to finish this thing out strong quickly I saw you fly down the field after your quarterback threw that block in the first half what what please give out that play what can you say about him as a leader and my boy is a competitor and he's not scared anything I mean I know you guys heard him say that before but he's not scared of anything he'll go throw blocks from people over it doesn't matter wrinkles were all gone through thank you Chris Tom Beth here Mayfield rocket that ultra flat grim has he the word with some of the sooner fans mixed feelings for his girlfriend and former Oklahoma State soccer player tonight is a fairly happy for her guy but not happy for Walsh and the Cowboys do you've ever well short Manuel agua jr. kissing goodbye almost certainly his last game here as he heads off to the NFL here I know got a scare with that ankle injury but came back to finish the game as well as mixing and listen to there's no shortage of highquality talent of Oklahoma's team but Mayfield and Shepard Kirk both reiterated what we've heard from all of these leaders you can clue Derek striker in that ya there's talent but you need more this team has that something more that that togetherness that chemistry that the championship team search for don't all was fine they're hungry they're a hungry football team after everything that they've been through there have been people that have mocked Bob Stoops in the last few years they've bought these players they talked about Oklahoma is kind of a program of the past they felt that there are a lot of guys that are seniors on this team that I think drive the bus I I just I don't know if I've seen another team in the country that has the love for one another in the way this Oklahoma team does it's one thing to look at the stats to be impressed with the quarterback of the running backs and receivers in the defense but I love to watch this team care and cheer for one another we saw hiyo state make a heck of a run last year when they didn't care about who was getting the attention they just cheered for one another and genuinely love one another this Oklahoma team championship teams have that kind of feel that's what I sense when I've been around this Sooners team the committee had Oklahoma State at number 11 so Oklahoma comes in here wins by 25 points Bob Stoops didn't campaign at the end because didn't felt he needed to Oklahoma makes their statement and again has their regular season complete so they will be able to sit back and watch clemson alabama and that big 10 championship game which figures to feed in one of the teams into the 14 bracket knowing they've got a place and if they don't move up to number 1 2 &amp; 3 will collide it wants to be final and unless Alabama stumbles or Clemson stumbles a move down potentially an Oklahoma Alabama semifinal rematch to that Sugar Bowl when the Sooners got the tide and there were some plants the baby Alabama wouldn't trying that hard didn't mean lon yeah maybe that's right yeah it would add spice they'd be fired up let's make it very clear Oklahoma will advance they're going to be in before whether they're going to be 2 or 3 or 1 or whatever they're going to be you just know as the Sooners fan tonight that you're going to be in the postseason in the top four so much for that myth last year about the big 12 needs a conference championship game to be able to advance into the top floor this year we see Oklahoma without a championship game being able to be crowned the champion of the big 12 they one fact to be in the top four and we'll find out as you said what Clemson does what Alabama does what happens in Indianapolis next week between Iowan Michigan State so the Sooners come off the road to Stillwater and make a strong closing statement to an 11 and 1 big 12 championship season we're off to the ACC championship game next Saturday night see if Clemson can do their part against North Carolina Tarheels also having a great year a big salute to our crew which once again here in Stillwater battled some tough weather conditions the road warriors that we have we appreciate what they do all year long you guys admit so much to us on air so thank you very much for all your hard work of course the talented crew in the truck building out our producer direct male our director and everybody who's helped us on Saturday Night Football for Kirk Heather and Thompson spotters saying so long who saw water support wrap up show coming up right now with Cassidy hover
