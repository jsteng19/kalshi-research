============================================================

I just told me okay show some pride hey you got it right there there you go play hard play a full full football game you cannot allow yourself to be embarrassed and for USC you're not going to see them let up if you're familiar with USC you know that Pete Carroll will continue to go after this Penn State defense they'll continue to try to do everything that they can to put points on the board okay a couple football peoples already that the corners can not play this far against these receivers is there some good at Taliban stop is if they come up to the receivers go by in places first throw of the second hand Ronald Johnson sophomore from Muskegon we Penn State is a cover three defense they're predominantly is sown defense they'll mix in some zone pressures but because you play a cover three defense and we've talked about this and we'll show you more in the second half what we mean by that but you are exposing yourself if a quarterback has time to the vertical passing game to the skinny post and that's where Mark has had most of his success the aerial show continues great grab but the point that the football men this couch made to me when I was out in back and without to see Joe pop is that they're just giving him so much of a cushion but these guys can turn to the sidelines as Williams did there they can come back into the front and they said that USC looks at a lot more bumpandrun against the pac10 than they have here yeah again I think the football men might have that is a maybe an adjustment but I think if you're looking at what Penn State is doing typically I think their concern our tight you know third and short 31 they're gonna get tight I think they're concerned about the speed just a speed of going right and quick move and around them it's just not what if that's not what you do then it's tough to make that adjustment and all of a sudden do that for Tom Bradley they've got to continue to try to hope that their plant works and you know that the big thing is forget the secondaries getting exposed right now but Brent the defense of mine is really getting exposed Mark Sanchez has had a number of times where he's just sitting back there reading the defense and having time to throw you've got to get somehow get some pressure on Sanchez Joe McKnight injured out so Stefan Johnson of the 13 and moneybags and busted and Sanchez makes the most out of it let's go down below now Alicia well Brenda I was speaking to a Penn State wide receivers coach Mike McCurry as he was coming out of the locker room and as Kirk said you know where do you start he said look we just we've got to keep our poise we did things in that first half stupid things that we didn't do all year long with the penalties as you guys already know Joe Paterno did not come down to the locker room to talk to the guys but he did send them a message he told them to play Penn State football guys and that has not been the case so far in this game making far too many mistakes seven penalties 62 yards have a 45yard run called back first down Johnson let's not forget what USC has been able to do here I mean we could talk a lot about Penn State's miscues but I think when you're overmatched in certain areas you press and you do some things that are uncharacteristic but that's see their first possession was a three and out and after that touchdown touchdown field goal touchdown touchdown and the adjustment that they made only was forget about playing this game in a four mood let's get this game to the outside where we have the big advantage with our receivers in our core battle in the football tried the Blitz Sanchez steps away hi and complete dr. Turner they receiver working the near sideline Sanchez upset that he got that way too hard what's your feeling about Mark Sanchez and what do you think the scouts will come back what will they say about mark I know you've talked to a lot of fun yeah I think Mark Sanchez will have the option to really evaluate himself and think about his future because he's every bit as talented physically as any of these other quarterbacks it might be coming out this year into the draft but I think if you talked to mark he still feels that he can develop and improve and we look at surround him almost everybody returns to this office with exception a Patrick Turner de veau brought down beautiful the junior from Mill Hill Pennsylvania comes for a big stop that's a big play there is a DirecTV ultimate picture cam the penetration we just talked about is essential to these linebackers having a chance to make a play and eat up the blocks up with the defensive line and then you have Hall and Bowman and sales that have to be able to get the penetration that time Hall is able to do that and now you put Sanchez into a uncomfortable third and 15 situation USC seven of nine Don's here today this one's at Tuffy 15 yards a days receiver open and he but it's short of the first down once again look at this water sure is with Damian Williams but he had a separated shoulder against UCLA there's some people wondering how much would he be able to play in his football game we saw him at practice he looked pretty good until the sudden he is healthy and he is showing on a huge stage that he's one of the top receivers in the country the timing outstanding he took a shot there on the shoulder and comes they got a favorable spot that's for sure pretty much nobrainer with Pete Carroll because here he is zinc with a smile it orders Dawson you don't for the smile Sanchez may be falling behind Christopher Oh Dow tax and sooner buyers Heather the guards with gout first down but going back to your question Brent about Sanchez and his future obviously you'll eventually be in the NFL I just really believe it with because the entire offense comes back again without Patrick Turner it allows him a chance to continue to grow continue to develop and if you ask him he would tell you there's still some areas that he feels that he could improve they've been nicked a little bit yeah on that snake a little push there with the snake pushed off that right foot might have tweaked his calf like he was trying to stretch it out gable running back trying to get to the short side it's clogged up and he makes the most out of it on the sidelines Tony Davis coming away with the football the only thing that could prevent this from being a fumble of course as if gable is backside touched the ground before the ball came out is not that is a clean fumble Davis did a great job and Gables gonna be back in the doghouse remember I told you earlier he bumbled on the first series against UCLA is ripped free in the Davis's gun I decided to redecorate our living room but no matter what I did and then I figured it out it wasn't the firm what so I used the cash I got back to redecorate my husband earn unlimited cash back is your city cash returns card to make every dollar count whatever your story is your City cash returns card and can help you write it because city never

central awesome on ABC the ruling on the field is confirmed first down Penn State plainly resumed after the media timeout Rogers reading the coordinator of officials for the SEC is up here he wasn't even earlier he said that's a fumble guys first you confirmed it with that definitive oh yeah that baby's out Rodgers comes in what we do like drama we don't have to end the first series of the third quarter never count the Lions out now here they go for pride there's no question Stephan green let's say this is the key replay it that's I think you folks should see this clearly at home that ball was out it looks like Josh Gaines the captain in there stripping that football got attack I mean your Penn State player you're the quarterback Terrell Clark never gave up keep attacking downfield gotta make plays moister out with a knee injury Clark gonna try it what's a block from Waller Waller's saw the player coming in behind and Clark wanted him to move downfield oh then he starts to run and he wants to pick up a block you get remember you're not playing Purdue when you point you better take off Terrell Clark look at Clay Matthews coming from behind to chase you down he runs a 4 or 5 coming off the edge so Darrell Clarke has great speed which is POTUS Clay Matthews who chased him down rather easily USC has pitched eight secondhalf shutouts this season third and five plenty of time steps away into trouble now throws got it and he finally found Williams Wow Derrick Williams had a little daylight and this is perhaps the best throw at a game under pressure an outstanding throw Clark showing again the presents there but Matthews does not give up on the play but well I was impressed with it's not just Clark drawing the football but to strength to be able to be running backwards away from Matthews and then to throw an accurate ball downfield towards the sidelines as Matthews is closing in on you for the second straight play which it's curious option lock keeps it and takes a lick from maze maze moving up from centerfield he's another than youngsters who's going to have his future evaluate he's a junior the family's a little bit torn he's a little bit short of a degree is my definitely want you to come back and pop some played in the was telling the other day well we're gonna take a few days off after this game let honk allow are you allowed to look that good in your uniform now there should be a rule he's 63 235 pounds and he runs a 4 to 8 he's the fastest player on the USC roster it's against the rules during sex during slipped on the Florida more pressure here on Gerald Clark begin to execute on a third down on that offensive line this is usually where Pete Carroll Nick Holt worked their magic when they get these teams to the Rose Bowl in the third down situation there's an occult the defensive coordinator and Pete Carroll's because she's you're gonna find creating havoc on down see where they bring the pressure havoc extra little day those underneath to grin well short of the first down hallelujah picking up the running back ma Eluga almost certain to go somewhere in the first ribbon exit NFL press a small thing but again accuracy important throw the ball in front of grain if you throw it in front of grain he catches the ball and it's man coverage he's able able to maybe turn the corner at least have a chance but by coming back to the football way too fast and easily makes the play on green 317 what up the edge the blindside and steps out of bounds but it's short of the first down USC football that was young Everson Griffin closing in from the backside the sophomore lost his starting job at again state game but he'll be the starter next year it looked like he almost knew the snap count he got off so well he guessed he guessed right he got the fresher and of course Penn State comes up short here small big maximum a lot four little Nissan Versa 34 mpg and the largest passenger interior volume in his class for under

out there would like to see if USC hangs on how many of you would like to see USC play the winner I see Oklahoma for today raise your hands uhhuh Stadium I thought so everybody up here let's try to +1 my friend we all want to see that six minutes Johnson stopped it a lot of illegals time imagine that imagine USC looking like this winter the Oklahoma Florida game a week later and that's gonna be your another well that will be a graceful spear war last two Heisman quarterbacks for me look at Penn State's defense the struggles here today out on the Rose Bowl against this SC offense that is healthy clicking for Sanchez and the draw three steps slang say Patrick to you when penn state goes back to look at the tape of this football game they're gonna see that the slant and they're especially gonna see that the post both the same concept movement towards from the outside coming in to the inside it has been there all day for number six and he's taken full advantage of it sanchez has now thrown for 309 yards we know the record for passing ends protectors it's about to be broke upon vandergelder if you keep them in a day always free or die the record is first and ten Williams goes in motion completed a deep welcome record was set against Penn State Danny O'Neill threw for 456 losing effort in a losing again but frequently as you know the losing quarterback will throw you sure you left stranded aback Argentine fellow trying to get back to the end yeah just depends on if Mark Sanchez wants to stay in this game and if they want to keep him in the game because at this pace is he's gonna have a shot Williams has 147 ago joy right straight ahead and there is Mark Tyler Wendell's son great shirt freshman miss last year because of an injury and he has a fine of side there's a flag thrown on the near side before the snap false start number 86 any offense fiveyard penalty it remains second down you know back in 1976 and I would guess that that our friend Dick Vermeil certainly remembers what pops did in that game Windell Tyler ran wild and revealed at UCLA they've lost a regular season game against Ohio State and Woody Hayes they came out on 123 210 Windell Tyler washed 21 times 472 yards and three steps outside drop drops the Primera today because Bowman he rattled Williams cage did he football player Navarro with only a sophomore you'll be on most of thee think about the big tent conference and what it's been through over the course to the last five or six years in bowl games really the warm chance you have as a conference to kind of flex your muscles and show what you can do and they have been struggling especially in the high profile bowl games and this one will be added to the list knocks it off the Russian Johnson will not get the first down set the screen pass with the running back and the punny team trots onto the field very boy dick that's their second part we'll see Williams again going back Williams he'll touch it again into the end zone there is a penalty flag we had about it Penn State looked like they had about 14 or 15 guys but a few guys trying to get on and off the field and I don't know if it was that or its offsides or what it might be but there's a lot of confusion there I think Penn State may be expecting USC to go for it there but a lot of players running off the field when the ball was snapped and you can to do that oh it looks like it's on SC by that reaction go as a substitution violation on the offense they went straight to the line and snap the ball that pileus decline it'll be Penn State ball on the 21st of ten but you counted for TV a lot of good four of them we're on the feet that's why so mad you put your foot down and it just goes instead of saying I love it's awesome truck just kicked into gear the trailer it was a smooth ride fantastic that's how we roll all season long to let an ESPN asked you to show us her game face and we want to thank everyone who submitted their

cell phone or computer call 1800 DIRECTV we welcome you back to the 95th Rose Bowl game presented by city well folks Rogers running the coordinator of officials for the SEC straight me out on this when the offense jumps out like this you have got to give the defense alive but therefore what 57 is they were all over that ball so you've got to give the defense time he he tried to trick they worked but it'll be lit the Alliant ball coming out for the 20yard Beechum the truth underneath the blanket pollution or the field guards so some of the youngsters land old is still out there token and there you see sophomore from Lawrenceville New Jersey and brought back that'll be one of the main receivers for the Nittany Lions next year second down and five for Darrell Clark Clark is thrown for a hundred and four five yards here today Sanchez of course bread hot between Beecham's first carry of the game freshman as you pointed out of her reach our audience to the first half from Youngstown Ohio just like his quarterback Terrell Clark offsides on the defense number 26 that penalty will be declined play results in a first on Harris it's amazing to think this defense has six three years starters of course one of them not playing Ellison it's what you see will Harris out there but the knowledge of this defense allows them to place so fast nine defenders invited to play in allstar games five to the Senior Bowl for the eastwest Shrine for unanswered points target for which they titled at 70 now wide open but low inside the 30 with a nice run after the catch Dion Butler the senior from wool bridge Virginia Dion Butler come into this football game to compete he's the fastest receiver that the Penn State Nittany Lion offense has he looks like he keeps that right knee up and then he just won't stop I mean we saw that in the first half from number 20 and wine makes the catch look at the right knee he may a touch you man touched nonetheless if they go back and look at it the effort is what I think you have to appreciate they're going to go up and take a look like the right knee did medias play is under further review you should take it back to the 40yard line he's trying to say come on man help me yeah right me Brent so I could touches the ground that's what you plead for the NFL but Butler coming off the huge game against Michigan State where he had three catches in 133 yards speaking of the NF that for road teams are underdogs in the first round of the playoffs they said you got to keep me kept apace away was that the field yeah the favourites are they other the home team's all a the Colts favorite of the Chargers going in slight favorite yeah yeah whoo Eagles a favor love Minnesota okay Ravens go down to I have to review the Penn State receivers knee was down after the catch therefore the ball will be placed at the 40yard line it'll be first in ten Penn State so and now makes it a 27yard can the other ones Atlanta Oh going in what are your Matt Flacco in it Matt Brian rookie quarter steps it out since when I really get excited to watch dinner film that's not it start already great really good you take those rest goes to the playoffs down now let's go to first down and ten back in is the money back with free arts or that Greeson polygamy playing his final game from the project number 58 there you have it a total of three touchdowns allowed in the second half no team no team has scored against Ken Norton linebackers and the holds defensive front and secondary no team has scored more than seven points in the second half against these guys that's I've stopped this defense has been adjustments or legendary from Pete Carroll every year but especially this year with his group second issue to the 15yard line like Henley flag on the would headtohead there I think he got the better shot on Kevin Thomas his own player he had both cops it takes a lot of courage to come into the middle of that defense knowing the tailor maze is getting come in and and take a shot on you I know it is obviously shaken up here the ruling on the play was an incomplete pass there was a personal foul on the defense helmet the helmet contact number two that'll be a 15yard penalty from the previous spot keep in mind TaylorMade 63 235 pounds here as wormwood comes to the middle of his defense goodness that's why the rule is there oh that's and I appreciate these safeties wanting to be aggressive but that's exactly you see in the NFL and Sundays I just can't do that not lead with your head but a receiver like that is unprotected very happy to see Norwood from that hit from TaylorMade first and ten furries across the 15yard line close to another first down nice job here by this this offensive line being able to get a push there you see the big tide in Corliss there's green I mean Green has come in here he played some football this year coming into the night he's averaged about five and a half yards to carry 500 21 yards on the year but he's done a nice job picking up to the place here that the boy stur so we reached the end of the third quarter and this presentation of the Rose Bowl game presented by Citi we

carry for the first down what's interesting at this point in this football game USC comfortable lead but we keep talking about how s is shut out eight of their 12 opponents in the second half and don't think right now that's not on the minds of Nick Holt Pete Carroll and the USC defense way to talk about competition and competing and that's really what they pride themselves on they're well aware of that and they want to try to keep the Lions out of this end zone Darrell Clarke scored the only touchdown on a quarter first down at the 10 yard line to take off to the right as you got a block down at bub scooped up by the Trojans the back defensive tackle I'm sure they'll take a peek at this it looked like the possibility is more was chasing down Clarke from behind looks like a possibility of his his knee touching let's take a real good look here down yeah it looks like he's down now it's a speed of Kyle war coming from behind to chase him down the ball comes out we'll take

saved by instant replay and you can take a look at this and it does appear Yahoo's Kirk like like he was down we have to appreciate that USC chasing him down trying to get school oh they do not wanna let them to me okay second in go so one of those backers is watching to the quarterback the short side and he's shorter the end zone throwdown coming up it's one thing to have speed it's another thing to have knowledge and experience that allows you to even play faster so defense keeps saying it that they lost five guys from last year's defense three in the first round and yet here this year with nine senior starters Taylor Mays and throw in there these guys are just a veteran group that's why you see the pride when Penn State gets down inside here can you see that nasty attitude you're gonna put Williams blip they are too top year spring learn got Williams that's where they split him way out in the Nittany Lions second half touchdown against the two potions and guarantees you have to appreciate we keep talking about us seize pride but Penn State's showing a little bit of pride themselves by driving this fall down deep in the USC territory Williams actually knocks back will Harris before the balls in the air to find a little bit of an opening in that end zone and once he makes the catch he is hit pretty good but holds on to the football suck it on the extra point Kevin Kelly

end of the day for me and my college career just understanding exactly what I needed to do stick right with us here and Fergie will say Sanchez not calling it off he and Carol are still going to only feel with the strike but let's go back to that game and Keyshawn talk about that brilliant day for yourself bill for the program well you know this was a football team that come in to Los Angeles and it was a cinderella story the purple Stadium everyone was talking Northwest they're not much about us and we felt a little disrespected and we wanted to go with a bang most of our seniors in and we wanted to leave this leave this city and in all of what could happen for the Trojan nation down the line first down and ten we've got some movement at a totally five kids what's it like being back around a college atmosphere I mean you worked so hard on the NFL game it you and I both know the college game in the NFL games so different what's it like to be back to the energy was it's it's interesting you know this this is fun in the NFL things are about money it's economics and when you look at college you're just out there you're playing for education you're playing to have fun you're playing to make money we're in the NFL Brett there's an investment for the owners they're investing in players to put them in Super Bowls to fill the seats so it's totally different in college football so after they flip is turn I'm gonna talk with ki about this play because we have seen Turner we've seen Williams we've seen all these guys have an ability here's the DirecTV ultimate picture cam the scene against this covered three look it's like pitching tents for Sanchez with his receiver if he throws in rhythm and he in the wide receiver steps on the total right there of the defender it closes a cushion get inside of in San Jose the 12th a just throw that ball and rhythm can't stop it at all then guys Sanchez now is 26 to 33 350 yards and three touchdowns first down and I know however you talked about all these four as Keisha is sentence got wide open touchdown Johnson 45yard touchdown Toronto safety in the middle for some reason bites up McCoy the tiein is there but look at this of all the players USC has had a field day this time it's row Joe Ronald Johnson getting behind but strata who's had a rough outing today for this penn state secondary out of position another easy throw to learn sanchez teach now these guys are playing like they might want to play the winner of the oklahoma florida game well they could be playing that get in that game if there wasnt Florida State we'll come right back but Kirk Herbstreit aqui Shana Diwali this crossover has more cargo space than the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander and they can't beat its fuel economy with an

Bell think outside the bun and the Home Depot you can do it we can help a USC well consecutive victory here two years ago it was bish again a year ago Illinois and now it is Penn State feeling the sting of this Pete Carroll post dynasty out here in Southern California fall on the tee now for Bella sort of the 20 and guy just go back you know just a simple stutter go move on a bootleg action in the corner is looking in the backfield you can't look into the backfield curtain on a playaction and that's exactly what this corner yesterday the corner was confused in this case it's fun but also we talked about the safeties maybe the safety look at spur ATO even Rubin there's hesitation and that's where you have a great running game complemented by the playaction and the athletic ability of Sanchez it just has put too much pressure on the secondary today for Penn State Sanchez now was 400 yawns that's a USC rose gonna go deep down in mobile incomplete now all time was Danny O'Neill Keesha 456 yards but he threw 61 times Sanchez's for only 34 points you see the pac10 to see us if they hold up here nine straight what's ironic coming into this game the average margin of victory was 25 points in a straight look at it right now twentyfive points again I mean what is the difference between a near mine I think we'd all know the answer the pac10 especially us see how they take on a big Tennessee well I think you you look at the speed first and foremost we run a promo style offense and defense here at USC as they get ready for the NFL and you will contains across the country 20 kids in Southern California California general were grabbing the best players in other states we're going to New Jersey we're going to Arkansas grabbing transfers and that's how we're building this couple of questions ever Stefan green until a couple yards T Shanda I'd like to know how it is that Pete Carroll has been able to put together a dynasty I used USC's always big blue let's make no mistake not the best of them at this body of war by this coaching staff over the last seven years it's one of the greatest stretches of any school mr. Poole you have to buy into the system then I think pchannel has sailed the system in any time you have good salesmen that's what you have to do you have to sell something he sold the University of Southern California he's sold USC he sold the idea guys you can graduate please go on and be successful in the National Football League if you're successful in college and if magic come back to USC finished those of all the sort of things that he's selling to his recruits not only that he's a good person in Chipping the thing I've been impressed with you see the dominance there's okay the most impressive thing to me and this isn't a challenge for every great coach and every great program complacency and the focus on the individual goals like it's not eroded this program that's the most impressive women well I think that is the case sometimes you guys are get away your microwaves away jerks they'll get away but I think will you talk about the things that's going on with this Tolkien was just teaching them if you play at the level that we're asking you to then you'll be successful and you'll have an opportunity to get that money we start pushing in on another play along with will Harris on that tee shot I want because we talked about the great talent and I know that you have to this play some of these treasures will be drafted I know that I felt closely and of these defensive stories like tries to throw it downfield and makes a fine play and let's take a little replay look at this one this young man has been making plays this entire game for Penn State really the one area that has shine is when number three has been able to make plays he sets them up to the inside comes back actually Harris loses him and once the corner loses him Clark delivers the football takes his shot at the end then it's another shot up high this time by Clay Matthews who seems like he's been in the backfield of Penn State the entire game unless the 35 yard gain we say that grams ugh to the left Dion averaging 30 yards a catch here today the new site incomplete data bounced out we go to hkey shines lifted tell us about well I think you got it right I think raised a number one pick Clay Matthews would probably have climbed his way up to the second round I'll he'll test will depend where he goes I think Kevin Allison he's probably a second third round guy there and as you go down I think Patrick Turner has the ability and he's playing well the second half of this football season has hit billion depending on how well he runs decline into the second you know middle that second round high thirdly I'll try for a situation for himself second out of 10 verax pretty great speed 10/2 and he's down at the 50yard I heard me take a look at this room this offensive line hasn't had her a minute moments like this page starting the backfield watch him be able to slip off through the tackler this case it's Matthews and then that's the acceleration that Greene can bring to this office yeah boy stur coming back next year and also Green coming back to this Penn State offense once he got away from Matthews is great blocking down especially at the second level in the talent level there are some juniors they're talking about coming out of school you know I'm not a strong advocate of juniors going into the NFL why do that well because first of all they really can't cut the football team they're young and they need to stay in school Clark and zone okay then he missed him he let bracket down there and then he could have run up six Brackins slides down to silence him he's coming right towards you Williams breaks to the inside little wheel round down the sideline and Clark anticipating Brackett being open just overthrows him tshh on what you're feeling about Darrell Clarke as you watch him against this great defense what I'm not thinking you know this defense is one of the best in college football history it'll go down there's one of those defenses and I think he's done a tremendous job at times of getting to his receivers the flute part you have to have balance against USC you have to run from Oregon State and then put the football in the air so right now for he's done a pretty good job there's Williams with even with that quick pass outside my Ava's plated just an outstanding game is so nice because he doesn't get the publicity that my won't look good pushing it and it's nice to see him well you know I had a chance to talk to him and practice the other day and I told him to cut his hair this is what gives me my power bet you didn't talk to that's going to be down and it's the fullback that was Lawler Danny Lawler that's his second carry of the game before that snap CPD sees it he sees it give me a timeout give me a timeout she thought out

nothing better I know that USC is about to become the first school ever to win three straight rows Penn State Stephan Johnson and you know a lot of coaches have tried through the years but only Pete Carroll has been able to win no three in a row John McCabe Woody Hayes happy Waldorf Bo Schembechler Don James Caroline might have won four in a row except for a fella by the name of Mitch Yahoo because you run out of things to say about Pete Carroll and USC it's like watching Tiger Woods play golf just so dominant this will be nine straight games they've now beaten the big tent by an average margin of 25 points as I said it was by an average of 25 points coming into tonight's game with eight straight so they decided to match that number tonight just for fun to make it now nine straight this is a fourth down punt coming up we do consider gonna let this window roll down now we had a lot of fun at the directors dinner the other night Cloris Leachman that was Wonder Dancing with the Stars flick of my man friend that was my first shot to dance for the real star how do you what a graciously we're out if we thought maybe one dance you waited in line thirteen year old about five deep when we thought he's going to get impatient but no no no no you waited to 20 minutes to get here you know you know the land for the most my wife are late but usually waited your turn you get out of the decision and then you went we thought he's not gonna he doesn't exactly go for one dance sure enough you did the one dancer then they went a little bit of uptempo on ya and you did the second then it's a second bench and you guys just had a great time by the way Dancing with the Stars there comes with Eva which she was a huge hit on the Rastus is it starts again season a to becoming the ABC on Monday March 9th so I don't know if you want to I don't know if you want to walk it my mouth I think I've ever seen one they have got my man line down for me and that paint it all pottery you enjoy sir whoa you're going back we are kids another first down so the first team to score more than seven as we told you short with any second half 13 games at is just accomplished sprained and they misfire on I think the biggest difference we keep talking about SC burst a big 10 the thing that I see and I think people miss this they think its speed as in just the receivers and then truth the skill of these teams I see a difference in the speed of the linebackers the defensive linemen the offensive linemen when I say there's a difference in speed between us see in the Big Ten that's where I see it I mean that that's where there's a huge upside huge advantage to the Trojans against these teams they face second intend now remember that hit he took earlier that helmettohelmet back out there with a reception picking up the first down maze that's I made to stop again it took another head here a veteran group of wide receivers the Penn State will be losing Derek Williams T on Butler takes a blast and this keeps going good balance lady who's slipping coming through that line and pushing and wrestling it down inside that fiveyard line though nice burst 195 pounds freshman out of the Bronx it's like he's down I would be the second money back to go down heaven oyster injured his left knee in the first half early in this game and has not has not returned Royster had carried six times her brief for 34 yards when he was injured and now it's Stefan Green and that would be Brandon Beecham coming back in so reminder to all to stay tuned after the game for Americans Funniest Home Videos over most of these ABC stations and of course over at ESPN there will be a Sports Center football special and we'll hear from the coaches and some of the players who have highlights from from all of the tball action today am I right Nebraska did the brass wind up did did they get a win over Clemson yes George Hill and Bryan Molson they've been in charge of following these games for us we want to thank them and how about your guy Darren brown over here at had a job he's done the heck of a job he helped me with the bus driver negotiate any kind of negotiations those short that's a fog couple innocent did somebody tell me the other night that there was shanell great as I said about five to ten minutes to write up to the gateway of the game as a movement down in the trenches now this is uh this has been some bull season for the UH for the pac10 Tom Hanson's last year's commissioner we certainly number 64 on the offense fiveyard penalty it remains second down we were he had his wife nothing but the best of their retirement yep he's not a great sign for the years what a way to go hot with this conference no games you can't beat that the daily sweet if that was he pushed complete the flight down USC that time just playing straight man coverage coaches told us that he played very very well yeah seizure who has battled through so many injuries and forest a CEO and his left leg came back battled through that tore his ACL his right leg battled through that had a lot of injuries but his senior year showing the NFL and more importantly helping his team be a complete defense opposite of Kerry Harris is a solid Coral by that defense attorney there's close it in for a touchdown Norwood caught it I thought the defensive lineman jumped but we'll let them sort this out if it was it's a touchdown and the Nittany Lions playing much better in the second half Austin number 93 on the defense that penalty will be declined touchdown it's Everson Griffin he tied one perfectly in the first half but not that not this mad this time free play for Darryl Clark and again for the second time here in the second half not only do they score a touchdown but they have success throwing to Clarke's left it's nice move the coaches would tell you of the grouper receivers is probably the best route runner finds a little seam there comes up this cool and will the bull cup challenge stand these we might end you can see unbeaten come in and let go five a no and again it's based on percentage so that would make that would cram them the champion now the Big East three and one Conference USA and big 12 SEC all playing well I think you got a look at the big 12 they're sitting in three and one still three games left really I mean I know we're caught up in a packed head and for good reason they got five and all of it I can't tell you how many times you and I did radio shows throughout the year and heard people say oh the big twelves overrated its average offense and terrible defense and so far still long way to go so farther they're showing that somebody actually says average offense yeah I heard that a lot you got to be kidding I heard I heard it was our own air would say the defenses are horrendous and it's just that can see wondering about the defense okay because Oklahoma State didn't hold up against right against Oregon right tonight I can honestly listen to that chatter yeah you don't like the chatter about the well I think they're just plain wrong about the office works it's not even close from Hibbing they've got great running backs great wide receivers are the best backs in the country maybe we've ever seen pop the bottle I think barfi not a lot of people will probably disagree with me is telling fish this off to 14 margin right now because I'm starting to think that quarterbacks may be more important the college gave them they are the NFL I'm not put them down no no that's what's the system yeah it's the way the game's evolved we'll be watching this in April how the majesty of Augusta and again the first and second round coverage of the Masters will come in April on ESPN now I step I believe I believe I was told by the executives that they will show it live during the afternoon it get come back at night and so many people are working love to see the replay of it that night coming on at Augusta last April date yes great job of getting walltowall coverage and I look it's great to see a masters promo that means her close to getting out of the winter he's kidding me pounds come in underneath Adam Goodman handling the ball you know it's an interesting question Harvey because with quiche not up here we talked about firstround draft choices with USC but as you look across the board with Penn State I see some offensive linemen that may go huh yeah I mean you see some linemen I mean if this is a veteran group Derek Williams Deion Butler Jordan Norwood the receiver Saul can he get looks in the league but on defense most of these guys have come back with the exception of Aaron Maybin who's a defensive end who has to make a decision Tom McShea feels that her Maybin is one of the top defensive players out there I think I look at that and I see a lot of great players or whatever Meghan just my opinion he's got a lot of physically and just maturing we just talked about that with Keyshawn Johnson he's only a sophomore what shirts off me I totally agree about maybe having a seat I've been up close during the practice field he would be making a huge mistake yeah a huge misstep he needs to develop when you grow a little bit more I always think some of these youngsters know how physical that is at the next level or what they stepping into has been caught by the by the Trojans I mean I I hate to see the youngsters leave early you know and I uh I got to her I think it's really underrated by a lot of the Scouts and that's Tim Tebow down at Florida ight I just think the youngster is a winner in a bad organization Scituate ake Detroit think up the first one right now they didn't win a game you get somebody like Tebow in there your pocket passer he can create so many things among when he's in trouble you haven't got a great offensive ayah I don't know what you think about down you go but he throws well on a Friday I think if he were built differently and didn't run over the top of safeties and people have a better appreciation for his ability to throw but the intangibles to me of that decision believable he's kind of created a new platform as far as I'm concerned when it comes to intangibles so Sam Bradford there's talk about him coming out a little bit more of a prototypical NFL style quarterback although he'll have get under the sarin take stance a lot of people feel that he'll come out and between he and Matthew Stafford the quarterback of Georgia could be one of the first picks over all in the draft if they decide to come about these Nittany Lion fans will never give up a 14 and they are just hanging tough jazzy's battling you have to give the Nittany Lions playing the second half with a lot of remember my second half adjustment playing playful fried and lets you talk to Joe Paterno yes there's that same thing that he said and they they have definitely done that obviously USC has changed these Nittany Lion fans want another touchdown right now they want to close down here I want to make this a sevenpoint game in it USC dominated Ohio State second week of the season Malaga intercepted and scored on a touchdown in the first half they were number one in the country Penn State with a tough game in Columbus Rubin forcing that fumble and the Nittany Lions upset the Buckeyes and then Texas Tech shocked number one Texas down in Lubbock that night on the Crabtree grab talked about Bradford leaping to the Heisman inst Oklahoma State but there's been no better symbol of effort and courage and how to play the game than Tim Tebow leading the Gators into that BCS that's figures to be now I tell you I have never see group of fans railings is alive as these days they want this other touch dang sure do this was real fair catch by Derek postgame coverage with John Saunders break James Doug Flutie from Pasadena they'll at the Rose Bowl trophy presentation they all have the offensive and defensive MVPs they'll make that announcement three minutes now for the Nittany Lions Darryl Clark look at the effort on the other side Sanchez trying to rally the get on the release and it's intercepted picked off as the receiver goes down and it was grabbed by will Harris it's a nice job here the stunt Clay Matthews who seems like he has been in the face of Darrell Clarke this entire game over the tide in and then works to the inside in the offensive line loses him Jim cut work to the inside the back I think it is a young back Brandon Beecham probably should have picked him up and instead released as an outlet loud matthews to get in there and there's an opportunistic defense seeing a ball that's tipped and somebody coming up with a catch in this game will Harris poreless is the receiver we slip here's Stefan Johnson and he is thrown down by AJ Wallace and if you if you've watched the entire football game I think you have to respect what Penn State has done but also realize that the game plan and the approach from USC has changed up 31 to 7 things changed a little bit offensively for USC sure they kept attacking and kept trying to put points on the board but not with the same severity and enthusiasm that I think they did in the first half but I in my opinion you don't take anything away from what USC is accomplished they've dominated this football game with that said you put an asterisk next to that and tip your cap to Penn State for not quitting and coming back and at least trying to make it respectable I don't think that the bait will be about us see in the AAP personally when all the Bulls are over I think if there's any debate that's again going to be if Texas really works Ohio State in Oklahoma beats Florida I think that would become the big debate and how ironic its Texas and Oklahoma yet again and another debate for the AP for Sanchez Stephan Johnson you know we talked about Mark Sanchez and reminds me that here in Los Angeles they've got almost 5 million Latinos live here and many of them are Mexicans and they have really elevated Mark Sanchez to star status here he's that he's a hero with the mexicanamericans and I know that his father Nick encouraged him to take an advanced Spanish class and that's so he could conduct interviews with the Spanish networks here and he's closing in on another win which would make his record 14 and 2 as a starter he's just an outstanding young man I talked with Steve Sarkisian a lot this month about Mark Sanchez and he said you know we probably put a lot on in this year we and an inexperienced offensive line we weren't consistent enough running the football put a lot on him and slowed his process down but he said as far as his physical ability you put him in that Carson Palmer type of physical ability with the athletic ability the arm strength he also said mentally they do more at this point with Mark Sanchez according to Steve Sarkisian than they did with Matt Leinart or Carson Palmer as far as checks at the line controlling the run game controlling the pass protection getting it in and out of plays well as for the big ten they still haven't won a Rose Bowl since 1999 that's when Barry Alvarez in Wisconsin beat Stanford and Ty Willingham Penn State came into this Rose Bowl having won three straight bowl games and nine of their last 11 but detail is about to become the first coach to win three consecutive Rose Bowls over his head netday lives with a chance here in the last 30 seconds Cooper Stevenson just a snack this one just a little huh I mean that is for the few mistakes we've seen from USC Stephenson juiced whoo he goes good four or five feet for top of the punter Boyd penn state without a timeout getting up 37 yards on that bitch now a lot of folks in Nevada feet down and 10 tried to get it off there was minsu's again then kylemore so you've got both of them more number 84 matthews 47 they brunt malukas well more has had a great football game and there's 47 again at Clay Matthews normally checks in 31 seconds to go down complete the butler but Butler's gonna be well short of the end zone but they don't have any timeouts and Harris was there whatever Harris came to the outside used to leverage to make Butler go back to the inside to keep that clock moving nice play there by Kerry Harris here's the third down stops the clock to give himself a fourth down here with seven seconds to go they'll be thrown into the end zone on this the wheels still turnin here remember the Rose Bowl presentation right after the game down on the field Clark has had some success last couple times they've been down here throwing to his left flying Derrick Williams head also toward Norwood the USC was a little bit concerned about him rolling left when they mentioned to us that they had seen on tape that he can still throw pretty well and going in that direction deadball delay of game number 17 on the offense fiveyard penalty it remains fourth down probably not going to change the play call here for Darryl Clark and Penn State again let's see if he looks to his left he's got Butler who will be at the top in Norwood in the slot cause a lot to the end zone jump ball intercepted threw it up for grabs in the Harrises hands three in a row for Pete Carroll and the USC Trojans first time in history Steve Sarkisian flips his quarterback before he goes to the airport and as the next plane to Seattle Mark Sanchez throwing 413 yards here today's a USC Rose Bowl records at a long day Joe Paterno let's go to Lisa thanks a lot Brent you're shivering a little bit alright I know the game was pretty much out of hand but what were you thinking when the ball went sailing over your punter oh I lost my mind for a moment there but we stopped them you know we got out of the defense game for one last time like they've done all year long this is a great opportunity for us to have a big time matchup and get a win I love this this win for us and we're really really thrilled about it so here we are another Rose Bowl another dominant USC performance what was the difference do you think in this I think offense was on fire the first half I thought mark this set that set the tempo Damian Williams came through Patrick Turner go line really protected well so we had a chance to really get moving on these guys it was at 24 points 2nd quarter how are you guys really able to just change the game well you know I don't know what the over the years we've hit it when all of a sudden we go we go you know and we just just kept firing at all cylinders the defense kept giving the ball back but I guys just took advantage of it was really cool we always talked about the speed advantage in your mind how did that really manifest I don't know about that this is a great football team you know the redisplayed I think I think our execution thrown in catching was really there tonight really came through I don't know random and all but we certainly just saw plays on deepest white guys ran them down this is a nice fashion now I know this is a hypothetical but what would you guys give to be able to play the winner of next week's game you know we would love to do that I don't think anybody could be this you know I just feel like that's that's what this team is all about we can do whatever we need to do and unfortunately we don't get to but maybe someday there'll be a chance but not now all right thanks a lot B congratulations Lisa thank you very much and we'll return with our Rose Bowl postgame coverage right after this message you know get pretty god keep the change whoa and use that change to get

football special Mark Sanchez 413 yards four touchdowns at a rushing touchdown let's go down to Lisa thanks Brent mark it seems like I asked you this question every game because you guys are always so dominant but when did you know that this was over I felt good going into halftime but you know hats off to a great Penn State team they brought it all game long they didn't quit you saw at the end there we were hanging on but you know a solid Trojan victory it was a total team effort that's the way we want to send the seniors out and you know we had no doubt this game that we're gonna come out on top what was really clicking between you and Damian Williams tonight he's always he's always an easy target to find but I mean it wasn't just him it was it was a Ronald Johnson and Patrick Turner all three of them the tight end you know getting in the mix and Adam Goodman late I mean all those guys put pressure on the defense and when he had that many weapons it's tough the game plan against and we exploited them today I'm noticing the I black the rest in peace what's that about Geron Figueroa he's the fifteenyearold kid he was suffering from osteosarcoma I met him why coach Carol introduced me to him earlier in the season before camp started he passed away now about a month ago and you know he was a loyal fan I talked to him you know just about every week let him know what's going on when we enter new stadiums and what the hotels like but you know he was he was in his bed he went quietly and now he's in a better place one last football question for you a career night for you tonight can only make your draft stock go up which way you lean in just between you and me video in America there you know it's it's a I have no clue right now I'm so happy about this game and I

have a chance to come in here and beat such an extraordinary football team as Penn State and coach Paterno we're really proud of it really thrilled about it what is it about this experience that your team comes so jacked up year after year does it come and want to put a pace to go on the Big Ten well first off these guys love playing in this event I know people try to say everything but that but we practice great the whole preparation they love representing here in California it's a fantastic opportunity for every one of them and so they just don't miss a trick and they just get all pumped up for it you're not gonna get a chance to but what if you had to face Oklahoma or Florida how do you see the outcome well and all do it and all due respect those are two great programs I don't think anybody can beat the Trojans this year okay we're going to bring in the Offensive Player of the Year Mark Sanchez mark 413 passing yards that is a career high yet a Rose Bowl record 82 percent completion performance again I'll ask the same question I asked coach what is it about the Rose Bowl that brings out the best in you guys you know we have that whole month to prepare it's a testament to our coaches to our team the coaches got us prepared the team bought into the game plan we brought our energy like we always do and we want to kick off the new year with a bang I think we did that I
