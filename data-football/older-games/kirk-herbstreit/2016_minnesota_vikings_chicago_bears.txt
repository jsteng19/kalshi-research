============================================================

back at Soldier Field and ready for action Monday Night Football the Vikings and the Bears Minnesota's won the last three head to head they swept the two game season series a year ago Sam Bradford and the Vikings offense will be on the field first Chicago on the toss and deferred so Minnesota elected to receive the opening kickoff and the dangerous cordarrelle Patterson back deep to receive the kick from Connor fire twice in his career the ball goes off the tee Patterson has returned the opening kickoff of a game for a touchdown he did that here in Chicago in 2013 week two of the season very pleasant night 58 degrees and the wind out of the southeast at 12 miles per hour enough to impact the placement the ball on the tee for Connor bars well the Bears haven't given them much reason to cheer but here in Chicago most of the sports attention obviously on the Cubs hosting the W after their win at Wrigley last night in game 5 against the Cleveland Indians touch back then the Vikings will start at the 25 lit by Sam Bradford an excellent touchdown to interception ratio 7 to 1 third best to the National Football League behind Tom Brady and Brian Hoyer the injured Chicago Bear neither them has thrown an interception this year in Sam's completion percentage sixty seven and a half fifth best in the NFL but off his worst outing as a member of the Vikings against his old friend the Eagles his first return overs of the season and they put pressure on him all night long Philadelphia had not been much of a blitz team entering that game they came after him regularly Matt Asiata gets the call one first down and a oneyard gain for a Minnesota team that's been the worst rushing team in the league so far this whole offense needs to hit the reset button not just Bradford they were awful last week against Philadelphia they've got to be very careful with pass protection early in this game look for some quick passes maybe a bootleg they've got to max the protection and regain their confidence up front where's last year's NFL leading rusher Adrian Peterson out with a knee injury Polk starting offensive tackles from beginning to year out with injury as well plenty of time therefore Bradford and ontarget stuff Stefon Diggs for a first down across the 40 to the 42 yard line a gain of 16 for Minnesota Diggs has been hurt battling a groin he gets off clean he runs an outside braking route and Radford threw a beautiful strike if you protect Sam Bradford he will throw completions and Diggs a young receiver who's missed some practice time good to see him back there's crowd the line of scrimmage Asiata another oneyard gain Mitch unwind the tackle for Chicago it's the remade offensive line with Jake long and TJ Clemons now the tackles Matt Khalil and Andre Smith both out injured the backs and receivers no Jerick McKinnon tonight their doitall running back he's out with an ankle injury so Asiata newcomer Ronnie Hillman we'll split the carries Hillman has come into the game and goes in motion to the left of Sam Bradford is the fourman rush and Bradford throws hot for a first down there is a flag down as Adam Thielen cross midfield and went to the Chicago 45 taken down by Tracy Porter the flag far side of the field along the line of scrimmage Jean starett toward the side defense number 97 lined up in the neutral zone penalty is declined the result of the play first out Chicago's defense a three for alignment coached by Vic Fangio of the kiemce Hicks will Sutton and Mitch unwind the front three newcomers Darrell Freeman and Danny Trevathan by a free agency in the inside and in the secondary lots of injuries they trust the rookies into action davon LeBlanc and Vivante Maas be Matt Asiata of the ball carrier to the 39 that was the secondary that was picked apart by Aaron Rodgers in the Bears last game a week ago Thursday night in Green Bay completed 39 passes as now the Vikings going to go quickly to the line three different Green Bay receivers had 10 or more catches Bradford too far in front of Asiata with Danny Trevathan running in coverage and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio of the Bears playing with the most inexperienced secondary in football they're going to go to their dime package now six defensive backs on the field you're gonna see Adrian a Mo's secondyear safety man move into linebacker to try to take away Kyle Rudolph too tight into the Vikings who's been their goto receiver right side of your screen the Bears showing pressure rapper midtime throws a wobbler his incomplete don't know whose tip it was an end over end past that Adam Thielen could not catch that's a big stop for the Chicago Bear defense if you're not going to get there get your hands in the air perhaps get a tip at ball clearly deflected in new punt returner for the Bears Craven Leblanc replacing Eddie Royal nobody knows much about Leblanc but he is a very good defender we'll find out what kind of return IRR he is the Royal out for the second week in a row with a toe injury one of the best return men in the NFL Jeff blocked the punter kind of field position you might ponder a fake but Locke poops it away and Leblanc let's hit pounce and the Vikings are going to down and inside the 10yard line Audie Cole first therefore Minnesota 33 yard caught bears on offense right after this ESPN's Monday Night Football is brought to you by Arby's Arby's we have the meats by ESPN shop calm powered by Dick's Sporting Goods and by GMC we are professional grade coverage tonight from Skycam brought to you by American Express and Skycam shows you the poor field position for the Chicago Bears their first possession of the night starts from their own 7 yard line led by Jay Cutler the 11year veteran first three in Denver the last 8 here in Chicago 33 years old the longest tenured Chicago Bears the running back is Jordan Howard the rookie when he gets the handoff bag to bounce to the right but he couldn't get away from the sticky arm of a veteran Brian Robeson who is the leader that defensive front Jay Cutler you're gonna see a different offense and we've seen the previous month with Brian Hoyer this man is a gunslinger he's going to be looking for Al Shean Jeffery all night tonight what the Bears have missed the most about Cutler is his scrambling ability he can create some offense moving around and they're gonna need it I think his defense is a lot of respect for Jay given their history against Ben they respect his arm talent as you said coaches ability to move around trying to fill a quick one that he does for the tight ends at Miller and picks up a first down out to the 18 yard line bounced out of bounds by Anthony bar Zack Miller a very good pass receiving tight in that's his 34th catch you can line them up in a lot of different positions and Cutler from the shotgun on the time and accurate and in this quick passing game you've got to be able to make some yards after the catch good work by Miller was tackled by Xavier Rhodes who in the opinion of Coach Drude was having a bobo caliber season powered the running back again and he is into the secondary roads has an angle and Howard running out of gas pushed out of bounds inside the 15 yard line he jumped into an eightman scrum if you make a mistake in a gap you're in trouble and Howard rips up he's going to come right off the left side he presses it nobody's home I have no idea or rookie safety number 27 day live versus going first 27 pressed into service with the injury to send a home he's got to clean this up I know Harrison Smith missed the tackle at the line of scrimmage but right away the Vikings missed their veteran safety Andrew send a home sprained an ankle last week in the first quarter at Philadelphia curse saw a lot of action in that game and struggled from time to time Mike Zimmer city was average his Howard again after a 69 yard run takes it inside the 10 down to the 8 yard line Lindvall joseph and harrison smith made the tackle this Howard is an interesting back Ezekiel Elliott having a great season for the Dallas Cowboys he leads all rookie rushers by far but Howard has had a couple 100yard outings and when Jeremy Langford went down Jordan Howard stepped up John Fox has given him another start tonight looks like a good young prospect Langford is active tonight that's real missing the last four games with an ankle injury awkward handoff an awkward landing for Howard as he got yanked down behind the line of scrimmage by Lin ball Joseph the former New York giant well he got Jay Cutler a veteran quarterback who's missed five weeks he got a rookie Center a rookie running back there's an audible and either Cutler went the wrong way or Howard went the wrong way but what a terrible error in the red zone is set up third and long and already out there number 41 Sean Sean Anthony Harris has checked in at safety there's last season when they had Matt Forte Martellus Bennett among others good on third down they have really struggled on third down this year they've moved the ball up and down the field in the middle of a pack in total yardage on offense but last in scoring hog around third and nine for the end zone a little bit too high for al Sean Jeffery with Xavier Rhodes in coverage and he'll likely be covering Jeffery just about the entire night tonight he will travel with the veteran Jeffery he's got to make this catch this is his own coverage he breaks to the outside and it's a ball that Al's job Jeffries has got to get up and get no touchdowns this year and somebody's got a jump start this offense don't make a great catch I think he should have caught it Conner parth on to try a 30yard field goal the punter Pat o'donald the holder Patrick scales the long snapper and it is good and Chicago's on the board John Fox in the Bears leading Minnesota 3 to nothing back in Chicago where the Bears lead three to nothing the Connor bar 30 yard field goal set up by a 69 yard run by the rookie Jordan Howard longest run of the season for the Bears in the longest of his rookie season for Howard good return to action for Jay Cutler and Mike Zimmer just pleased with the way his team played last week can't be happy with the start as you mentioned coach and made a very quick change at safety after cursed looked to be in the wrong place on that long run there's Conor part to kick on Patterson's gonna let that one go out of the back of the end zone Vikings struggling to get the running game going last year with Adrian Peterson leading the league in rushing they averaged 138 yards per game on the ground that's down to 74 point three this year only two Jaguars in the Giants average fewer yards per game and the average per rush of 2.6 for Minnesota is worst in the league and it's the lowest average by any team that won five of its first six games since the current formula to compute yards per carry started in 1947 it's tough to win when you rush the ball as the Vikings have but they're doing it with an efficient passing game for the most part in the state free football offense with the exception to last week and that great defense here's Ronnie Hillman just his second carry as a Viking and again very little in a running game as Akeem Hicks blasted him back there's just nothing there you look at Hicks number 96 he's a man that has been erratic in his play he's been good at times he's been really good he's disappeared but he just whipped TJ Clements and it's second and long again and you're just not able to set up any playaction pass whatsoever when you fall behind a change week in and week out with this running game laughter under duress got it off in the traffic an incomplete intended forced upon digs at hit Tracy Porter Sam Bradford is not going to last long with this kind of protection he gets hit by two Chicago Bears coming off both sides we talked about this in a pregame warmup the Chicago Bears welcomed the return of Pernell McGee he's a power rusher the man can run right through you in floyd number 94 their firstround rep Joyce has a lot of speed look for Floyd number 94 to create a oneonone somewhere inside to get after Bradford three receivers to Bradford's right we're running out of time had some early and now he's yanked out by the uniform cornelius washington the fouryear man out of the University of Georgia took him to the grass big concern with Radford is he's just not a quarterback that can scramble number 90 Washington in hot pursuit of Sam Bradford and he runs him down three and out in effect the running game predictable passing situations struggling offensive line not a good thing with the quarterback just cannot scramble that does go down in the books as the sack jeff block will punt crave on leblanc back deep the kick by the former UCLA Bruin will live long not sure if he touched that or not apparently didn't because he just got away from it but not their usual punt returner and it showed their cordarrelle Patterson now a gunner on punt coverage for Minnesota doubted near the 5yard line next week Monday night football returns to the beautiful Pacific Northwest Tyrod Taylor in the Buffalo Bills in Seattle to take on Russell Wilson and the Seahawks that's at 8:15 Eastern Time coverage beginning at 6:00 with Monday night countdown served by Applebee's you can catch all the action right here on ESPN and also streaming live on watch ESPN 72 yard punt by Minnesota's Jeff locked the longest of his fouryear career and the Bears for the second time in as many possessions start inside their own 10 they've moved at 81 yards to kick a field goal in their first possession Jordan Howard already on a 69 yard run he got stood up by those UCLA berlin's Anthony bar and Eric Kendricks former roommates at UCLA starting offensive line for the Chicago Bears new guards the Pro Bowlers jock sitting and Pat long are out so it's the veterans Busch and Larson on either side of the rookie Kody white hairs at a very nice year and the backs and receivers powered and Kadima be jointed running back tonight we believe by Jeremy Langford who is active tonight for the first time in five weeks long tricep injury suffered in the game at Green Bay sitting out with an ankle Jay Cutler short set Rose pot short of the first down Al Shean that use me Josh Bellamy taken back by Terrence Neumann the ageless cornerback now 38 years old only James Harrison four months older his older among defensive players in the NFL quick huddle here they go in Minnesota nowhere near lined up butlers throws in the traffic and almost intercepted attended for Jeffery Xavier Rhodes was ready most of his teammates weren't but he got in front of that pass and almost picked it off great idea to jump the count but he just missed the throw you got to miss this throw to the outside Cutler missed it to the inside and Xavier Rose almost with a pick six location on outside breaking routes critical with Pat O'Donnell on the punch not a very good check you can hear the crowd groaned Bradford a lot of excellent field position they're going to spot it right at the 50yard line with the 38 yard punt back in Chicago where the game is delayed ed Walker the head linesman injured during the punt by Pat O'Donnell he slept while running down the far sideline his feet just went out from under him and he's getting medical attention as you saw or joined as we are every week by jerry austin long time on the field official in the National Football League so obviously and unfortunately would hope Ed's all right he's not going to be able to continue so what are the mechanics now for this officiating group going forward now they go to a sixman crew the back judge well the hip side judge on that side will move down to the head linesman position or the back judge will go there the back judge position goes away there's no one deep in the middle of the field until there's a punt then the back judge will be we'll go back there it'll be one short on the sidelines he did land awkwardly he was legs bending underneath him let's hope he's okay and everybody has to get an explanation as to how the officials will be deployed I think Jerry's still in good shape John we'd miss him up here but I don't know if you brought your uniform Jerry you'd have to be the head referee he worked a long time to become the lead official worked a couple of Super Bowls in that capacity well I did more deep for eight years prior to being the white hat so if they don't give me a whistle and a flag I'll go after an offensive coordinator Norv Turner of the Vikings has had plenty of time to think about what the call and I know Coach Turner is an aggressive play caller he's looking at a depleted secondary of the Vikings excuse me of the Bears and I know deep down he would love to take a shot on first down in this field position bottom of the screen number 20 Devante Boz beat just activated from the practice squad struggled last week against the Packers Tracy Porter number 21 at the top of the screen has been battling a knee injury let's see what gives Dean stertorous and final words for other members of his crew on how they will handle this situation officiating one man short bradford not on the same page with Stephane dicks was covered by the veteran Tracy Porter these two had a lot of problems last week in Philadelphia Diggs was too short he was too deep this time he's not on the same page young receiver veteran quarterback cross signals again north turner we visited with him put that on Diggs didn't run the routes that drives more crazy man wide open and Diggs couldn't make the catch he was behind the defense in the throw just a hair too long use an uptempo offense and that's the matchup they wanted their young speed receiver step 5 Diggs working against Tracy Porter who's been injured and he ran right by the veteran Retford usually rings these up disgusted with himself third down and long back for the Bears unleashed their pass rush they've been effective in these obvious passing situations Radford likes the tight end Kyle Rudolph on third down looking in that direction and throws for Rudolph and he's short of the first down ripped down by jerel Freeman the free agent over from Indianapolis good work by Freeman when I want government makes a good rap tackle well short at first down let's see if leblanc can field this punt when I was coaching and I had a young returner back there I used to close my eyes and hold my breath he cost him dearly the last time you wonder about the spin of the punt off the left footed lock a little bit different what they customarily see another beauty by luck and they could not rescue if trae Waynes was there but couldn't keep it out of the end zone so the ball will come out to the 20 it'll be the best starting field position on possession free for the Chicago Bears Xavier Rhodes the quarterback from Minnesota has done an excellent job so far this season against him has been roads closed Odell Beckham the Giants on a Monday night game of career low 23 yards receiving here the Giants lost in Minneapolis and the best receiver for the Houston Texans in Week five DeAndre Hopkins had five catches they were all in the second half although Rhodes didn't have a pass interference of defensive holding penalty well matched up with Hopkins so another challenge tonight for Xavier against Alshon Jeffery Xavier Rhodes and the entire Minnesota Vikings know where Jay Cutler is gonna look tonight in critical situations they have got to get the ball to Alshon Jeffery they misfired early in this game for a touchdown and Jeffrey has been shut out no touchdowns this season he's on a franchise contract they got to get him going unfortunately roads in this secondary will make it tough targeted twice no catches for Jeffery the only player in the league with 500 plus yards receiving this season who does not have a touchdown playaction pass the Holland Cutler throws the deep ball and to looking for Deonte thompson who got behind Terrence Newman now take Thompson against the veteran Terrence Newman 38 years old when I want cover just a post pattern Thompson had a step coupler over cool Cutler's missed a lot of time hasn't worked with Thompson a lot he's used to seeing Kevin white Eddie Royal two veteran receivers who are out tonight the white their firstround pick a year ago injured again missed all of last year the leg injury Zach Miller makes the catch that's 98 straight catches without a drop on throws that were on target the longest streak in the NFL it actually dates back to 2010 because Miller missed three years largely due injury the front four from Minnesota is outstanding 17 sacks up front and if your Evelyn would you enjoy the rest of the lineup for the Minnesota Vikings they move fast I wonder 72 fiveyard penalty they're down Charles Leno guilty of the false start third year left tackle out of Boise State let's see what Jay Cutler gives his bears in a huddle he's got two new guards he's got a rookie center and he's got to match wits with Mike Zimmer in a defense that loves the disguising confused on these third and long there's 32% on third down Vikings blitz Cutler has time in his nose way too high for Miller there was contact but the ball was way over his head he do not want to get behind in the chains against this Viking defense Robeson is a defensive end lined up as a defensive tackle he and Anthony bar are gonna blitz on a cross dog and it's mantoman coverage with Harrison Smith were roving at free safety there's nothing there Pat O'Donnell will punt again Adam Phelan back deep Ford there without Marcus Cheryl's best punt returner in franchise history five career punt returns for touchdowns he's out of the wrist injury suffered last week at Philadelphia now feeling out of Minnesota State stumbles down at the 32 yard line but the coverage about to arrive 51yard punt feelin took it back for four three nothing Chicago back in the great city of Chicago Bears hosting Monday Night Football for the second time this year it's their fourth primetime game they've been a Sunday night of Thursday night now to Monday's they're still looking for their first win in primetime and a rare home win they're 2 and 9 at home in their second season other John Fox haven't given this crowd much cheer about they're trying to fire up the fans as the defense is on the field leading three to nothing with 312 to go in the first quarter Vikings need a first down they need to develop some kind of rhythm on offense they have been able to capitalize on good field position starting down from the 32 top run by Matt Asiata up near the 39 yard line Harold Jordans Forte made the tackle bradford been under pressure early again in this game he went down hard and when you get pressured a lot you sometimes rush throws he can't step up and finish throws because of the push in the pocket and he missed the pot digs a ball he normally hits second and short the u.s. Sam last night when you're pressured like he is what are your concerns he said you have to continue to go through your progression to camp or right through the option Jonathan Bullard a nice tackle on Matt Asiata taking him down short of the first down by about a yard and a half this offensive line has been yelled at a lot this week and they're trying to use this no huddle offense to calm the Bears down they're coming up to the line quickly right everything they can they just can't do anything on the ground Asiata stuff well short of the yard to make Adrian Amos up from his safety spot the offensive line just cannot knock anybody off the ball and get a short yardage conversion third down along just gonna run an inside zone and Brandon Fusco stalemated at the point of attack free linebacker in the hole and it's another three and out for the biking offense 0 for 4 on third down babe on leblanc back deep again already the fourth punt of the first quarter for Jeff Locke not a good one rollin returnable for LeBlanc rookie out of Florida Atlantic and excellent coverage by cordarrelle Patterson when his fourth year out of Tennessee just became a gunner this year he has become an excellent gunner 40yard punt 7 yard return will more of the same from a week ago coach for Sam Bradford for evil teammates in Philadelphia you've mentioned the top of the telecast sacked 6times hit 12 fumble for time lost to through a terrible interception of the beginning of the game the two teams exchanged turnovers on five straight possessions back to the drawing board on the sidelines for the Minnesota offense playaction pass to Jay Cutler 15 carry was the running back a wobbly hot into Minnesota Territory Meredith the second year man out of Illinois State Bank down by Terrence Neumann who is Cameron Meredith bootleg Cutler pulls up and Zing's one I've been watching this Chicago bear film I thought Meredith was Kevin white that I thought Meredith was out shot Jeffery then I put the film away and I said Meredith his playing like the best receiver on the Bears offense he's an unknown out of Illinois State former quarterback wasn't active at the beginning here I remember her the first Monday night game this season week to the first Bears appearance and you at practice will wonder why Meredith wasn't playing so impressed newer Kadeem carry the ball carrier Brian Robeson made the tackle Oh Meredith and for the most part this entire group of Bears receivers are outside receivers they're guys that line up outside the numbers run outside braking Ralph they run down the field what they're lacking is a slot receiver and you're gonna see later in this game Meredith is gonna work between the numbers and make some critical inside braking catches as expected low scoring the Bears leading Minnesota Soldier Field on Monday Night Football Saturday night at 8:00 Eastern Time and ABC a huge big 10 matchup with college football playoff implications couple of oneloss teams number nine Nebraska in Columbus to take on 6th ranked Ohio State and JT Barrett stream it live on the ESPN app and watch ESPN rested just suffered its first loss the season played well lost in overtime at Wisconsin you never quite sure if you're good when we're playing Minnesota sometimes they deliver surprises with the pass rush Rutledge stumbled a bit in the ball hits Alshon Jeffery in the back of the head Jeremy Langford better button his chin strap you got to be ready as a back when you play the Minnesota Vikings and you're gonna get destroyed in oneonone pass protection but else John Jeffrey never turn for the ball don't understand that no Jeffery and Cutler have connected a number of times but I've never seen that result back there throw third time they've targeted Jeffery still without a catch third down and eight just across midfield four receivers in the game Harrison Smith on a safety puts now a shovel pass ahead to Jordan Howard here he goes again down inside the 20yard line take Cutler something we talked about in the pregame what they miss is his gunslinging adlib plays unblocked defender Harrison Smith the Pro Bowl safety Cutler's going to avoid him he has the presence to flip the ball to Jordan Howard that might be the biggest pass play against the Vikings all season vanish Chicago Bears finish the drive they love to throw the ball in this three tight end set great time to do it 34 yard pass play back to the ground with Howard bounces off a couple of hits he's down inside the 15 Jamar Stefan excellent run stopper back up defensive lineman out of Connecticut made the tackle Howard is an impressive running he's improving as a receiver I think he's got a long way to go the Shon keep an eye on Joshua Bellamy number 11 they have a strategic group a place for him in this tight red zone for men Minnesota rush time for Cutler in the black by Jordan Howard ripped down immediately by captain Munder hland eightyear veteran Marlin is a good veteran player he's done it a long time he did it well in Carolina he replaces Chad Greenway a veteran linebacker in there nickel package and on third down and six where is L Shaw Jeffery and there's that matchup Rhodes and Geoffrey if you want to score you're gonna have to beat their best from the 10yard line toddler steps into the throw and it's batted away intended for Jeffrey and Roche wins the paddle again yeah roads is like a sigh Young awardwinner he throws a shutout for us every time we get him oneonone with Al Shean Jeffrey on third down in a red zone and look at the length the long arms of Xavier Rose I think that ball got in I'm Jeffrey again you've got to extend your arms cut the flight time down and snatch it if you're a whiteout Jeffrey has failed twice now on third down in the red zone there's Connor parse is already connected from 30 yards this is a 28 yard field goal attempt and Chicago leads six to nothing baby roads an emerging star in his fourth year out of Florida State we said hydeia counteract the very tall Jeffrey said you just go up with him and battle ESPN's Monday Night Football is brought to you by Lexus by NFL game pass replay every game this season go to nfl.com slash game pass start your free trial and by Miller Lite the original light beer what a night we had last night is the guest of our buddy Marc Janus John and I had a chance to go to Wrigley Field last night sit in great seats down the third base line for Game five of the World Series at Wrigley Field what a night that was so tonight did you see Chapman throwing that weighted ball getting loose and then Joel Madden brought him in he was throwing 102 miles an hour that guy has some heat that was a lot of fun the Cubs spent a lot of time with you now since May we all know having watched your passionate emotional guy I don't know if I've ever seen you as excited and you were like a little kid at that game last night no penalty flags either no instant replay challenges I loved it there was a favorite part here comes cordarrelle Patterson Vikings could use a big play from the special teams they don't get it as he got plastered at the 15yard line because Kristen Jones see Chapman's down there I know he he was down there getting loose and you were calling for the lefty that called for him a lot earlier than you did but I don't know if he could tell but Joe Madden was looking down at me from this angle dugout was over here so he just wanted to know what we thought looked like you're scared of something I was scared of those Indian Hills that was a good time woeful performance on offense for Minnesota down six to nothing here's Ronnie Hillman the leading running back for Denver last year part of their Super Bowl team and he picked up about five on first down Tracy Porter ran him out Hillman had a hundred yard game last year against the Bears as a member of the Denver Broncos and they need a big run from somebody Adrian Peterson known for making long runs those days are over at least for now and they need a big play from somebody Sam Bradford will look like he started to duck when there really wasn't anybody that close it's a sad Floyd the rookie you can see him getting better and better every week got a Georgia he was the ninth player taken in this year's draft when you can get this kind of pressure with a fourman rush it allows you to do a lot of different things in the secondary nurse Jake Barnett left Baptist struggling there's nowhere to go Jake long pressed into service remember they started the season with matka will they tried T Jake lemmings they made the emergency call too long and they're struggling in all phases runs at neat trouble played fewer than 20 seasons deep throw nothing doing Adam feelin well covered by Devante Busby who was just promoted for his first NFL action up the practice squad for the game a week ago Thursday night in Green Bay I like Boz B he's out of Pittsburgh State he's number 20 he's got the length and that's a good nocall excellent coverage I keep waiting for laQuan Treadwell the number one pick of the Reds of the Minnesota Vikings to make his appearance but so far no catches at all for the first round or out of Ole Miss he played very active tonight fourth straight three and out in another punt two Jeff Locke here spray ball up walk does he got to the 43 yard line trae Waynes with kentrell brothers brothers a rookie out of Missouri active and seeing his first NFL action tonight time for tonight's Monday Night Lights Saturday the Bears practice facility in suburban Lake Forest Illinois USA football team with Jon Gruden hold a football clinic for players from nearby foreign bridge in Waukegan high schools the conclusion of the clinic as he does every week coach Gruden made of two thousand dollar donation and the mayor's match the donation to each of those schools that was awesome the Bears came bad as today we're matching it keep the game strong support youth sports support high school football keep the game strong love those kids the 41yard punt by Jeff Locke a 13 yard return for Trayvon leblanc good field position chicago operating from the 43 of Minnesota and Jordan Howard dropped immediately by Harrison Smith and Cameron Meredith one of the things that he has to work on is his blocking he's got to come in motion recognize this Safety's coming off the corner and he's got to stick his face in there and sell out that time Harrison Smith just crossed his face and whipped Jordan Howard got to take care of the edges if you're a wide receiver second and ten Jordan powers to the 41 yard line taken down by Everson Griffin to disappointing running plays with this great field position two runs for one yard and once again it's third and long just watch what Jay Cutler has to go through when he breaks the huddle expect that double a package Robison 96 is the Joker he's the chess piece that they move around and he does a lot of communicating for Mike summers defense here they are bunch to the right they've taken that direction a screen great call and executed for a first down Howard paddling for every inch gets near the 30yard line great call is the free rusher on the right side of the screen the Neal hunter unblocked and Cutler has the perfect play called in shortened Howard is getting the Gunnison receiver that's the one thing I thought the Bears really missed the receiving skills of Matt Forte so far Howard has really been a nice job he has three catches he also has a 69 yard run that set up their first field goal there in field goal position again already leading six to nothing Cutler the quick pop to Zach Miller and he's down at the 10 yard line Jay Cutler after five weeks out sharp tonight that's the Creek call again by Dowell Loggins it's a trap pass they're gonna pull the right guards and they're gonna fool anthony bar at linebacker and pop the ball to the tight ends ack fella for a huge gain they are mixing it up extremely well and they are taking it to the purple rain defense big dive and they finish it drive William Paulson an extra tight end into the game as he's been bran anchor the rookie on Harvard his first catch it's almost a touchdown tripped up by Trey Wayne's first career catch for Ben Veronica the rookie out of Harvard a great job they're doing mixing their play selection up there's Dowell Loggins in his first season as the Bears offensive coordinator and how many adjustments as he had to make he's use three quarterbacks he's used a number of different receivers different running backs and in this go lie situation Mitch son Ryan a defensive tackle has checked in at fullback will they slam it at the Viking they don't have a pull back on the the way they might not need him touchdown another great call by Donna Loggins and executed to perfection by the Chicago Bears they made everybody in this stadium think they were going to run an inside and run behind their 300pound defensive tackle they made everybody think they're going to run it in here and they tossed the ball and completely cool the Minnesota Viking defense head coach Mike Zimmer was upset last week he's got to be just as upset tonight especially with his defense honor part yes the point try he's a too many men on the field they got the man off in time to avoid a penalty and the extra point is girl Jordan Howard the star of the night on up and so far for Chicago and the Bears upset the mind of trying to get their second win of the season lead 13 to nothing Jay Cutler on the sidelines looking at the tablet checking with the coaching staff he's know a lot of coaches during his time here in Chicago in eight years he's seen many offensive fortyeighters come and go under head coach Tubby Smith J worked with Ron Turner Mike Martz and Mike Tyson's the coordinators only mark therefore more than one year then when Martin was a head coach Aaron covered the offensive coordinator for two years last year is Adam GaSe he left to go to Miami to be the head coach so Dow Loggins promoted I think that's a great move John a lot of continuity now you know Jays had to deal with all these different systems and coaches now he gets the work for the second year in a row with a guy he really likes and respects Jay told us he thinks the game plans are excellent from dialogue this is a very good offensive coaching staff and he has a lot of confidence in respect for how hard they've worked getting a lot of young players ready to play in a short period of time the kickoff returnable Connard Bart set it down near the goal line for Daryl Patterson leaves out to the 20 20 yard line the ball came out went forward and it's recovered by Charles Johnson of Minnesota Minnesota just cannot get out of their own way right now and they're fortunate here this ball is clearly out you see the strip Vic foot house key witkowski another draft choice of Ryan pace out of West Virginia script set ball and luckily for Minnesota Charles Johnson's got it five possessions five months the last four three now it's 51 yards of offense from Minnesota to first downs midway through the second quarter Sam Bradford short for Ronnie Hillman swung down by Adrien Amos secondyear safety out of Penn State the only player who started on opening day last year on defense who started in the same position this year on defense for Chicago lots of turnovers they get younger a lot of people talk about the injuries that the Vikings have had how about the injuries on this bear football team but it's good to see Pernell McPhee back out there at the bottom of the screen he's a power rusher he's going after TJ Clemons and Floyd at the top of the screen has been impressive again tonight second and five again a short throw Branford there's the third first doubt of the night it's Stefon Diggs out of bounds run out by Tracy Porter to the 42 yard line one of the things Vic Fangio the defensive coordinator of the Bears does is he plays a bend but don't break defense with all these young Chicago Bears he's going to make you possess the ball incomplete passes pass protect avoid penalties and so far the Vikings have been unable to sustain anything but it's been don't break defense and you're gonna see a lot of that tonight after Navy Yard gain and a first down for Minnesota Bradford's throw too high for Kyle Rudolph Danny Trevathan had the coverage the first blitz I've seen tonight grave on Leblanc going to come off the right side last week the Philadelphia Eagles hurt Minnesota bad with perimeter blitzes big fan Gio the X coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers and his coaching staff deserve credit for getting it done with a lot of missing pieces lots of injuries in the secondary in particular Siana outside the left across the 45 yanked down by Leonard Floyd I just think about Sam Bradford when you get hit as many times as you got hit in Philadelphia and as hard as you got hit it's hard to forget that he's been knocked around a little bit today he's got to get a good drop he's got to get some cast protection where he can get through a progression and use all five of his eligibles that's when he's at his best he said if I can get time he's thinking you take advantage of that depleted Chicago secondary is Green Bay did a week and a half ago when they completed 39 passes but he's under the refs again the ball is out right now no whistles for an incompletion Cornell McPhee knocked it out Adam feelings on it now a very late flag thrown McPhee just crushed PJ Clements with the power rush just when you think it can't get much uglier on offense from Mike Zimmer and the Vikings it does Bradford hit as he wound up to throw was ruled the fumble recovered by Minnesota and then a flag at the end of the play welcome L&amp;L McPhee is been ruling on the field is that we have a backward pass that ends up moving forward and recovered by the offense we also have unsportsmanlike contact number 90 of the defense for coming off of the bench you know the 15yard penalty is going to be added to the end of the run first down Minnesota what a horrible penalty on Cornelius Washington interesting explanation the backward test that went forward I'm still trying to figure that out well he did come out on the field and you can see the personnel on the bear sideline do it Sam Bradford gets punished that was third down it should be a punting situation I have no idea what the penalty on Washington was saw the official there with the play still going on for all the flag big break for Minnesota in dire need of one Bradford his pass deflected and tenant forced upon Diggs but Danny Trevathan got in the way and he's looking at his hands as if he can't believe he didn't catch him Trevathan the X Denver Bronco played three years for John Fox in Denver he's a very good linebacker time has jumped just perfectly and the ex Kentucky Wildcats still getting it done a lot of perseverance in that man's tank he's come back from a lot of injuries had a thumb problem that cost him a couple games earlier this season Roach's five minutes to go in the first half to set up a screen the tightend powered off blockers out in front but he still tripped up short of the first down nice play by Harold Jones Corte and nice effort by Leonard Floyd it's a sprint out pass to the right they're going to throw a screen back to Kyle Rudolph and watch Boyd 94 and pursuit good ball it sets up third short and a playbook is wide open in these third down and short situations keep an eye on Rudolph at the top of the screen he's the man in third down in field goal range what if this might be for down territory Branford Rose taught by Adam Palin inside the 15yard line with the vonti pause be in coverage great throw by sam says a lot about the character of Sam Bradford he gets thrown around beat up early now he hangs in there throws up pulling the ceiling for a huge first down and I love feeling he was our grinder a few weeks ago Minnesota State undrafted lay off the practice squad Bradford to the far sideline Kyle Rudolph taken out of bounds by Adrian Amos this 13point deficit the largest the Vikings have faced in the first half this year we spoke with Sam Bradford last night he said we need to come out early and play with the lead so important with the wave a play to play with the lead but obviously that hasn't happened tonight and get a break you get a penalty it gives you an opportunity like this great way to change the momentum of this football game motion usually gary mckinnon the former quarterback who runs the Wildcat this time is Matt Asiata very near a first down inside the 5 yard line as we tick down to three minutes to go in the first half when you play against Norv Turner you got to prepare for a lot Sam Bradford just motion out from underneath Center they snapped the ball to Asiata with Bret Ellison and puck still pulling it's a good north/south run short yardage and the Bears have loaded up with big people will Sutton 93 Hakeem Hicks 96 officials timeout Sam Bradford went over to speak with jeans territor and the officials are talking about it well north turner long time offensive coordinator in the league regarded as one of the best 15 years as a head coach but he's struggling to find the right solutions to the problem so far just hang in I call him ATG that's what we refer to him as anything goes you got to prepare for the quick game screens reverses jet sweeps unbalanced line you just saw the Wildcat you've seen him in two no uttal doesn't matter who you who you give them he's gonna get his group of players in a position to move the football and right now in this short yardage situation but be interested to see what he calls but north turner his experience with a quarterback that he just got at the beginning of the season beatup offensive lineman no adrian peterson if they have a chance to move forward they're gonna have to find some offense and Norv Turner is going to be a key player for the Vikings the second half of the season meet my pH eg I would argue that should be AG so it's not scribble though anything I have a problem relationship right now it's NW nothing working for Minnesota Siana did he get enough not very close to that yellow line before he got drilled and sent in Reverse led by Danny Trevathan and Chris Pierzynski a backup safety in there and short yardage and will tick down to the twominute warning no idea who's rockin number 29 Darryl Jones Forte but that was a big hit warning John McDonough Jon Gruden Lisa Salters twominute warning here in Chicago the Bears leading 13 and nothing John Fox has just challenged the ruling on the field they measured while we away and it was a first down for Minnesota but John thought it was a bad spot so gene stereo tours going over to take a look at it the help from the folks in New York I think he's short Shawn Jerry thinks he's short when Jerry is the ultimate authority when it comes to matters pertaining to officiating so the twominute warning it's 13 and nothing and of course this drive for Sam Bradford extended on a strange play well it looked like the Bears had stopped the Vikings again but Chicago got called for unsportsmanlike conduct and one of their players Cornelius Washington ran out of the field while the play was still going on you can see where they marked the ball looked like on the replay Asiata came up in my opinion just short of the three yard line from where the ball is placed right now looked like they gave them the three and then made it a little bit more really little to lose of your John Fox in terms of the challenge at this point here comes John Fox and rather at jeans territory the referee John Fox and Mike Zimmer awaiting the decision after review the ruling on the field stands first out of Minnesota Chicago is charged with its first timeout of the half that is also Chicago's first challenge of the game it's just such a hard thing John in a replay to judge whether correct spot is I haven't really seen that play overturned often but let's play some football here Chicago should consider using a timeout to preserve time for Jay Cutler the Bears have moved the ball themselves offensively and last week in this goal to goal situation Minnesota had a false start they were unable to cash it in early in the game Bradford threw an interception in the end zone really set the tone for the whole day in Philadelphia well play the drive aided by that big penalty start at their own 20 in Asiata Natalie for everything has got a yard before he got sent back primary hit from the vodka a pause B and he had plenty of help that's a job that none of my receivers ever volunteered for cordarrelle Patterson comes in short motion and becomes a lead blocker on the goal line I used to ask our receivers which one of you guys wants to do this and no one would raise their hand and you can see why second down and goal stick with Asiata and nothing doing into the pile and down of the line of scrimmage third down and goal as we approach a minute to go in the first half Adrienne Amos leading the defense looks a 1 back run and they have a builtin RPO he decides to hand it they're outnumbered in the box it sets up third down and goal and I think the Bears have done quite well in this situation they're willing to play mantoman coverage bottom of the screen it's border against gigs in an open formation empty backfield they use it very well in Minnesota and Bradford is sacked back at the 13 yard line by a team Hicks the monsters are out tonight in Chicago we challenge them in the pregame they have got to get after the Vikings offensive line to have a chance and you're going to see Akeem Hicks who at times looks like a great defensive lineman has played very well tonight you get in the goal line situation for years are used to seeing Adrian Peterson found it across the goal line and now you see an open spread offensive system that is very very hard to run the ball in these tight goal line situations and that's just a horrible horrible offensive set for Minnesota then you wonder why Minnesota called the timeout Minnesota timeout that that's true they've left a little time on the clock there for Chicago with Blair Walsh picks a 30 yard field goal to get the Vikings on the boy big sack poor has beenit's a team with the fourth sack of the night for Chicago back in Chicago with Minnesota had the ball for more than seven minutes they settled for a 30yard field goal bogged down after first and goal at three reminiscent of the early stages of their loss last week in Philadelphia big sack by Akeem Hicks the University of Regina in Canada kicked by Walsh and Annie taken by Deonte Thompson 25 seconds away from the Toyota halftime Chris Berman led his final drive among the topics Tom Brady and Derrick card two leading candidates for NFL MVP honors to this point of the season the first take crew will have their take on Cam Newton's postgame comments about all the hits that he's been taking and Kurt Herbstreit who stopped by to talk college football the first college football playoff rankings will come out Tuesday night at 7:00 mine is PN cago on the ground with Jordan Howard and neither team is going to stop the clock it seems and now there is a whistle both teams on the field had started toward the locker rooms but John Fox was called timeout one timeout left for Chicago they put a couple of seconds back on the clock 17 seconds till halftime hoping Howard can pop another long one he's into the secondary Harrison Smith Lin ball Joseph finally wrestled him down John Fox will use his last timeout with nine seconds to go and impressive first half for Jordan Howard the rookie running back who started his career at UAB when they dropped football he went to Indiana it was firstteam allbig ten last year averaged 135 yards per game rushing and in less than a half he's already put up the most yards from scrimmage of any player against the Vikings this year and he has another half of football still to go prevent defense for the Vikings going to defend the sideline look at Rhodes at the bottom of the screen Newman at the top of the screen just keep the ball in play I wonder if they'd be out here bird not for the call time out by Mike Zimmer just before they kicked the field goal help give Chicago this chance just the threeman rush over the middle Zach Miller can he get out of bounds he's trying desperately and he's out with one second left it would be about a 60 yard field goal from here or they can opt to have Jay Cutler throw a Hail Mary middle screen a designed block screen inroads at the bottom of the screen failed to keep Miller in bounds and with the arm strength of Jay Cutler and the catch radius of Alshon Jeffery why not too long to try the field will be almost 60 yards into the breeze Bart's long as 57 that was in the altitude of Denver nothing as time throws it up into that breeze big crowd down there and it's batted down Xavier Rhodes the man in the right spot for Minnesota coming up next with Toyota halftime Chicago leads the Vikings 13 to 3 and the Bears will get the ball to start the second half now here's Chris Packham back to Chicago Soldier Field Chicago Bears upset minded tonight they're 1 in 6 hosting the five and one Minnesota Vikings but it was Chicago that looked like the 5 and 1 team in the first half they lead 13 to 3 as we head before the third quarter Sean McDonough and Jon Gruden more the same for the Minnesota Vikings on offense they have a defense you would think John good enough to perhaps win the Super Bowl but you wonder if that's even possible with the way this offense has played the last couple weeks well they can't run the ball and they can't protect the passer and their defense wasn't really good either but the pass protection is what has me concerned to most let's take a look at tonight's Kay Jewelers brilliant moments we'll take a look at it the monsters of the Midway Leonard Floyd beats Jay Qualls early in the game on an inside move for a sack 104 in the first half Pernell mcgee welcome back to Chicago with the power rush against TJ Clemmy Down Goes Bradford and Joel Burgess gets beat by Hakeem Nicks those Hicks I should say and it hasn't been pretty at all and if I'm Chicago I'm going to stay on the gas pedal continue to rev up the pass rush north turner the offensive coordinator of the Vikings has to consider some lineup changes Jeremiah Searles number 78 has been playing Summit right tackle wouldn't be surprised if we see a couple new faces up front for Minnesota we'll be Chicago to get the ball first to begin the second half Sam Bradford will have to wait as Blair Walsh kicks off the ante Thompson back deep touch back the ball to the 25 here's Lisa Salters well Sean John Fox told us before the game that he really thought that Jay Cutler would come out here in his first game back and really play well with the chip on his shoulder and Fox just said the same thing to me right now he said Cutler is really inspiring the team and guys are playing hard for him right now but he said I'm not surprised because our guys have really played with a lot of heart all season as for the biking struggling again on offense so far tonight Mike Zimmer said that every time we seem to make some plays we seem to sputter he said but I just have a feeling we're gonna be okay and I'm gonna make sure the guys know that in the locker room just come out keep fighting Sean all right Lisa pistol formation for Jay Cutler on the first play from scrimmage of the second half play fake to Jordan Mallard Harrison Schmitt the safety was up in cover space Logan Paulson the tight end finally taken down after a five yard gain Eric Kendricks and Harrison Smith Harrison Smith ran back to be involved in the tackle after putting the pressure on Cutler very important for this Viking defense to get a three and out stop they must create field position for their offense they came in here creating turnovers they got 16 of those nine interceptions seven fumble recoveries the best way to help your offense is to do it with your defense pistol again Jordan Howard who had a big first half how big you're wondering you mentioned already more yards from scrimmage against the Vikings than any player in the pole game this year and it's the most by a bears rookie in a half since 1981 Marcus Anderson played one year in the league as a wide receiver at 148 yards in the first half on Monday night against Detroit and Kadena Air SFL excuse me Kadena carry checks in in his replace in his place and it looks like there the clock stopped the chair Mike Zimmer challenging something here there's Chad Greenway on the field Minnesota is challenging the ruling of the field that the runner was down by contact timeout we go to break let's take a look it'll take other looks during the break well Mike Zimmer in the Vikings think that Jordan powered fumbled before he was down Eric Kendricks did come away with the ball for Minnesota at the very end of the point but the ruling on the field was that Howard was down by contact and jeans territory still over under the hood chatting with Dean Blandino and the folks in New York his knees down he still has the ball I think that play is gonna stand his call John not a fumble would you agree I would agree but I'm old for one tonight Sean Gerry's all for one unfortunately for him his microphone isn't working and I can't defend himself I think this is gonna be a play that stands but we will see you like zimmer desperate for anything at this point do something that might lead to points for his team to homecoming from Mike Zimmer Illinois native born in Peoria and grew up right down the road in Lockport in the Chicago suburbs son of a coach is dad Bill very successful football and wrestling coach he's in both Illinois halls of fame for after ruling on the field is confirmed the runner's knee was down with possession of the ball Minnesota would be charged with its first timeout of the half that is also Minnesota's first challenge of the game one for two now tonight and on third down and five let's get back to this Viking defense they have gotten to this point five and one with their defense they lead the league and turnover ratio they have intercepted passes they forced fumbles they need something from their defense to set their offense up with field position perhaps an interception nine straight games with one from Minnesota by far the longest current streak in the league no other team has more than three games in a row with an interception time for Jay Cutler steps into a long throw look like Jeffery got away with a push off on Xavier Rhodes first down in the Minnesota territory down at the 36 yard line that's what Chicago needed go to your best receiver against their best corner and Cutler loves to throw jump ball flies the Alshon Jeffery look at that catch radius great throw by Cutler he has a cannon for an arm and the first catch for Jeffery good for 34 yards they pay Cutler forced to retreat throws incomplete he got hit as he throw it and Zach Miller the intended receiver stumbled the bid as he tried to run under that pass that pass rush save Minnesota Lynn Val Joseph and friends get the Cutler early he's got Zach Miller wide open nothing Jay Cutler can do here right out of the fake he's under serious pressure from wind out bishop taking advantage of to backup offensive guards remember Josh sitting is out at left guard how long is out at right guard time for the big man number 98 to take this game over if Minnesota going to get back in it his teammates talk about joseph was the strongest man they've ever seen on a football field he pushes the pocket back the pass almost intercepted by Xavier Rhodes as he had the coverage again this time on Josh Bellamy and another injury on this bears offensive line looks like charles leno getting up slowly looks like he's okay but two backtoback very good pass rush downs by this viking defense keep an eye on Jeremy Lankford number 33 who's just checked in as a running back he's gonna have to pick up a blitz or help in protection in his situation he got beat up earlier in the first half they protected Cutler very well tonight with this patchwork offensive line no sacks allowed by Chicago and Cutler time for Jeremy Langford who has a first down lunging for the 25yard line Anthony Barr made the tackle that's what they need they need their backs to make a much bigger cop contribution in the passing game it's a little option route by Jeremy Langford pressure by Brian Robeson in Cutler's face Jay Cutler has made some great grouse tonight that one under intense pressure and it sets up Chicago in the first down right outside the 20 why / Alshon Jeffrey roads there for the tackle at the 18yard line three minutes into the third quarter Chicago boys to add to a 13 to 3 lead they look at some of these growth by Jay Cutler tonight there's nothing wrong with his arm he throws a rocket the Cameron Meredith for a big first down he gets out of trouble flips the ball to Jordan Howard for a huge play and he does a nice job in fighting the rush on a screen pass and trap pass to Zach Miller got a beautiful job tonight moving this offense against the top graded defense in pro football carry into the pile perches ahead for a yard ran that play right into his strong safety blitz and Harrison Smith no doubt heading back to the Pro Bowl is a man that they like to use off the edge in these rundown situations third and short Jordan Howard back into the game it's going to be a mantoman situation and it's Rhodes at the bottom of the screen working against Geoffrey once again I'm 32 Jordan Howard trying to turn the corner first down that's an NFL run by the rookie they're running a toss sweep you're running east and west you got to know how to get those shoulder pads north and south and finish the run in a first down impressive by the big back out of Indiana what a story he is it's another 100yard rushing game for Howard Rhodes got up very slowly and now he is limping off the field that would be an enormous loss for the Minnesota defense already playing without one of their starting safeties tonight Anderson daeho they've been alternate EJ Ron Kherson Anthony Harris couple of young players in his spot and Trey Wayne's secondyear man out of Michigan State checks into the lineup he's had his problems this year with pass interference Wayans number 26 he certainly had an up and down year they have 15 first rounds Knicks on their roster 11 of them drafted by Minnesota or were first round picks elsewhere now members of the bike is that is it a lot of first round picks where's have just three on their team Chicago three out of three on third down in this Drive that looked like a bit of a busted play and it's away by Jay Cutler in the general direction of Logan Paulson good discipline by Brian Robinson attempt dear man out of Texas it's a bootleg you got to make sure you contain the quarterback in Robeson who does a lot of dirty work for this defense how about what he told us yesterday you see him so often listening while the quarterback is calling the signals he said usually by the second or third possession he thinks he has figured out the terminology for the protections that the other team is going to use and then they have that all night long probably not the case tonight they haven't set Cutler he throws a touchdown pass Sean Jeffery with his first touchdown of the season and they went after the game tray wait that's a tough way to stop Jay Cutler get that ball in the running backs just a long time he eliminated the underneath coverage and a delay slant left rap back Geoffrey had burned a secondyear man from Michigan State but it's the ball handling that eliminated the underneath coverage in hip Jay Cutler and offensive coordinator Dow logins a lot of credit they have moved the ball consistently up and down the field over 300 yards against his biking defense which came in averaging 280 yards per game allowed 75yard Drive took more than five minutes off the clock the extra point good by Connor Barnes terrific returned action for Jay Cutler three Chicago ESPN's Monday Night Football is brought to you by Navy Federal Credit Union federally insured by NCUA by Gillette Pro shield with lubrication before and after the blades shields while you shave tonight at halftime great ceremony bears Great Hall of Famers dan Hampton Richard dent Dick Butkus Gale Sayers honored by the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the ring of excellence ring that was redesigned by Kay Jewelers in 2013 it will be presented to all living members of the Hall of Fame with special ceremonies across NFL stadium including here at Soldier Field tonight honored Barth kicks off another touch back in Minnesota will begin at the 25 down 20 to 3 let's go back and look at this touchdown Sean with a total replay I love this the ball handling is gonna fool Harrison Smith you eliminate the underneath coverage and Jay Cutler throws a beautiful delay slant to Alshon Jeffery just that hesitation about the fall big place excellent work by cutler selling the run and throwing a beautiful tight window slim to Jeffrey I love that combination s Jeffrey's first touchdown well done toss to Ronnie Hillman trying to get outside davon LeBlanc the tackle six yard gain for Minnesota that really counts as a big gainer for their running game they have six runs this year coach of 10 yards or fewer by far the fewest in the National Football League in his Dorf Turner set last night even though Adrian Peterson struggled at the beginning to season before he got hurt usually he's good for two or three explosive runs per game now they can't get one from anybody Bradford on target Stefon Diggs looked like he had enough for the first down and it is spotted there before Tracy Porter sent him back here's Lisa yeah Shawna I was talking to Vikings head athletic trainer Eric Sherman's day to give me an update on Adrian Peterson he said on Thursday he will be six weeks postsurgery he's following his rehab schedule doing well he said he's able to do more range of motion work has increased his exercises to another level since the last time we saw the Vikings in week four he said it's still going to be a while before it's safe to for him to run so timetable I said midnovember middecember he said there really is no timetable when we think it's safe for him to be back on the field it's Ronnie Hillman one of the replacements for Peterson on first down got very little will Sutton backup defensive lineman third year man out of Arizona State made the tackle Adrian Peterson ran the ball 31 times I think this year for the Vikings for 50 yards I don't even know if Adrian Peterson is gonna make yardage behind this kind of blocking they have not created running lanes for anybody to run through second and long can they pass protect they did the offensive line was a problem entering the year they went out in sign free agents Andre Smith and Alex Boone flag down very blatant holding call up coming here against Jake long the pass in the general direction of Ronnie Hillman looked like a throw away from Bradford not even close holding offense number 68 10yard penalty still second out call it on Clemons dick long nose he held to both these tackles struggling Clements was the right tackle last year moved him to left tackle now he's back at right tackle he's working on the right side he gets beat by willie young and tackles him both tackles struggling in pass protection and i would not want to be sam bradford look for a quick screen or some kind of screen take the screen one way and then his pass in the other direction is patted down by twilly young let me pick the quick screen and they run a slow screen the other way Willie young was off to the races and Sam Bradford who has been hurt a lot in his career continues to take severe punishment bacon to the left go up to the right one playing quarterback watch out for Paterson at the top of the screen he's the one man it can change a game with his feet Minnesota 2 for 9 on third down and this is third and 18 they do get it to Patterson with some blockers out ahead of him but he's down well short of the first down at the 36 Ralph Freeman the former Indianapolis Colt made the tackle there's no time for anything yeah commit a penalty you can't run the ball back the back screen passes and it's almost as if the Vikings don't create turnovers and score with their defense they're gonna have a hard time all year moving the ball with this offense way the line is playing it's been a pretty consistent theme around the league lot of offensive lines we've seen both in person on tape this year had struggled Jeff Rock pot bacon by trade on or blonde news down at the 27 yard line it's been the Bears and not the Vikings who have put the pressure on the opposing quarterback tonight a lot of attention obviously this weekend on Wrigley Field the former home of the Chicago Bears they had a lot of success there under George Halas played there from 1921 to 1971 for NFL championship games played at Wrigley Field that venue home the Bears grapes leg Red Grange and Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers Butkus and Sayers here tonight our last championship there in 1963 when they picked up late it'll five times won the NFL championship game more bears in the Hall of Fame than any other team how about that draft in 1965 he get Butkus with the third overall pick and then you get Gale Sayers number four that'll work Jay Cutler under center now running away from the rush I've ever seen gripping then runs out of bounds picked up a yard perhaps a yard and a half but it's an element that the Bears have been missing Brian Hoyer who played very well had four 300yard passing games while Cutler was out just not known for his scrambling ability and Cutler has had to use that movement in the pocket several times tonight one in four while Hoyer was in there despite his big numbers first Bears quarterback ever to throw for 300 yards and four straight games but we're starting to be a debate about whether Cutler would be the quarterback when he came back healthy Gordon Howard runs ahead of course it was a moot point when Hoyer got hurt in the last game at Green Bay and Cutler was ready to come back after missing five games and when Jay was asked about he said well John Fox has no choice Brian pluggers not healthy so I have to play but when we asked Jay about it the other day he said he had been told all along by Fox and Don Loggins when you're healthy you're gonna go back and be the quarterback his 100 start tonight and he has made his presence felt fifty and forty nine as the Chicago quarterback their alltime leader in every major passing category completions attempt yards touchdown passes he throws over the metal to Zach Miller first down into Minnesota Territory watch Jay Cutler in the pocket ever since Griffin screaming around the left side Cutler shows no panic but he moves subtly in the pocket keeps the ball in a throwing position and throws a quick strike the Miller for a huge first down hard to throw the ball with that kind of location and velocity with your feet all over the place what an arm Talent Jay Cutler has nobody has disputed down 17yard completion for the fifth catch of the night for Zach Miller the iformation would know in the past kill the ball hold by Jordan Howard into one yard lost John the question I would have and I think a lot of the viewers would have as they watched tonight and they watched Jay Cutler play a lot over the years you see the talent you see the athleticism but you also see that record 500 for his career here one game over but for his career two under including his time in Denver but why hasn't he been able to do it more consistently well he's got to answer the questions for that but you got a look at his record at the Bears record without Jay Cutler I mean there's six and 14 when he doesn't play he's had a lot of continuity issues here at head coach offensive coordinator he has been up and down helped her skelter in his play but he hasn't had the best protection throughout his day here either Everson Griffin leading the way on the first sack in the last two games for Minnesota they didn't have any in Philadelphia last week and now they have one tonight against Cutler Griffin he's a grinder he's got it the hard way played special teams for a while and has worked himself into a topflight pass rusher got to be real careful on third and extra with a 17 point lead if you're the Bears Pro Bowler a year ago 27 and a half sacks now over the last three seasons for Britt powered bounces off one hit from Robeson who gets run down by Everson Griffin terrific athlete at 273 pounds couple years ago he was the gunner running down covering putts from the outside effort rush the passer rushed the pastor you see the ball from will make the tackle Minnesota surrounded with high effort high football character players and gives you a chance to make a comeback effort like that they're running out of time in a fastmoving third quarter under three minutes to go as Chicago's held the ball for a lot of the court battle Donnell punts their catch signaled by Adam Thielen who made near the 13 yard line 43 yard punt and a timeout with Chicago comfortably on top the last appearance for the Chicago Bears on Halloween night on Monday Night Football is in 1994 they hosted the Green Bay Packers at a very young assistant coach by the name of Jon Gruden it was a torrential downpour Mike Colter was a hit coach and Andy Reed and Steve Mariucci we used to all try to get plays into gameplan Mariucci always got him in there Amy Reed got plays into game plan they always made fun of me but one night on Halloween night 1994 I got to play in the game plan and Mike Holmgren called it and it was a torrential downpour it was red left fake Fox 3 naked right fullback slide up Brett Favre went on the longest touchdown run of his career 36 yards we win the game what you're gonna see me on the sidelines barb ran right by me to go see Mariucci and Reed look at me right there he runs right Bobby that was my play and on the plane home Barry calls me to the front of plane he goes you're getting a game ball that was a great play I walked back to my seat and I called Amy Reed game ball my first game ball is an NFL coach right here Halloween night Sam Bradford he had some young assistant to dial up a good play for him right now Stefon Diggs gang tackled just shy of the 20 yard line I think you're being modest because you actually got two plays in that game that worked good you know did get two I don't have time to show you the other one but that was my first game ball have been traded I've been fired I've been to a lot my career but that was a great night I love Halloween dad Halloween Eve now you've been to a World Series game as well Radford throws Adam Thielen taken down by Devante Boz B this is worse excuse me Sean this is where I want to see Hicks 96 I want to see Hicks take over the game you have them behind in the scoreboard you got them in a predictable situation you played extremely well tonight close them out watch Oh who's just checked into rush as a fresh pass rusher at the top of the screen you got to close them out Matt Asiata everything he could for a fouryard gain jerel Freeman threw him down you surprised John that Minnesota is not picking up the Pacer they're down by three scores one or two minutes to go in the third quarter I am very surprised absolutely no urgency here in the operation on offense for Mike Zimmer we started five and oh they were the last team to lose a game in the NFL started the night of one of three oneloss teams with New England and Dallas around the birds have washed number two unless they can pick it up in a hurry which throw across his body Bradford to Kyle Rudolph and Craven leblanc made the tackle 11 yard gain and if they go to five and two they don't have to look very far to find the Packers and the Lions now four and four and I was very surprised by the optimism level of the Chicago Bears at one in six they were talking about going on a big winning tear in the second half of the season they think they have the talent to do it McGee got his hands on Bradford knocked him down after the incomplete pass P Jake Fleming's can't block Bernal McPhee McPhee comes flying off the right side and Fleming's struggling big time well Rick Spielman the Vikings general management known to make moves most notably went got Sam Bradford when Teddy Bridgewater got hurt they got Bradford eight days before opening day the trade deadlines tomorrow everybody keeps talking about Joe Thomas the great tackle for Cleveland wouldn't be available to trade the Browns say no but if there was every team with the youth really good offensive linemen it's this one and several others Asiata another short run Jonathan Pollard made the tackle and threw three quarters unless they snap it quickly and they're not in any big hurry to do that it's going to be a very unhappy home coming to Chicago for Mike Zimmer in the Minnesota Vikings twenty two three chacha go as we head to the fourth thirty three quarters of Minnesota Vikings have three points they have 147 yards of offense Jordan Howard the working of the rookie running back poured in Chicago is out gained Minnesota by himself he has 156 total yards third down and seven for Minnesota Vikings at their own 44 first play of the fourth quarter Bradford Asiata and taken out of bounds short of the first down by about a yard by Danny Trevathan and I think the Vikings have to go for it excellent throw Trevathan had great coverage and Sam put that ball in there perfectly here comes unwinding Hicks fourth down and short short pass to Rudolph and he has the first down tackled by Adrian Davis Rudolph dis comes across in motion runs a flat craps and Bradford is on the money two short passes but the ball location gets it done and it sets Sam up with a first down at midfield five catches Rudolph tonight Bradford got away from the traffic and has passed a little too hot to handle for Matt Asiata they're missing Jerick McKinnon who's a good receiving back I see out of more of a downhill runner but again the pass rush it just doesn't give Bradford time to get back there and set up and survey the defense he's under duress almost every single time he throws the ball try the run again Asiata weaves his way down to the 43 yard line perhaps the 42 Mitch on Ryan made the tackle Vikings taking their time play selection very important obviously still and puzzled by the pace with which they're getting these plays off a little quicker out of the huddle this time third down five do you think poor down territory the rest of the way here down by 17 points fourman rush Floyd and help comes to Floyd for a sack for Akeem Hicks hooks's pressure by Floyd that forces Bradford up in the pocket and there's just nowhere to go speed rush out here and Sam has to step right up into the rush you see long working against Floyd Sam steps up America the big man Hicks who has had an outstanding game for the bear defense circuitous route to get to this point was highly recruited went to LSU there was a recruiting issue there he was not eligible to play work for almost a year the DirecTV call center was living with a sister living Colorado their get signal made by Clay Baum LeBlanc on a lock punch finally he got a call from a coach at the University of Regina in Canada come play for us that resurrected his football career and he's now a very important member of the Chicago Bears leading 22 3 back in Chicago a quarterback comparison of the big number that jumps out the five times sack to Sam Bradford on top of the six a week ago Mike Zimmer after that game called his offensive line soft we talked with him last night coach you got the sense that he regretted that a little bit he said the players know me I tend to speak my mind they know wasn't personal he said I really wasn't saying they were soft as players I was saying the protection as a whole was soft but if he thought last week was soft this isn't any better and his quarterback has no mobility and Jay Cutler does that too is obvious Minnesota had the ball for 11 plays almost five minutes did not score his Jordan Howard the rookie with his third career 100yard rushing game tonight Eric Kendricks made the tackle bears are gonna try to run the ball obviously and they have to keep an eye on Harrison Smith of the Vikings we used to tell our linemen be alert for a stinger call what is a stinger a stinger is a strong safety blitz and in these situations Mike Zimmer loves to bring Harrison Smith off the edge to try to cause a negative play in a running game and keep an eye on him number 22 robust safety out of Notre Dame our and peered for many of the first down but it looks like the official on the fire Cylons gonna mark him just short the last bears rookie running back to have three 100yard games in a season Matt Forte now with the Jets that was in 2008 one of the most productive backs in the history of the Chicago Bears and he's doing it tonight against an outstanding defense with a rookie center to backup guards it's impressive what the bears have done as a unit Jay Cutler said I faked Ted Larson Derek push veterans have been around backups this year before long and said he got hurt again on the move good throw by Cutler in a first down the Alshon Jeffery Cutler's athleticism is the winning edge he's going to run a sprint out to his right nothing's there but he buys time he keeps his eyes downfield goes a beautiful pass away from the coverage for a huge first down and a clock continues to roll how about the emotion tonight they're 1 in 6 when we spoke with the kiemce Hicks and Willie young two defensive players yesterday said they're excited about the return of Jay Cutler and they acknowledge he's not the most emotional energetic guy and I think that's one of the reasons why sometimes people are so critical of him seems like he's disinterested from time to time fully engaged tonight on target again to Zack Miller and a thumbs up for a sevenyard gain Lindvall Joseph put the pop on Zack Miller he had the odd day Thompson running deep with protection I thought he was going to take a shot the Thompson running clean but he's taking a high percentage plate tonight given the situation he knows the only way the Vikings can get back in this game is by a turnover use all the clock remind everybody that touches it to protect the ball Howard again this 21 years old will be 22 on Wednesday if you want to send him a card he's back to the line of scrimmage good job by Jay Cutler he saw Harrison sniff on that stinger he got to tried to get in his way Cutler even tried to throw a block that time again you like the preparedness we talked at the top of the telecast about what would the game plan be down loggins has done a very nice job just 35 years old as the offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears he knew Mike Zimmer poses a lot of problems with all the wrinkles that the defense brings for Minnesota but the Bears have had the answers tonight I wonder if they're going to count that as a drop you saw the note he had the longest droplet streak in the NFL 102 passes which goes all the way back to 2010 because he missed three full seasons mostly due to injury that stat was on target drops and if that's deemed to be on target it's a drop it's gonna be no gain any our Kendricks read that here's the font digs in there special teams create some field position even they've been uncharacteristically down the last couple of weeks they allowed a kickoff return last week against Philadelphia Cheryl's fumbled a punt he's out tonight's the pond digs tackled excellent coverage by the Chicago Bears 20 to 3 another chance for Bradford with under nine minutes to go ESPN's

the 17 yard line 851 to go to time outs from Minnesota down by 17 three scores over the middle Asiata bobbled it was almost intercepted by Danny Trevathan and Alex Boone starting left guard in his first season where the Vikings came over as a free agent from the 49ers going to the locker room Jeremiah Searles checks in Searles has played both tackle and guard and the spiking offensive line been overhauled they brought in Tony Sparano a new line coach several new linemen it just hasn't come together for a lot of reasons Matt Coyle started every game at left tackle the last four years he's out after hip surgery Siana after Bradford rolled all the way to the far sideline that Asiata runs all the way out near the 50 yard line with eight and a half minutes to go run down by Harold Jones Corte so what they're going to need they're going to need the quarterback to make some unscripted plays Bradford in trouble and you see travail foul dropped his coverage in pursuit of Bradford and Asiata makes a great play here comes the Vikings and the throw pot by Stefon Diggs into Chicago Territory they'll give him forward progress to the 45 yard line it'll be second down about two and a half got to keep an eye on Bradford remember he's new to this offense hasn't had a lot of two minutes situations live under his belt but he's got to get it moving and communicate nonverbally in a hurry Jeremiah Searles playing left guard now for Boone Diggs out of bounds hold across the boundary by Tracy Porter let's see Sam Bradford communicate what plays what formations that he wants I'm shocked her in the huddle right here I was hoping to see Bradford jump the ball and speed this up but clearly his inexperience in this system is effective yeah it really looks like the fight has gone out of them in a lot of ways the pace of which they're operating Bradford dumps it off for Hillman Jarell Freeman made the tackle Chicago China and a long streak they've allowed at least one touchdown in each of their last 66 games and as the longest such streak in the NFL last time they held a team without a touchdown was October 2012 when they 141 to 3 in Jacksonville that was the final year the lovie smith administration pears got to win a home game that would be a huge boost to this franchise if they can address their issues at home so far so good 8:51 to go here at Soldier Field Chicago leading 22 3 Tracy Porter the veteran cornerback limped off the field they're already ravaged by injuries in their secondary we wouldn't know it tonight Minnesota has just three points but Daryl Patterson the catch and enough for the first down to the 29 yard line that's one of my favorite players that I've seen this year his name is Craven Leblanc they picked him up from the Patriots he's played the nickel corner he's come in here and he's played right corner with all the injuries in town Fox likes him over the summer digs to catch the Patriots and the Bears did joint practices together for a few days and LeBlanc got the Bears coaching staffs attention John told us we're actually thinking about trying to trade for him because we knew he probably wouldn't make the Patriots team he got let go by New England on the last cut down and they pounced on him quickly and he's a bear later 22 yearold rookie on a florid Atlantic Bradford wolf over the head of Hilton you look at Vic Fangio it Donna tell the secondary coach you're gonna see the pass rush here quickly get in on Bradford but if you look at the secondary of the Chicago Bears right now they're playing with number 22 Vontae paws beat at left horn they're right corner is Craven Leblanc Maurice Hearst is off the practice squad number 30 and s safety Amos is in his second year as his Harold Jones Forte what a job they've done tonight rattling the Vikings Vic Fangio very highly regarded and the past paddock down Sam Bradford incomplete jaundice Chicago defense does not have a single former Pro Bowl selection in the group Chicago is the only NFL team that does not have at least one player on the defense who's been in at least one Pro Bowl that's something it's unheard of because everybody makes the bow hold on they're going to have some candidates though they've got some young players that are humming tonight Vic Fangio deserves a lot prepared an energetic oneinsix Chicago team tonight Floyd with the rush didn't get there and it's a touchdown to Stephane date so that's 67 straight games in which the Bears have given up a touchdown and hope is still alive on the Minnesota side line they're down 22 9 Oh Bradford got protection and they were able to go after Boz be with their best receivers to find Diggs good pass protection it's a stunt and Sam can step up and finish on his front foot beautiful throw and Diggs Pete's paws feet to the post ballgame second touchdown catch of the year for Diggs 6th of his career and four of them to come against the Chicago Bears 83 yards 10 plays 310 for the scoring drive the first touchdown of the night for the Vikings next week Monday Night Football comes to you from Seattle as the Seahawks host the Buffalo Bills at 8:15 Eastern Time coverage starts at 6:00 with Monday night countdown served by Applebee's catch all the action on ESPN streaming live on watch ESPN 541 to go here in Chicago the Bears now leading 20 to 10 Blair Walsh to kick off Chicago anticipating an onside kick but the hands unit out there and he kicks it down to the eight yard line Deonte Thompson takes a knee no blocking help so he surrenders at the 15yard line good night for Jake Cutler and the Bears sean mcdonagh Jon Gruden Lisa Salters our producer J Rothman director chip Dean are terrific Monday night football through with you from Soldier Field in Chicago Vikings just scored on fourth down and four on a 25 yard touchdown pass Sam Bradford is stephane Diggs opted before gold the onside kick with more than five and a half minutes to go in two timeouts now they need a quick three and out provided by the defense Jordan Howard his big night continues first down 11 yard run that's how you run the ball on a four minute drill every inch matters right off the left side you're going to see 41 Harris a oneonone tackling situation that's just great effort by Howard what a performance by the young back rushing and receiving and if I'm Jay Cutler I'm just gonna remind him protect the ball at all cost let's melt this clock again here's Lisa Salters well Sean you know that Jay Cutler usually does not show a lot of emotions but he certainly has especially in this second half I watched and go up and DAP up his entire offensive line I was even watching him on punt coverage when they made a big tackle he was jumping up and down enthusiastically remember the tuck this week upon his return wasn't so much how excited everyone was but how much longer Jay Cutler was going to be here he told us he wasn't really listening to that noise he's heard of before didn't really care about it but John Fox said that he thought that he would come out here that Cutler would come out here and play with a chip on his shoulder and so far tonight Sean it seems like he really has when he said he was ready to go teammates talked about the attitude and in very positive and a lot of times you hear one in six teams say that it doesn't turn out to be true they play with a lot of energy well the night or the Future Jay Cutler's under contract through 2020 signed a sevenyear deal but after this year none of the remaining almost 79 million is guaranteed but where would they go really no logical successes are you trying to do better in house mat bar cleanest fourth year hasn't started a game Brian Hoyer a journeyman one game over 500 since Ryan pace has been the GM they have not drafted any quarterbacks the last two years Mel Kiper says Mitch Biscay of North Carolina deshaun Watson of Clemson the best available in the next draft music makes it a real mystery with the Monster Mash to get the night started tonight well the Bears are going to have to bring a young arm in here at some point in development but Chicago's not the Lone Ranger with quarterback issues that really need to be resolved Cutler's contract he's 33 years old look around the league there is half a dozen teams that are hoping there's a quarterback in this draft they're gonna pursuit the possible trades Mike Glennon of Tampa Bay what's gonna happen to Kirk Cousins in Washington is there a sleeper in the draft like that Prescott who would have thought young Jack Prescott with starting further Dallas Cowboys doing what he's doing and believe me there's a lot of teams that would love to have a talent that arm like Jay Cutler who's played at times well in this league you mentioned dak Prescott Chicago had three picks in the fourth round and last draft the round of which Prescott was picked before Dallas picked Prescott didn't take them and now that's revisionist history around here but you know every other team in the league didn't take him ether before Dallas did that's right I don't think anybody anticipated he'd be as good and as we've seen back Prescott's been terrific but he's playing behind a terrific offensive line maybe the best in the league you put on behind that Minnesota line you wonder how productive he'd be there's Zach Miller not a great play call by Dowell watt and you CJ I think I am you playing up to the booth to downwind's they have a great relationship and help with Dow logins told us he was a quarterback in high school he's five foot six he said I knew I wasn't really going to be able to play even though I was a starter for two years in high school he could have played at small schools he decided to walk on at Arkansas because he wanted to be a coach he wanted to learn under Houston Nutt in his staff he wound up being the holder for four years and wound up getting a lot of coaching experience with Houston Nutt went on to the Dallas Cowboys nobody's made this much yards against the Vikings nobody this year splitting carries among Langford and Cary and Howard I think their primary back might have emerged tonight what a night for Jordan Howard who takes us to the twominute warning 22:10 Chicago on Monday Night Football on the windy yeah I'm coach Ditka of course the Bears are winning at the twominute warning coming up on the GMC postgame report I'll be joined by while all of these guys in a Sports Center at night with Scott Van Pelt alive is one big thing Tom Brady feeding father time and some bad beats are you really not gonna watch SportsCenter now Shawn John come on man of course we are I think they put a lot more time and effort into Halloween obviously that we did but I'm ready I am as my ode to you at the Chucky stick and the Chuck mask which I was going to wear except it's a little hard to put on with the headset on that's a foul mouth little guy there Chucky yeah be careful with that and am I right in saying you or when you've been home 17 years in a row you've been Chucky I think you even have to wear the mask and you just go like this the kids walking they come up to the door they knock and they say I know that's you coach Gruden I got my chunky mask on 17 years in a row you know Chucky was born in Oakland back in 1998 Harvey Williams one of our running backs we're gonna go 96 96 goes to the right 97 goes to the left we went 96 and Harvey Williams went to the left and I went crazy you nicknamed me Chucky go Chucky face all because of Harvey Williams going the wrong way now look at all these Chucky's everywhere they're everywhere look at these guys a lot of folks in the spirit here it's the lucky thing when I first started working with you I was wondering if I should even reference it but you know it doesn't bother you gotta like I'm a moody person as you know I have my bad times especially when there's a lot of penalties that are going against me that's why I love this tonight three penalties yeah Chucky would not have come out tonight it's been a clean game only three flags thrown and I credit these officials for letting the men play there were a couple games yesterday my old team the Oakland Raiders they won a game with 24 penalties they have their record but the Raiders are rolling can't wait to see them in a couple weeks on Monday Night Football in Mexico City how great is that gonna be awesome great atmosphere that game sold out no time flat okay so Chucky masks at that game I promise you playing the Houston Texans no turnovers for the Bears tonight they've given up only one sack committed just to penalty Jordan Howard takes us under a minute to go how about the history of the running back position at the Chicago Bears Gale Sayers here tonight the great one Walter Payton Matt Forte and perhaps the emergence of another star Jordan Howard what a story he is but to go to work every day in the tradition of Walter Payton Gale Sayers Matt Forte what an opportunity what a responsibility it is for Jordan Howard to beat great to give all he has and he's a fine young man and drop football at UAB lost his dad as a young kid kept grinding kept playing and here he is with an explosion on Monday Night Football good for him kept grinding I wonder if that's a foreshadowing of things to come you're getting it Shawn I tell you eight games of you now well that's foreshadowing that's a little multisyllable word I usually don't use but the youngest player ever with 200 yards plus of offense in a game for the Chicago Bears paddled Donald a punt with 15 seconds to go and the Minnesota Vikings after that flying five and OH start when they were playing basically mistakefree complementary football on offense struggling up front and affecting the entire offensive operation they'll need to regroup if they've been be a very competitive division in this NFC knowing bigs trying to make a play brings it out to about the two yard line Nick wachowski and sheriff McManus McManus a special teams standout for the last couple of years for Chicago credit John Fox a head coach of the Bears oneinsix second year did not inherit a starstudded roster they had a lot of aging players cap problems they have to rebuild this team he and general manager Ryan bass get a huge win tonight and this can be a launching pad for this team they have a lot of young players it desperately needed a win to give them confidence it was a team that really got old all at once guys like Urlacher forte and marcin I'm really old but I'm old enough that the average age was among the oldest in the league now they're one of the youngest and perhaps a sign of progress tonight a convincing win engineered by Jay Cutler 20 to 10 the final as they take down the Minnesota Vikings with won the last three headtohead between these division rivals SportsCenter coming up next including the GMC postgame report and we'll be back in just a matter seconds to reveal this week's choice for the Gruden grinder see in a minute and thanks for watching Monday Night Football from the great city of Chicago you
