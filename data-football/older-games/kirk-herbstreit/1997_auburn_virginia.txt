Jerry punch working the sidelines let's check in with him right now thanks Mike in hello everybody you know never in his 16year history of head coach the Virginia Cavaliers is George Wells had to replace some of these charter that's why one of the key men tonight will be up front where the extremely inexperienced an athletic Cavalier offensive front while somehow trying to slow down a veteran and extremely quick Auburn defensive front you know cavalier quarterback Aaron Brooks is extremely mobile he likes to tuck into run when he wants to as evidenced by his impressive performance last year in the car quest Bowl when he ran for 60 yards I guessed a very good Miami defense the only problem is tonight he may have to tuck into run a little more often than he would like Mike George Wells beginning his 16th year in Charlottesville as the first ACC coach to win over 100 games and Terry vowed to starting his fifth year with the Tigers a sparkling 36 9 and 1 record he first 20 games Virginia won the toss they have deferred to the second half Auburn will receive and John Allen Roberts will pick away to mark Keith cook and we are underway in Charlottesville to the 20yard here the ever start battery starting lineups for Auburn Damien fright leads the offense as a pastor and runner third in the SEC in total offense last year the Tigers leading receiver junior Carsten Bailey who had a teamhigh 45 catches in 96 the leastexperienced group the offensive line but Victor Reilly the only senior talented enough to be a preseason allamerican Michael look for Auburn to take some chances tonight opening game you got a veteran quarterback and Damian Craig down by the Cornett starts at tailback struggle with this gravis Griffith gets the sack but that looked like it was all nerves on the part of Damian Brent well remember Mikey J Dunnigan is moved from tight in and defensive lineman to be the center so you figure that they've worked together for the last two weeks but a little nervous starting off the ballgame while a reader makes the play on Damian Craig along with Travis Griffith what a tough spot to be in first fifteen yards second and in a toy yard off people on the ground to get some breathing her from Antonio Dingle one of three excellent tackles in jr. he's a preseason allacc pick the linebacking core hit hard by the NFL Draft but Wally Raynor last year second leading tackle is back in the middle an Anthony Poindexter an allamerican Canada a year ago at 98 tackles more than any other ACC defensive back the playbook and the plaintiff conservative stacked up on the middle of the defense Maurice Anderson led the charge to the Cavaliers great start it is Mike and when you look at what Virginia's lost on defense you figure how can they be a good defensive team but their coach Rick Lance says he has three defensive tackles that are number one prospect you know Poindexter is going to be a number one pro prospect so they got a lot of good athletes on the field Jarrett Holmes an outstanding twoway putter in his own and Thomas Jones waits at midfield the Cavaliers say they've got innocence safety is offered recovers holy cow what a start for the Cavalier defense it looked like Dwayne Stoops was the man who made the block what a start where really is Mike when you look at winged Stoops he was a corner that they didn't expect to start this year he came off the corner of miss blocking assignment and special teams in the first ball game of the year a lot of times determining factors Stoops number five those seemed come inside right here just a mist blocking assignment the personal protector didn't see him either he's supposed to pick him up also and they were very fortunate that Jared Holmes got on the footballer it would have been a touchdown but not a good way to start on the road because you want to take the crowd out of the ballgame not bring them in Virginia may have seen something from last year with puffballs head two months block the 1996 when you lose a lot of players Mike and your inexperience you need good things to happen early and that was a big break for Virginia we talked today that it was critical with eight starters back for the younger guys to get their confidence boosted and this will certainly do it Wilkins and Jones will wait back at the 25yard line and Jarrett Holmes with a freekick you only have ten men on the field for Virginia it's gonna cost them a timeout again a special teams ear here in the first quarter the other thing it does is cost them some emotion because you want to keep the game going at this point when your special teams coach you look up you've wonder where they head coaches hat because you know he's gonna come down that sideline that's Danny Wilmer George well she's not happy about that use the timeout in a kicking situation here well George showed up right on to you that's another thing about having a young people not really sure their assignments all the time but sometimes they want to buy a ticket instead of plan again Jones and Wilkins weighted to 20 after the penalty Wilkinson to 13 47 yards on the return Mike what makes that really important is that you bring an inexperienced quarterback in Aaron Brooks and he has great field position so he can come in loose Terrance Wilkins gets a big block from Thomas Jones number six the starting tailback cuts back against the grain and sets up here's the block by Thomas Jones number six right there let's see if Virginia can convert beautiful field position Joan starts at tailback who's got Toby Jones gets the carry then hit initially by charles dorsey and pushed back into the backfield virginia's quarterback firstyear starter Aaron Brooks a good scrambler with a very strong arm to succeed he needs better accuracy receiver Jermaine Pro L is the complete package size and speed he could be Virginia's best since Herman Moore only two starters back on the offensive line the tackles Doug car Zeus Kia preseason allconference pick they give him three yards again the 35 for Auburn's defense on the line all three starters back left in Jimmy Brumbaugh was the nose tackle last year led the line in stops inside linebacker Takeo Spikes only a junior but this is his second season as the Butkus Award candidate and safety Brad where made the All SEC Freshman team a year ago after time for the team Virginia will instead it's the fullback interesting night three times in a row they ran over there leastexperienced long you'll make very conservative calls here in the first quarter I thought when they had to good punt return that they had field position that they might want to open it up with their and Brooks but you know you got an experienced quarterback when he get his feet on the ground Takeo Spikes the allamerican linebacker number 55 making that tackle Frank Rotella will come in to try a very short punt the ball spotted at the 34 yard line just try to poach it down to Cooper hi and the cavalier is bedded back and down it inside the 5yard line and the officials will talk it over and it will come out to the 20 Shawn junk downfield trying to make the play couldn't do it on special teams we've got a timeout with 10 19 to go first quarter is it nothing shutout it starts here it starts here it also starts here and here and it all starts right here at Walmart home of the ever start battery a powerful battery for trucks cars boats and mowers that you can count on to starter when you've needed to and since it's at Walmart you can also count on a good price ever starts the name says it all ever notice that a year that's my quicker these days which means the weeks go by quicker and the days the minutes introducing the allnew supercharged Regal GS no other sports sedan packs in this much fun power and standard safety features into your life so you can get everything done hey when life is back the allnew Regal GS by Buick official car of these supercharged family neat hardware don't miss the service starting coasttocoast great American fix up sail the Potomac eightbyten tarp just 294 a stanley power locked April only 794 the things to do yourself for needs are at service star and coasttocoast doors back to action and Cooper on first and ten will get to maybe free off the right side and my god fraid I think if things start to go south here for Virginia they will look back at the two huge plays they had early in the game that produced only two points for Lee and you're right Mike a conservative call spot again when you have an inexperienced quarterback that last year split time they're trying to get his feet on the ground I think in that first search and it been a great time to throw because you're in the Auburn field position second and seven Craig will go to the shotgun he's got three wide receivers in the game hits for number 89 joins discarded Kragen a little half roll under pressure throws it alive was getting pressure from the middle linebacker Wally and they did a nice job making sure they strung it out and didn't give a break any room to run with Damien Cragen he played a blunt highschool and mobile for Ben Harris an outstanding coach he won two state championships all burned his Southern Mississippi really the only two schools that recruit him as a quarterback he said I'm a quarterback I want to be a quarterback Joe Witt recruited him and they recruit him as a quarterback now's his time has run five plays they have lost in a total he was very good last year sis on third down third and seven here creig under pressure throws in the flats of Cooper shakes the tackle shakes another driven out of Bounce across the 30 he's got the first down nice job as Joe Williams missed the tackle on the sidelines the other thing I talked about in the first game is special teams in tackling because sometimes you don't tackle alive in the preseason practice and you're gonna see Joe Williams this two balls thrown out in the corner and the flat to mark Keith Cooper he's only 5 foot 760 pounds just missed tackles that allowed him to get that first down otherwise Auburn would be punting the ball away again new set of downs outside the cordon who put the single setback display right the Cooper again in the flat three Cavaliers waiting for him this time in a gain of only two good tackle by Williams Virginia was just devastated by the draft an indication of what kind of talent level George Welsh has built here at Virginia the two linebackers they lost sharper and Ferrier they were the two top linebackers taken in the draft also John Harris Tiki Barber the great running back and two guys taking the late around that's a lot to lose off the football team but Virginia's at the point where they can replace the like they got athlete's bleeding here's the shotgun some reverses Sofia Cavaliers did a nice job of stringing that one out and Dwayne's Dukes the left corner made the tackle but again you look at a quarterback like Damien Sprague a lot of quarterbacks would have been sacked here he had the option on to come to this side of the field this is ball off shotgun now the option stopped because a good call by Virginia they had the strong safety fire coming on but a good tackle by green scoops have been in the open field big third down again for Auburn keep this drive alive Greg the leading rusher among SEC quarterbacks a year ago and it comes the bliss and it was Greiner the middle linebacker while a reader is starting middle linebacker last year he had farrier and sharper on both sides of him he has to pick it up a little bit this year makes a big play number 44 middle linebacker on a little song blitz gets off his feet into throwing Lane and knocks that ball down on Damian Craig gerrae Holmes will punt to Thomas Jones and right now Auburn looks like the team that doesn't have all those the side of his foot and take a punt of only 26 yards and again good field position for the Cavaliers some families get more done in a day than others do in a week they're the first to do anything including to say now there's a car that does as much as your supercharged family introducing the allnew supercharged Regal GS no other sports sedan squeezes in this much supercharged power and standard safety features into your daily routine Regal GS by Buick like the blur the allnew Regal GS the official car of the supercharged family what are the rights okay Bunker's left okay and a pin is oh my people can't wait to finish their round after all when there's a nice cold Michelob waiting at the end time is of the essence trade your carts there's nothing your big King know it's a bad coach no in the backside yes sir it is well what's the smart kid like you doing sitting on the bench played quarterback really like taking candy from a baby the new big king from Burger King flamebroiled with 75% more beef it's like a Big Mac except it's bigger and tastes better and right now you can get one for just 99 cents coach that I could point out back Indiana faces North Carolina's wrecking ball defense and dynamite or of receivers Indiana vs. North Carolina Saturday noon on espn2 ESPN's presentation of college football those brought to you by Buick welcome to Park Avenue the allnew Park Avenue by Buick the power of understatement and by serviced our visit your service star or coasttocoast or now during the great American picked up Vail Virginia leading it to nothing here with 748 to go first quarter a year ago the Cavaliers seem to have everything on offense especially Tiki Barber but when it came to the quarterbacks Tim Sherman and Aaron Brooks in his relief 5 touchdowns and 18 interceptions the worst ratio ended brought a job breaks one tackle gets it to the 40 yard line good Mike you're right they want to get this quarterback speed on the grind he this was a good call because Auburn had a blitz on them took heel spikes is coming in he gets picked up by duck Karski number 79 and that almost popped even though they only gain three yards it slows down the rush Jones out of Big Stone Gap that'll make them feel better a safe call might because you sprint him out to the right he's a righthander you bring closer to his receiver it's Jermaine Crowell the six foot five receiver curl route right in front of our TV is Houston the outstanding safety ran out right good throw those have an arm good he's got a strong arm worse than 10 Cavaliers Jones nice 36yard walk 13 in high school he rushed for more than 7,000 yards Casey Crawford number 86 the top of your screen he's got the good block and they're handling this defensive line of Auburn that was the concern I had the quickness of Auburn's defensive line but so far Virginia has handled them Crawford only get a couple and Ricky Neil one of the inside the linebackers had him around the knees Neil was second on the team in tackles new year ago had a hundred and eleven he's got a big playmaker for well safe play calling for Aaron Brooks and juicy you mentioned Mike last year he split time at the quarterback position but in the spring George lost solely the quarterbacks job is yours he now has more confidence that they will need to come out of this game second and seven whoops in trouble thrown the ball away right up the middle Charles Dorsey the nose tackle we talked about the player turnover for Virginia and Mike they have four new coaches three of them former head coaches well George Walsh felt like that he wanted he lost some coaches Tom O'Brien now the head coach of Boston College will do a nice job there but he wanted some different ideas he hired Sparky woods his offensive coordinator out of Memphis State and feels like then he's turned the offense over his party third and seven per jigna will go with three wide receivers wilkins's in the straw and movement by the Cavaliers and that was Thomas Jones the tailback along with fatty Sherman the right guard line burn down Mike but also goes into play calling is the fact that you open up with Auburn in their coordinator Bill Oliver runs a lot of different defensive coverages so they just don't want to turn Aaron Brooks loose and make the mistake here early in the ballgame and get his confidence down and this defense was tied for the lead in turnovers last year in the nation of 36 now it's third in 12 for books new Cavalier Ross has time intervals hi Pro L and Virginia has squandered excellent field position again but we'll have to punt of the law and remember that night now they've had a couple shots down here you mentioned earlier they got the safety instead of touchdown they've been down here inside the 52 times in offer and it just not untracked yet offensively playing well defensively but offensively just a little sluggish here in the early going Cooper weights it to 10 Rotella will punt again nearly got it down within the 5yard line the last time you kick and this time the cavalry the 10 yard line and course Auburn to start from the 8 great job by Virginia on special teams twonothing Cavaliers Here I am with my own car wow it's my mom who's been trapped anyway I'm on the road it's raining and the windshield to reach so my dad said listen honey let me show you how to install the new wiper blade so here he comes with a tool about some screwdriver looking off furious I'm like yeah we use exact bit wiper blades to strike oh no complicated instructions no confusing parts with them below hassle they just click on easy sometimes I don't know what he do without me boys of summer had to do chopped science on the mouse will beggars bring the hardware home this year kipper and glass the law and Watson even home at Bristol University with thousands of applicants competing for less than a hundred sixteen eighty and his SATs 4.0 GPA average student body president especially important are the teacher recommendations I have expressed my concern to Jason's parents about a successive tvwatching he's been caught skipping school to attend football game sounds like a Bristol man he's Mike Patrick by gottfried Jerry punch our entire ESPN curl with you on a Thursday night from Scott Stadium in Charlottesville Virginia Auburn has started from the 20 the 20 and now the 8 yard line rusty William peasley absolutely as well Johnny's shy verse number 99 went through after the ball was handed to Beasley and nailed Damian Craig well the most important thing is you look at the center position now that's TJ Dunnigan the linebacker standing on top of him that's danny green but Dave got a lot of penetration on this Auburn line now Rick trick at the offensive line clips and it's the best offensive line he's had but they're young and may not cybers was very fortunate play with the court second and nine this time they get in one room for rusty Williams and he picks up about five let's check in with Jerry punch doctor you mentioned Rick trick into Auburn Safari offensive line coach during two chains the possession a moment ago he lit up the big ugly's up front talking about though exactly what Mike was talking about the penetration up fraud he was very concerned about the linebacker penetration he changed some blocking schemes and wanted to be able to baby possibly run some misdirection to maybe some trap blocks on the backside he wanted to set up some traps the backside of the early plays here peep in their territory all right Jerry let's see if they can spring when it's 36 right there well you always trap defensive linemen packs this time instead he'll float it downfield Bailey let's say a flag down Baili against Dwayne Stoops it's going to be a tough call if that's interfering yeah if its defensive interference I think it's defensive interference and I think that Damian Craig scrambling ability caused that play he's able to break contain now you put the defensive back in a tough position personal foul roughing the passer on the deep end that's interference in the offense it was offset replay third down Mike I honestly thought it was going to be offensive interference because Carsten Bailey went up over the shoulder him Dukes came back for the football Victor Reilly the big tackle sixfootfive 313 pounds against Shannon Taylor with the penalty on Damien Craig do as a blanket Gregg was near side and throws he's got a complete or this 2:22 that will bring up a fourth down the coverage by Joe Williams the intended receiver Carsten Bailey again hit like a typewriter my coffin looks very very sluggish grow over here early and the bad news is it got fun again inside their 20yard line they have been bottled up the entire first quarter great job by the Virginia defense holds the punt and Jones rates at the 45 Virginia looking in a potentially great field position again Jones from the 37 makes a couple men and back in the Auburn territory at the 43 the West Virginia defense faces their second straight major challenge last week it was Marshalls all worldwide out Randy boss this week Buccaneer back Scott Harley was third in the nation in rushing last season but the Mountaineers counter with a star of their own a massero IU at 174 yards and three touchdowns in the opener the linemen will dig in the backs will run all day be there at 12:30 Eastern and Ames like he is this would be a good down to throw the football deep but oh well the fullback inside the 42 about the 38 Virginia I think has to get something out of this drop again playing conservative but all in the place for their quarterback again inside the 50 yard line where you like to take the little chances with your quarterback but trying to get his feet on the ground first down to cut down or hem just throw they picked up four yards any time you pick up four yards on a running plan successful Pro L is out of there right now and Sean Jones has checked into the wide receiver squad he's going to the top of the screen judge the tailback they were giving out sneezing blocking down the left side of that line Mike good good block by the offensive line on the left side Charles Kirby the fullback number 36 he offsets he the left side having their way with offer there's number 36 Charles Kirby with a good lead block and then Thomas Jones Joseph's beat only had 36 carries last year baddies shamone got a good block on the pole as well Jones five one yard so forth and that's 204 Sean Jones who's in there right now for pro well Mike the other thing when you establish the running game which is exactly what George Wilson Sparky woods are trying to do right now when you have a quarterback that's mobile off of the running game then you've got the waggles you've got the boots you got the naked where all of a sudden you get there and flips outside so their key is establishing the running game that's their game plan tonight Boyle comes back on second and 10 ran away from spikes and forced out of bounds she kid at 6 498 pounds he doesn't look like he's all that fast but he just runs away from people Aaron Brooks drops back to pass and all of a sudden the second dimension becomes available as the running back you see the linebacker Rickey Neil trying to cover it back in the flat takes him out of the middle and all of a sudden the scrambling lien is open they'll go with two tight ends Washington checks in for the Cavalier they have the first down but there's a write them down on the floor one of the lines been through it defense end up offsides for a veteran team making uncharacteristic mistakes right now see right here as you look down the line of scrimmage that looks like the helmet is offsides before the play shows the hand Marcus Washington number 82 again a nice time to throw the football first down that playaction fake off of the run there is pressure from behind nice block toward Marcus Washington putting the pressure on from the blindside a step too late to get the brush so we talked about early the conservative play calling what that it does is that sets this play up good standing in the pocket by Aaron Brooks and here's the reception by Jermaine pearl good coverage Nikhil spikes from the 55 and Albin tougher on that one gave up maybe a half yard so far when you look at this play kristinia offensive line has handled this bunch right here and they've got good size on the defensive side of the Nardo Carson Charles Dorsey Jimmy Brumbaugh all good defensive linemen but Virginia had problems last year in the red zone which they also had tiki bar judge has the single setback Brooks the throne is that a touchdown are they going to market short they will market short the endzone to get the ball came back to the football what's he supposed to do is recession Terence Wilkins a form of tailback he moved the wide receiver and the coaches at Virginia George Washington say that he can really make you miss because she's running back skills third and goal the classic joke ow Virginia again fails from pointblank range the recovery by Brad where Mike a big mistake there was by Virginia they had eight seconds on the clock really should have taken some time there let the clock expire and then move to the other end settle your offense down and call the play an option play the left side here and press open Thomas Jones is wide open for the score Auburn football when we come back to nothing Virginia you worry you're overprotective you're a parent isn't it nice to know that there's something almost effortless you can do to protect your family even more just ask your State Farm agent for a free

commercial on this super power you get national exposure plus $10,000 it's the see your small business on the super bowl search enter now at mailboxes etc this time the tailback they started down to nothing getting a breathing room out here the poor yard line take a look at the first quarter stats and they tell you that Auburn has not been able to do anything offensively to rush yards only 11 passing a total of nine and I have to go back to the point Virginia has had multiple opportunities in the first half they only have two points on that safety offer it has to be feeling pretty good right now if you're over and coach right now you feel very good the fact that you're only down to nothing rusty Williams crack set up to about the 8th stop by Rainer the middle linebacker is been very active in the first day out Virginia defense again remember they have three defensive tackles that Ric Lansing defensive coordinator feels like this would be number one draft choices in the polls when they grab those are they here to defense and lost him great state we've done the three Anthony Poindexter to its feet the prince opposed to Beasley first down and more 25 26 yard line before he's finally knocked out of bounds Travis Griffith had a bead on Damian Craig but Greg was equal to the task quick release by Damian Craig right here to see the little fake inside now all of a sudden now you break contain and here's Fred Beasley wide open in the flat outside the linebackers picks up the first down and he's a former tailback so he has good skills tackled by Anthony Poindexter to the safety and the guy he ran away with the plum was a freshman violent creep the outside linebacker so first there books where the ball that I think he was down at the Virginia 38 yard line a gain of 35 Mike Brett Beasley is an interesting story because he came to Auburn as a tailback and they talked to him two years ago they said listen you play fullback this year we need you to pull back and then we'll put your tail back but then last year they played in five games tailback position but now he's back at fullback here Damian Craig finds him but that's a good athlete out there in the middle of the football field catching that football against Virginia now the field positions change once again it was firing three two freshman linebacker who markeith people taking a tailback now forced to the sideline and taken down gain of maybe a yard Donnie rein number 33 wouldn't let him to get away you look at Damian Craig and it's hard for us to understand he's not on the Unitas yeah as one of the best quarterbacks that's 19 quarterbacks and he's not on the list and when I asked him I said are you disappointed I'm not disappointed he said I think it's a disgrace to our University the tradition we've had at the quarterback position and I've got a figure he's got to be one of the best 19 quarterbacks in college football Seavers on second and ten Cooper on the toss down to the 35 once again it was Rainer the middle linebacker number 44 Beasley with a good block marina cleaned it up in a hurry take a middle middle linebacker in a 43 set number 40 more sitting right back here while a greener number 44 he's deep in this Oh James third and seven and he's got Hicks four and four fights to get to the sticks is that a great name or would Nick's poor for Marietta Georgia it's better than being the reverse my kid I'm going to go back again because hits poor almost made the same mistake almost came back inside that first down marker and you go back to Virginia they had a receiver in the end zone it was welcome Terence Wilkins and he came out of the end zone to make that catch and they spotted him on the oneyard line so that could have been a touch and then he came back and didn't up the clock expire and ran the option fumbled football so they missed some Vodun opportunities Williams back tailback spot for Auburn it's Beasley the fullback bounces off the fire again talk about Fred Beasley and he's such a weapon Rodney Allison the offensive coordinator said he can be the best fullback in the country he has to go back learning skill but he also blocks his a bird back nique your team where he was able to pick the back side now Auburn starting to look like the ballclub uncle rusty Williams we talked about you just made a statement Gary office now looking like the offense and the ballclub that we expected that remember there's no exhibition games there's no other preseason there's nothing all of a sudden you get on the road in this hospital atmosphere and the defense isn't playing like you're scout team and all of a sudden you go back to huddle and say hey they're a little faster in those guys back off and it's running up the Virginia plays and so it takes a little while to simulate that speed good koala that's what he said but talked to him last night and said you know I wanted to prove to everybody last year I was a quarterback so I stood in the pocket and there were times when I wanted to run but I just didn't feel like if I ran it say hey I'm a slammin quarterback and I I can't read V fetches and all that but this is the difference in him this year he looked he looked he looked he went through his three progressions he decided to tuck it run for the touchdown there is nothing wrong with doing it all at home Damian Craig hit three passes on this Drive and then ran it in from 17 yards it has been in 22 locations storage compartments in 12 locations 10 speakers in 8 locations cupholders in 14 locations and lights in over 20 locations so now you know the secret to dodge caravans userfriendly design location location location Dodge Caravan now get up to $1,000 cash back during the Dodge big summer clearance Holiday Inn hotels are undergoing a billion dollar renovation to make every holiday and as good as the best Holiday Inn what that means we're changing a lot more than the sheets Holiday Inn on the way we are artists muscle agility speed molded into raw power ESPN's presentation of college football is brought to you by the new guy it's about change how quickly things can change it looked for all the world like Virginia would score to go up nine nothing instead they fumble and Ogron goes 98 yards to take the lead Jared Holmes to kick off Stoops and Wilkins are deep for Virginia and taken down near the 20 let's go to Jerry punch doctor the big question king college football this year early owners who would win the Ronald curry sweepstakes curry considered to be maybe the best college quarterback and point card in America out of Hampton High School now early today I call down the Hampton High School and ask Mike Smith Harry's head football coach where will you go what do you make a decision he said yes one legislative decision he is going to commit today verbally for the University of Virginia so Ronald curry comes to Virginia and he will bring with him outstanding linebacker Darnell Hall you're his brother the whites pretty good Miami Dolphin and also tied in Bobby Blizzard so Blizzard Collier and furry from Hampton come into Virginia Jerry congratulations on breaking that story for us look at some of the numbers for curry this is for the passing for more than 5,600 as well and we'll play both sports at Virginia come away on the kickoff for the inside their camp Jones on the bra boy gets it out to about the 15 you know Calvin's football is here when you get a sleigh to games like this Saturday 3:30 Eastern a quintet of regional games highlighted by Peyton Manning in the Vols heading out to the Rose Bowl of face UCLA Washington BYU are also with early national implications than in primetime prime times alma mater the Seminoles of Florida State take their aerial attack against us C's own version of primetime Jalen McCutchen whoopsie that's drawn gets it up before twelvethirty charity this kid has got to get six catches a game he's dead good that important to the offense well there's no doubt in the beginning of kooks long harvest he'll spikes on the Blitz and again you like the weird Brook stands in the pocket here's the route just a little sitdown route by Jermaine Pearl and then he turns it on up the football field for well three catches 38 yards so Paul straight back in the pocket Kenzi this is the product of youth but he is sure waiting a long time for those receivers to uncover and he really is he still being a little cautious throwing the football and there's a flag down back where Brooks threw the football hold it Philistine yard mic with an inexperienced quarterback what you'll worry about is negative plays and and penalties and then the turnover sets in here to hold by Doug Kisuke number 79 but when you put a game quarterback in a bad position like this now you can put some heavy coverage on him and to me the key for Virginia tonight is not to throw the interceptions and fumble the football with already come at once busting 25 then that good enough to overcome that Jones on the draw get a compass but Jimmy Brumbaugh and a host of Natesville waiting for Iran were working in one of the 50 might go back to Ronald Curie Jerry punch break in that story I mean that's big in college football because a lot of the recruiting people topper to Don California had him as the best player Tom lemming service he he was being recruited he headed down the Michigan Florida State Duke Virginia North Carolina and finally came down to North Carolina Virginia and I would say it's probably one ralph sampson commitment in basketball that top bacon absolutely except ralph didn't play football too with plenty of time dumps it off the Wilkins underneath man fights been fair to nail him along with Brad where this Takeo Spikes of some linebacker II set his goals when he came to Auburn the first year to start as a freshman he wanted to be an allamerican last year with second team and he wants to win the does that would been against him he does that would been against him he had a hundred and nineteen tackles last year and that his recruiting was big because he was mr. football in the state of Georgia came down to Florida State ball burning Auburn after to heaven he was the only sophomore who was the finalist third and 16 for the cavalier stand up run 25 that's what you don't have you don't have you been already situations because now they can hang up on Jermaine Crowe al there's a penalty marker down personal foul roughing the passer that is HUGE instead of the interception if we have some big plays so far a lot big penalties in this Terry Bowden wants to know what all football coaches want to know who is it on oh yes shot to the head with the helmet Quinn Reese yeah the outside linebacker but you fight so hard to get to the quarterback you get blocked in finally you hit him and they throw 15 yards but that was 15yard penalty I saw by the referee southeastern Kondo a new life for Virginia trying to clear some cobwebs he's hit six out of nine Jones behind Virginia's got a pretty good job running the football so far I think that's their key they've gotta have put mix in and running in a Thomas Jones looks like a good back he was recruited by Notre Dame in Tennessee in his first Gary here at Virginia he went 57 yards against Central Michigan but he has good quick feet 510 199 played behind Tiki Barber last year and people are spoiled here a little bit with Tiki Barber because he used to running 60 yards out averaging four and a half yards is shot here in the first half that'll get it done Shawn Jones number 19 concerns there's the strong joke you're not getting a lot of pressure on the quarterback either no and given Aaron Brooks time to find the curl route just a strong curl here where the backers can't get out underneath it strongarm earn Brooks Shawn Jones with reception now an experienced quarterback he played half the time last year had a wide open Jermaine girl and just couldn't hit him but you're going to see a quarterback here I think with the tools who's going to develop into a good quarterback when they get into the conference schedule also I like his arm strength like the scrambling ability and he's seen a lot of things tonight for the first time a lot of different coverages the Auburn coaches said the one thing he can do is really throw that out nice saving tackle by Brad where the free safety if he doesn't make that tackle Jones my skill to run Hawaii Mikey just came out of his second day but everybody's joining college football those safeties real close so they those safeties real close so they could play the run and grab the rear seats right away he reads the block of the offensive linemen he knows it's rung right now there's number 27 seve come up he beats the block he's able to come in and make that tackle on the draw Thomas Jones Brandon was the wide receiver who couldn't get there to make the block otherwise it would have been a huge play 37 when we come back seven to Auburn they come from the small cities and big farms leaving behind their egos and their innocence bringing only their speed their dreams and perhaps a small fire extinguisher for the sweat and the heat and the pain of Joe ball and they're on the Black Diamond we're witness to the greased lightning of the flying backs the brute strength of the sock temples and the spontaneous combustion of those who foolishly ignore the giant turkey thermometers chorus light salutes the guides of the grill line men who know that when you're about to burst playings there's only one beer capable of cooling down that burning thirst frost brewed Coors Light because you spend so much time in here we apply the same technology that makes today's finest home so comfortable windows that

get up to a thousand dollars cash back during the Dodge big summer clearance Saturday aim is zero we in the nears get it on in Morgantown East Carolina West Virginia Saturday at 12:30 only on ESPN Virginia in the middle of an impressive Drive facing third and seven inside the Auburn 40 they're down seven two with 419 to go in the first half now he scrambles and gets near the 30 yard and that would be a first down nice job of getting just enough the fans were yelling at him to run the football they felt like he was going to throw it but they don't understand when you're looking for receivers you're concentrating so hard you're not looking at opens right up Takeo Spikes number 55 the middle linebacker he's just working in zone coverage now all the sudden she's hearing Brooks run the football in that little fake got him the first down this tackle by steel spikes first down Cavaliers just outside the 30 Joe it's about three the Auburn 28 yard line and getting up off the pile was putting a reach number 86 from the outside line back my Karen Brooks is doing a lot of checking off at the line of scrimmage now Thomas Jones the tailback watch him move right here he's here in the automatic night it backed up he did it a couple seconds before we moved it but he backed up a couple steps because he was sitting closer to the line of scrimmage to block on a pass he changed the running back with the step he was in position to carry football offensively here comes the Blitz they see Crawford who cut only four balls a year ago he/she Crawford good afternoon he was drafted by the Braves out of the high school Safety's real deep on him can't even see us safety now all of a sudden you see Brad where for me to make the tackle third one big third down for Virginia the bankers my short of the toilet a personal foul by Clinton Reese on that interception pool yo and if they marketed to 20 he's got the first down Spike's makes the tackle you know you see a running back his the lead blocker goes to the right he goes to the left that's for vets vision that's when he sees the scene that he thinks he can get the needed yard well he gets the ball so deep that he's got the ability to cut back that's the key Aaron Brooks has to give it to him about four and a half yards deep sleek and make that cut this was not a generous spot the official on the far side marked it at the 20 the official on the near side came in and marked it short of the point but it's a first down down the last I'll say it again Virginia better get something out of this Drive and indeed more than three here Mike yeah three is not good for them down here even though it gets them back into the where another score could take the lead but they need some confidence again they had trouble last year when they got ripped home first content outside the 23 why this junk what's the troll he goes down bang of the 27 yard line Charles Dorsey will get the sack Ricky Neal also applying pressure on our burn games drawing that done a good job by offering a good defensive call by Auburn because watch the defensive lineman in and the linebackers moved to the side that they thought that the past play was going to go there's 91 charsi in making the sack and George Welsh didn't need a negative play but he got one a loss of seven second and 17 14th play of this Drive like a screen welcome did a good job to get anything out of that down to the 24 yard line and apartment 14 Washington and spikes converged on him there there's a thought process now if you're Sparky woodsy offensive coordinator 124 to go on the clock you got an inexperienced quarterback you try to go down field for the first down when we try to catch him with a trap for draw some safe pass to pick up some yardage and get the field goal I think he'd go for the first down here even though you got a young quarterback because you may need more than three to beat this all those people because you're offering two contracts team this is the same kind of position very clearly in the sexual whistles stop the play there was movement up five I think it's delay a game Mike lay of game offense finished five yards here's the problem for Aaron Brooks the clocks are not working so the officials have the time on the field so he can't see it clock to telling them to speed it up but he was checking off because they had the Blitz on that believe he probably would have thrown the faith because all the VP's were up against the consumers and that means you have to rely on the clock in your head in that direction the football back at the 39 and in that position you just can't take it you have to experience but he had the world over Takeo Spikes number 55 the Outland Trophy guy that's on the list reading this play all the way and just put the ball to are very fortunate they eat that gonna call back and you're right he had four well man so we miss an opportunity try to feel going here but the clock ran out on him terrible job of clock management by the Cavaliers although that would have been an extremely long field goal so they'll just take a fivepoint deficit in the locker room that's the story in the first half let's go to Chris Fowler for the Coors Light halftime report Mike Nick you an eventful first half a Cavaliers who go to the locker room knowing they should have a substantial lead in this game but instead down 7 coming up on our Coors Light halftime report we'll look towards Saturday's big games as Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit join me plus the halftime Blitzers will be along cavaliers got the early safety

report is presented by Coors Light now welcome back to our Coors Light halftime report Chris Fowler along with Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit well with September 94 in the Rose Bowl a true freshman named Peyton Manning comes into the huddle the Vols are trilling the Bruins and Manning's eager he rallies the TV says guys I know we're down but I can take us down the field and leave this to a touchdown when Darren lineman turns over and says shut the bleep up and just call the play it was a three announced series not a great debut for Peyton Manning but a very different court of X as the Vols visit the Bruins on Saturday afternoon on a very different UCLA team which doesn't have its best defensive back in Sean Williams he turned his ankle Bruins gave up so many big plays to Washington State ten plays Lee of more than 20 yards meanwhile the Vols defense and I think this would be a great experience for the Tennessee defense because they're playing to court to people the quarterback Cade McNown and the tailback skip Hicks who are the best to tanum in a country that they're gonna play this year and that includes the backs of the Gators I think this is going to be a tremendous situation for the defense to learn how to play those Gators in a couple weeks that's the big that's what it's all about I think I think this football game this weekend earlier tonight I talked to you about what UCLA hopes to do and running the football keep in mind they're going up against a defense that is unbelievably quick have renard reinecke thompson you have Leonard little and also out Wilson at the three linebackers probably the quickest free linebackers in all of college football and last week just go a spike dykes of Texas Tech 33 carries 11 of which were negative yardage or zero yards so they can really stop the room Bruins have bound to hit Manning they had no sex against Waze news Ryan Leaf last week Florida State and USC in the Coliseum Florida State the focus has been on the guys who are not there because of suspension or injuries what about a guy who was coming back after 20 months out of football unbelievable story well Florida State on Saturday will start six new faces including a man that is familiar with the Florida State defense he's one of the best going back to that 1995 season he his knees tore his ACL back in the Orange Bowl in 96 a very emotional player a heart here you can see he's changed his jersey from 56 to one because he wants a lot of attention on himself he believes he's gonna have a big year speaking of linebackers this guy is good at the gifts and USC wants to run the ball he's gonna be everywhere linebackers a good at Florida State but the reason why they've been successful these last seven or eight years the defensive line that's where they're terrific they lost two firstround draft choices for the National Football League last year but they got a guy named Andre wodsworth who could be the best one they've ever had they think this guy's a sensational defensive lineman that's the night part of the day night doubleheader on in Los Angeles both games on ABC the weekend begins really with the bars ABC is concerned with the regional coverage at 3:30 Eastern sound you can also see that great Washington dyu game as the Cougars quest for respect begins against the deport ranked Huskies and then in fivetime Florida State and USC fat Busby has been so sharp and preseason campy takes on the Trojans which will try once again to run the game more coming up at halftime after their they come from the small cities and big farms leaving behind their egos and their innocence bringing only their speed their dreams and perhaps a small fire extinguisher for the sweat and the heat and the pain of Joe ball and they're on the Black Diamond we're witness to the greased lightning of the fine backs the brute strength of the sock tackles and the spontaneous combustion of those who foolishly ignore the giant turkey thermometers Coors Light salutes the guides of the brittle iron men who know that when you're about to burst in there's only one beer capable of cooling down that burning thirst frost brewed Coors Light when

through to tap the clean taste of the Rockies Scott Stadium in Charlottesville Virginia where a burn is leading the Cavaliers at halftime seven to two welcome back everybody Mike Patrick Mike Godfrey Jerry punch working the sidelines for a first half of big plays and missed opportunity for Mike you mentioned it's a great field position by Virginia they didn't take advantage of it I think it's really important for them to get a big kick off the turn here good field position because this drive is going to be very important the way the half ended and you want to get confidence back in your offensive team first half statistics you look at the time of possession against 17 minutes 19 seconds for Virginia and except for Damian Craig of Auburn they didn't really have a lot of office teaming frigde was hit for them in the first half and 98 of the 107 total yards came on a single Drive that started at the 2 yard line Virginia to receive three yards Pete thinks about it and downs a need but Mike you mentioned the big place in the first half it all started to fireworks in the first punt by author Dukes coming in from the left side blocks the punt Albarn was able to recover get the safety then he came back to play that good stop that drive now here was a big play gated that and now Auburn was not allowed to keep the football look for the norm signal Kent wants to throw on Ryan tailors saw it coming and made the break reading the quarterbacks eyes just as he threw the ball and Mike could knew they had to get a big kickoff return auger and stop them by kicking the ball in the endzone you start from the twenty first down you try to throw the out here's Ryan Taylor number six and you see just throws it right into the lane of the throw and then Aaron Brian Taylor in the endzone for the touchdown and momentum is all all burns Auburn last year second in the nation with 22 interceptions that's the first one in 1970 to go touchdown for junior linebacker Ryan Taylor it's fall the best time to be planting your spring lawn when you do rely on Pennington the people who make beautiful lawns their business Pennington newest lawn seed and viral blend can be easier on you and it can

system cleaner STP is most technologically advanced fuel system cleaner ever dirt has met his match STP complete fuel system cleaner how did Ryan Taylor looks so good intercepting that ball is a former strong saftey converted to linebacker so he's got the hands to make the plays the second big turnover that one results in a touchdown the first stop of Virginia touchdown as they fumbled on third and goal from the one about the 23 yard line let's check in with Jerry punch dr. oz at half time counter head coach George Walters concerned about his office said you know our office has been out of sync in the first half our efforts at running a twominute drill before the halftime were very ineffective say the least we've had a number of missed opportunities he wanted to come out early in the second half and throw the ball effectively obviously they had a 40 ominous beginning for the second half absolutely Jerry and Aaron Brooks with that lack of experience has got to learn you can't just focus on and stay there because somebody like Taylor there's a good enough athlete to read your eyes and pick it off back to the ground game with Joan and they've had an effective running game tonight not spectacular but certainly effective and Brad where makes the tech yeah I like your in Brooks is the quarterback tonight it's all an education process of what you see out there on the field he needs now again now you have to settle back you got a chance to establish the running game and pictures pick your spot where you want him to throw a football nice quarterback for the peers over numbers are pretty good if you take away the interception and Jones is worth 14 dime similar offense has done pretty well statistically but they have not been particle cheese Jones this time stacked up as he got from the 29 yard line drum ball was in on the stock man who started every game in those tackle a year ago and he's a knob standing player he played to hurt the Alabama game last year and hits frame knee and hit 15 tackles freshman allamerican at Auburn and just gives you effort on every play third down in four yards to go for Virginia and one could see the critical possession number five taras Wilkins broke all of Eric Metcalfe's rushing marks at Bishop O'Connell high school in Arlington Virginia he was not very happy about the move from tailback to make himself a wide receiver he might like it a little better right now there was no one near him in coverage for Auburn had to be a busted coverage all the way and when Aaron Brooks saw him out there he was alone and then it was a footrace and they're not going to catch Terence Wilkins the other thing that happened Mike as you could see Aaron Brooks look toward his first receiver in the Auburn defense went right after him and left Wilkins Oh and Brooks was sharp enough to hit him for the touchdown 49 our score sweet dreams from gg is that a new big king no it's a bad coach no in the bad side yes sir it is well what's the smart kid like you doing sitting on the bench played quarterback really like taking candy from a baby the new big king from Burger King flamebroiled with 75% more beef it's like a Big Mac except it's bigger and tastes better and right now you can get one for just 99 cents coach that I could play nap back fortune 500 companies know that when it comes to renting a car there's really only one place

college football players brought to you by Burger King where you can get your burgers work and by National Car Rental you've got places to go we've got the key Virginia strikes quickly with the big play Wilkins scores from 74 yards out and it's 14 and I'm John Allen Roberts to kick the mark Keith Cooper Cooper from the 11 a solid tackle from Williams at the 43 yard line 32 yard run Shannon Taylor missed him back near the 25 my third down situation it looks like Houston has Terrence Wilkins mantoman now all of a sudden he peeks a little bit if he's got him mantoman he lets him go right here now all of the sudden Aaron Brooks fine spirits roof is wide open the foot race is on scoring grab 77 yards 71 of course play in a new tailback for Arbor has speech to send Kate Pennington number ported straightline speed Bailey had a step on Joe Williams and he just flat dropped him hit him in the bad spot is he and spike because Carsten Bailey wide open on that play he had Joe Williams feet and the other thing was impressive demon Craig was under pressure good playaction fake right here but he's going to get pressure from the left side of your screen there's the fake here comes the pressure from the outside Patrick Kearney number 58 alright in the hands of Carsten Bailey and just drop Gregg avoids the sack Erica was right there no denying Carsten Bailey the junior from Sharpsburg Georgia 57yard no one feels any worse than Kirsten Bailey on the first one he wanted a chance to redeem himself but he kid what made that play was B me Prague be getting outside of the Virginia defense buying time to get to throw off and he beat Stephen Phelan who grew up in Montgomery Alabama and Alabama fans so this game means an awful lot to him Jared Holmes for the point after in the first half but not here third quarter both teams converting an Auburn regains a 12 point lead three touchdowns State Farm presents rules of the game we're talking about touchbacks in this play

Saturday noon on ESPN Roger big plays galore in the second half Auburn now with a 219 leave Ahmad Hawkins is back to receive along with will that's a weapon there's a touchdown right here's the touchdown play first diamond Craig with the playaction fake now what makes this play as he's able to get outside of Patrick Kearney now look at how a yes body he has nothing but arm here to throw the football no followthrough and watch this catch and good coverage by Stephen Phelan but look at Karsten Bailey making a tough catch with a defender hanging on him for that touchdown him he was on the play before he looked good on Owen Anthony seven is the new tailback for Virginia about the back of the year and the Cavaliers have a feeling half the answer on this drive done I agree with you Mike when I was coaching always felt like when the opponent's score he needed to take it right back and he answer the score you answer it right away Takeo Spikes number 55 in coverage stepping back now he comes up take take content too tight in case of coffee Magnusson as they need to get to the 30 per per child course he was in on the tackle along with Neil Mike who talked about it at the top of the program but they were hit Virginia was hit by a lot of heavy losses but they still have high expectations here now Auburn last year eight or and I told you that in the 1563 great for you now therefore you out no tickertape third and two works to the and he's done a great job of being in the right place at the right time and really reading the quarterback I'm so coverage what you want the outside backer to do it just drop to his area Ryan Taylor is dropping right there with his eyes on Aaron Brooks and almost had his second interception that's not a good series for Virginia now they have to kick it away with Frank Rotella marquise Cooper's back Mike you made a punt back he had a touchdown on a spring game that was nearly blocked hung up by Rotella and out of bounds near the 40 yard line they'll mark it at the 42 let's go to Jerry punch dr. Michael is a crown over 45,000 here tonight and thanks to this man standing beside me Carl Smith next year in years to come they will all have seats in the mini seats up for more to come here at Scott Stadium Carl Smith donated 25 million dollars in the University of Virginia mr. Smith what prompted that here well it's a variety of things but I felt the University the efflux broken both were hit in the right direction our football team is over the last ten years as one seven or more games every year we during that period of time and actually there are only seven other schools in the division and 1a that have ever had that good record and we've also done that with our act the graduation rate for the athletes in the school are close to 90% the same token the university is strong school academically and they are there a good lead for us to increase the strength of our athletic program uuv university has over the last four years had approximately well four years straight they've been in the nation as far as public universities are concerned and with that kind of gotta guide the athletic program we'll try to meet the same common goals and they've got a great coaching staff with a proven record they have want to stop that's okay mr. Pierluisi showing the folks the beautiful city we're going to build here but we do appreciate the effort said I know that you being a football player giving that kind of impact here's a guy getting 25min third down for Auburn complete to Bailey he's got a first down to the Virginia 42 yard line and for 25 million dollars I think you got to get a little more air time know you well he that stadium that they're gonna build is beautiful and tonight and you talk about that gift of 25 million and an equally important is the quarterback doesn't work of course he did it all at once that money is all the University of Virginia it's not like that's where we would do at $25 a year for the next million a year arrested the program Don Nehlen appreciate you I know that one out it's the eye opener for

bright good pressure by Charles Dorsey up inside and this Auburn football team you don't want to get in a long yardage situation on them because they're very dangerous with their speed this is a ballclub last year that had Alabama in pretty good shape with 26 seconds to go they had the lead and then relinquish it with a six yard touchdown pass so they had trouble protecting Leeds last season

guys everything we planned for the year depends on what happens in the second half I know we've had terrible field position twice inside our own 10 in the first half twice inside our own 20yard line but we can get this offense rolling and then Damian Craig stood up and challenged its football team showed a lot of senior leadership it said we will get the offense going and of course Terry Bowden said if we get field position we can open up and run the Auburn offense people are accustomed to seeing as indeed what they have done here early in the second half well Jerry the important thing about Auburn right now they blew leads to army last year in Georgia and Alabama and so they want to protect those leads they're up 21 to 9 right now 612 to go third quarter back in a moment it starts here

tremendous feat Johnny Simon's number 99 was in on the tackle they've got a load up front Chivers number 99 took on the block it was able to shift the block and make the tackle on Pennington 99 Johnny shockresistant this block right there he's in the makes exactly banking old mr. clock strengthen this Virginia defense is up they need to keep gaming because sometimes I killed the movies games in the pocket club thrilled at the 35 by Poindexter but he hung on hi Mike that's a great catch by Goodson he had six touchdowns receptions in 96 and a great play by empty poindexter number three is safety who may be the best athlete on this football field tonight number three seed break on it Wow I mean he's Ronnie Lott is his idol and he made him proud tonight he with two years ago Texas he played linebacker in the Texas players voted him on the all opponent team good suit comes out and they're going the ground the fees will use back in there at the fullback spot he picks up a couple straight up the middle doesn't even look like there's any cobwebs good says I'm just fine let me get back in there when they talk about the Auburn receivers they talked about how well they block downfield when you brought down field trip go over the middle and make those catches because you're a tough receiver and there's nothing more discouraging to a defensive back in the Rio like that if somebody had to got chopped up right in front of me trying to make sure the goodbye second and seven well Bailey will make you jet at the Virginia 27 yard line demon Craig's in rhythm now he just he feels it started off very slowly but now he's got a rhythm going says his goal is to be the best player at Auburn he said I know there's some great players but that's my goal good catch by Carsten Bailey in a good tackle by Dwayne Stoops the pick throw threestep drop 10 out of 16 116 right the safety spinner and Poindexter came flying up to Linus trim while we talk talked about failing in and Poindexter to cook second there at back failing there's a walk on four years ago this Poindexter number three is going to come up and fill this and make this jacket that offers him for down Jericho here a fourth and just under a yard you go the moon Victor and it will be first down Auburn inside the 25yard line you look at a quarterback sneak but you look this offensive line six five three 13 Victor Reilly DeMarcus curry 6 5 3 15 the left guard TJ Mears was 662 97 and the left tackle he no games at 6 for 300 so a pretty good line to get behind her in a quarterback sneak and then he got TJ Dunnigan in the middle 60 to 40 Terry Bowden you won his first 20 games don't believe these guys are immune to criticism he said explore hurts when people say things on a radio write things in the news expectations are so high down here poker spins out of one tackle and gets back near the line of scrimmage is the mark is down haven't had many penalties here in the second half there were some big ones in the first half before the staff there's a dead ball false start and the offensive end Emily first of the film Auburn was evicting the full field position to start this ball game and couldn't generate anything on offense they've got a cranked up now the last four possessions 205 yards two touchdowns they'll have a person 15 after the procedure public Goodson is back in the ball game there's a killer and you know that interception means a lot to Stephen Phelan because he said he grew up in Montgomery Alabama laid out in the backyard he was a Alabama fan he said I always dreamed about playing the Alabama Auburn game and I asked you miss at who won and he said always Alabama when he was playing such a big interception for him while Irene ER was good pressure on Damien think a mistake that demon French Virginia gets an opportunity with one at 46 to go third quarter yes it takes them waited as long as he but you knew they were going to try that eventually threefour times tonight but what make this play was the route the German girl Rin he set Jason brave he gave him a stutter step play up the decent breeded jump on the out round and hit the speaker out for a big game and breas 510 brawl 6 4 4 catches 83 yards tonight southern the tailback pushed back absolutely the 30 precana maybe a yard big kid six feet to 39 and Neal knocked him straight back southern not really a true tale back style runner this is what Virginia's had some problems oh well without Wilkins easy second column Shawn Jones checked in at the boat wide receivers going to the top of the screen if Albarn comes with pressure we'll be back intended for Wilkins in too far well our burn is just challenging the receivers of Virginia at the line of scrimmage let's see putting pressure on Aaron Brooks trying not to give him time this martavius Houston jumping on Terence Wilkins seventh trying to stay with him just long enough that the pressure of the front four gets to Aaron Brooks this is the sixth time the Virginia offense has been an offering territory they only have seven points to show for all those the second nothing here nice tackle by Jason play Mike I think you have to think in terms of four downs here I think you have to go for this you need to touch down and they have squandered several opportunities already and I don't think there's any question in George belches my ring with you and I think you're gonna look for Germaine role somewhere here because he's a senior he's a veteran ride receiver do you like any kind of oil family make them outside here the first down sticks it all depends on the market or they'll break my veins it means you write on this sort of thing I think Marketing short the crowd thinks that to their bully we were sort of screened by the Virginia players here's a better look at it perhaps with a lot of zip on that past June its Wilkins obviously don't like maybe his arm hit there where they spotted the ball in fairness so a big stand for Auburn they take over on downs at the 24 yard line and there's only 8 seconds to go in the third quarter another missed opportunity for the Cavaliers and Mike I've always had the theory you only get so many chances in life and in games and I think Virginia may have well you talked about it in the ball game and this drive during the game the key at any points that comes back to haunt you all the time toss the Pennington thing cover that to about the 27 maybe of the 28 yard line and that will be the final play of the third quarter number 18 on in hostile territory leading at 21 to 9 over

Jerry punch with you and George Welsh finds himself on the short end of 21:09 score with 15 minutes to go Terry and his Tigers on top by the Dozen an Auburn football after the defensive stand at the 32 Craig in the shotgun Pennington is his running back that one off his finger out of Brooksville Florida who had that break catcher over the middle Phelan makes the tackle what might what must be going through that young man's mind is Stephen Phelan it grew up in Montgomery Alabama in the middle of great college football Terry Bowden recruited him it's Sanford he walks on here Jett molar the PA announcer his high school games called George Welsh and said you know you should take him an indispensable safety and said he has had dozens of dinner offers the Cavaliers looking a little shaky right now the way again tough for the quarterback you don't have that clock line because there's so many things going through your mind is a quarterback game you just forget about at third and 11 get the football back in the best possible field no pressure on 77 yards to Carsten Bailey and how do you get that wide open on third wall in Mike how about the play to that football in the distance that ball was and watch birthday perfect just got between Anthony Poindexter and Joe Williams but look like Williams was in his own and let him go the safety never showed up in time 77 yards good pass protection by the Auburn offensive line allowed the time for Damian Craig to hit that man Phil Bailey now with two touchdowns 151 yards on four catches and the 18th ranked Tigers have now taken a twenty eight to nine lead as Damian Craig is on fire in the second half we've just explosive legs snapping jaws a massive reinforced neck flesh shredding teeth all controlled by a brain incapable of remorse the lost world you're the trex there's bellum you big king no it's a bad coach no in the bad side yes sir it is well what's a smart kid like you doing sitting on the bench played quarterback really like taking candy from a baby the new bit King from Burger King flamebroiled with 75% more beef it's like a Big Mac except it's bigger and tastes better and right now you can get one for just 99 cents coach that I can play out back ESPN presentation of college football players brought to you by frost brewed Coors Light who reminds you the three most important words are a beer man Virginia now down by three scores Carsten Bailey has had a huge game along with Damien Craig especially in the second half got to the outside the to light the chased out of bounds at the point or yard line well it's slipping away from the Cavaliers and you can see that with the lack of experience on this ballclub has hurt them although they're veteran guys are some of the guys who have made the four plays that have heard of tonight the mic convention that when you have a young football team and they lost a lot here and the coaches were concerned that when things go bad on the football field Tiki Barber is not here kami sharpers not here barriers not here so somebody has to grow into that position of stopping the flow when things go bad Jones is the deep man in the eye behind quarterback Aaron Brooks with straight back the throg guns this one but it's tipped and it looked like Quentin Reese got a hand on it here Terrence Crowder the comparison between the two well both of them have done a better job in the yards rushing would indicate because their mobility Johnny Auburn's offense has been entirely Damian Craig tonight neither teams really been able to establish a sound running game which puts pressure on the quarterback and Terry Bowden said he can't be the hole often noticed you're just part of it they haven't established the rest of it yet as you've worn it out company tonight the Cavalier offensive coaches were very concerned about trying to maintain and build on the confidence of their young quarterback Aaron Brooks you know in the first half books look pretty lively on the sidelines here in the second half the last two times they come off he has gone to the sideline phones talked to the coaches upstairs lowered his head and walked away well Mike that's what Sparky woods the offensive coordinator talked about he said I know he's worked hard so I know he's going to go into the game confident I want him to come out this is a long season this is the first game of a quarterback that really started for the first time I think he's played well on first container my aunt hang on logan's is that a good ballgame he really has and you need that when you've got a guy like crow L on the other side you need somebody to compliment yeah because you're gonna get bracketed on the other side if you're Germain throw well and you need somebody on the other side that's Antoine Nolen with a great stick on the Terrance Wilkins scrimmage five yards lead your penalty would be first down but they lose the play and it will be first and 15 on a procedure call and Auburn's kept Germaine for well in balance pretty well in this ballgame he caught the one deep ball I think you're gonna see if the season goes on there being four well as we got hot late last season again down the field for catching a little bit more deeper footballs first in 15 he approached 12 and a half minutes to go in the game a little option they had a lot of injuries have offered defensively last year and that was the negative but the positive is you get a lot of players playing and this is a football team now you look at Virginia they come back they lose all those stars are burn returns 18 to 22 starters both their kickers so you talked about an experienced football team to open up the season with this was not a good match for George Welsh in the first ballgame second and 14 we'll see about the 13 about the Roberts Carter spiking they've got ten guys back for starters and Ryan Taylor was a parttime starter at safety he moves the linebacker sir really you've got 11 guys in there who started in one position or another last season in a defense led by that man number 55 Takeo Spikes you got to have some great players on the field and you got to have a leadership and the leadership this Auburn defense starts right at number 55 Takeo Spikes and still this is a sophomore and junior dominated p53 is even brighter did a good job of avoiding the sack Quentin Maurice had him around the collar you look a linebackers quitting Reese is on pressuring Aaron Brooks he got Darren Brooks and then you look at Coquille spikes now linebackers blitz every now and then you pick up the tight in hold him a little bit so he can't get by Casey Crawford Babylon jersey you wonder why he was hoping it was a nil from across the middle and reached his body slam the quarterback and now Rotella will punt and Markieff Cooper wakes back at his 20 yard line returnable quick but the fair catch signal made outside the 15yard line twenty eight nine ten fifty three to go from Charlottesville I never lost my love of football Jenner's some quickness Jumeirah gives me the chance to pursue a dreaming feel low to the ground speedy and I'll need speed to play with guys like them

Victor Reilly in the center that screen fills it up pretty good at 65 313 he is the star on Albert's offensive line and they are here in Charlottesville Creek Trickett the offensive line coach say says he could be the best ever at Auburn get more Carrie in Auburn and think terry bowden would like to establish something on the ground right now Damien Craig's Knights talked about the open his ability to cut the football down this year and decide when to run the football here he scores the pinochle play that he showed in the opening that he did this very same thing last year good partners by failing but a nice strong throw that Carsten Bailey for the touchdown he's got a great arm and if you're gonna play Damian Craig you better keep him in those tackle boxes and not let him outside because he makes you extend the field when he rolls out 247 yards passing Auburn as a team is only rough it could be more than a little bit they're gonna need the recipe just can't throw the ball all the time as they certainly learned a year ago there's a flag down on this place it's probably going to be holding which I'm sure this driver Rodney Allison the offensive coordinator says we want to run the football because that's the way you protect Leeds sure twenty eight to nine against a pretty good football team here you want to run the clock holding offense finnaly be from the spot of the foul after the canal it's Rodney Allison the offensive coordinator when I was an assistant coach back in 1977 at Arizona Tony Mason was the head coach a great coach bribed the Allison team in Texas Tech to beat us and I asked him I said you ruined the Saturday night remember it very well they only remember the wind the long and slowly second and seven big and they'll blow this play dead good

Turk cloth or permit his second touchdown of the night 29th reason of a 13th ranked team in 1mm I still think they have the best nickname in football the purple palliative that's pretty tough to be

the official car rental company of ESPN time has become a factor for the Cavalier 6:28 left they are driving facing a third and three deep in Auburn territory Auburn's jokes here they come Jones he had tucked that one outside it looked like he had some Running Room they need to reach about the nine yard line for a first down he stopped with the ten by ten out here I hate to waste those timeouts but you've got to get this plot it's big here right here this first down then you got an inexperienced quarterback and then experienced offense you want to make sure this call Virginia going into the last play by cast 326 yards in total offense great field position all night one touchdown the difference you know college football is here when you get a slight like just Saturday at 3:30 Eastern a quintet of regional games starting off with Peyton Manning in the bottom gears heading out to the Rose Bowl to take it on UCLA Washington against Brigham Young also with national implications and then in primetime the Florida State Seminoles and Thad Busby bring their aerial attack against the USC number five against number 20 Florida State seven and Oh during his decade opers USC has not been as fortunate only score five and one in the last ten years Bobby Bowden has to play the pac10 team in a long time Mike you got this controversy with pic getting ready to play Penn State if it won't send in the film's last week's game what do you think about that I wouldn't assume either they didn't play so you play who fourth of the yard fifteen 20 yard line decent grade of course fivefootten it gets to be another michael rubin type thing in the end zone where you get the leaper number seventeen to me grow six foot five against five ten uses his body for the touchdown George well said he had to catch five or six game passes a game for them to be successful for tonight five 493 and a touchdown and my could see what's going through Auburn's mind right now again that last year when they give those blew those leaves they'll go for two three wide receiver set into the end zone how does he get that right over that's the one guy you've got it come over the middle and me to catching this a good confidence builder but I still say they're still in this football game Jermaine Crowell in the middle number 17 just somebody the linebackers just leaving sit back there and some cover another busted coverage this is great for Aaron Brooks long side kicks we get back in this thing it's an 11point lead with six 13 to go the reason they went 42 is if they can get another Eugene instant fireworks here for the Ducks on the opening kickoff of the season has to do it all seniors Stalin Matala weaving through the Wildcats looked out at the kicker right there he's not going to catch him sevenzip Oregon jumps on top what a way to start a season back to Charlottesville 1997 quack attack is underway worth well feeling a little bit better about his ballclub matter than 2817 the gopher onside kick here with 613 to go I think you do because way offer and has moved the ball they've stopped themselves with penalties here in the second half Auburn is anticipating if they have up here the 45 yard line that Virginia will take it be Robinson all the way back to the four backside and I said of bouncing 220 when you kick it deep in that formation it's impossible to get a wedge back there for blocking know what you do Mike is you line up your anticipate you onside kick so once the ball goes over the first group of linemen and so forth then it becomes a wedge all the way everybody retreats back guys to picked up foot they can pick up you get what you can get with a wedge up inside now here's where the pressure comes to mount on Jerry Biden in Auburn again they run the football run the clock and keep the ball away from Virginia and the last thing you say when you break Cooper and B Cooper found a seam and got up to the 25yard line brought down by Byron to week number 32 you make a good point line because you do talk about hold one in football double clutch it whatever because on defense now they're taught to go for the football good tackle football trying to pull it out with 541 on the clock you know some backed hate to hear that don't remind me oh yeah hold on to the ball Oh put them negative in there gonna clamp the see play action by play interesting call there at the second and five trying to bake out the Virginia defense a little bit but Travis Griffith number 95 is going to play D me and Craig rice in the Sun football play he'd get outside of in good pressure inside that Johnny Chivers in the sacrament Burton long that was strange he'll planet and 422 so they'll force a punt the clock continues to run by the time they kick it away we'll be under that's the problem with kicking it deep because you're going to lose two three minutes but they're still going to get the ball back right here again they need a big return big returner a block they came after him last time and remember they blocked the first run of the night ten men at the line is firming putting on to Jones signals to the fifth guess back at the 30 cool so the Cavaliers filled down to scores and they have 350 to get them following the game where giant Inc in Maine US Open tennis tournament and the 49ers named their starting quarterback Steve Young having the problems with those confessions we talked to him last year very concerned about it not only as a football player but as a family man and kirby 41 finally brought me back in the pastor Jerry punch talked about the first half they didn't do a real good job it's two minute off and show us see if they do a better job here with the two minute off that's called Goodell the offensive line coach is signaling to go to the twominute offense we got 328 left you're going to clock at two timeouts don't one score away again so make it back in the same get a steady dose of pro all right now no matter whose color they go to the other for the sublime it'll stop the clock in the first down with 3:13 to go it's a gain of 14 very good route he's another former walkon came out we had a full six that BOCES got there I he averaged 17 point seven pitches yards for Kip Salzburg it's sort of the first dance of the clock continues to run let him make the fetchers keep that clock find that situation at Campbell era still have to let's taste out of the pocket incomplete for crow well Takeo Spikes applying the pressure and a good job by Brooks just a fact out of the tackle pull to get unloaded yeah Mike can you look for big plays out of your star players and Shaquille spikes and read the eyes of Brooks now he sees he's moving out of the pocket now he jumps on the space hips his hand and she's trying to go to Jimmy for allegan 227 to go Virginia down by only 11 third and a yard we've gotta get the first down will they go to the run they go to the quarterback keeper they have the first down the club they're spending a lot of time we're at the line is furniture there waiting for the signal from the sideline they're set before me they're not moving around formation wise they're just taking a long time to make the count you're right now you spend a little bit longer and their coaches would like underneath Jones and that won't give them anything Neil and Houston will right there on a fence and now Virginia is going to use a timeout and unfortunately for the Cavaliers those are the timeouts they're going to need to stop the clock Givaudan gets the ball back if or when yeah if you score right here they've got a good shot at score and then you go again for two points then you've got the other side for you yeah that's what we have to go for the outside but this game else being called because that can an inexperienced quarterback bring him along this has got to give Brooke some confidence because he is making a move here in the fourth quarter and running this offense very very well and there's the timeout situation again only one for each Club of course Auburn probably the last thing they're going to do is call the time Gaming fragments at the big second half like almost figures they got to try to grow the Internet's go well everything they had good play with him just a little bit ago and the numbers are mounting with Brooks 23 out of 37 there you see at 280 yards two touchdowns the one interception he had another interception taken away oh six to go they have reached the operand 31 yard line well well comes to the near side all under the let's see if they tell about any topic and this may be another delay pound began with that flight clock off game offense fiveyard penalty that's a quick 25 seconds there was and Jordan also have to live it did seem to be a quick count in there and the time they came on football field second and 12 good on Noland number 13 he's reading take off right off the bat he's not faked out at all by this route stays right with him almost with me Dameon Craig turns cheerleader with the defense on the field he's world third and 12 Brookes grows short give me inside the 30 ins got out of bounds good job by Kirby he get out of bounds to stop the clock inside the 30 spikes and kasher couldn't stop it Charles Kirby in four years Mike is at 22 carries bought four passes in 32 games and then experienced fullback also but who makes the play on Charles Kirby all over the field the Butkus candidate he'll spikes whoa to again evening the education of a quarterback make that mistake again next week and that was probably the last gasp for the Cavaliers with only 147 to go and one time out to you is Auburn with the opportunity to run out the clock and a sellout crowd has come to its feet and starting to file out of Scott Stadium here in Charlottesville Ric lamps the defensive coordinator talking to George Welsh I think they have to be pleased that obviously felt like they could win this football game but with all the replacements they've made it's gonna be a formidable team to play George ruff said yesterday you know these intersectional games with ranked opponents are really good ways to start the season if you win yeah you got it down then Thursday night game to report it you win down there it's a new ceiling for the next game because you get the extra couple days but you lose it it's tough because you got a long time to sit with this four feet toward 12 talked about that I asked mister how long you're gonna coach he said I want to see that big crowd of 60,000 s'alright as long as they take that stadium to be built he's here courtesy of mr. Smith's gift that will enlarge this place you know Disney coach George Ross said he's not been afraid to open the season against ranked opponents you look at his record over the years said you know you don't learn much it gets playing some of molester the vision of someone that's weak you do learn by playing teams like Michigan Florida State Notre Dame Georgia and Clemson yeah look at all for those five those games they lost them all but what that graphic doesn't tell you was at each one of those years they came back and won eight football games and went to a postseason Bose that we opened up against good opponents and we come back strong during the season Jerry there aren't many people in this business was much respected George wealth he has done for dignity and honor the University of Virginia to places where they said you can't win and he did at both and with two more conference wins he will have one more or three more conference wind will have one more ACC games than any coach that ever coached dear he has also gone over a hundred wins nobody who coaches in the ACC has done that while coaching at an ACC school George Welch has done himself proud here and what a recruiting to for him today that's a big night for him he may have lost a football game but they lost the battle today but he may have won the war get the Ronald Murray to a committee 35 Virginia has stopped the clock the last time it did George yesterday when he talked to you said what did you get his shaman who said I read 10 books and they weren't play books either now probably weren't paper bag clock running 39 seconds to go we can't tell you what the play clock is head it's been out all night being kept on the field but they'll probably let it run all the way down then take the penalty and punt the football and Terry Bowden you have to be happy for him getting off to this start may have been his own worst enemy when he won 20 games but you've got to remember the effects of the probation have hurt this team the last two years he lost scholarships and that's very difficult to overcome he's got a lot of pressure on him back push last fall of the year when you play Alabama sure is a big ball game that you've got to win and now he's signals for timeout so they don't lose the five yards but only 15 seconds to go involved don't contend for the Westone LSU very very sound under Mike and will glad to see them next week begins Vanderbilt Mike I think so I really do we had Vanderbilt Notre Dame last year in Vanderbilt played the Irish off their feet maybe Duncan the outstanding linebacker at Vanderbilt leads that defense a lot like he'll spike we saw here tonight Holmes will punt with 15 seconds to go in the game Jones will drop deep and again Virginia the 10 men on the line of scrimmage got it out of there did his job 26 can only get back to the 30 with 70 seconds to go so a bird will win its opener go wanna know and with the unrealistic expectations at most places in the country including opera fans of every team expect to go 11 every year anyone fair the athletic director I think is outstanding and I thought you do that I think he's behind Terry bow totally and I think giving him every opportunity at that school and I think they've got a very very good football team seven seconds to go 47 yard line and that will do it our final score Auburn 28 Virginia's 17 for my Guthrie and dr.

tackle football to run through all the NFL substitutions car racing to contact sport to the up or down on Dale Earnhardt but first the yang six and a half down out he in the showdown in the boogie down now we finally arrived on the big four game set with the Yankees and Orioles with nothing big to talk about unless you consider Baltimore's big six and a half game lead over New York or the Yankees big six game lead for the wild card slot one that allows them to avoid Seattle in the playoffs and thus bequeathed the possible pleasure of seeing Randy Johnson twice and five games to the Orioles and of course unless you consider Yankee starter David Wells he got the start on the same mound that he earned Baltimore's only win of last year's American League Championship Series and speaking of that of the poem they're gonna chain that off just in case any 12 year old some old Kappa New Jersey won and if you Derek Jeter can't get her anima barela's Bay fit the center and the top of the third I knew the Desmond makes it to enorus it's tied at two in the Yankees hitting lows show it's really code we had again Tino Martinez grounds to first afford a referee the national championship in 1988 the Irish would try to become the school's first repeat champions since the 194647 squads standing in their way with the trojans led by quarterback Todd Marinovich with more on the Notre Dame USC matchup here's bill Patrick with his vintage Sports Center report from 1989 the USC defense is number one in the nation against the rush allowing only 37 yards a game but the Irish have a powerful running attack that gains over 256 yards again the Trojans who appear headed to the Rose Bowl for the third straight year need to elevate their game if they expect to beat the Fighting Irish it's a great opportunity to play a great football team Notre Dame the number one team in the nation the defending national champion and a football team that I quite frankly think is the best I've seen in over 20 years of college coaching rocket Ismail will be on usc's mind last year he burned the Trojans with a 55 yard reception and this year he's returned to kickoffs and a punt for touchdowns SC starts redshirt freshman Todd Marinovich at quarterback he's thrown for 9 touchdowns while being intercepted only three times Tony rice his opposite number is an experienced signal caller who's equally dangerous as a passer or runner last year his 65 yard first quarter touchdown run against the Trojans set the tone for that game the topranked Irish are favored at home over number 9 USC but in a rivalry as intense as this one emotion will play a big part prior to 1989 Notre Dame had a sixgame winning streak against USC later in the show we'll profile Notre Dame receiver Raheem the rocket Ismail but right now we present the 1989 college football showdown Notre Dame and USC on ESPN Classic those of you just joining us 9th ranked USC and number one Notre Dame Jim Nance along with Pat Haden and John decree we are two minutes in 13 seconds into this contest and USC has just scored Notre Dame received the opening kickoff and rocket rocket Ismail fumble the opening kickoff ball was jarred loose at the 40 top irrelevance the quarterback for the Trojans then marched his team eight plays 40 yards and a touchdown pass moments ago to larry wallace alabama won that game 47 30 over Tennessee and Jim here is the touchdown that burnovich through to Wallace two plays earlier they had thrown this same pattern the Blitz inside picked up well the post pattern he was open on both plays and earlier he hoped led him to much that ball was well thrown in I think you have to be a tall quarterback to be able to throw this pass it's a short post pattern he is 6 for he gets the ball all the over of the tall hands watch the protection here number 75 Tucker is right there the ball is well thrown he led the receiver and then the emotion of the freshman quarterback burnovich he's a big kid 6 foot 4 and you've said all week he was born to play in this game well in 1862 his father played against the Fighting Irish feeds him 25 another his OCO Craig burning in 1964 was a quarterback who led a led them to whittle the number one ranked fighting ours here's the kick is bogies Paige was the last band he bumped them out after a 57yard return he doesn't waste any time every good kick returner just takes off and doesn't dance around in the hole picks up a couple of blocks bellows number eight evil a nice black Tyler's number 13 game along the outrun the kicker and then a lonely number they eat Pete's face were made to stop watch the hole on the right side this blocker on their kickoff return team so the first play from scrimmage for number one Notre Dame water and johnson in the backfield rice keeps it rice fits to the 31yard line a gain of eight let's beat though today Tony rice the senior quarterback going in the backfield by Anthony Johnson who has scored ten touchdowns this year and Ricky Watters by our the rice last year broke 165 yards the first score of the game against Southern Cal for a touchdown second and short Anthony Johnson Delmar made the tackle up front for Southern Cal Danno Tim Ryan Brandi horn are on that line linebackers Scott Ross Delmar Chesley Michael Williams and junior say out great with the other linebackers first and ten for Lou Holtz at Notre Dame run in the option vise keeps again gain of eight Holmes likes to do early in every ballgame is just feel out and offense first he lines up and sees how he's going to get deep in some point the game then he sees how you're gonna defend the option and then formations and then some wishbone if you can to defend any those he'll keep coming back to Notre Dame's offensive line Mike helped his the center a pair of Tim's at guard Tim Ryan tip front heart and the tackles Mike Brennan Dean Brown Derek Brown is the tight end sophomore from Florida Tim Ryan on the offensive line for Notre Dame at a Tim Ryan at defensive tackle for USC second we'll call it three Johnson as he does so often bulldozes his way for the first down it's the opening kick Pat USC kicks in this farm and they kicked it very high he caught the ball about the 25 yard line he was hit there and Larry Smith the head coach and challenges return teams against this mile and Sandy we're going to defend against him but here is the touchdown the post patterns in over 82 Larry wants good protection the tall quarterback and 6/4 to get the ball over the outstretched arms of the Irish defense Tullio had made the fumble recovery at 7 of the USC Notre Dame threatening first and 10 is smile running from the tailback spot gets to the 11 USC always traditionally rain in the backfield that's defensive backfield and they today bring out to Wayne Garner earnest Spears and a pair of safeties Cleveland Coulter and Mark carrier it's going to be really like a oneonone game between mark carrier and the quarterback Tony rice he has a responsibility option plays to go to the quarterback to the pitch pants okay versus rice Sony's spent at the bottom of your screen is filed on a swap left waters back at tailback second and seven for Notre Dame option left rice peach pitches late he gets to the six yard line go to the seventh last second pitch by Tony rice there's a lot of different ways that Tony rice can beat you sometimes say some people say he doesn't throw the ball with great accuracy but his plays like this what really should have been a negative play a four yard loss he breaks right through the tackle and then makes a late pitch to Ricky Watters it was only a hustling play there by Chesley number 53 that prevented a touchdown but that's a great play there by Tony rice and pitch went right past the extended arm of Michael Williams it's third down for the Irish inside of the 10 rice Cohasset it took just a little more than three minutes to counter USC's touchdown hendrik can tie it with the extra point seven seven minutes in ten seconds left in the first quarter Jim football team is a team overcome some adversity USC school they came right back in their first possession good penetration there Tony rice again took the ball away from the fullback and then it was just determined and fought his way into the end zone and then the emotion of head coach Lou Holtz he knows how important this game is this ESPN Classic program is presented by Discover card with a slightly smarter consumer every time you use your Discover card Discover will make a donation to America's

Discover card calm we saw the emotions that erupted prior to this game and now we've really just started and it's already 7/7 UFC notre dame let's take another look at the Tony rice touchdown the eyes of Tony rice this time he saw the pressure there by the outside linebacker sale number 55 he took the ball right out of the fullbacks stomach and then the power the strength and the determination that's what makes Tony rice at 118 games in a row hey he and his team is the first rushing touchdown this year allowed by UFC as Hendrix kick goes out of bounds Todd Marinovich we spoke with him yesterday he wanted to come out here and have success quickly to try to quiet this capacity crowd quieting that crowd as soon as I can that's the most fun thing about playing away is everyone's all fired up at kickoff and going in and marching right down the field and scoring it you can hear a pin drop that's why I want to hear after we hit the ball Ellie was three for six on that opening possession including the touchdown pass it's really amazing as a as a freshman you talk to the Southern Cal coaches this week here is a guy started his first Southern Cal Notre Dame game and yet there they are counting actually counting on him winning this game for them all pass for young men ever since the victory in the fourth game of the season against Washington State he has played with extreme confidence has not thrown an interception his last 93 passes units of the Cal coach did a nice job Jim of bringing him along slowly in their first game against Illinois they didn't ask much of it but as each week has gone on they've asked for and more of her innovation as he's thrown the ball downfield backtoback huge win by the Texas Longhorns coach David McWilliams he was getting some heat down at Austin and that certainly will cool things off after a victory last week against Oklahoma and now today handing Arkansas its first loss of the year Texas football back here's the return back up tail back returning it to the 37 yard line let's get another report from John decree and this about the fight prior to the game John Jim let me tell you exactly what happened Notre Dame lined up after the warmups along the goal line here the USC was running off the field and they challenged USC to go around them of course players in the frame of mind before the game wouldn't do that it became a challenge us he couldn't get directly to the tunnel pushing and shoving broke out and then some players went down they were kicked there were blows throwing actually Lou Holtz was hit and went to the ground too a lot more in a minute Jim first 210 Marinovich rolling and rolling i'm jackson off his fingertips todd light number one almost raced it back todd light number one has had a sensational year thus far with the five interception he's got great confidence as he plays the wide side of the field number one todd light plays always placed to the field he's great and reading pattern you see his where his hit is his eyes are looking right inside at the cornerback he reached the pattern and stress up to make the play second down at ten holt the lone setback Marinovich going long and over the head of John Jackson that Terrell was in the secondary autumn USC is two and four against Notre Dame when the Irish had been ranked number one 25 years ago Pat you spoke about it earlier Craig verdict in the final two minutes threw a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman his USC came back from 17 to nothing to win over number one Notre Dame that's 25 years ago third and 10 Kowski racism out of there in direction in be sure to the first they bill him as a slashy gutsy type runner and he made some great moves to get near the first now when you run a screen pass you want to drop back but I think burnovich really gave this screen away by dropping back a little bit too far he's flailing back and all of a sudden I think the defense felt the screen a little bit or earlier than they ordinarily would but Ricky Irvin did a great job of making a lot of guys miss they spotted at the 45 it's 4th and 2 Bart Preston will punt for us see they used to punters will smile is back deep it's a shortcut what of the air USC's Junior Seau there is a flag down near midfield the recovery near the 15 and he went down and Jim I edited there is a lot of wind out there and that is what having the ball is swirling around I was talking to kickers and punters Seavers before the game the holding call against Notre Dame it'll be USC football at the 15yard line now is mo returned to punt for a touchdown last week but that was just misjudged it was misjudged because the ball was swirling and hidden his shoulder pads and then Junior Seau was there to make the play again Larry Smith all week long has stressed coverage on kickoffs and hunters against rocket Ismail that's two turnovers by the Rockets here in the first quarter the first one had really nothing to do with the wind this one where the judgment error with the way I remember that the game a year ago really the difference was the Ford turnovers by Southern Cal and thus far Notre Dame has two in the first period Wellman to the right Jackson to the left first and 10 USC Marinovich looking Jackson's way now we'll throw short really just dumping it off getting rid of it Jackson was in the area bob dole putting pressure on the renovation Marinovich plays with a nonchalance of a much older player he is only a freshman you're not going to see him take many sacks and he does not throw interceptions that's really ordinarily the sign of a much older player we're talking about that big win against Washington State he came back in the Gipper Ronald Reagan made a phone call to him and said that was one of the most exciting comebacks I've ever seen 18:17 victory Marinovich throwing for a twopoint conversion in the final seconds there he goes to Jackson Jackson slashes in could a touchdown for USC second touchdown pass of the quarter for tapa renovage this one covering 15 yards we're midway through the opening quarter and it's already 13 to 7 three touchdowns Rodrigues will attempt the extra point for the Trojans
