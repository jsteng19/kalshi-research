here is Chris Fowler all right Brett thank you great to be with you here youthful exuberance for Texas so many new faces two firstyear coordinators getting their first taste of this rivalry and Oklahoma comes in with the swagger and the confidence of a season preseason number one Lee what's a key to this game well I think the key to this game is Texas ability of pressure Atlanta Jones rememory is from 22 pass incentive a 16 career games Norman and this game is in Dallas another thing very important last six games 15 to 1 the turnover battle guys that's important coach I think as Oklahoma's defense you can't take Texas these young guns those quarterbacks Kate look case McCoy and David ash lightly you know Bryan Carson's going to try it down left some trick plays because let's face it the Oklahoma Sooners are pros Tony Jefferson most dynamic linebacker he's gonna have to play big the first Travis Lewis travels Louis bringing that pregame intensity as the Sooners take the field Texas appears but call more of the two teams but is that the naivete of you the you mentioned turnovers black and penalties rushing yards time of possession those have also been keys to victory in recent years what's your pick yes I got the Sooners I got this one is pulling away left it's gonna be close early but the Sooners late good game pretty big I got old home I wish I had my gun the winner if history holds the higher ranked team the favorite team has won every time but once since 1996 Texas has already paid back two teams this year in a milestone win over Landry Jones and the Sooners stay on force in the BCS Championship game pellet football presented by Buffalo Wild Wings will continue after this message at work from our ABC stations Oh utexas another crowd an excess of 90,000 on hand and now far rivalry history and that is brought to you today by Sprint been players since 1929 but Wilkinson Darrell royal just through the great names who have participated in this one of these two teams has won the big 12 title each season since 2004 and you know it seems like they've been here forever Norman Oklahoma Austin Texas you could see the drive 194 miles down Norman 190 miles from Austin evenly split as we take a look at Mack Brown 14th years coming as the head coach Bob Stoops been a head coach at OU u for 13 years let's go to Erin Andrews with the Oklahoma coach how do you do it being assignment sound tackling well playing physical this is your thirteenth year a part of this rivalry in all those years one key in a game like this running being physical and taking care of the football turnovers thanks for your time right Thank You Aaron Oklahoma the visitors so they'll wear the white here today and they'll be on the far side Texas in their burn orange jerseys will be on the pressbox side I'm Brent Musburger with Kirk Herbstreit and Kirk you made a very quick into they must have been holding the elevator fail I thought hey we're a very well planned out yeah this this is great the energy down the field which game day you could just feel these two teams so different you know you have Oklahoma the veteran team and Texas all this newfound youthful and they just they're ready to go it's gonna be interesting to see how this one I'm told early yeah I think that is the key for Texas it is early because as you and I have talked during the week and experienced a lot of it expect now it was interesting folks that Mack Brown broke his format for this game this is the first time since Mack became head coach that he's brought a team in here for a walkthrough and yesterday they did an entire walkthrough in shorts he said I just want to get in the customs in the scene was yesterday that walkthrough that you're talking about now other players on this roster it's the first time they've witnessed in Nexxus won the toss they will defer so we will see the Landry Jones and the oh you offense off the top of this game Trey Franks who is back after a twogame suspension for violating team rules is the deep man here for the Sooners Justin kick it away five yard lines Frank's picks his way and here now it comes Annmarie Jones on the season ten touchdowns five interceptions but hurry everybody is making a thing out of the fact that he throws more interceptions on the road than in Norman there's no doubt about that I think that's one of his personal goals is to be able to show in this kind of environment away from Norman he's going to be able to have a good day the key for Texas his defense they've got a lot of youth on that side of the ball too it's pressuring you don't have to sack him just pressure and get him out of the pocket make him have to reset his feet that's what Texas has to do with long with stopping the running game of comedy wailing and wailing will while Houma the walk lon Jones is going to throw one out one sitting down at the 40yard line in a footrace and here's the matchup those two great wide receivers against the Texas corners that you conceal at Oklahoma has it mind all day they're attacking Diggs he's a soft corner see how he is retreating that's an easy throw in a great way broke a woman to get Landry Jones in the rhythm you got a veteran like Ryan Boyles and a true freshman like Cloncurry Diggs to match up they'll take they went quickly the way late on the first carry of the game and Alex Okafor makes the stop right near the actually that's going to be a loss of about 3 yards and so it will be second down and long this hurry up tempo that Stoops and oh you to lose it use here this afternoon against the Hornets back in the pistol now motions is back out gonna flare to it here comes Whaley got the flat angler rustles outofbounds at the 24 yard line our chickfila impact players for oh you hear her and we will try to get this in before they snap the ball andrew jones obviously lab boys you already saw both of them deep gave i curt now is its center for the injured Ben Hagen and Travis Lewis the leader where number 12 days for Austin box on 3rd and 3 Jones fires for a first down Miller's out of the backfield to the 10 yard line there he is using his fullback H back for the first time today a first down at the 10 one thing to prep with a young defense this tempo it's another thing to see it in person and right back in Whaley the horns were ready that time a six yard loss on that play so they jumped to it with that hurry up tempo coach Diaz had the horns ready Jackson Jeff goes one of those highly highly recruited defensive players for the horns makes an impact here early and Manny Diaz does a lot of slanting and angling with his defensive line that's going to put you in position to make a lot of plays against the run it can also take you away that time it worked out stills is one on one to the left great pair of hands the other white out Whaley flashes Jones looks at stills that he's inside the 10 for the 9 yard line it'll be third down coming up red zone execution it's so big in this game rent for both sides Manny Diaz on the defensive side Lahoma Josh shines well they both told us how important it is to be able to commute in town in this area you've got his four touchdowns they put coils in the slot to the right he'll try to get a safety on him third down now and goal for Oklahoma oh you burns an early timeout as they come up with third and goal a big play in the first quarter so we'll take a break and come back and see what the Sooners have got it with their third and goal we are back with third and eighth and the first thing we notice that Ryan Broyles has gone out to split in he was flanker before the timeout so they make a switch and they make jazz Reynolds on the inside of that formation of the light Landry Jones looking still stills one on one and incomplete out of bounds field goal time coming up here for oh you really good coverage there by the sophomore Carrington by them locked up with Kenny Stills the guy they like to try to hit the fade to down the red zone locks him up really good gives him nowhere to go and gets them to the sideline Landry Jones throws it away in the Texas defense after giving up the big play to Broyles gets the stop once again in the red zone they've been terrific in that area this year now Jimmy Stephens continues to be out with that quad injury RB we had him kicking him down in Tallahassee so this would be Michael Honeycutt redshirt freshman from Richardson Texas this is a 26 yarder for Chanukah curls it right through beautifully Oklahoma strikes first but the Texas defense held in the red zone that is big according to urban ABC witness beat sports AT&amp;T get invested with 4G we think possible and the 2012 Chevy Silverado HD aerial coverage of the State Fair of Texas provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven Oklahoma is set to kick it away here Fozzy Whittaker is back deep along with Andre Diggs the function and it will be the freshman here comes Dave tricked up and shorter the 20 yard line now the rotating quarterbacks here comes case McCoy the younger brother of Colt there is David Ashe he has a play in this sequence but coach Carson said it will depend now on what we do but he will bring him in on every three down situation he rotates him throughout the game Texas will show a lot of looks trying to confuse the Oklahoma defense but they've got to be able to run the football to take the pressure off these quarterbacks and that is young Malcolm Brown the freshman behind Cody Johnson he'll get the first carry and here is that running back very hard a recruit it picks up to three yards as we take a look at today's impact players brought to you by chickfila well chase McCoy you talked about along with David Ash obviously they're playing they're poised big here Malcolm Brown the true freshman has to step up another true freshman younger brother of Jordan Shipley Jackson Shipley probably their goto guy out on the perimeter and then Blake getting a veteran one of the few veterans on this Texas teams to have to step up and provide leadership for the horns defense McCoy stays in for second down back to the backfield and he'll come again into the middle it's going to be hard going against this defensive front of the Sooners Alexander Walker's McFarland ever Nell Lewis they are a load for any offensive line and they're wearing number 12 the memory of Austin box is their great linebacker Travis Lewis something to keep in mind for Texas it might not look real flashy right now but their point is to stay on schedule stay on schedule look looks at the bottom right hand corner third and four they don't want a lot of third and seventh and third and eight 3433 gives them more options with their play going Fozzy Whittaker has checked in as the back he's off to McCoy is right we'll see him in the throughout the game and there's the penalty flag as Jackson Shipley went down and it appeared like it was a little bit early well let's let the officials sort it out good crew here today Scott Novak's our referee and Michael Cooper's are on fire and I think Tony Jefferson have it after having three interceptions a week ago against Ball State was a little bit anxious here and he jumped the route he just came down and made contact a little bit too early with Shipley so Texas on their first third down catches a break with the pass interference by Jefferson now david ash has checked in for the first time at quarterback he goes into that pistol formation this is Whitaker pretty clearing up field Whitaker down the sideline for another Texas first down all the way to the 44 yard line that's 18 yards swimming the corners in position the number one thing Bob Stoops said we cannot elect Texas run on the perimeter fleming watch this a great angle he's right there you cannot allow Fozzy Whittaker to get to the outside of your core technique that time and good quickness by a healthy Fozzy Whittaker we've been watching Fozzy played for four years now it's the first time he's healthy and his experience is heated any 6year senior for the Houston area tripped up his ash Frank Alexander rolled in defensively and like I said Alabama and LSU have great defensive fronts Oklahoma will take a backseat to nobody this year it's obviously a miscommunication upfront the one guy you always want to account for on Oklahoma's defensive line is Frank Alexander the coach is telling us this week he just seems to be playing at a different level as a senior he's practicing better showing a lot of maturity and much more awareness you saw it right there McCoy returns goes empty in the backfield Shipley's off to his left down at the 34 big KC Walker brought pressure come over here from the outside and they're just trying to create some confusion they overloaded up front and I'm surprised any time Texas is going to throw the football that's what's going to happen the ball came out and Oklahoma pounced on top of that football so on our first turnover the Sooners are in business at the 33 yard line and Walker being congratulated like many of the Sooners out of the state of Texas he's from Garland Dominic Whaley back in as the running back Sooners lead it by a field goal playaction going down beautiful move by Okafor okhla for and Jeffcoat are giving the oh you tackles big problems here in the early going and this time went they just went right over the tide an austin hate would bring it as much pressure as they can and that again is a bit king medal a flag and talk about attentional grounding and whether or not he was outside the outside of the TOC tackle box area maybe second hell also looked like he did a good job of getting away from Okafor and getting to the outside of that boxed area but Whaley was there anyway so they pick it up so it will leave oh you with a suck it down and ten and after the incompletion Jones plays stills stills breaks free the 25yard line just short of a first down you're a Texas fan watching this got to be proud of what these guys are playing up front to bringing a lot of pressure big key is you've got a tentacle the receivers Kenny Stills and Ryan Broyles once they make the catch he's got to wrap him up you cannot allow many yards after the catch need two yards on this third down the left for Jones but it's low cooing for the first down so Jones showing his experience when he moved waylay over to the left side through to him in that flat for the first out he recognized that he control underneath that horn defense they flooded his own with three receivers and only ten two defenders in the area and Landry Jones does a good job of looking into that defenses coverage in finding the open man for the first down just across the 15 yard line for Jones and the Sooners quick throw to stills try to break the tackle down at the 8 yard line that was find a moon Carrington bind him the corner and he's got his hands full with number 4 any secondary that plays oh you would be matched against perhaps the tooth finest receivers on one team in the country Broyles and stills Texas 7 to the nation a red zone defense they were successful their first time down in this area and see of Oklahoma's bettered executing on their end now they bring Broyles into that slot on the right and Whaley will get the call breaks one tackle to the five yard line Tina Roberts from the cedar from Plano there defensively for the horns is very impressed right now with Texas in the trenches I know that they've not had great field position I know it's going to be an uphill battle today young offense but just watching this defense they're holding their own which is very very important as this game goes on I remember it was the fumble that gave the Sooners this opportunity by a field goal skills will motion to the right on the run fires incomplete and that's because he was under pressure and that was Keystone Wendell big number 91 out of the Beaumont Texas area rolling in on him great job again by the Longhorn defense and Brent you're right Randall just beat up Gabe iCard the guard who's now playing center because van Heyburn is out it's the first time in this game we've seen that Kirk the Oklahoma offense where he just got manhandled up front by Randall to force the quarterback out of the pocket and that's the key to stopping Landry Jones get him outside of the pocket Honeycutt this time a 24 yarder big kitchen perfect on the day and he is put o you up by two field goals but the Texas defense has stood tall in that red zone twice well a great view of the Texas State Fair courtesy of the cheezit real fan can listen fans have been having a great time here and big connects looking down on this crowd that's one of her B's favorite characters from Freud a big tags six don't they now strength the two field goals hurry and Texas has to feel pretty good if they can get the offense going considering the way their defense started the game into position they were in to be able to hold down the the Oklahoma offense the red zone forces is huge it's gonna be the freshman again one great digs the corner this time out to the 25 yard line and well tonight big schedule on hand here on the family of networks look what we've got we've got offer in Arkansas ESPN on the espn2 georgia tennessee ESPN news got alabama vanderbilt and ohio state nebraska will be right here on ABC get the clicker ready tonight folks or head on down to your favorite neighborhood of it all follow them up there united to actually participate in the clicker tonight tonight to do that great malcolm clown now we've talked about him Herbie he's that talented freshman Ronnie Becker is still trying to get him going they're gonna throw on first down and McCoy does to Shipley and Shipley is out of bounds at the 32 I like that the first series they're just trying to get these young guys settled in and they ran the football fairly predictable but Brian Larson has an offensive coordinator again coming over from Boise State he will mix up the looks that's the thing to watch today watched it the amount of formations the personnel groupings all to confuse the Oklahoma defense one thing Oh second down and two is Malcolm now he'll try to get that edge and not this time Whitaker got it earlier but Aaron called and the safety said you're not gonna make a living trying to get to the left Brent Venables the defensive coordinator from Oklahoma Bob Stoops they have talked all week to their team about not allowing Malcolm Brown or DJ Monroe to get to the corner Fozzy wintered Whitaker did it earlier this time Laurie Nelson kind of sets the edge finish defense and arrested that Oklahoma defense swarms to the football good job by the Sooners Gandhi's third down and two Cody Johnson and it's a wildcat there's the reverse there's Harsens razzledazzle first down Texas to the 35 yard line so once they set the Wildcat you can bet on I'm handing off and even throwing off that formation this time they come around for the first down Brent how about this razzledazzle third and two handoff handed off to Monroe first down for two and a half we'll take that off the razzledazzle 32 first 35 yard line down McCoy you can recognize him as the quarterback with that long white sleeve on the you see these two quarterbacks middle complete to the 40yard line Herve Blaine Irby big tight in you and I actually had him years ago Brent in a Holiday Bowl against the Arizona State he's battled through some injuries and he finds himself back in the rotation it that tight end along with DJ grant DJ grant checks back to the game for Irby he's number 18 he's a former receiver oh here they come more razzledazzle there comes one of Harsens formations haven't shown this all year there's the screen pass to Whitaker to daylight to the 45 yard line brandnew play that's what Brian hearts who wanted to do he has saved some wrinkles with his Oklahoma defense and they came out and nobody's out on this perimeter to the left Nelson's out there by himself but he's dealing with three linemen in a tight end Fozzy Whittaker gets into the open field he knows what to do that time Travis Lewis had to come all the way over to make that play there's the wrinkle by Brian Harrison sir Irby back in is tied in with two tights one tie than an hback actually in motion this is a power running formation and Whitaker and it is one after breaking free what a girl to the 34yard line he's off to a huge start good job of setting the edges time by Texas great perimeter blocking down feel the effort dear by Mike Davis but this is Fozzy Whittaker this is the Fozzy Whittaker that we've been waiting to see for a couple years I'm telling you he's healthy I think the presence of Malcolm Brown and Joe Bergeron have really pushed him he's the kind of the grandfather they're all facing especially in that back field down to the sitter's 33 brown back on the field for the horns drop boy with brown Malcolm cutsies steps Jefferson making this stop her be at the airport one of my friends there one of the quarters for a long time is closet Whitaker's relatively they have me tell the coaches that if Fonzie didn't show up big in this game don't barbecue when he comes home dad takes the way he is he thinks the world has young man that the career he has had here that Wildcat formation and they've got the quarterback and Fozzie is alongside him they give it to Fozzie and the sewers were ready for that second down throw a lost bite Fleming this is part of having an inexperienced quarterback not recognizing a corner coming off the Blitz look right here and the quarterback size he's not even looking out there this is the difference between Kevin Kellen Moore for a Colt McCoy who's a veteran and having a young freshman you don't see it you're not able to check out of it and it's a negative play there comes a big showdown for B it's six yards Shipley is to the left incomplete didn't get the ball up high enough and it was deflected at the line of scrimmage so the big uns got in that time RB ya and Cory Nelson came on a blitz we've talked a lot about Texas blitzing on third down well you gotta get experienced quarterback a true sophomore you're going to obviously bring pressure that time Nilson comes untouched right through the middle and it goes the awareness to get his hand up and knock that down so Justin Tucker on to attempt a 46yard this longer than they do successful oh you fool on its way looks long enough slips it across and cuts the lead in half battle the field goals continues in Dallas Oklahoma is leading Texas 6 to 3 are the first quarter as we continue dr. peppers road to the championships they all state BCS championship the night of January 9th in new three francs and Dominic Whaley back deep there's rhymes coming out from the six 36 yard line 'lord fans don't miss out now on the Kansas Texas game that's going to be October 29th only on the Longhorn Network so dial up your cable system but how about DirecTV and the Dish Network lot of you folks in Texas they've got DirecTV and Dish dial them up that chemists at Kansas long horn game check it out on the long horn Network you know they show practice live in Austin on the Longhorn Network on Tuesday and Wednesday if you're a Texas fan there's nothing better than that absolutely here's Whaley and as a running back is wailing left side that defensive front Herbie that's a tough front they are really being physical right now at the point of attack I mean it all things considered you down six to three but gotta be happy with the way they're holding up against the run they're trying to get Landry Jones into some obvious passing downs when he throws they'd put some pressure on him they're doing okay to holding up up front right now and win in that battle but can the defensive backs hold up as Jones is back in the pistol on second down and he's gonna put it up against them right now Royals double team they've bracketed over the top but the experience of this defense of the Safety's Christian Scot and Blake Gideon but so far that's a true freshman it digs on the first play of the game had the cushion and Broyles made him pay for it since then the adjustment by Manning he is is he's tightening that cushion up and taking it away I'm gonna put it up again come underneath for the first down he's got it is jazz Reynolds so the one they were probably not considering as a go to receiver jazz Reynolds comes up with a big play he's a sophomore from Houston when they threw a flag right at Kenny Stills as he was making a block on Blake Gideon the interesting to see as they talk to see if whether or not he got in front of Didion on his wrongness your luck now for helmets helmet head they're taking a look at this not just the potential hit from behind but whether or not he got up too high to good effort by stills that he uses the shoulder it looks like the contacts right there on the shoulder I'd love to see them when they get together as a group talk it over maybe somebody on a better angle and they they correct the call absolutely first out and out for the Sooners they've gone into Longhorns territory with the football for the third time here in the early going and Whaley picking up about four yards and this will bring up a second down the FIR Jones so the weapons galore for this öyou offense you look for Broyles you look for stills you could sit on the tight end here they go again play action rolling right underneath Whaley as a receiver first down to the 31 yard line and see you and I are used to see him it's this team and seeing Landry Jones get to the line and Texas has looked at it they they they were introduced in there by weeks before Iowa State two practicing against tempo but it's one thing again for these defenses to see it and prep it and then just like that you get him out of position you catch them napping and you're able to hit a big play it constantly challenges your focus as a defense the Aces are to the left the field side and opening quarter comeback with the run play way late so Picaro and bind him were matched up against Broyles and stills on the same side of the formation and they're staying right there right now the way to Texas safeties and linebackers are attacking the running game do not be surprised to see some playaction and to try to slip a tight end or receiver behind that aggressive look from Texas defendants on the right side of the Texas defense with its hands full now and Jones comes back the other way got the first down at the 20 yard line Hannah so the stars were lined to the left and he came back with a bluecollar Todd and Hannah for the first down the experience of Landry Jones you can just see it in how he runs the operation there's a penalty on this play however this is Broyles in zone there is a penalty for judge soon immediately as the play unfolded let's see if his rooms coming back that flag was thrown immediately Brentley the Oklahoma coach is telling us this week one of the things that they're most proud of has been the execution of the tempo not on not only are they running 90 to 100 plays but the turnovers and the penalties have been limited here the crucial moment when they find boils for a touchdown and illegal for the formation catches up to Oklahoma where where they are in that hurryup mode and Boyd Finch checks into that back field as a running back there's Royals in Vacarro Boyle's is in the left slot Thanks and they've earned a timeout that's the second time out that they have called so far in this game probably one of the one of the storylines that have been interesting for me to follow over the last couple of weeks because we did Oklahoma down at Florida State and I thought that was one of the hardest hitting football games that we've been around especially in September a long long time the one I'm curious about is how the Sooners keep on falling when they really haven't done anything wrong I mean they started out the season number one I note that the coaches are keeping them number one in their pool yeah but the writers seem to be looking for the flavor of the week what's going on I think that the writers have looked at LSU and Alabama and their accomplishments and rewarded them I don't think it's necessarily all about what's wrong with Oklahoma I think it's more about look at LSU is done look what Alabama has done but it is interesting to see how these teams have changed one thing I would add to an Oklahoma fan just keep winning LSU and Alabama will knock each other off if you keep winning you want to be a gym around with advice versed in 15 throws the slant back to the 20yard line Landry Jones defense will have its hands full when they take on the experience Landry Jones the junior from New Mexico this presa takes the college football presented by Buffalo Wild Wings will continue after this message and a word from our ABC stations and now for our conference update brought to you by dr. pepper and will who's in and who's out you made out of notice but this conference playing pretty good football five unbeatens at four and OH Oklahoma State heads to Austin next week to take on Texas now owe you up a field goal will they suck it down third time they've been in the red zone against this defense it comes you second down and eight as we start the second quarter pump fake going in zone got a man wide open touchdown same play basically that they beat Florida State with pumpfake on the screen pass and go to the end zone Kenny Stills he cut that one Intel and now he touches this one at Dallas to stay for this offense the motion out facts the motion out a receiver this time it happens to be Boyd Finch and it's just a little hesitation by the quarterback Jones enough to catch the attention of the defense and then he puts the ball right on the money the key there is he had time to make the throw and here is Chanukah and the one thing you may have noticed about stills he had a step and a half on that defensive back Royals is the political candidate but stills takes a back seats and nobody Rosia matter just groped the touchdown for Oklahoma as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary keep in mind OU's had three possessions and three scores two field goals and a touchdown everything yeah and they're not running the football but because right now Texas is determined to take that away Texas is playing well in the red zone but that was a big breakdown in coverage we'll show you in a second how Kenny Stills got so open so again into being the freshman digs coming up in the oneyard line game is to keep in his hand this time he breaks it to the 31yard line let's talk about the presence of lion boils and what that can do to a defense here is Blake Gideon a veteran you have Ryan wells who you think might be able to get the football and the guinea stills goes down and eventually gets behind it's not just a pump to Roy's bench watch yo Blake Gideon is so concerned about Ryan boils that where he is Wheatly breaks down in coverage great plan a great attack in Texas his secondary is out of position David ash will take over just come in at quarterback so it's his sequence now Malcolm Brown will be behind him this young man is dangerous afoot now from brown just can't find big holes as we check it down below with the third member of our team Aaron and Aaron right I was just standing by the Oklahoma defense when they were over on this side line before a couple of messages that the coaching staff was giving them you know the D line very frustrated by Brian hearts and trickeration Travis Lewis actually had to come over to them and say guys come on just think this through it's not that hard and then for the secondary the message for them they have to be a lot more disruptive to Texas all right Aaron and Fozzy Whittaker who's been dangerous and the more experience of the runningbacks is back on the field they over back to the right ash runs into the running back breaks free throws out of bounds and kills the play was smart enough to burn it by throwing the ball out of bounds this is what happens when you have a true freshman quarterback instead of dropping straight back he drops and an angle and runs into the senior Fozzy Whittaker he's lucky he didn't fumble that football and then eventually threw it away Brian Hartson said the difference between telling Laura and a David Ash in case of the coin Kelly Moore had buildings the finest third and fourth receiver he's quarterbacks if it's not there throw it away marquise Goodwin the speedster checks in and ash from the gun going deep mental intercepted picked off by Jefferson who had three interceptions a week ago Jefferson throwing down do not see a penalty flag I thought there was contact near the receiver but there are no penalty flags down around the 45 yard line this an interception by Tony Jefferson from Chula Vista California well one of the things that you hope for through Texas is that the freshman would not put the ball on the coverage especially against the savvy of this secondary of Tony Jefferson three interceptions of three straight possessions he gets an early start again here and boy he made a commitment pass interference call early in the game this time the freshman stairs down his intended receiver in Jefferson is in perfect position to be able to make the play his first interception of the year so the two freshmen quarterbacks a fumble and an interception that inexperience that was what Texas was hoping to overcome for three stores in sleet possession starting to take complete time that they can finish this one is wailing that last play as the receiver went down we are told by the fellas down and tape that his leg just got tangled up take a look at this as he goes down they said the legs just accidentally went down at first shot when I saw it live I thought he might have been pushed out but he's clear for that replay that the officials made a good nocall line Jefferson young man one of the three bigtime players from California on this early roster we now look at second down and five to complete first down 20yard line and there was Broyles it looked like Israeli who was flashing in the middle that he was snoring to Whaley but instead it was number 85 he was looking for man to man his Sooners Landry Jones sees the corners isolated man to man without any safety behind them they're attacking obviously the perimeter I thought he might go to stills who's all by himself up top instead goes to Boyle for the first now Broyles goes over to the slot left and stills is outside him Jones fires back in that direction with a penalty flag it stills push off and I believe he may have pushed off but this is going to go against the offense Bob's gonna argue his case but Brent Kenny Stills before he has a chance to get away from the ball you'll see it right there with the right hand the defensive back was continuing on I don't know how much he actually pushed him but he gave the perception as if he did Bob students can argue it all he wants but when you're a physical receiver like Kenny Stills they're gonna get you for that Texas catches a break there because there again a foreigner isolated oneonone with Kenny Stills Landry Jones is going to try to expose them so it'll come back 15 yards the other way maybe they'll bring the ball back to the horns 35 and it'll be first down and five incomplete and had he hooked up with stills that tied they were not communicating that would have been a huge game there was a soft spot over there Jones saw it that I'm not sure that stills recognized what his quarterback was looking at firing out of bounds and that will bring up a big third in twenty five so that penalty really hurt this oh you drive that's the matchup that they're trying to get after they also that time had Ryan Broyles man against quaint Gideon third in a long way here it is probably thinking about trying to keep it within field goal range to fit again with the aggressive nature mob since they do they try to attack Hunnicutt's careerlong is 44 yards in kg one and four receivers out fires right side jazz Reynolds again he has made his pitches count here today this is this is a page from the national football league for political receivers against mantoman coverage to nobrainer they go after the true freshman again and now Whaley on first angel is stopped at the 5 yard line by Keenan Robinson he's a second time the quandary Dix who has a great future as a talented young man but he's a true freshman he didn't do anything that slow jazz Reynolds off the line of scrimmage and mantoman never saw the football Landry Jones spotted it great awareness put the ball right on the money in so third and long becomes the first down third and 25 32mile second down and goal quick toss stills in the air does great hands and it comes free working on in that time Brent stones actually who has strong hands had his hands on a football bind him actually gets his hands up and knocks the ball away just like you would do in practice in a drill great coverage cuz stilt went up and over him but he didn't give up on the play and eventually he stripped it away from the stronger still battery there's on the field milord is a of this offense it's there down in five they're offset he's just to the quarterbacks left and if that's the third time I've been used at 11:47 to go Big Bob knows this is a crucial moment in the game big difference here between a field going to touchdown what it would do to Texas in spirit 133 Oklahoma's runned it again we'll be right back ESPN's College Football on ABC gee bud hunting if it's fuel efficient affordable stylish and safe it's probably a Hyundai death the power to do more great view of the Texas State Fair courtesy if the cheese at real fancam 90,000 plus on hand Cotton Bowl bouts annual oh you Texas battle Sooners dominated on third down Jones fires right at the corner of the endzone touchdown the live judge says that's Broyles royal sits down at the goal line and on third down really put a big number up on the law you think Lantry Jones at Ryan Broyles have done this very much of practice and see if the ball breaks the plane yeah it does I mean basically go to the pylon just get it step beyond turn around I'm gonna throw the ball against the true freshman ready break touchdown Hunnicutt take a look to see if it hit break the plane it it's not about where his knee is it's not about where his body is it's about where the football is once he has possession that first looked we had looked like there wasn't any question but always better to take another look Frakes the plan right there well if this stands up and whoever thinks it will that was Broyles forty second career touchdown I'll be checking also the back of that Harvey just to make sure the feet were outside but I think the line judge that he might have been looking at that and there was an official boy look at that look at that shot you know just a little bit of red right there when you go back to that perfect technique by the official if we go back to that still shot I mean he you if you can't make a be in better position to make a call Mack Brown knows the importance we went to the breakdown we said big difference between holding them to a field going maybe down 16 to 3 well they scored field goals on their first two trips down there but now this would be their second consecutive touchdown if it holds up again our referee is Scott Novak the ball right there and saw the other angle his foot was the line judge saw that there was space between the foot and on a bond he watch the line chest he's looking right there that's the part of the play that he's right on top of it's what you walk up there right now absolutely remember on 3rd and 25 the Sooners go 30 yards to jazz Reynolds now on third down and goal they come back to Broyles so it stands and you know through the years as we're watching boils they've had so many great running backs as you think back and we'll watch Bonnie got here with the extra point but that's his forty seconds worth TD which I told you about it but if it held up now you watch Honeycutt but when you think about this game and some of the names through the years who have played for Texas and Oklahoma unbelievable careers so the question today is and we'll have the answer after which one of these great running backs holds the freshman rushing record for yards in a game sim look at which one has the freshman rushing records in this game back with the answer so are me as a freshman which one of those great backs rushed for the most yards at this game I'm gonna guess Billy since this cuz I loved him as a kid and it was Adrian Peterson 2004 at 220 they're spotted now but you love Billy Sam we're just great man were they fun to watch his digs back deep this one's in the end zone he's coming out suitors closing in on him but he breaks out to the right good return for the freshman out to the 30 and right now let's check in the studio and here is Scott Van Pelt Scott great good afternoon time for your AT&amp;T allamerica Player of the Week updated skelling more off of 254 yard performance three touchdowns a 50point road win against Fresno easiest two winds behind Colt McCoy alltime you can text your vote to five five eight six two from your mobile phone to vote for a chance to win to the national championship back to Brett and her bein Dallas met Scott Scott thank you very much yet Fozzy Whittaker is in now with case McCoy 23 and on his first pass of this series plane Irby makes his second catch Texas threeposition fruit possessions her Vienna fumble a field goal interception not going to do it in experience he definitely showing up here so far and with the youth of this team the turnovers have hurt them and it's affected deal position which you don't want to see if you're Matt Brown Oklahoma's starting on an average hit right at midfield in 254 his Texas is starting at the own 25 making them drive a long field with this experience of youth and they come and around tucked up at the 22yard Palvin rolled in an on a boule miles on a boule the wide receiver coming around he's got to come from the outside you talk about awareness and in the defense right now that it's an attack mode great job of reacting and seeing that play but a fire Oklahoma defense but mainly as Eric Coleman you don't think that Bob Stoops is enjoying this consider the last time person who was the offensive coordinator at Boise State in that famous Fiesta Bowl Stoops will take all the great defensive plays he can get it as Carson's office looking for another interception incomplete underthrown that time but you go back to one of the famous calls and all the college football that Statue of Liberty play the harson dialed up with Boise State for that game winner Stoops is gonna pile it up if he can on whoreson here today he has not forgotten and there is the young offensive coordinator who comes in with an inexperienced offense trickeration not going to do it against this defense first part of the game back at the 28yard line and out of bounds that's where the Sooners will take it again Texas needs to stop I thought if it this one's getting ugly aerial coverage provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear and more driven Roy Finch is the running back for oh you they turn loose a scoring machine here in the first half of this game they go Indian they're gonna flare to it here is bench spins away from the first defender crosses the 40yard line a late flag the back judge threw that as he came up did they have a crack back here building a block no it's coming back Troy Frank's had suspended for a couple games back on the field for the Sooners and Bob will not like that can't coach is going back towards the football and you dive towards the defenders legs and a call that this year and Brent good I too can see that Texas right now just kind of reeling they need anything they can get to help them out we were talking it's a break first time Landry Jones has been bent back in his own territory Texas needs to get pressure on Jones and try to hope for a throw over right now to help their office goes down wide open in the air and almost intercepted that was bind him who had a crack at that ball and still should have caught it to begin with I can't believe that he doesn't hang on here and there's nobody behind Vaquero behind them comes over and you're right it should have been able to hold on to them there was nobody out there on the outside of the defense play that Oklahoma would love to have back but there is going to be a penalty here on Texas critical error by the Longhorns on this flag they won't object so they bring it up to the 39 not an automatic first down let me change that it is it is a first down let me correct myself that was a personal foul so that's an automatic first down on that call I was still looking at the replay was still surgery that I sort of missed the call how long it feel yeah late late hit on the quarterback kids on that automatic first down and here goes Landry Jones and his tempo again from the suitors play action rolling left throws it underneath and pinches got the first down Roy fetch the sophomore from Florida picks up the first down and here they come again I know Whaley gets most of the attention even Brendon clay a sophomore but boy Roy Finch now that he's healthy low center of gravity just a very difficult back and a good complement to the other backs that they have back in the backfield for Oklahoma roll in that pocket to the right they're going to throw back a screen on the other side of it get a block and it's a big game to the 30yard line Austin Haywood a seldomused tied in sophomore for 20 yards on that throwback screen right now Josh Pikeville is a step ahead of Manny Diaz just dialing up and moving this ball right down the field the hurry up definitely affecting Texas bucket holes fires boys fumble as ruled incomplete they wave it off there are huge voids in the Longhorns secondary and this is the wrong offense to do that against again a little pump fake to the outside just as a decoy and the defensive back that time Diggs came in and gave to hit from behind them to dislodge the football but Brent I'm telling it right now Landry Jones is going to find those seams if you're going to lead huge openings in that secondary he and his group of receivers will make you pay for it man Adrian Phillips had checked into that secondary to back there later and straight back and that might be late we're at all in the backfield and that was Jeffcoat trying to set up another play back into that boundary but behind the line you're a free free man to be able to hit down third down Calvin Howell from the San Antonio rolls in this defense is still battling upfront and we said from the very beginning of the game that the matchup was actually playing to the favor of Texas up front in the trenches at that time and you know the Oklahoma's been able to settle down and put some points on the board that time Texas Shawn they're not giving up in this game and they get some penetration and get pressure on Landry Jones trusts way backs up line and Andre Diggs who's standing on the 10yard line this one out of bounds it is going to be marked at the 15yard line and a reminder of Monday Night Football in Motown could you believe it folks the redhot Detroit Lions fourandoh and as there is Stafford their big time quarterback let me show you something about nacio right here at Highland Park High School down here Dallas way he went to Georgia his father who did not play football in Athens was a graduate student there and Mathew played for the Bulldogs and here is leading the redhot Lions match against the Chicago Bears last week yes you asked me about Josh Freeman I was looking Florida great the down pitching staff February second half cross coming to you there's David Nash in at quarterback the rotating quarterbacks complete out to the left to Shipley and we have it out to the 18 yard line for a gain of about 3 yards on that play that's the first time they have faced adversity this year I know BYU came up a game and they ended up winning that game by a point but I'm saying since they've gone to the freshman quarterback and they've gone to case of a boy they've controlled UCLA that controlled Iowa State let's see if they don't panic offensively and they try to stick to their guns here a touchdown before the intermission be huge we'll throw this away it's like he was going to set the screen and it had been blown up so he just threw it away and he now faces a third down this is a true freshman did not come to school early so he missed some of that early preparation and not Crownover on the sidelines hoping that one of these young hoarder my ninja formula against the Sooners produces a 59 Herbie for the long we're Brent Venables can tried and really come out to David Asatru freshman and trying to give him some looks we'll try to get me some pressure trying to come to the inside they did bring the heat Murphy just as you predicted back at the 11 yard line Frank Alexander creditor Lucas I across the middle linebackers box come in here Travis Lewis and by doing that it creates enough confusion upfront not to mention the ends who've done a great job all year coming from the outside and the true freshman has nothing to do but to just duck Justin Tucker back and Ryan awaits this punt so it off the side of his foot he rushed to get it out of there and Broyles in the gang gonna let it rolled on Olivos touch right around midfield by a long horn well after finishing first to the second curtain motion Jimmy Johnson have reached in championship contenders Kevin Harvick and Carla's was inside for the lead and will continue the Sprint Cup at Kansas the race for the cup Sunday 1:00 Eastern on ESPN dead even out of it Edwards really good you tight right now who you like Kirby let's say I'm gonna go with Edwards Edwards got the hot hand good man good athlete is very Tiger fan is absolutely you know I'm a smoke trail it's full of the Jody's beautiful incomplete it'll be second down here there's a penalty flag there could be hands in the face on the defense base on the defense and I'm ready to fight 15yard penalty first down my hands a little bit yeah paddle in the trenches and the penalties always seem to be a big factor in the outcome of this game and it looks like early Oklahoma is making some minnow airs and now it's been Texas here the last couple drives not the thing you want to do to this Oklahoma offense they don't need any help that's for sure off a lot of weapons as you look down there at Oklahoma they're looking for major adjustments of their own here comes Whaley but back to the right to the 30yard line the kind of have abandoned the running game because they've had some success throwing the ball into this into this inexperienced secondary of Texas but you know Oklahoma you know Bob Stoops one of the things that they were determined to do this year is become more balanced be able to control the line of scrimmage and run the football because it's only going to make their passing game that much more lethal they're experts the Texas secondary for 227 yards and rushed for only 10 and their way to the 17 point lead and you can see why they have abandoned the line yeah they'll come back for the pass now on his third down in young Jackson Jeffcoat whose daddy was a good one with the Cowboys makes that play Jeffcoat on one side Okhla fir on the other dorsey Randall they've done a good job of getting penetration when they've tried to run the football now in third long see if they get some pressure on door unlock go quick snap drop would not have been a first down anyway but Hannah can't hang on and here comes a fourth down so the Longhorn defense held on that series and here they come again we're gonna go down they're gonna order to taking Millard out over there out of timeouts right here breath there aren't any safeties behind the coverage nobody in the back in the middle now they moved back a couple safeties now they stick a little softer recovery Jones ago look for one on one incomplete and a head stills breaking back toward the post this time instead of the sideline but it's incomplete and the horns will take over they still got five minutes here this is a big fiveminute period coming up protection it was interesting that Oklahoma made some adjustments and then watched tip Texas his mantoman right now wait Gideon makes the check he gets him out of it now they're playing a little bit softer coverage so the check from the sideline from the Oklahoma coaches was to attack mantoman but by the time Landry Jones called it Texas and Manny Diaz had adjusted to cover too and it played perfectly into what della Palma tried to do that on fourth down David Ash Malcolm Brown in a deep set in the two ballyhooed freshmen Brown got daylight on the left and you can see some resistance that he met Travis Lewis when Travis brings it you're going down the closing speed and the Red River Rivalry is a little bit different than the high school games last year did mount young Malcom Brown face because he alright I make it picked up four yards but it looked like you might pick up ten for 12 come just second down option breed and Oklahoma jizz read the football KZ Walker said get whooped up front to slow developing KC Walker who's really starting to emerge on this defensive line beats his man but the entire defensive line hitting their penetration and Britt that play didn't have a chance from the word go not just because of the battle up front but the execution in the backfield that time was Ashe in the back out of sync too slow Whitacre in the backfield for Ashe who is only one of three facing a tough third down and here comes the heat and he turns away probably and throws he was close to the scrimmage line that's Mike Davis he was very close there is no penalty flag but that was big by the freshman just to step up and keep the play alive it looked like Frank Alexander had a shot at him there's his athletic ability and quickness he steps up away from the pressure and then has an ability to be able to find the receiver Mike Davis that was completely legal he was the right side of that line of scrimmage good recognition action steps away from the defense fires on the run intercepted Enzo this is going to be a sooner touchdown first Devante Hurst a young man from Lankester Texas so here is Michael Honeycutt backs on another extra point a 55 yard interception return for a touchdown you know what really set this up Erin Colvin is as the safety walked up and his going to blitz watch the quarterback able to elude him showing his athletic ability steps away now he wants to try to plant his tight incoming here but what he doesn't see his first steps up comes off of his man and he just throws it and hopes but when you haven't experienced defense and a guy like hurts through they'll tell you is their top cover man he came all for his receiver read the eyes of the freshman quarterback and came over and made a play David asked just threw that ball after awardees Belvin had just hoped his receiver PJ grant could make a play on it you know that old line that coaches used to say about what's the best thing about a freshman to make sure there'll be a sophomore and experience experience they'll have it these young men will grow up yeah in the system and a couple years from now Herbie will be down here the Cotton Bowl we won't recognize you're right those two young you're right they'll know what they won't throw that ball in that situation oh no class continues 27 3 the Sooners are in total command of this game this time it's going to be Whittaker burning it out hole in the middle explodes quick spray fifteen with a huge one record yard touchdown return by Fozzy Whittaker all the barbecue you want young man they have been kicking away from quazy to quandary digs and as you watch her be the start of this return they had admin role out there and this time Fozzie took charge of the kickoff next the point is good you need to turn to a veteran to be able to make the play and this is a great view at what happens here an open display it's right in the middle he hits the free fish Mashable Harris on something to stop the ticker but you know what you turn back tonight mm in 2008 when Jordan Shipley had that big return to kind of change the game around this is a different set of circumstances but Texas needed something to get them going and maybe this to be exactly what they need to give them a little bit of hope to be able to be competitive this was the moment you're talking about except play and zone it is their special teams well I like to check up listen I just sit back and listen that's you now we'll see what happens could change the game again a lot of football to be played here still got 244 to go and the horns are trying to get their kickoff team squared away get their eleventh in out their trade franchise back deep with Waylon brother Sooners you know you know kleh Houma it's not gonna be content with just running the football here they're get out they're gonna try to put another touchdown up on the board so one of two things will happen either they're gonna score or Texas you'll have a chance to stop them and get the ball back here's this is Waylon and you stopped shy before let's go to Scott Van Pelt Scott right this Taco Bell studio update down in Columbia Connor Shaw under center this week looking for all Sean Jeffrey always a wise play big number one has visited the end zone two times in the Gamecocks out a 17 point lead in the second over Kentucky thank you and we've got a 17 point differential here Scott 27:10 and the Sooners come out they've got time to throw they remember they're out of time outside they split this stadium in half 50% for Lawrence the other 50 Princeton Oklahoma right now is in the Texas side of a football field Jones putting it up on first out of Broyles and close to another first down where he put it down and minded it we just heard Scott coming up on the Cooper Tire halftime report he'll be along with Jesse Palmer they'll have holidays big highlights huge games around today so the second in short and we leave the ballcarrier and now it's going to be thoroughly enjoyed ther C stopped them short of the first down big play by course they're not running the football very well so as a result they just keep you to himself Jones does and picks up the first down they'd be creative with how they moved Ryan Boyles around he's been at all three different wide receiver positions he's currently in the slot to Landry Jones is right trying to match him up oneonone and see if they can get him to get up against Blake get in for potentially a big play James Hannah was on the left side of the formation as the tightend right title oh listen that it cost the Sooners five Jarvis Jones who's been out with an ACL since spring they eased him now Oh prefer actually next round is irate they called that uh no prefer said he cause Jarvis Jones to move Wow sort of came up with a rear end there that engine didn't they you could move on the defensive side since it's me I just thought it came straight up that fire first down whoops comes down field and aim to jazz Reynolds incomplete that time and they're paying a little more attention to number sixteen phone except for those two big catches that he turned in here and they in the early going of this game I would challenge any fan out there and watch any game today and find a group that has a tougher task for four quarters than quandary digs Adrian Phillips and Carrington item out their isolated oneonone against these crew this week the wide receivers and Landry Jones you know they're yelling goat come on defensive line get to it that's it that's the king Sega dad and they did that time but he drops it off down the jug Reynolds again and arune's has another puts it down near midfield and regains it and that's a first down at midfield took a big hit continue to get downfield picked up the first down you said they need to get pressure that time they brought up blitz and nearly got to Jones he just got the ball on Rick snapped out at Jones got the middle of fires Broyles shakes off a tackle and he's across the 15 yard line to the 14 that time Brian Broyles the bigtime senior from Norman did not go right down the middle of the defense and he got right behind Blake Gideon perfect throw up to the 36 yard gain fires in zone stills pulls it down touchdown well that's his spot isn't it you get him on that left side on one on one and let Kenny stills from California go to work it ladies and gentlemen that's what we call an answer so much for the momentum after the big kickoff return bingbangboom touchdown stills on the face and when you leave those corners isolated oneonone without a safety in behind them they're going to get you here's not a good zags on and the Nerds 4.34 10 remember that third quarter down in Tallahassee incompletion Broyles first down stills touchdown this one about one play longer but just as effective this is the play that's set it up jazz Reynolds who's really been coming on good job of concentrating takes a big hit and fights for four more yards they brought the Blitz they were able to come up with a play and then just a just when these two are playing they're always in sync Landry Jones finding Ryan Broyles right over the middle of the defense and this is what you have to always be concerned about when they get in the red zone you think about Broyles you think about maybe the running game but it's Kenny Stills the Florida State game that we had today against Texas when Oklahoma gets down in the red in the red zone good chance they're gonna throw that fade up to number four for a touchdown I was a serious vertical on a part of number four so Landry Jones today with these three receivers as the main target has thrown for three hundred and two yards and those three touchdowns to distills one to Broyles Reynolds has moved the chains all game long would they overlook it so last night it was Kellen Moore at tonightís Landry Jones and I daresay this might become one of the best nights when appropriate chases in a long time that'll be out of bounds that'll be the penalty against the kicking G but at least that did not allow posi to go another hundred so there's 31 seconds and oh you leads it by four points a great graphic because stills and Broyles get all the attention which they should but something that defense's the rest of the year are gonna have to concern himself with is the emergence of jazz Reynolds to sophomore 62 about 200 pounds you can't just lock in on one guy and that's what makes the Oklahoma offense so tough arils didn't play early in the year he's really come on here since the Missouri game in the Ball State game and is kind of given that third option and Landry Jones is not shy he will give him this touches so case McCoy will finish up the first half for the Longhorns he'll hook this one short of the out of bounds marker and he is run down by Tommy word Tom Ward remember when Clint Trickett was trying to run for his life this Oklahoma defense loves to attack quarterbacks and they the closing speed Brent I think is the thing that it really stands out with these linebackers so there's 21 seconds left here Harvey in the first half ordinarily I might say what context is do we adjust in the second half but this is gonna be tough going with young team now let's be a lot of stuff and I guess the ball that starts a second okay all right that's that's that's one way to start but reality is that this is a young team we knew we talked about it all week Howard do you show up the three turnovers had backfired the veteran team Landry Jones had capitalized the big thing if you're Texas just keep fighting keep fighting hope the defense can create some turnovers get the ball back McCoy complete down the sideline Mike Davis recourses a bit of a prevent defense the the Sooners were not uptight pressing that time and so Davis was able to sit down in a big hole in that defense now 16 seconds and the long two timeouts here in 16 seconds and McCoy trying to move him into that zone this would be huge if they can strike release little diving looks like an interception in center field that was Javon Harris and now they're waving it off now the field judge said no now there's too much of Harris said he had it two of the officials were agreeing with you Brent and then one other official came in and said that it actually hit the ground I'm sure they'll got to take another look at that right oh yeah those hands look like they got underneath now they are now this is gonna be a little tricky because the hands yes are under the ball but what's happening under the stomach as he pulls it in remember this is an incompletion on the field had a bit of completion might stand up also but they called it incomplete so this one's going to be tricky based on that that first shot that we had it you don't know if that's enough evidence for them to be able to to turn it around because like you said Brent the hands look like they get under but once his body collapses on top of the ball it's hard to see you hope that the officials on the field would have a better look at it than what we could see in the replay this is going to be tricky because of what the call is on the field there's no doubt the hands got underneath the football Furby while we while we have a moment I want to say something about a football icon who passed away earlier today Al Davis the owner of the the Oakland Raider is dead at the age of 82 I'm sure that throughout the day on the sports centers and the studio updates we will hear more and of course prior to tomorrow's game the Raiders are in Houston now here's the story the ball hit the ground incomplete pass second down yeah was impossible to to turn over and reminder that we also lost a good friend Joe a study colgate he was a catcher to College World Series and then started as a runner and he became a legendary television director areas with Dennis Lewin where the former ABC executives Joe has said a debt at the age of 76 and that he was just a favorite of all of ours around television and incomplete seven seconds sprint and you know that the kicker Justin Tucker and are you gonna have to try to get as many yards as you can Tucker actually has a careerlong of 51 yards so see if they're thinking that or they're just thinking that's foot one up there and see if somebody can come down with a big play third down and and timeout call by the horn came from background as a sideline well öyou is taking them to the woodshed here in the first half the high point for the Longhorns Fozzy Whitaker's 100yard kickoff return but offensively the Sooners with 312 total yards and 302 of them have been passing yards from Landry Jones in Texas 87 yards of offense he might be right about Brent Venables and Bob Stoops looking at this game is his personal chance to go up against Brian harshly after what happened enough Tiesto ball a few years ago go down and from the 40 complete halt on that Mike Davis received at that time and a twenty four point lead for the number one or the number three team in the nation depending on which poll you prefer Texas will get the ball to start the second half and Bob Stoops very happy with the way his team is playing this year let's go down to Erin with Mack Brown Erin right thank Matt it's really the first bit of adversity these two young freshmen quarterbacks have dealt with on the road what's your message when you get inside oh we haven't done anything right we've the things we had to do when we came in we had to take care of the ball force turnovers I think we've had three or four turnovers and haven't forced any we had to stay away from penalties we've had the penalties they haven't had the penalties we have to take care of third downs they've made big plays on third down we haven't so we have played absolutely horrible give them credit they played great we better grow up better get back in this ball game I like their spunk in the the fight at the end I like the kickoff return shoot they they take an 80yard Drive when we get back in the ballgame with a two minutes left in the go so they're playing great we had to disrupt Landry Jones we're not he's standing back there and he's making plays all over the place so we just got to play a whole lot better we haven't done anything right give them credit they've done everything right thank you all right Aaron as we send it to the studio now to Scott Van Pelt and Jesse Palmer for the Cooper Tires halftime report take it away Scott welcome back to ESPN college football on ABC presented by Buffalo Wild Wings Landry Jones throws for more than 300 yards in the first half and Oklahoma builds a 24point lead on Texas and in case you just joined us we should point out Kirk that there were three big long horn turnovers and that resulted in 17 sooner parts yeah and just what it looked like Texas might get things going with a big return by Fozzy Whittaker at your ticket name maybe some momentum going into halftime well Oklahoma just went right down the field and eventually hit a fade Kenny Stills for another touchdown for that 34 10 lead it's clearly the experience the leadership the big play ability of Landry Jones and company against the inexperience of the horns definitely a big factor in the first half so the horns will try to get something going here with the first series of the second half and if you weren't with us the high point for Texas in the first half was Fozzie Whitaker's 100 yard kickoff return I'm Andre Diggs is back deep with Whitaker and they try to keep it out of Whitaker's hands bond rate picks it up on the right sideline and they'll force him out of bounds around the 26 as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary not two quarterbacks here today but it's three herby well Andrew Jones Brent you talked about his first half three hundred yards three touchdowns you know Oklahoma an 11 plays of 10 yards or more and in for case McCoy David Ashe their first real experience of dealing with this kind of environment and this kind of defensive pressure struggling in the first half with the turnovers let's see if they're able to settle down here and get some things going better in the second half case McCoy opens a quarterback for the horns Brown pretty good hole on the right side and a powerful one to the 33yard line Texas is not good enough to just line up and play and you can see in the in the first half of the 30 to play 16 for 3 yards or fewer and the negative plays in two turnovers just really a Mack Brown said it to Erin Andrews walking off a home town that they've selfdestructed but Oklahoma has had a lot to do with that well Brown again Jerry boas and Fleming would not let him have the edge number Flemington print on the one of the first few plays of the game Fozzy Whittaker very similar play but Fozzy Whittaker gave him a little shake and got outside of him Fleming's in exact same position but this time against a true freshman he doesn't lad him outside and not only that he makes the tackle very important for Oklahoma's defense today not letting the perimeter run game for Texas have any kind of success Brown and Whitaker both in the game on this third down Oklahoma touchdown David King back up defensive end a junior Houston rolls in with the fourth long horn turnover of the game and they brought pressure what a surprise on third down and two guys get in there first being Travis Lewis Frank Alexander also creates the fumble and David King doesn't want to just jump on it showing a little athletic ability there 64 275 pounds jr. picks it up and goes into the end zone and Mac Brown and a long horn offense continue to have big problems with the turnover Michael Hanukkah tax on the extra point four turnovers have resulted in 24 Obama points college football in high definition he's presented by Vizio Oklahoma leading Texas 41 10 and the third floor we continue dr. peppers road to the championships and you certainly have to think about these Sooners who have showed up today for the Red River Rivalry game against Texas Diggs Diggs smack inside the 15 yard line as öyou continues to bring it and tonight great primetime lineup on our family of networks SEC on ESPN and espn2 how about that Tennessee team there's some folks who think they're gonna beat Georgia tonight huh what a game that might be and Alabama is on the you and Ohio State Nebraska everybody your thoughts about Ohio State Nebraska tonight in Lincoln defensive battle I think both offenses are struggling coming in I think the Braska at home will be tough to be Pro high o State the way their offense is executing right now now McCoy hands off to Malcolm Brown who shakes a tackle and is down at the 12yard I've ran l Lewis so you take a look at the turnovers and the importance in this game and on the season and the horn suck perhaps they had conquered that coming in look at what's happened here today and really since Garrett Gilbert has been replaced in the BYU game by Case McCoy and David Ashe they've done a really good job at taking care of the ball and I think that's what gave them hope coming into this game that maybe that trend would continue they fake the reverse Whitaker keeps it on the left side out to the 16yard I I hope people who are not Oklahoma or Texas fans are watching especially in the SEC because the last two weeks LSU and Alabama have done some impressive things and they proved ahead of Oklahoma in the polls welcome a home anew that they had a big stage and a big opportunity against Texas to show what they could do and they're trying to take advantage of that and I'll tell you this defense is a lot better than a lot of people give them credit and the coaches though have not but they still have oh you rated number one right third down and eight McCoy penalty flag on the play the throw was out of bounds I that the pass was thrown there was a penalty flag on that far sideline check it down below now with Aaron Kirk which is talking about that stage that they're on making an impression on people and Bob Stoops told me coming out of the half we're not taking our foot off the pedal here guys just like you imagine he said we have to finish this off this is Texas over there you'd like to see his guys run the ball a little better though Broyles is back deep Justin Tucker and in inside is five whacks it about the six yard line and here is Broyles out of bounds at the 39 penalty flag unnecessary roughness that's a personal foul Broyles was clearly out of bounds and giving himself up on that sideline you know Brenna Quinton Hayes the backup safety from Oklahoma looked like he may have hit a Texas he may have man knocked a player it into Broyles I think they're confirming as they did earlier in the first half army and you could be right about this then if he did if it was a no you player instigated it this will go against Oklahoma we'll probably push him back 15 yards their background is seeing if he gets a vote in this now I see there's a second flag that I had not noticed and the defense participated with 12 players at fiveyard penalty is declined first down Oklahoma timeout on the field after all that so Stoops was trying to get a timeout somebody realized the mistake and could not we'll take a break college football on ABC Bud Light it's the sure sign of a good time here we go at Wrangler feet comfortable jeans well there's your view of the Texas State Fair that's courtesy of the cheese a real fan can some burnt orange jerseys out there Stern a little bit earlier that didn't like and it beaten a rush out there is way Lee's gonna be the running back now for Jones on this first down dropped milord very sure handed H back fullback drops at that time at its second ten rare chop dropped by Miller that really called his name much more versatile players on this offense lining up and pull back but using it a lot in the passing game and there's a really good job but just kind of be in the glue to this offense an unsung hero for the offense now then they write flat they set the screen with Whaley and there's a penalty flag flying Whaley is to the 42 back judge threw the flag Bob Stoops getting frustrated because this is a rule that's new this year depending on where you are on the field you have to really have a feel for where the football is so he's saying he's not inside it's a matter of where the ball is when you decide to go down it's it's saying you know more and more coaches should probably look at what avoid submarining these defensive backs even though it's such a big part of these offenses where they get the ball out quick to a receiver second and 21 incomplete stills the target not on the same page bind him the defendant rare miscommunication by Jones and one is one of his receivers now what was a third and 25 the last time that they were in the third and forever they'd found a oneonone matchup from 30 yards in the first down looks like they're not getting the mantoman situation they had on that particular matchup when they were able to pick that first down up short of the first down 45 yard line out of bounds is Jaz Reynolds he has been the first down man in those situations but Stoops will send the funny team out and nothing hopefully goes back deep and Whitaker is also it'll be it'll be Shipley alone back deep the horns put up a 10man front against this punt and here they come and press white gets it away crowd booing I don't even think he was touched he was so excited to just dive stoop says look at the replay he stoop says take a look at this replay as soon as he punted the ball he just went down he's China they almost sold it too much it touched him but he heat went down quick I don't he wasn't touched he just you got to do a little bit a little bit of acting there tres Wayne trying to take one for the team bob says look at that replay Bob's not gonna want to see that David Ash his turn so they bring the runningback Monroe off the edge on the end around basically and our era coverage provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll in heroes Goodyear more driven with a few times we've seen DJ Monroe get outside and pick up some yards the linemen actually came around clean that time the execution was perfect by Texas all offense only a hundred and two yards of offense for Texas here today a hundred and two and Fonzie Whitaker gives him a few more with a good first down burst on that run before Fleming is able to push him out about the Oklahoma defensive line actually shifted down to the left the defense is left and when they did that it was a really good job of recognizing the backside cutback and Whitaker once he got around Frank Alexander it was him again with Fleming one on one that time Fleming at least didn't get him around the Fozzy Whittaker picks up that first down rolls right throws it incomplete second down David Ash has a reputation in his early curly part of his career being the athletic guy between he and Casey before but mack brown telling us this week i said that he run kind of a zone reed was an option guy in high school he said no not at all he's a pastor he's through almost every down in high school so he could throw the football I think he's starting to get a little bit more command of the offense and not just a an option guy he can throw it as well draw play Malcolm ground the freshmen bring up a third down and five coming up for the horns and ash you know Texas at Mack Brown this is obviously a game that's getting out of reach but they go back home next week and take on another top five top seven type of team in Oklahoma State so you know they're still trying to learn about what they can do well and what they cannot against the better opponents that they play Whitaker and Monroe and Whitaker in the Wildcat here comes the throw off the end around and ready for shipping play was successful earlier this year but not against this defense and Bernal Lewis number 56 blows it completely up and Bob Stoops is thinking on the sidelines remember that first of all folks not gonna happen today how about 14 yard loss Renta pressure again on third down Texas up front I think surprised and they ended up missing Ron llois one of the best athletes on the defensive line low and broils does control dead at about the 35 yard line so it will be OU's ball again when you come back well there's the seasonending award the coach's trophy presented by Dr Pepper and that will be awarded at the 2012 allstate BCS championship game in New Orleans and Oklahoma has its eye squarely on that prize I want to tell you as they come out out with their offense Whaley will be the running back first down and ten there's Whaley's try to stretch it out for another huge gain tenet for the end zone Whaley touchdown Oklahoma 64 yards and folks Bebo can't stand to watch it anymore his flat turned his back on the horns and says that's enough of that stuff holy Toledo Hunnicutt replace the injured Jimmy Stephens the last few weeks the new cut has a strong leg with his extra point so here's the young man this one 64 yards RV yeah outside zone play some good blocking on the outside the tight end 89 Dave wood picks up a good block up to the outside a pick up Tyler Evans head as a nice sealed block but I just think the guys would surprise to most I think it's probably Dominic Whaley he got to the outside and there was nobody left who's just a simple outside zone play and the effort by Ryan boils the downfield blocked by him that is that's exactly the way you draw it up and meanwhile there's some orange burnt orange shirts headed for the exits they have seen enough crimson and cream not moving Texas only touchdown a 100yard kickoff return by Fozzy Whittaker Red River Rivalry is turning into a Red River bloodbath laundry DJO let me check that penalty flag TJ Monroe breaks today open headed for the end zone second kickoff return for a touchdown this one a 90 yarder but remember there are two penalty flags and the owe you players are signaling this one is coming back because of an illegal block to return Kendyl Thompson just locked up trade milord fullback that was covering the kickoff protect you know if you're Oklahoma nothing better than winning the game and finding an area where you can still improve this coverage unit has been a problem and that's something that Bob Stoops obviously will want to address 35 right there in the middle the screen does this pulls him down Kendall Thompson David Ashe back in is the quarterback Malcolm Brown goes to work spins to the 26 yard line some yards here on first and ten right actually not only do you pull down milord it's right exactly where Monroe and Fozzy Whittaker ran right up the middle so opened up that scene but this this room I end up with a halfempty Stadium you and I were talking about they split the stadium in half the burglars and crimson Texas still trying to fight here doing everything Ted can DJ was roll he's the back alongside Ashe Shipley Cicely well short of that first down marker that is Chevelle 20 Jamel Fleming down Arlington Texas is developing into a bigtime hitter on the corner we have seen him now against Florida State and here today against Texas and he's a tough rascal when Brent Venables the defensive coordinator of Oklahoma has got to be very proud of the way this team is playing with such awareness their closing speed their attitude they're locked in they obviously read their reading their keys very well I talked about I disciplined quite a bit this week and so far they played with quite a bit of that Cody Johnson is back as the tailback girl in his short and very there timeout is called by the Longhorns well let's take a look down today's good hands brought to you by Allstate it's thinner there have been a lot of good hands for Oklahoma Jazz Reynolds able to focus and concentrate initially setting up a big play Ryan boils down field or a touchdown right before the half which was to this man right here there's the good hands Kenny Stills for the fade the touchdown who's a strong good hands there are the numbers on those three by the way Kurt I had the pleasure this week of being at the Discover Financial Services you know discovers gonna sponsor the Orange Bowl party and your commercial was the hill of the show oh yeah herb Street what address is that Peggy was killing me right I was getting overcrowded Peggy Romanian isn't it what yeah but the accent I'll get to that that's our guy David ash here there's a handoff and a battle for the first down so there is the there's the first down for Cody Johnson this is uh this is kind of interesting because your folks who have seen the commercial you've seen Lou Holtz and now Herbies commercial is out there they're calling up they got trouble credit card and there's a guy on the other end who hassles and won't let him catch the name of Peggy well Peggy is a romanian but he's an algebra teacher I thought that he was an actor but those phone are discovered real algebra T's a real algebra teacher I'm not kidding my friend it's a good commercial yeah they all want it good ok that's important first down and 10 what about keeps it ash this time and each out to the 35 yard line except about 5 yards on the play it's like Tom warp maybe down and Travis Lewis both both linebacker while that would be huge here herbie hang on with these two injuries look at this you can see wearing the number 12 weeks now that's Travis Lewis in honor of the memory of Austin boxes it box his best friend probably on a team was Tom work who's also down number 21 and so they will honor him all season long someone will wear the number 12 and when they break the huddle they go 12 and that's an honor of a young man who died tragically during the the off season and right now down on the field when you see bull court and Lewis down one play you're talking about two marquee players it's good to see you got both players up it looks like Lewis looks like he's okay Tom Warrick he's getting help yeah he's getting some help off to the leg injury Tom what's a young man who was born in England played some soccer before he moved to the United States with the high school then north of San Antonio New Braunfels Texas and he has been a good'n you know the Travis Lewis coming back in the game you and I had done in Tallahassee was it just big to have Travis Lewis out there because he's a playmaker it was big because it freed up Tom wart and the rest of the defense to just be able to play Lewis takes on such responsibility of being that extension from Brent Venables out to the rest of the defense freed up Tom Warrick he could make a lot of players I think they were looking at the right leg there's my season because he missed those games Herbie a few games down the road he'll become the leading tackler again found out he's moving in on Brian Bosworth for total tackles with the Sooners he'll soon pass him he has that that he had that broken bone in his in his big toe and I said you know even when he came back he hasn't been able to to practice he was a very fine high school running back and Texas did not think that they can convert into linebacker and Oklahoma did and they were able to convince it and that's one of the reasons why he went to Norman and not to Austin you can see how frustrated he was he had to sit out a play and he said hey I want to go back out on the field yeah exactly we'll keep an eye on Tom Ward 4810 and he wants to keep playing good run here now this is a young man we want to talk about Malcom Brown I asked the Sooners this week if they had recruited Malcolm ground and they did in fact they offered him a scholarship after his sophomore year in fact the Sooners offered five big time running backs out of Texas scholarships and the one they got was Brandon Williams now we haven't seen him yet because they are so deep at that running back position but he has a great great upside the Sooners knew they were going to get at least one of them and they got Williams and Brown wound up declaring for Austin so not only these two teams battle here in October they battle for recruits all season long nice throat is Shipley what a beautiful pass that that's Ash's best pass of the day right there and it's kind of what I think eventually you're gonna see this offense become moving him away from the pressure he's comfortable we're all rolling out and throwing the football and he's got a receiver and Shipley that I think as time goes on you'll see them build quite a relationship between the athletic strong on David Ash and the quickness of drum of Jackson Shipley herby I think you're exactly right pocket right and left now come around by the way is back and as the tailback here is the freshman heavy going basically alone there for a couple of yards you're talking about how they these two teams battle each other in recruiting I found it interesting when when they told us this week that was it's a neutral site I always wonder it happens it how do you host high school players in a game like this do they both get to bring players to this game and it's just the home team so this year Texas and Mac Brown and the home team so they have a chance to invite players say the same thing way they would do it if the game were played in Austin but Oklahoma does not have that chance being the away team middles open got it on the slant beautiful throw again Jackson Shipley Jordans younger brother and see this is what people don't realize is that David Nash can throw the football I mean if this guy has a strong arm because early in his career so far he's kind of been that changeup early this year is the option guy make no mistake between heating cases the point he probably has the stronger lung fumbles of snap falls right back on it we were talking about David Ash do you know who his sports hero is David Ash how crazy is that Colt McCoy I said okay that's his hero and now he's come on Corey is a great gun man to look up to I'm sure he's probably watching this too you don't suppose that he and Sam Bradford had a bet on this game I don't know these guys wouldn't do that no both doing a great job up in the NFL so Sam has headed out the dinner with his stick it down years Ashe in trouble take it down at the 34 by Tony Jefferson there comes that speed to play safety they move him up to that wool linebacker spot and he's coming and David Ash will learn to appreciate this the more he faces Oklahoma the closing speed it's been on display the entire day and he's got a lot of confidence in his own athletic ability to get outside and break contain the only problem is you forget that Tony Jefferson isn't going to come in from behind you catch up to you and sack you for a big loss third down and forever after that 15yard loss by the way JD Byrd has moved in at linebacker replaced work ash going down football puts it down again bossy Whitaker bounces on it at the 45 after Whannell Lewis punched it away from the freshman quarterback said another example Brent of not just having the field yet is it being a quarterback Fozzy Whittaker tries to match up oneonone with RJ Washington that's what forced Ashe to step up Washington's initial contact but I'll tell you what rondell Lewis on one side and whether it's Frank Alexander or RJ Washington or David King and Oklahoma has four big time defensive ends and this defense has not given up a touchdown in this game Texas only score came on a kickoff return Royals is back deep signals fair catch at the 7 yard line and that's where Jones will put it in play one two Z's his fault Tim Allen returns to the ABC a new comedy about a man's man living in a house full of women Tim Allen lastmanstanding series premiere Tuesday October 11th 8:00 7:00 central on ABC hey did you get a chance I know you were physican ready for a game did you get a chance to watch Game five last night between the st. Louis Cardinals filled up is good a picture though I'm gonna come clean I'm an old school national a guy means I like pitching I love watching matchups like holiday and carpet I know everybody likes home runs today I like that kind of matchup series is on the line Game five two of the best arms in the game going back and forth that was awesome good friends yeah that was a cool by Toronto spectacular first downs throws to the sideline to Devon Miller his first catch of the game so now they get to Juan Miller the senior from new jersey into the stats well what the hell I'm just interested that they're backed up deep inside their own 10yard line and up what what is it forty eight to ten yeah he's gonna keep firing away you like to hit the well pitch games oh it was a great pitcher's duel Cardinals winning it one did nothing but Holliday and Furcal what a pickup he was from the Dodgers to play short stuff that one play he makes life night comes a fire he must have a strong long as any shortstop in the majors right now speaking of arms our man Landry Jones has had a pretty good day today threw for more than 300 in the first half alone as he comes back to Broyles and now he's at 344 can he hit four oops won't call him off not at all third down and short Broyles again I think I think Oklahoma is frustrated they may not want to admit it I think they're frustrated if they have continued to win and Alabama and LSU continue to get all the credit I think they're out here trying to send a message to people and they're not going to let up third and four course you made the key point and there is no big 12 championship game this year remember that the last games gonna be bedlam and Stillwater and Oklahoma State there's another great offense pump fake Lambert Jones going deep and there's interference that was clearly there was no doubt about Picaro reaching over on the wide receiver but in fairness to McCarl he mighta saved six Broyles has had some success hitting this crease right here and it yeah I mean the boat looks like it may have been a little bit overthrown but thing I love is to watch Landry Jones operate this offense bring your footwork and technique what's a little pump fake watch how he's able to reset his feet get back and that's why he's so accurate it's as much about his feet as it is his arm now coach Gundy said Brandon Williams would get a shot and here he is so here's their ballyhooed freshman he is behind Landry Jones now on first and 10 and number 23 gets his first call in this game as a powerful one out to the 46 yard line so a youngster we've been waiting to see and believe me if he gets to daylight he has breakout speed when we come to the end of the third quote for word watch a couple of young running backs come down the stretch you're a no you fan you're gonna want to beat it Williams so we'll continue after this message and a word from our ABC stations in downtown Dallas not far from the Cotton Bowl where Oklahoma leads Texas 48 to 10 is we start the final quarter and freshmen Brandon Williams from Brookshire Texas motions out for Landry Jones wants to set the screen and throws it incomplete as he was under enormous pressure from Emanuel opto of the Acho brothers and his older brothers playing in the NFL Chacho comes right through the a gap between the center and the guard you can see both of them kind of looking at each other who's gonna pick him up the ghost missed him firing complete first down at the 44 yard line and Broyles hanging on again we already showed the good hands team and that is a great catch in traffic by Ryan Broyles and that's the thing about Broyles it's not just how many receptions it's how he gets him that fighter stream quickly to the outside and Royals out of bounds how about Ryan Broyles at 5:10 about 185 pounds going right over Carrington buying them towards the end of that play and that one went right through miller's hands i believe it was was impossible ball chingon and in every face every aspect I know the kickoff coverage teams giving up a few today but you have a veteran quarterback get your players great receivers great running backs and you score this much your kickoff team gets tired they're down and four now they have a chance to see that Kenan Robinson and man watch are both coming on the Blitz Texas backs out and working the sidelines as Jaz Reynolds that's right about the line again jazz has a great feel for the first down and he picks up another one most of his receptions today like all the one I think have gone for first downs in this game Landry Jones let's throw this one away that also is a mark of a good quarterback waits till he gets his receivers and that mark and then hits a thing a lot of us about Landry Jones that impress you I don't think they show up in the stats I just think watching him run this uptempo he's gonna be a load for any defense this year he's yet good looking quarterback the other thing is and he hasn't done it today but when he makes mistakes he doesn't dwell on it you know he bounces back from potential errors early in games we saw it last year when they played Oklahoma State second down and 10 that was deflected at the line of scrimmage so to bring up a third up when you go back to the day that he was forced into the lineup Sam Bradford right here on this field yep knocked out because of that injury and and it was tough going but you're right Landry did not hang his head that day not at all it's kept on play and we talked to the past at this Oklahoma offense always seems to have a quarterback with the similar attitude and approach to the game that Josh Heupel who's now the offensive coordinator the cooffensive coordinator and calling the plays the Sam Bradford had that you see it now with Landry Jones as well is that inside handoff on third down close Whaley was the ball the crowds knowing folks and you go and don't feel go here what did woody Haynes say when he was up on Michigan 15 and 14 why'd you go 42 and said because I couldn't go for three great like fourth down maybe gonna let it go down and call the timeout we're gonna talk down now they call the timeout jennipher aerial coverage provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven so here's your fourth down coming up 400 you Jones throws for incomplete Texas football Royals the target that time and well covered by the karo now for an update let's go to Robert floors Robert hey Brent update on number nineteen Illinois and Indiana Indiana out to attend nothing lead until the Illini come back Nathan she'll house AJ Jenkins and the Alliant are are on the board they are five and Oh for the first time since 1951 that season they started seven and oh they're down by three meantime Florida State trailing Wake Forest on espn3 calm but EJ Manuel is back at quarterback for the Seminoles and back a quarterback here David Ashe handed off I believe it is they have rotated case McCoy they had a shoe throughout the game Whitaker there is David he's out of Belton Texas 63 222 pounds and now positive Whitaker who scored their only touchdown on a 100yard kickoff return he's shaken up as he comes to the sideline DJ Monroe it is the running got something this time on that far side that nice pass to DJ Monroe's slipping out brent once they had trips meeting three receivers to the right David Ash and I Louis maybe maybe potentially cramping up here he's done so much work today but they motioned out Monroe they had four eventually four receivers out there is telegraphed Oklahoma was there's just TJ Monroe made of myths now as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary turnovers have been a huge story in this game a four for the horns have led to 24 points average yards per play here today for the horns only two point eight less than three yards of play meanwhile 367 passing yards for Landry Jones so it is all oh use way and I suppose that the only real negative here for Stoops although they did a lot of a kickoff return with it but I think the bigger factors injury to Tom war at the middle linebacker Malcolm Brown his in as the running back down and Aaron what's the what's the report on the field about linebacker Tom Ward working on in front and what did seem like they were working on was his lower right back they were stretching him out on the floor and trying to give him some aspirin to shake it off and he's actually been stretching it all the while he's been standing on here on the sidelines so it looks like lower right back all right so here's Monroe let's hope upon his feet that normally a good sign are beeping that was appear to be a leg injury either two threeman rush now ash throws in underneath swimming in the end zone boomer sooner and Alice today that's their third defensive touchdown of the afternoon well we talked about awareness awareness awareness you give up a little bit of a hit route you don't give up on the play and Fleming rips the ball out of there from Mike Davis to sophomore wide receiver has the presents to be able to pick the ball up in the air and then he's gone speed to the to the end zone in another lesson for Matt Brown and Brian Hart and this young Texas offense protect the football Michael hanukkah redshirt freshman from Richardson that was a 56yard defensive touchdown 55 to double nickel the 10 ESPN's College Football on ABC to buy sports and visa proud partner of the Heisman Trophy great view of the Texas State Fair do you like butter fried and get it here who came up with that as courtesy of the cheese at real fan camp not only that some people have told me it's pretty good I'm just passing it along take that on door Norman filled it at the 21yard line and that's where Texas will put it up like three defensive touchdowns here today by the Sooners first on a 55 yard interception return King on a 19 yard fumble return and now Fleming 56 yard fumble return you know there's an voters ap voters what do you do watching and listening pretty good when the defense can outscore the opposing offense they're up 21 to 10 and case McCoy will try it if there's Malcolm Brown let's check in down below over there thank Frank Burke you actually got a great point during the break there what happened to LaMichael James when the organ ducks came kind of out of hand well there's some injuries to talk about on Oklahoma's defense here David King dealing with his shoulder injury Ronelle Lewis is cramping up and we already talked about Tom Wharton talking with some people over here for the Sooners and they're saying Bob Stoops doesn't take guys out though when games out of a man he's going to keep pounded remember the festival second down it's a rallying call right Oh Brown agains from back by bird who has replaced the word is the middle backer you know I stand corrected I said they've outscored Texas is offense twenty one to ten they've in fact not given up a touchdown he only touched down to Texas has you said it earlier is on the kickoff return so I stand corrected and I did not mean that Oklahoma their defense has played so well not only had a scoring they've not given up one touchdown today they've heard you brag on that LSU Alabama they're saying hurry what hey look at this his third down from the quarry slips free on the move and find Shipley on a scramble play Shipley to the forty and it's a first down for the horn I think you and I agree print that these freshmen are eventually going to become players that will come back to Dallas and will be bragging about how great they're playing but this is just a reality of being a true freshman being asked to step out here in case McCoy's case a true sophomore he didn't even play much last year this is really the first year he's played much the same thing with Jackson Shipley and Malcolm Brown they're they're better days clearly ahead of them they're learning every single snap of what it takes to be successful play fake throw back to Brown here is that freshman twenty five they finally got him some daylight and I think you could show us see why Texans are so high on this on the show man now to Cibolo Texas six foot two hundred 217 true freshman so these young players I know that this games out of reach it's ugly it's embarrassing for Texas but it's about continuing to grow and mature and develop there's the roster 56 freshmen and sophomores here grows in underneath and that's davis mike davis for the first round so the offense trying to get its first touchdown of the game for Texas the Oklahoma defense trying to keep him out of that endzone they'd love to say that they didn't give up a single touchdown and the horns meanwhile I would like to build on something here in the fourth quarter Colt McCoy's brother case find it a Khmer empties the backfield now and back with the running game and it's going to be second down drill Bergeron a freshman from Mesquite another true freshman that's his first carry of the game too early welcome in Jo Jo's form of power back where Malcolm Brown reminds me actually a lot of severed Vincent kind of a slasher doesn't quite have that breakaway speed there's a high school senior named Jonathan bread out of Aledo Texas just outside of Fort Worth said they think next Gina can give him more than Shamal Charles fast which guy and go along with Malcolm Brown and Bergeron in that backfield next year McCoy I'll fake in trouble going down as soon as he brought up the right arm he saw Big O u defender all over it well they are confusing every time McCoy drops back to pass they're doing enough to create some confusion up front that time accordin have much of a chance at all and now here comes a third down seventysix accured on top of its worry touchdown almost intercepted threw it into the myths of RJ Washington a junior from Fort Worth he's a backup lineman so there are some backup players out there on the field RJ Washington this again a good job of just the awareness can't quite get to the quarterback you kind of sensing that he might be trying to throw that screen not just singing hit put the athletic ability to go up and he almost was able to intercept that there is you port down you get a timeout 643 to go so we'll take a break Oklahoma headed to a w there's a Texas family had to wear that hat he gonna be wearing for a little while longer I think fourth fires incomplete Oklahoma football that's gonna bring the curtain down on Landry Jones drew Allen has been warming up on the far side and Brent how bout the corner play today by Hurst on one side and Flemming on the other it has been outstanding and I know they're going up against some young receivers but they have played well Landry Jones pretty good effort today Brent 31 a 15300 267 yards three touchdowns no interceptions and a good argument to be in that debate about who's going to win the Heisman Trophy this year and believe me it is a debate Brandon Williams gets the handoff freshmen cuts back to the left tries to create no down at the 10yard line can he become coming up his 17th career a 300 yard game school record so here is the back of our vehicle and he's from San Antonio sixfive sophomore and the chance for him to get some reps trying to run this office one sitting practice looks over the coaches and came to our Bell tailed gonna give him giving a play and he reps her good reps for quarterbacks and that was almost pick six mark ro was closing in Landry Jones has done just about everything just again at Brett set it I agree it's not just the numbers it's the command in this offense the uptempo offense they're able to go up tempo and avoid mistakes because of the way he plays and because of the decisions that he's have he processes the information quickly he's kind of unflappable and it was on display again today for this o you team and did part of the success of their there and their effort indeed Allen throws it deep and incomplete and so that will bring about in Oklahoma punt you know it's been a very good year for Landry Whitney hand is a guard on the women's hoops team and yes folks that is a quarterback in yes he is proposing you'll see on that fence Mary Bay she did say yes okay more than 15 it is interesting Herbie and you referred to it to watch youngsters like Landry Jones mature and and I was thinking about the Texas quarterback situation with those two news words punt field at at at midfield by Shipley and moves down right away about the 47 yard line so we'll have more as the Sooners have taken dead aim at a national championship survey notice today so there is part of the crowd you can see a lot of burnt orange has already filed out into the Midway thinking about how this young team can grow up and you can get them next year fifty five to ten oh you had your hands off and so getting a pretty good look here at DJ Monroe now this conference the big 12 and they're covered I think is five unbeatens right now but Chuck so I'm down the field he's here today interim commissioner the SEC has welcomed Texas A&amp;M and they'll be gone by next season the missouri president authorized to explore conference affiliation and a big 12 has extended an invitation to TCU Joe Castiglione the athletic director at Oklahoma he is here and remember he was the former athletic director at Missouri so he's telling me that the fate of Missouri is definitely far from sealed in other words there is still a chance that they'll stay right here you know when you think of Columbia Missouri its midway between st. Louis and Kansas City and one of the great rivalries in all of sport whether it's football or basketball is that Missouri Kansas rivalry yeah sure would hate to see that disappear and if he looks like the Texas A&amp;M Texas game is gonna disappear and that is just a shame for football fans here in Texas but TCU is gonna step in to that point for the Longhorns and then we'll just go on there is simply out of bounds as he steps toward that first half that's it I'm hoping Missouri's just making some noise I really don't think they have a whole lot of options right now I think it'd be a mistake to leave even if they got into the SEC which it sounds like is what they're investigating big 12 right now you bring TCU in very competitive in baseball and everything except men's basketball they seem to be doing a good job with their athletic department Missouri stays in it's a natural rivalries big club this year enjoying a lot of depth six teams ranked going into this week at the top 25 laughing absolutely agree first out in ten from the 25 family that's incomplete let's incomplete well we've got three 30 games coming up after this let's check in with Robert Flores Robert what do you got for us that's right Fred coming up at 341 on ABC Iowa who has beaten Penn State eight of nine they will try again in Happy Valley taking on Joe Paterno or Miami taking on Virginia Tech Missouri taking on number 20 Kansas State top two games on ABC or ESPN that bottom game only on ABC Brett thank you very much Robert and Phil Schneider what can you say about him and the job he's done again with Kansas State on the move and they're showing some of the running ability that you talked about his actions he steps out about that is a big game in Manhattan today as far as the big 12 is concerned Missouri lost to Oklahoma obviously earlier this year in Norman but James Franklin starting to get in command of that offense taking over for Blaine Gabbert they're running the football well but I'm in Kansas State's been a great story we'll find out a big beat a beat Miami down in Miami they beat Robert Griffin and Baylor now they're back home going up against Missouri and Colin Klein their quarterback is a pretty tough leader running that option attack for Bill Snyder I wouldn't mind seeing Robert Griffin play season he's just such a good looking for running for his life that's what you're gonna do against this oh you front that was Lewis and he's been in there a lot here David Asher's a dominant athlete true freshman and in high school he didn't have any problem probably breaking contain and eventually making a play that's a defensive end Ronelle louis a former outside linebacker had made the move last year the defensive end has four or five speed if not better and he's gonna he's gonna chase you down that defensive front first and second team perot you stare this fellas are gonna be lining up on something no fuss no doubt about Halifax in the linebackers with war assuming he's healthy and Lewis and Tony Jefferson f117 ask fourth down and it comes ash trying to keep this alive on the move Davis first down so maybe the Horn offense and there's the penalty flag over on that side was out of bounds when he pushed him so that'll I had a few yards maybe this Texas offense will pull up a shqip display alive this time with his athletic ability and you know one of the things that you always want to see from from a young team and a team that's struggled it's just continue to fight and Davis is able to find it in the opening in that zone but it was really the effort there by Ashe to not give up on that play and eventually get that first down well don't turn it over they got four cracks at it yes she's gonna throw on first down wide open Shipley touchdown Texas their first offensive score of the game they had a kickoff return for a touchdown and now Brody Shipley's younger brothers scores their first offensive touchdown of this game that time to Monterey Hurst just looked lost in coverage I don't know if there was some kind of miscommunication or what happened there but he didn't even stick with Shipley just kind of let Shipley go to the fade and made it pretty easy for ash to just put the ball up into the end zone for a touchdown so Tucker adds the extra point and now get ready for the onside kick first and Fleming the corners had played well you see his eyes peeking in but you know I don't know if he underestimated maybe he thought knocked Shipley down he just kind of gave up on the play no I have to push that man there's no safety I guess you're allowed you're entitled to one mistake for a game well the NASCAR chase continues and it couldn't be any tighter they're rolling into Kansas the telecast presented by Dodge ESPN tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Eastern while you're watching the NFL switch on over during commercial and take a peek it could not get any tighter than it is right now Harvick and Edwards deadeven steward only nine back along with Kirk Bush and oh yeah there's a guy by the name of Jimmy Johnson only 13 out only 148 that 40 is pretty good it's color that's good man I gotta get you that NASCAR scene you know those guys are big football fans I know they're watching you I know they said what's with this right need to go I don't want I don't know I don't know we should think about you need to see it in person doctor you go one time in person you're hooked you're up Daytona next winner will go down it s fan upset with you let's go great we'll take down with us yeah George Tiller guys are taking a knee they decided not to go to the other side by the way I think they're excited to maybe just let this this clock go out yeah let's take a look at the Oklahoma schedule fans love seeing what's ahead for their favorite teams and herbie walk us through what you think about their schedule as Kansas still playing football since Mark Mangino laughs boy oh boy hey a train wreck right now Texas Tech of course that's in Norman the two games I thought might be a concern before the season started at Kansas State and at Baylor just because they're on the road and they're not traditional powers but then it's the big one of course at the end of the year at Oklahoma State that's the game I'm assuming will be there and that's the game that I think will decide the big 12 championship bedlam 1st down and 10 for the backup quarterback Andrew Allen mop up time this is Williams the freshman fumble and Texas's got it Texas can punch in another touchdown after Brandon Williams puts it on the deck see what happens with true freshmen play Mack Brown said hey hey hey Bob my whole team is Brandon Williams bigs big hit that time by Christians got the safety and there's a rare mistake by an Oklahoma Oklahoma defender and halfs another freshman or recovered it yeah Josh Turner jumped on top of it big hit by Christian Scott the senior that's Okies first turnover of the game came during mopup time so let's see what David ash can come up with here end zone incomplete no penalty flag and the receiver marques goodman with all that speed but he was not pulling away for that oklahoma secondary no no these these guys can fly and they're obviously locked in on what David Ash is trying to do I think that the game is out of reach it's 55 to 17 the game is over but Texas just trying to be able to do anything that they can again about building for next week they go back home they play Oklahoma State they're trying to find some things that maybe can work for them next week Bergeron in as a running back and so that quick flankers Green to Shipley and you know Shipley's doing as many things as his brother he looks a lot like him actually I think somewhere down on the field with game day before the show started before this game started in there I looked over at Shipley and in warmups and I thought he even looks bigger than his brother did I agree he doesn't look a little bit taller than that's impressive Jordan and for to be just a true freshman a freshman and to be competing in his game they list him at 61 about a hundred ninety pounds but they say he is probably the best practice player they have on the offensive side of the ball how many times do you ever hear that about a true freshman they're down and four incomplete pressure was coming Frank Alexander maybe I thought there was pressure but I didn't see the personal foul that I missed something here let's take a look at this I think he came in high did he come in high that was Alexander they move around this guy put him in the middle no question oh good call very good call he's a forest I was watching you know and that influence that ball could it kind of flew out yeah so that gives him a first down at 133 and oh by the way he is a starter and oh by the way he's still playing here there's a minute and a half to go hold yeah they've kept most of their starters out there well they're on full scholarship yeah as that long handoff the burger on this will bring up second dad down burger on they prodded put into the game he's more of a power back but if Fozzy Whittaker or Malcolm Brown or DJ Monroe don't have the football their hands they actually not we're on the football it's it's about speed let's check in now with Robert floors for an update Robert Trent Wake Forest is looking for their first three and OH conference start in school history but Florida State down they get a touchdown run from tae Joos to cut the lead to 32 to 24 they're still trailing Wake Forest's leading early fourth quarter meantime the Illini of Illinois spotted Indiana a 10point lead but they now lead 20 to 13 hey Britt hooked me up with a funnel cake and some of that fried butter on your way back thanks coming right at you Robert anything you want down here my friend will take care yeah I saw her be here's my question regarding Texas two quarterbacks is some people always say you got two quarterbacks you don't have any quarterbacks would you make a decision if you are Mack Brown on Ash McCoy going forward this season both fresh but not in your second one I think playing two quarterbacks is a dicey situation and fairness to these guys I think you need to see what they can do in games for one of them to separate themselves from the other but I always always get worried when you see a quarterback situation where there's a platoon that is back down incomplete mcfarland rolling in that time number 97 the junior from Lufkin Texas he's a starter Brunell Lewis out of Oklahoma a junior mcFarland Casey Walker Frank Alexander backed up by Stacy McGee Dorian Peterson David King RJ washes is a very very good defensive line and they have great depth that's the big difference is you could rotate guys and it's nice to see Jamarcus McFarland starting to make plays he came in with almost unrealistic expectations one of the top defensive recruits a couple years ago finally healthy and finally starting to make plays takes off and it'll be fourth down from just shy of the fiveyard line minute to go here remember if it got out three thirty games coming up right afterwards we're gonna do some hits on the field so herpes going down with game day and all McFarland's coming up now and I'll be watching you guys from Montana here we go now fourth down and five its rubble Oklahoma law run the clock out and go home with a 55 17 hold on we got a yellow flood the mantra Hurst looks like he's trying to state his case the flag came in right where he was in coverage flag came in late problem is the ball wasn't thrown and I mean unless it was holding defensive holding in her face masked so it'll be Sooners football and victory golden sombrero heads back to Norman and picked up the flag and waves it off in the sitter's as we've said throughout the whole broadcast take advantage of this stage send a mesh message maybe to some of the AAP voters 55 to 17 Texas gotta regroup in a hurry going back to Austin next week to take Brandon Weeden Justin Blackman in the the Oklahoma State Cowboys come come to Austin it's not gonna get much easier next week we talked a lot about Jana Carson the new offensive coordinator out of Boise let us not look past Josh Michael as a play caller for Oklahoma he's been doing an excellent job they absolutely enchained or veljko offensive coordinators picked the right Michaels calling the plays for Kevin Wilson and he's not hid not skipped a beat the way they're playing so Oklahoma definitely one of our contenders to go to New Orleans in the championship game they win at 5517 Bob Stoops with another big win and Texas will go back to Austin and regroup in time for Oklahoma State so thanks for watching ESPN on ABC coverage will continue after this message and a word from our ABC stations you
