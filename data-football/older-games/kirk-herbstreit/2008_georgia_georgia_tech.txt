============================================================

we the L exact gets out on their home field here in Atlanta Bobby Dodd Stadium gesture to the sellout it's a whiteout the students in the spirit on senior night the jackets come in 7 and 3 4 and 3 in the ACC chasing firstplace Miami and the Coastal the Hurricanes meant to before controlling their destiny two wins away from the division title but handling prosperity for this team that's won five in a row kind of a new challenge as we bring in Erin Andrews open to that topic Chris it was kind of funny you know listening to the nonchalant comments on Miami's sideline during warmup people were saying it's a good thing that Kane's team is so young because they don't understand the magnitude of this game yet so how big is tonight's game for the Canes program I had coaches I had players tell me tonight's game could be the biggest for Randy Shannon and his head coaching career at Miami this is a program changer I actually even had another player tell me if we win tonight watch out world the Kings are back nerves what nerves these guys are ready to go in fact some coaches we're telling me they didn't care the fact they were ranked for the first time in white oh stick they didn't care about the fact they have destiny in their hands what they care about is how cold is it going to be in Atlanta on Thursday night the booth but we got heaters it was a debacle his opening year in Miami inherited some problems had it was still discipline but it's been a spectacular season in a lot of different areas for Annie Shannon and no off the field problems of his team very strong academic performance and their bulb and a chance to win the conference championship it was so impressive about Randy Shan the job he's done he doesn't a lot of freshmen it's a very young team but they're very mature they weren't talking this week about being ranked for the first time in more than two years then we're talking about winning the Coastal Division the ACC title game in Tampa or ball games they are worried about Georgia Tech tonight and getting this win and the fact that Randy Shannon is consistent you know where he stands his quarterbacks Robert Marr Borchetta you don't slam it into guys in the warp up but here you saw Randy's demeanor and he knows he's got young guys fired up Marv wants to get a little angst in there but they don't get flabbergasted with the surroundings ending magnitude of the game they focus on their assignments speaking of assignments Paul Johnson preaches that course in his first year coming over after very successful six years at Navy won a couple of national championships in Georgia Southern what was then one double a people thought it'd take a long time for him to install the option and win here he has got about 70 guys on scholarship that's 15 under the limit for various reasons but the terrific season so far commercial collision here on senior night Scott Blair who kicks off and putz for the jackets the soft board the boot of the way Travis Benjamin his deep from Miami he was questionable tonight but he's got it at the goal line at the 17 so here comes Robert Mars the redshirt freshman out of Tampa ten interceptions to go with seven touchdown passes he throws pretty well on the run is a very effective runner at a key scramble and we could go against the Hokies his legs pies time and that's really a concern for this Georgia Tech defense tonight they got to make sure they contain him when he leaves jacory Harris will see duty but the fourth series of the game we'll see both young quarterbacks from Miami but Mars gets the start this is great Cooper sophomore back the pullback Hill Marvel gunforce Alex farside a low throw incomplete now Darius Johnson not able to come up with the catch the impact players who start with the tailback Miami seven and one this year when they run for over a hundred yards expect great Cooper to get a lot of touches tonight and not a good start for Al Darius Johnson sorry about that dude 27 receptions leaves a team you met come up with that play and on defense Anthony Reddick the senior safety steady guy back there will have to deal with that Yellowjackets option Jenkins get the football second attack it's duper as a pretty soon Craig Cooper dance to go to the secondary and across the 35 Gooper Taylor on the stop the yellowjacket slow to get up the linebacker Cedric Griffin 20 yard gain this place should have been stopped from the beginning you're gonna see the bottom of your screen true freshman Rashad read the corner coming on the Blitz he takes a terrible angle and that allows great Cooper to get out you talked about angle is one of the best teachers out that is Greg Schiano the D corner head coach at Rutgers he talks about the proper angles we watched him at practice Herbert Fowler when you sit there you see these guys if you take the wrong angle you're gonna run beyond the play they crossed him up they probably were expecting a pass right in a second insensate he's coming off the corner headed for the quarterback you mean all of a sudden has to adjust we're assuming then that Patrick Nix has established a rhythm here and a routine with this offense already am I saying that is the guy who courses back at Georgia Tech he called the plays for chan gala he was let go after this season and he knows many of these jackets players very well we'll take a quick break back in Atlanta we loved the pageantry the balloons and everything but that get caught on the wire that controls our skycam we can't use the camera to those balloons are removed so guess who gets that job Express oh man scaling the lights popper looks like you there's a job I do not want big group Mars we're treating in first sound clips of screen and Cooper breaks a tackle Craig Cooper lets it back for about c√©dric Griffin the linebacker for Georgia Tech taken off watch what happens Rashad read off the corner Jessie taken that bad angle will collide with the linebacker boom right on the leg in Griffin as their most consistent linebacker junior one of the veterans that's a big loss for Georgia Tech if he's not able to come back in this football game 51 those heading into this game you mentioned it not a lot of experience that lie about the concerns of Tech they need feel good sign that he's over there on the stationary bike on 2nd and 5 Cooper gets the call and for about three not only is Griffin the linebacker good and consistent at the running game but he's also the guy they used to bring pressure as though got some tweaking now the checks take care of him with a young football team that's a challenge well we talked to Dave Wommack the defensive coordinator for Georgia Tech and he said because of oftentimes they play these mythical packages they'd like to play an extra defensive back to make up for that lack of experience I wanna see where Patrick Nick's dials up on third and here's a here's a free safety back there coupe the tailor he had built he's coming up a lot the boxes its Greg Cooper to the left of mark in the shotgun he'll throw on 30 short and it's complete at midfield and to be a first down catch by a cylinder in the backup tight end Morgan Burnett the rover stop Patrick Nix the offensive coordinator has he had really established a plan for this offense Jesse they're still trying to figure out who they are well they are and it's a very young team a lot of inexperienced a wide receiver a lot of inexperience at quarterback we talked about that Knicks last week he said have to play books in right now is because he doesn't feel comfortable loaning this team up because they're so young that he likes his gadget place we'll see a couple of those tonight for sure nothing tricky about the handoff to Cooper Jackson the middle linebacker controls them after a two yard game in Miami and the Yellow Jackets youth a theme for both teams all the quarterbacks freshmen look at the percentage of the various yards gain of these categories what it meets but these are talented football players we've seen the defense last week against Virginia Tech they can play defense like the Canes used to play because now they need their offense to come along eight different freshmen who scored touchdowns most where's James on second date he's got it we set power back neck quite is complete as Craig Cooper James with a Christian on for now James's ease with a high ankle sprain just returning to help last week against the I think that's a good sign for Miami again the magic number 25 when coupon jams 25 turns when they don't buy these three and six so both of those running backs have to have their presence company the merry carrying the football goodnight three receivers to Mars less he gets instant pressure gets away Mars lets it go and it's broken up at the line of scrimmage Kyle Jackson the quick pressure and then Burnett may have gotten a hand on it you know if this is against tendencies for Georgia Tech this is the old John Tenuta style bring the Blitz this defense this season has been much more used to pressure the defensive line so that confused the blocking of Miami Robert Marv they're showing you the inexperience clock has to go off on third down you have to express impression command monster the sophomore and there's all the kicking and punching for Miami trying to pin the jackets deep it's a very short punt taking by Andrew Smith at the 15yard line 32 yards on the button and here comes Josh Nesbitt the sophomore still not 100% with that ankle he's been off injured this year hamstring and so on it came out of high school as a passing quarterback in the spread but he's a very effective runner they need him to stay healthy tonight Paul Johnson pregame watching this but his concern jesse is mentally can he handle it mentally out there not physically his biggest job in these games he told us was to get the team in the right place he has the choice when he comes the line of Spainish which direction will set the play he's got to do a great job of that tonight nesbitt on the reverse to close Demaryius Thomas to close it back across to Lucas and it's Johnson oppose a gadget play to start this game it's a wide receiver third of what they call the a back yeah watch this over here that a back on the left side watch Cox how he just kind of drifts in there bounces up a few folks that's great great patience they ran this play two weeks ago at UNC except Demaryius Thomas kept the football now you see the wrinkle you see the playbook and Paul Johnson opening up to Marius Thomas hissing that's because Lucas capsules will pop open Nesbitt he'll throw out near side made by Cory URLs of who should be to the 45yard line Chandler's grin on this time so the impact players for the Yellowjackets offense well Randy Shannon told us that 50% of the battle stopping the option offenses stopping the fullback that's easier said than done against Jonathan Dwyer leads the ACC and rush interesting tonight now DT Demaryius out there with his with his ability they're gonna throw the ball early on to see what Miami does up front in a defense already seen Morgan Burnett breaking up the pass on third down he has six interceptions tied with a buncha guys with the national lead second and three Garside complete the Thomas it breaks the tackle this is what he does if I asked him about throwing the football he kind of winked at me he goes he'll go see early on what's laid out all right so it is working Paul Johnson smart guys they're loosen up that fun for hit when they could pass and catch the defense offguard lot more effective I mean that's only a 48% passing as a flag comes in pick about two yards past protection this offensive line it's been a real problem that he would like to throw the ball more Johnson but that the guys up front haven't really been up to it we're on Sheree the referee and we see the first call we knew this was going to be an issue it's a chop block which means two guys are working on one defensive player via Skycam but you now have been working yeah you got to look over here left guard not the definition of a chop if the soil okay that's clearly the center is engaged with a nose tackle the left guard comes in Howard and cuts them that was preached by Randy Shannon all people who play against Georgia Tech send the tapes into the page he hates this card it's a real sore point but now Shannon his defensive coordinator Bill young just adamant that this is illegal yep bill young said I wonder if forever if his sons play the defense how often they throw the flag on 15yard penalty it's at first and 25 there's big man's pitch quiet it's nice box gets the corner bangs off a minute Juan's you could see why he leaves the HCC rushing and then he read it got pancakes about the corner watch when they get to the corner the blocky insideout receivers blocking inside on the outside and Dwyers got an easy way to get down the field you see why Jonathan door you just shits people when they try to make tackles he's got a lot of speed a lot of strength he's the total package were running back thirtyfive in first in 25 Joe Joseph McQuaid Hendrix combining on the stop our sonic rivalry recap that real old rivals Miami has never beaten Georgia Tech they've met at the ACC Tech winning the last three for some whole new regime here in Atlanta but Tech has been a nemesis for Miami early years of this conference second and ten Seleucus in the backfield Nesbitt on the reverse to Thomas again Thomas has the corner and gets down inside the 10 loses the football milk fumble no fumble instead at the 9 yard line so Thomas active picking up 14 of that running play this is all about the backside and you're gonna see on the backside watch the lack up just down the line blind dog in a meet house here no containment say what it's a blind dog in a meeting house they're looking for the meet you know Thomas said he he made a more decisive cut down field might have scored there another Georgia Tech game Demaryius Thomas involved in this game running the football while not just throwing a tune then even touches on the ground so forced it go right away it's like gonna be a meat potatoes plays to keep finding these defense honest those inside runs they haven't worked so far I think it makes sense right now very very offbalance here's an area of concern for Miami's defense being in the red zone twentyeight possessions this year they've given up 23 touchdowns they had been also in the red zone all year Bill Young has not been able to find the magic formula he glitz people a play coverage to mix up those fronts it has not worked yet and we're in here the truck 11th game of the season Nesbitt wit count keeps it muscles forward for about two and B third goal in the six to expand on your on your comment your question yes it's a setup op mention summation and is really right now working the eyes to that defensive line we've seen the reverse is now we've seen a lot of different looks and trying to make Miami's I think what's still talked about playing the style of offenses that forces everybody in defense to be mentally short so they try the middle of you times from first and goal at the nine and our stop so that red zone defense for the canes which been suggesting a problem rises up you know what I'm watching here is that I don't I'm not sure Nesbitt you shouldn't have pulled that football man if his ankle ride he depend around the corner challenging the perimeter good mind these deep in Salonika it though again Randy Shannon stole 50% of stopping this offense is stopping those dive plays from that be back but a pretty good job fighting on the inside run play so far see how reliable Scott Blair is from short range this just 21 yards and he knocks it straight through so the jackets on the board first 3nothing Midway first border for the price ESPN's college football primetime is presented by Applebee's it's a whole new neighborhood and Nisa passionate about performance and proud sponsor of the Heisman Trophy post game activity guys well let's just make a Jesse ball at home little Canadian over there the weather outside seeing the ice Skerritt there's he bets Paul Johnson he's talking to the offense there is no offensive coordinator by title for this team he calls all the plays always has take some guys nicked up their attenders reporting that Nesbitt was limping around Demaryius Thomas such a big part of that drive hip problems as well so to the health of the jackets offense to that successful drive Lacy's Benjamin he's head of tiptoeing into that first line of coverage guts for Georgia Tech he came in maybe favoring an ankle as well and limping Aaron to you all right Chris thanks so much you never know who you're running to on the sidelines here at Georgia Tech games we have t.i we have rappers Outkast and then maybe the biggest name right now freeagent wives in baseball Mark Teixeira joining me right now first of all what is the latest there's rumors everywhere Yankees Red Sox what is the latest the latest is gathering information you know it's a long process and it's going to it's going to take a few weeks but right now so it's kind of seeing what's out there and I'll make some decisions here in a few weeks where do you want to go mark oh I want to go where I can win and my family's happy and whether it's the East Coast that's where I'm from but I don't know I love playing in Anaheim too so we'll see what happens is there any one I mean when do you want to have this thing signed by with any team you know I don't want to put a timetable on it but Christmas morning I want to know where I'm gonna be for the next couple years hopefully by Christmas it'll be done in the meantime good to see you in Atlanta join the football game thanks for stopping without me sir all right guys they're working hard and they're trying to break is Jason Varitek all God in baseball guys down here I tell you what the sheriff's could get enough money that he could become a part of congressional talks with a bill that plan the seat bench have been limping off that's not good news for Miami he didn't look right from the very first kickoff of this game and he's the big playmaker on offense as well Cooper short game in middle Morgan Burnett severe Swift and reaggravated Benjamin's injury on that kickoff return but you were right Chris he didn't have a lot of a lot of power in those cuts and you can't have that on your team returning kicks you got to have a guy who's fearless back there Ben's have been only hurting his team if he's playing hurt returning kicks right now yeah you go it's a forty six forty but on an ankle like that if it's about 6:00 to 6:30 Marvin the shotgun on second six flips it to Cooper and Cooper asked was partially deflected court got to him Daryl Richard the excellent senior defensive tackle on the perimeter for the tackle he's very close to a first down but it'll be third short Morgan got a hand on that ball before it got to Cooper Patrick Hill the fullback weighs in at 260 furnace Cooper on the play clock just get it off and Cooper hesitate doesn't get back to the line of scrimmage so some uncertainty of the Miami line and the stop made by Brad Jefferson James have to punt boy you talk about penetration and defensive line watch the bush the hit right here at the blood a point of attack you look like Marv over there trying to manipulate the the blocking it didn't work and it's painful to have a three and out like that but to defense back on the field against ball Johnson's option foster barely got it away how is it not blocked doesn't travel very far the role takes it inside the 45 of Georgia Tech another look only 30 yards the caves very lucky that ball wasn't blocked by Tony Clark what is he doing said something about not driving through Texas without getting a shot of a bull oh good we should help him first want to get an empty chest Taco Bell's new fully loaded nachos loaded with toffee so there are no empty chips not air fully loaded nachos at a time when

points per game at about 11 hundreds of offense in primetime on ABC part of rivalry week presented by Samsung eight o'clock Eastern Time the only two teams in the country to score 35 points every game that is going to be a shootout I talk a lot more about that I think a partner mr. James might have a spot or two and a collision in Norman mrs. Dwyer in motion as the drop straight back on first and thought about going downfield now he'll be sacked Marcus Robinson the guy who had three sacks a week ago against the Hokies the true freshman got there josh is gonna wish he had that play back he had to marry his Thomas and running down the field wasn't wide open but he had beaten the safe he was running clear down the middle of the football field that's a throw that Josh Nesbitt has to be comfortable letting loose I go back to what Paul Johnson was looking for in pregame what he talked about yesterday is that he's concerned that Nesbitt mentally is not ready to play physically he can get with it but he's not making that like the before you're talking up there he needs to let that thing go he's missile out of practice hasn't he that's been a problem this is rowdy Joe in the corner and spitting daddy thirty it's not all about Jonathan Dwyer the be back this is the a bag ready June's 429 this young man you'll seem come left to right and this motion what is happening here is it's giving your blockers the angles that they're looking for on the perimeter look at this Ronnie Jones former baseball guy gets with baseball guys on the sidelines he's into it and I think you have to have a mindset defensively when you play a spread option offense you're gonna give up five ten fifteen yard runs but you cannot get by twenty thirty forty fifty yard runs there's already been two long runs in his first quarter Luke keeps it just to squeeze about a yard and a half first down Steven Wesley on the stop you could already see how little fun it is to play defensive line against this offense you see blockers just dive in at the knees and commence illegal stuff as long as he doesn't have another got blocked yep top in that one just so much pressure on me because as the game goes on you're not necessarily looking in the backfield anymore to find the football you're worried about offensive lineman an offensive player's diving at your legs it takes your focus away you have to have 100% mental focus each and every stop because you have to play perfect assignment football when you play against Watson on second and nine Nesbit's throwing to the far side Thomas and has to make a man miss he's a big strong guy 230 pounds 63 a sophomore Bruce Johnson on the stop let me let me go back one play here Josh Nesbitt now look at the end men on the line of scrimmage he's going to come up the field the fullback needs to get the football here this again now is where he's not making good decisions you know you see that there Jessie to help the feel mentally is he there to back up the jackets offense tenyard roof a second bed Zack Fisher the freshmen who see bird call for the hold said of third and short going to be second 15 mr. Johnson does not agree but to get his gas even that shot block early in the game for the choppedoff were you calling on them to once and the pitch to Jones this time the Kings string it out you know all the Miami fans say way to sing it the options never given Miami defences trouble Randy Shannon was difference in war data we smothered Nebraska in the Rose Bowl win the national championship over the years we've held the Sooners and the Huskers in check why is this option different because I believe you have the ability to throw the ball you've got those two half backs that are playing in the wings slot so they're closer to the line of scrimmage so that's the threatened throw down the field then you put them in motion and you get the angles on the block and just play them against the defense that's very young very inexperienced that only has one week to prepare this is a challenge for this off they might even run it on third and 12 Brampton dropped in the backfield coming off the edge with Sean spending to the end a nice time of the Canes first you mentioned earlier Georgia Tech and Paul Johnson want to throw the football but they've had a lot of problems with blocking one in every eight pass attempts Josh Nesbitt and Georgia Tech quarterbacks are getting sacked that's a great job of Sean Spence the two freshmen coming off the edge but boy oh boy that protection has been bad this year for Georgia Tech and that loss pushes them out of field goal range Scott Blair not that reliable so after the first quarter jackets lead by a field goal and look at a punt Miami deep Saturday Michigan State Penn State 3:30 Eastern on ABC it took me start of the second quarter here in Atlanta Yellow Jackets up three not thinking about to punt this is Scott Blair into the end zone it's a very proud week for Georgia Tech because the space shuttle endeavour launched last Friday and of the seven in the crew three are Georgia Tech graduates that pilot Colonel Eric BOE Bennett Colonel Robert askew Pro sauce Sandra Magnus their flight engineer shuttle took up flight number 126 they only have nine more to go before the Space Shuttle is retired and it's circled right over downtown Atlanta at 6:15 the space tuition there's pretty good stuff right overhead here that is really cool and they are very excited to have three graduates from Georgia Tech involved in space for of excellent aerospace engineering program here for tech it's a first down throw from our what's down field high throw over the head of Sam shields he got hit as he threw in a flag is down by the way this this is a guy that just so close so close to making the cut the space shuttle launch but just missed out it's because he wouldn't stop dancing once he got inside you know you're floating around in there you need your space and this guy is just a lot of time on the simulator made it look too much maybe a little too much oxygen met enough now you see that the penalty against Miami backing the Canes up had been so penaltyfree last week Shannon just harping on this drilling his team in practice after the Virginia game when they had 12 Flags only won against the Hokies first place at the left tackle over here and it's Jason Fox and it's clearly a 15yard penalty can't do it even at the offensive end grabbin which Lily helps out Georgia Tech after that bad without the Jabbar's James who's wrestled down Tony Clark there among others fortyfive yards in the uptick quarter tech had 125 twice inside the Canes 30 but only three points to show for it's really really critical for Georgia Tech's defense tonight Georgia Tech demons been so good against the past is here their 10th in the nation but they have 15 picks and they can force these young quarterbacks of Miami to throw the football good things will happen for Georgia Thalia there's that big defensive line watch the bush that the defensive line gets for most the time five this man there's a throw to change he's pushed out at the 27 by Tony Clark in the set of the third and short there's a lot of difference between this defense and Johnson noodles from last year to noodle F what's a Notre Dame this D bit slasher used to come all the time with blitz twin splits now with that great defensive line you're talking about Jessie they could be much more playing in the back to be more multiple they can run different coverages that can run different pressures but they think that plays into their hands again tonight because of the inexperience of quarterback to Miami it's going to be hard for out of more than just for Harris to get a read on what Georgia Tech is doing because of that great I knew this Mexico may want the coordinator years in Arkansas Southern Miss South Carolina on the resume his guys can do on third and three Marth has time intercepted picked off heading for the end zone is Michael Johnson and that's why the NFL scouts love number 93 the sixfootseven senior not even a fire zone but you're going to see Johnson on the left side he'll first come into the block and then just backs out this because he can't get to the quarterback he's got those long arms you see a man with a shirt and get the operative line in the office we can stay on his feet and jump up and make that play what an ass he's the leading sacrament offense in line that's his first interception takes it back 26 yards you guys called it this is a very Paul hungry defense Marrs been an interception thrown and find themselves in a 10zip hole on the road Michael Johnson's interception that's their feed mate is he feeding it to me tend nothing Johnson you can see his Marv gets a chat with Patrick Nick's the offensive coordinator Johnson's defense getting in the end zone Michael Johnson you can see why they they like him so much 5% body fat 67 kattiline power rusher and they try the offside kick and it doesn't work Miami recovers it an instant momentum so they tried to fool the Canes but Tyler Robinson makes the recovery an excellent field position for Chuck Lorre Harris they'll make a quarterback change here this is part of the plan but what about this gamble it's a big gamble here obviously though Jesse they're trying to catch the ball the kicking unit is supposed to catch it in the air it does get beyond 10 yards but they were not watching it the kick team didn't see the ball I don't like that call you just get a huge momentum shift on an interception for a touchdown your defense is holding them kick the ball the Miami had had awful field position its first three possessions now set up at the 34 here is jacory eres the truth freshman from Miami this is part of the plan analyst comes in about the fourth series James breaks a couple tackles and Jabbar's James cranks forward for nine yards they don't pull bar because of the pick this is all part of the plan Harris we're good for a company series and then go figure out who has the hot hand who was the better look at the eye that night support Harris really has played better on the road his best games this year come on the world particularly in the sense to see more of the poor he has used the hero and that rally at Virginia driving the cage down the field 95 yards for a time touchdown of the getting overtime he's the guy off the bench every game hours ahead and get physical up front and move the pile to the 21 this touchdown again what's more impressive to me about this he catches this ball that's a bullet thrown from seven yards away Michael Johnson plucks it out of the air with his hands there are a lot of wide receivers that'll drop that ball and again going back to that flight that Georgia Tech kicked in for the judge back and then the penalty against Miami that backed him up that put the pressure on the office not to make a mistake rare talent the very common man there's 500 Mike there Johnson's on Facebook 72 in the Atlanta phonebook you know formation Harris keeps it flips it downfield intercepted again wishes was shot lead tooth Weston picking off to fester let's make the right breed but we here Jessie when you watch this round here it'll work his way back and fight LaRon bored he's a true freshman look at him sit there waiting on the football we'll have to attack the football and protect your quarterback particularly when you're running out breaking rounds got some good comeback Ron when he gets to the top to swim but he's got to put his foot in the ground and attack the sideline to protect jacory hairs he did not do that there interceptions continue to be a problem for this Miami offense two of them within a minute 20 so the Jenkins at they're 15 and flier muscles free here's Jonathan Dwyer with the stiff arm push seven islands after a 12year SportsCenter right now all right press the Phillies hopes of repeating his world champion just a little bit tougher Chase Utley's going to have hip surgery potentially he could be out the June more details coming up on SportsCenter with that score and of course you can always stay current with ESPN news and I'll keep the current on the NFL game the Bengals without Chad Ochocinco Johnson and Cinco Ocho scoreless against the Steelers Bengals 21 just once this year urban streets Bengals to continue to struggle on and off the field okay bitches it to him again and that time he's hit and drop I'm the line of scrimmage by shawnsmith right now old momentum is over clearly with Georgia tax while Patrick Nix has got to be thinking on in Miami sidelines what am I gonna do I've had a quarterback make a mistake on backtoback plays and he can't allow this defense to stay out there that long it's gonna wear them and had a change there with that one sidekick to get momentum cut in let's just open his awkward's can get it back quickly second the 12 jackets take a timeout early second quarter 10zip tech will be back hey Thomas beep a Nancy's phone Nancy doesn't have AT&amp;T so no bars here yeah we're not getting the

new AT&amp;T your world delivered world's busiest airport I feel here it's where all the fans you see them going to games on Friday whether it's an SEC or an ACC came here all dressed up and on Sunday mornings many of us were strangling back home you see him headed home took not the easiest place to travel Georgia Tech now nine different players with the pen see credible de Cain's had only come up with three picks and defense Nesbitt shield and across the 30 be third and short he got 6 yards and an offensive lineman is down on the field Nick Claytor a freshman boy they've been bagged up both regular starting tackles out tonight David Brown and Andrew gardener with injuries later forced into duty as the starting left tackle now he's down on the field you know what they're this offense it takes timing and you need reps to get consistent although we did ask Paul yesterday about it he said I've got some interchangeable parts where I can put guys up there but he doesn't have a lot of depth he told us that his five best linemen have not had a chance to play together once this year I think that explains a lot of the problems this team has had in protecting quarterbacks when they're passing but man oh man do not have that consistency up front that really hurts your office he's such a dove branch celery's he's a junior but a third stringer really at the beginning of the week and he's at 252 pounds right it's not a big tackle in efficient of a foot but Paul Johnson wants to recruit guys who could play defensive line that a more athletic and can move that's okay the problem with bringing in Brad sellers is and maybe a junior but he's a firstyear gone this off well here's the deal you got a 252 pounds left tackle man and you have a 254 pound right tackle in Austin better Austin barracks a guy that in this spring was playing the a back he was one of those wing backs yeah but because of necessity and guys going down had to move him to tackle that a normal converging wing back to left tackle Palmer how would you feel if you're playing quarters that's what I was gonna say you selling you don't want to back worried about the numbers upfront you're saying Craig it's no big deal the tackles are two suits I know he wants athletic rhyme that's it is a little light it's a pass blocking but you see how they do the cut blocking and they get in there they're not challenging those big guys up top they're cutting their legs out let's see if this makeshift offensive line can do their job on third and five Nesbitt it's great pressure fires in complain flying off the edge with quick pressure was the middle linebacker Glenn cook Nesbitt had to get rid of it and he's limping back to his sideline he's still not right and I totally get what Johnson's put Johnson's talking about with his quarterback because mentally I'm not sure that he could put that foot in the ground and grind it and power through it and make them throw balls in the ground and delivered the slot receiver in miners off at dorsey of the punt miss Scott Blair it's a short kick call you lets it bounce it heads out of bounds we'll simply hit one of the up man Miami will take over near the 40yard line the Nittany Lions of Penn State went away from clinching a spot in the Rose Bowl if they can beat the Spartans regional action 3:30 eastern time on ABC presented by Samsung mobile it's rivalry week the land grant trophy at stake but that's not really what the Lions are focused on trying to get their 800th win they controlled ggone in that football that's going to I've been

sitting here at number four licking their chops big game right here as well Utah may be clinched a spot in the BCS game they get that win their home against BYU there's marvel I must certainly come back into this game Paris getting a couple of series says the pattern to court yes I thought so far since he's been the game is played with even though that pick that wasn't his car this receiver had to help him out on that push down give to Cooper we've watched the ACC now week in and week out and have this defense now the defense's around here you know they come out they dominate the offenses and the offenses to get it going and if you got a ten nothing lead and you're at home and call John's now his strategy changes completely on yeah it's a little differently you're still watching another big 12 the pac10 some other conferences there's not a lot of spread offenses here by the methodical offense is a very conservative defenses for the most part that making marks the field Harris has time deliveries and Jackson behind me but again he got his hands on you see the Georgia Tech defensive lineman right here arguing yelling at each other because there was a mixup with the stunts up front the line of scrimmage Watts up top we'll see guys twisting bumping into each other moving around not able to get Johnson is Harris's high school teammate and it this guy they've connected on a lot that's two times tonight that Johnson's had the ball in his hands he's a good received at least the team in receptions he needs to come up for that for that play you see the play has not been so

expensive to them she came to need some help here in 39 Cooper to the right to Corey Harris every pressure Harris gets it away far side diving attempt by Johnson and they give him the catch in her first down at the 32 he dropped a couple easy ones did he make that tough catch if he did that was really what a great job of Val Darius Johnson who's had two drops they watch him drive and dive watch him work to the outside that's the second time jacory Harris has thrown a timing out route to his high school teammate of Darius Johnson very impressed with the catch but also with the boys and the confidence to review this they'll take a look did that fall hit the ground did he have control pretty displays on the review did his knee get down if he had control a couple questions on that catch you think I don't know it looks like the football does it come loose in his hands before it hits the ground did the ground help him procure the reception and as the knee did hit in bounds I think the issue is gonna be did he hold of the ball I don't think so whether or not control or not let's see here the other ones more conclusive I just don't think he had it Sean Reid getting a little shove in the back just as the ball got there I'll tell you what this is huge for Miami if they do not they overrule this all of a sudden they're forced to punt that's at least the second and third time and he's gone three and out and falling out yep that defense is going to get tired you're playing Georgia Tech and they'll run the ball the way they are your defense needs rest finally better hope this thing stays the way it is so they can stay on the field keep that defense wrestler in Johnson 27 caches they spread the ball around but he is the leading receiver coming in had a kitchen every game but one and again as part of that Miami northwestern high school powerhouse seven guys off that team last year with the Canes including Harris and Johnson well Erin Andrews reported in the pregame talking to the Randy Shannon and some of the players that they felt like this was the biggest game in Randy's young careers and hit football coach right most at stake for sure I'm sure looking at this very carefully Aaron and Chris when I talked to Randy Shannon he said hey some of the players are saying this is your biggest game as a head coach and he said come on and he goes this is a big game but next week is a bigger he's not buying into that the place is called okay you say so ma'am maybe they didn't see enough to overturn it if it had been called incomplete if what if it ruled incomplete on the replay so they do get the crucial conversion and the Canes set up now inside the 33 of check another look yes possession right now the question is that the gonna help inmates in possession that sponsor will take it it's real tough stuff at this game you're still shaking your head not attached to throw on first down looking downfield on the great shields makes the catch that makes a man miss and Sam shields dancing out at the ten in front of Mario Butler so that junior the veteran of this Corps makes the catch you see what I'm saying jacory harris is playing with great poise and great rhythm right here good to see Sam shields work the double move come back you don't see that very very often in offensive play books but when your quarterback is throwing in rhythm and do an area it's a great play you know what that means Jesse that means that defensive line that we've been bragging about those four guys are not putting pressure on Harris and he allows the time for that double move out shields guys had a tough year he's been in the doghouse he's tried to contribute on special teams the big one sets about first and goal and here goes Cooper lowering the head for a couple Morgan Burnett we didn't call his name all night the rover in on another tackle for the case you guys to get seven not today yeah I think so I mean this is an area where they've been good this year they've always come away with points 36 times in the redzone they've come away with points in 38 yards now get some of that momentum back on your sidewalk 23 touchdowns none of those 38 not a real high percentage but because matcha is so automatic on second ago before the snap no touchdown flag came out those false start penalties seven in one game two games ago gets four Jing that was Reggie Youngblood the rights act and in the next week they followed up because they had so much focus on it during practice they didn't have Benny against Virgil tail so that was a home run back on the road you're more prone to March pull your hair it was amazing every spread around is six different guys makes this red zone trip a whole lot they're pressured fires short complete that's muscles to the 6yard line first catch for Diedrich Epps jr. tied out you got to be smart about it off instantly next needs to dial something up with a chance to get to the end zone but he doesn't want to mess it up where they can't at least get courts on the scoreboard absolutely right again it's not been supported on you're wondering defensively coverage is a gimmick buster if you don't scream pressure is too comfortable enough in the sockets to know where he has to go with as Craig Cooper you set wide the bottom of the floor mission grievous eBrush to the left to Paris buyers middle and Pat it down and with some hesitation from the quarterback Michael Johnson in the neighborhood and here comes the field goal attempt Oh you would really when you study the film here you're gonna see that there's some blocking on the left side they're only going to bring four and there's nobody in the routes getting in front of the vision of Paris well you know what scares Paris is big Michael Johnson hair again he's got those claws he already took a pic back to the house trying to work a double move inside the paint Ferguson Michael Johnson spooked to Cory nice on that play mad posture thus often one of the steadiest pickers in the country he's now made 13 of his last 14 24 it's the Canes on the board 10 3 Georgia Tech hey have your tickets right what you ask well be the dr. pepper ACC football

scene of the SEC championship game and a couple of weeks at a filthy rocket the Gators and the Crimson Tide perhaps perhaps a de facto semi final game the beast yes yeah all teams can win out that's very short kickoff Randy Jones see way back Kalani Jones gets couple of blocks and barrels out across the 40 so good field position for Paul Johnson's offense Arthur Brown making the tackle NBA action on Friday a doubleheader starting with the Rockets and the Wizards at 7:00 Eastern Time followed by the Hornets and the funder NBA Friday also available on ESPN 360 calm yumminess see he got nicked up live again Rocket Center how do you find time to follow the NBA well you follow the rocket absolutely I grew up in using a little bit of look rocket flare there and buy her the fact that she even had time to check the standings wires got it Jonathan Dwyer breaking tackles throat echoes aside and headed for the endzone touchdown 58 yard man knows defense this is the best running back in the ECC in 2008 at the two longest run to the conference all year because of plays like that he's strong he breaks tackles him with this defense there's not much help back there this network of the safeties Scott Blair is Georgia Tech a 14point lead Dwyer already over a hundred yards I can answer your question where the safeties there are so many different assignments when you're playing against an option football team that many times have you watching it on film so do the three of us yesterday watching the Florida State game you have a great allamerican and roll back there who is sometimes out of it so when you look back here you see these safeties and that as a linebacker but you're going to see coming from the right side first of all poor tackling next about the safeties Chris you see them that they so focused on the backfield Jesse they never see really what they're trying to do with the football it just saw Randy Shannon yelling at his outside linebacker Romeo Davis Romeo Davis was in charge of the dive on that play inside this container o me o Romeo Romeo had a big game in the secondary to come up and make plays and tackles you got to go low on Dwyer he's strong goodlooking diesel they call him huh boy he is he just throws tacklers aside and at 2:28 he can move came to Georgia Tech was recruited by Paul Johnson to go to Navy but said his eyes lit up when he found out Paul Johnson was coming back to Georgia Tech all the you can see career rushing touchdowns in the ACC Dwyer just a sophomore but he's on the chart records of these six around here 450 goodness kick is taken at the one by Brandon Harris and he's cut down at the 24 canes back to work down by 14 now as we check back with rece Davis she has just a real quick peek over on ESPN 2 the 2k sports of classic benefiting Coaches vs cancer Duke and southern Illinois the Blue Devils right now working on a double figure lead nice night for Jon Scheyer who's into double figures winner gets a winner of UCLA and Michigan all right thank you there's a lot of excitement around Miami about the basketball team preseason top 20 picks I can either call the conference I can only follow the Rockets Miami basketball too I wouldn't ask you to go for a thief I just make a little segue back to the football game Gary its Marv back in the quarry Harris had his chief series and now mark tries to make something happen his legs that he'll lose a couple sample Owen the church street linebacker but they rotate a lotta guys in there Robert Marv did a great job last week against Virginia Tech with these the legs ran for 44 yards in that game was able to heard that deep that he's gonna have a very tough time tonight though because of how I took this Georgia Tech see Randy Shannon working over this is the part of him that I really admired he has his hands in the Opera put fingers he's talking again to room here Davis but it's the Kanes offense it needs to do something one second down delivers a complete Epps was wellcovered Tony Clark's been active there's not a lot there I took I've been saying now we watched him last Thursday night Virginia Tech I haven't bought into this offense yet that to me someone missing link Robert Marva watched him in the spring and he was an accurate 240 Harris accurate it's there but it's not why's to point yes he's played the last few possessions why isn't he out there why would you just stuck with him you may stick him if these continued for miami on third down Mar trying to get the conversion pocket breaks down Marv the line Flyers downfield into traffic Kitsch made a dangerous grow their own Collier didn't get the first down but there were maybe a lucky to avoid another interception man outstanding effort here I'm Tom say this is a wide receiver working for his quarterback bottom line Miami's punting again watch him get knocked down Jesse Collier when he gets knocked down he gets back up woods first quarterback for just getting there late was Morgan Burnett but it is Matt Basha on the pike boom Andrew Smith driven back to the 15 and we'll be corralled at the 25 so a 10year return after a 53yard punt darrell Sharpton making the tank of a Miami's defense pretty much has to do something right here the way the offense is put in you can't afford to fall in a deeper hole you know and Georgia Tech has had success dashing this minor defense today and that was a big question with Paul Johnson got here bring him in the spread offeene attack you can't have enough big plays in this offense well Johnson's been able to put those doubters to rest they have 50 plays of over 20 yards coming into this game five plays of over 66 yards heading in we've already seen a couple long ones tonight inside a four and a half before halftime miss Nesbit tries to add to this 14point lead that still keeps it Nesbitt galloping into the secondary Josh Nesbitt down to the 20 Romeo Davis got blocked he chased down the quarterback this plan on guts and a get the ankle on another huge run by this jackets offense now first of all look out at your left tackle here clay chill remember the head to carry mop while ago watch the block at the point of attack body positioning outstanding job body on body Josh Nesbitt just betting it out in a bad angle earlier in the year Nesbitt land for 151 yards against Virginia Tech it was the most enjoyed second back could ever run for in a game so these got the legs to be successful in this bill 54 yards in a bad wheel they have 208 rushing yards in this game Dwyer around after a yard line Glen cook and Rubio Davis as we check back in with Reese all right Chris coming up on the Pontiac performance halftime report another week another big 12 showdown will tell you what the keys will be broke Lahoma and Texas Tech and the most Ludacris dr. lue episode ever and will also decide whether coaches in Waiting good idea or bad idea mark and Luke will join me we'll see you guys just a bit all right rich Ludacris and dr. Luke in the same sense Lucas from Atlanta so is TI right he's on the sidelines why're spinning inside the ten Burstyn gold Georgia Tech watch the run by Nesbitt he almost get to the end zone before Davis can grab him and is this by the hand warmer is that what he's grabbing what makes you think to grab on what if it breaks away what if it's a tearaway hand warmer what the heck was he thinking that's a tenyard track that's like a dogsled by the first and go wire five again there's room here gave us a more conventional smack talk you know you're talking about this offense the big play offense here of Georgia Tech the fact that they do it on the ground it's misleading that this is a team that explodes they have big plays and defenses he's kind of lull him to sleep up early in the game Jesse remember we saw the passing by Georgia Tech that surprised everybody had softened him up and it's allowed some gases inside 223 yards on the ground right now for Georgia Tech long the football ball almost stopped their season there's four game second goal wire powers hand pushing toward the goal line touchdown Joe Joseph is a 300pounder but he could not keep a hold of John Dwyer Romeo Davis and that defense he had taken to the woodshed right now by the jackets option running game why here's a load he's slow to get off the field his Blair sighs to make it a 21point lead you might be given here feel good about themselves confident they have a lot of work to do because the jackets are going to get the ball to start the second half and there's big guys wire early in the game georgia tech even rolled the dice and they had the onside kick over came that this offense and the power inside you're not seeing defensive linemen make plays remaining last week they did absolutely right Johnathan's water now is run for $128 million Shannon told us when you play this style of offense you have to talk the way the fullback on the dog runs and this was the big run Jonathan Dwyer hot outside aside from that though good look it's just been inside and you see the power to see the ability to get Milton space and there's the breakaway speed and go back to this point this group of football players that we recruited to come here for completely different objects and so imagine what Paul Johnson's going to have with these guys after another spring and working with them with this option often I think it's a good point how much better will they be in the offensive line is a more talented and better versed in this option attack and when the PlayBook can expand talked about those days at Navy when they could run more things because everybody 28 is a misconception this is a methodical ball control office it's not they then she had the ball less than their opponents on average they strike pretty quickly because it visit the big runs they generated mrs. Harris gotta make a plan and stop at the 32 the Keynes a minute 52 to work with before halftime as we check the Applebee's weekend menu dominated force by that showdown in Norman and the game we talked about in Happy Valley a different feel for Michigan Ohio State we never had a three touchdown underdog in that robbery showdown for Utah tech BYU and that game a dangerous dangerous spoiler yeah they're tied in and is a great player pita yeah he's he's nicked up a little bit of an austin call it's a the game I'm really interested in is though watching the Ivy League I went to Colin Fowler he got he got the four way potential to barb is dropped storming in is Ellis nube so that defense happened our way as we check back with Reese for quick NFL update all right Chris Bengals and the Steelers are playing as mentioned Bengals 1 8 and 1 they're tied at 7 right now early second quarter Ben Roethlisberger's thrown a touchdown pass to an HCC alum each pillar of Virginia there's tied up in the second buzz Becket's enjoy this one on senior night Kane's going backwards second and 20 and the clock ticking down and just take off he's dropped by Michael Johnson long arms and that six foot seven frame air in the injury started to pile up on both sides you're looking at his left knee trainers are coming over and talking to him just getting the thumbs up right now but guys for Georgia Tech's defense Dominique grease and Cedric Griffin they are out tonight with left knee injuries thank you Miss Andrews here rocky there's a penalty by the way Michael Johnson is going to be flagged after the sack the deadball there's no foul on the play okay take it back they did throw a flag we thought maybe flagging Johnson for celebration you doing that whole feed me thing you see in the hip hop I'm not sure Paul Johnson had that feed me attitude Dilip maybe he's about down there talking right now I'm trying to figure out what that means exactly but officials nothing to beat district talking with Paul though he's cracking up he goes you know I never really know if these guys are with me or not he goes when I first started coaching he said I knew I could look at a player I could say he's glassyeyed you know and I knew if my team was ready to go nowadays because I have no idea whether these guys was a he just says I had changed yeah headphones music feed me and they're listening tonight I think they're pretty dialed into the program offensively and defensively this is a great performance for Georgia Tech they said hey we're not spoilers they can't control their destiny but if they were at the last couple they got a shot there in there Virginia Virginia Tech Carolina as well you can tell the wires concerned about his zone mrs. Marsh fires into traffic and Johnson makes the catch but or instead of a minutes ago we stopped some not much urgency for the Cain's just let things run down and now fake Johnson's and much ill mood to spend its time out either we got just a moment I tell us about this Ivy League dahlias read your column yeah so there's a four way potential time at the Ivy yeah we were it was interesting it up you to write about it I got to fill space in the column what's interesting is it could be a fourway tie for the championship if Harvard beat Yale III or something isn't enough to keep track of the ACC you read what the Ivy League just following you there catch at the 39 by Smith for halftime 35yard punt and Jessie seems to be in the mood to reference hip hop and hip hop videos and we're gonna have Ludacris at halftime with dr. Liu and talked about ti land and made it down there Cass was here the other year on the sidelines as well this is a hiphop Club obviously we get different cultural references with Jessie than with Flutie if you notice the difference in here in Washington last year you are naming tela bay B's now last year Flutie was referencing like 70s movies really different jackets we'll just taking me what a first half go get the ball to start the second half Jonathan Dwyer just overpowering this Miami defense and the Canes offense is smothered 24 free board the jackets Erin Andrews talking to Randy Shannon has not been the start that he wanted and for his biggest game ever Georgia Tech over 200 yards rushing often well we got to go back in no we got to play this einman football we had a couple of bus missed tackles up in the middle and I think that's the biggest thing we got to come make out an attack on the second half how do you even get your offense going at this point well we've been moving the ball was this ain't converting on third downs and moving the ball up and down the field well we get the situation we get third down and three throw down and form we just can't convert so we got to go back and start converting on third down alright Randy thank you I don't know how helpless it is but they they are to parade on third down hedges under 36 yards offense at halftime what D for three Yellowjackets lead at the break as we joined rece Davis who old spark may the pontiac performance halftime report bitch wire gets nice blocks gets the dog these guys can do on third and three mod has time intercepted picked off and that's why the NFL scouts love number 93 formation Harris kitchen flips it down breaking tackles throw attackers aside and hit a clean zone she put the dog on a touchdown first half here in Atlanta dominated by Georgia Tech's running game 228 yards on the ground and by the jackets defense a couple of interceptions Chris Ballard Brett James Jesse Palmer James rolled it over the fivegame winning streak in control of their destiny an ACC Coastal him had no control over this game tonight I'm a 10.5 yards per play for the jackets like that really when you consider the Miami's doing it at 4.40 that's that's parts of LA I know you got checked with a bunch of those big long runs 2935 5854 everybody thought paul johnson send out an explosive offense they said you know as the EDC Jonathan Dwyer 128 of those 228 couple touchdowns in the first half and we can make tech bart's the field control field position we got a good chance but they've had some long marches for touchdowns and Roddy Jones takes the second that kickoff out across the 25 as we check that Home Depot coaching adjustments well I think we don't three agree with this one here unless Miami comes up and starts tackling the ball carrier there is nothing that their football teams do offensively to get back in this game particularly on the inside they've got to wrap up and make better play coming into this football game from the linebacker position they have not been executing the fundamentals of tackling so far in this football game as a defense that against a very different kind of offense last week on Thursday night looked like the old canes just dominating Virginia Tech different style different results so far this is Lucas Cox is lined up in the be back but Nesbitt back to throw on first out pump fakes takes off at Josh Nesbitt for about eight dollars as we check down without a dress well Chris had a chance to speak with Paul Johnson coming out from the locker room he said he's happy with everything the one thing he's concerned about this seam right here Jonathan dryer he's on the bike right now because they want him to try to loosen up that left knee now before the team went in for the half I kind of tried to talk to Dwyer a bit he was telling his teammates he didn't hear a pop hit his knee he gave me the thumbs up and said he was good to go but the training staff for the Yellowjackets have told me that they just to make sure he's okay have the luxury of being cautious Aaron with the three touchdown lead the tenant back get seven that twopoint stance in this office I'm gonna ask you about that Craig is Nesbitt keeps it for a first down Deli oldschool right you see somebody tailbacks up with dirt there their feet on their hands on their knees and old school here Georgia Tech threepoint they're wanting to school by the shoes they lined up there he's got the clothes Monson upbeat come out of that stance to get down hill fast to the line of scrimmage now I contended one year with my New England Patriots running back coach that from a twopoint stance you could see the defense three snap green and I can still get to the line of scrimmage just as fast I think that's way too oldschool it reminds me the old electric football with all the running backs had their hand down of it grand you just don't see that a little bit Spence mrs. Jones on the pitch hammered or a short loss good job by Shawn Spence Steven Wesley the defensive end on the tackle kids got to get the ball back but they they can't afford to spend a lot of time on the field I guess the good news for Miami's defense right now is while they have to try to figure out the spread option attack they've only given up one touchdown in the second half game so historically here in the last few games Miami has been able to stiffen up defensively let's see if they can get a big stop here on this series the third quarter has been their best quarter all season as a crease in the lane Josh Nesbitt has a first down Jojo Nicklaus the safety makes the tackle but it was 11 yards downfield Ronnie Jones gets up on the line of scrimmage not his way back slot just a simple little tweak right there but that allows him body position on the safety and these success of the run yeah see this an early timeout by Shannon he said wait a minute I've seen enough for the two minutes and 16 seconds into the third quarter get up and over here that's a refresher course at least have a code to tell you what I have to he said look boys get on up here we're gonna have a cometojesus me there was that Lane and somebody did not in their sign spied on defense don't you like that about him just absolute Chris we've seen you quit on brandy a long time and the guy as iceo ultimate executive of this football program has control of why would you wait till the end of this series when maybe it costs you six or seven points burn the timeout get it corrected right now clip it in the bud get your guys back on the field start playing some dude now you may need those timeouts you think you had a free touch has but he he sees the urgency right here get this thing fixed they can't afford to get farther behind Nesbitt and of colliding with pops in there the match loin but still falls forward for four yards Marcus Robinson stopped him you know we talked about it earlier the mental stress that gets put on defenses when you play this type of offense someone's got to be in charge of the dive someone's got to take the quarterback you cannot take the play off mentally because what you do that's when you get down second and six poll Lucas rumbling into the secondary an absolute clinic an option football tonight that pressure you're talking about jesse is really clear to see watch the middle to sit in the two guards watch what happens to the linebacker here as the fall curing goes mine watch the number seventy and seventy seven Center comes out and he's on the legs of a linebacker did you notice another big miss tackle there in the second line linebackers missing tackles you see really shitty looking Jonah's got stay away keep with your keys they here stop before Becca that's five runs of twenty nine or more yards tonight five of the center Dan Voss 77 funny story Paul Johnson said before before the game he put on his body suit and he says Boston havilland have great bodies he didn't have a Jesse Palmer body the hole he said so he goes in there he puts the body suit on and he says a boss walks around in the locker and show it off and he said Johnson says so I put my body suited and then walked in the locker room next to him said and I look the color he plays better he looks that offensive lineman Nesbitt hid in the back of good penetration by Glenn cook and Nesbitt spinning ahead for a yard but she can stop a couple plays like that all you could look good as a defense and then boom the dirt play 250 yards downfield exactly what Craig was saying earlier this offense the common wall you to sweep a little bit they throw the dive actually the quarterback you see you think it's contained and all of a sudden BAM one guy to stop off the fourteenth run this you know what good should mimic what you got the opposite wall Johnson mine you know I look at this offense I look at Mike leaches offense with what he's doing right now if they both get it done firing for the end zone Thomas jump all off his fingertips bruce johnson in defending and you know the advantage that johnson has in recruiting is now he's gonna go out and get these great running backs get for good running backs maybe maybe one of them works maybe the other one doesn't they put him in be back or a back thomas is six three but that was just a little too tog catchable ball but i don't think he would've been in balance anyway so here comes Scott Blair for a 30yard field goal attempt Zach able to take the second half kickoff chew up at 4:45 and add three points to the lead seems together town the cans get the football back the mountain gets higher 27 3 driving two universes together will eventually rip them both apart we have come to challenge you in

on our playing field so keep watching us the University of Miami it's all about the you downtown Atlanta with the hometown Yellow Jackets have a twenty seven three lead over Miami sure to take a slight favorite despite Miami's ranking the Canes playing their first game as a ranked team and more than two years and it worked out well so far we should have known that Miami was going to struggle tonight when your ranks ahead of your opponent on Thursday night for the theme his six first downs for this canes offense they have any shot they really need to do something here when you think quickly also what do you think Frank Beamer's sitting in Blacksburg right now saying why didn't I get this my idea this office and the Georgia Tech kid can hold this lid it's going to really make things confusing will boots try to help you as best we can sort out the HCC race is this not going to be much clarity after tonight that's for sure Harris at the five it's the corner at the 33yard line lose the drive chart for the Canes pretty ugly couple of pics did get the field goal and then two punts see all these three and outs that's bad I think this right farright column could get the endzone you can't a sense they needed to get seven there because they weren't gonna get there very often right so Robert Marv offense neither quarterback has been very effective from I am eaten and it's Craig Cooper and takes it deep handoff Cooper not for a loss let's go to another storyline tonight besides the trouble stopping the run they've had no running game themselves defensive line now Georgia Tech starting to heat up put a little pressure on that offensive line and these two quarterbacks though for Miami there's I don't think Jessie they're seeing the game there right now it's just it's a train wreck out well it's for the middle of Patrick next told us about his young quarterbacks about how sometimes going into a game one of them won't have their head into it yeah he won't find out till it's too late here they are they're on the world hostile environment very good defense where did you guys get his head into it tonight bars pressure fires down field has Epps who makes the catch at the 36 so a good throw of the run and the tight end went up and got it you know what this kid is a player that they say that's the total package left side of your screen hooks up just on the middle stays active with the play takes off deep Johnson comes short nice execution and as an offense that's what you need right now you're down by a bunch of points the 30 yard at bonfires short off the hands in it complete was dropped by Darren Collier continues to be a rough night for the Miami wide receivers fortunate that wasn't picked off on the carom about high throws tonight ooh now you do not know the words some of them very entertaining or good study it's the most underrated fight Gooper sidestepped tackler and muscles forward for free and it'll be their dad and seven here's the jackets defense I think there's a little carryover effect from John to nudists presence here with this defense they're aggressive Dave Wommack is coming into an outstanding job of matching this scheme to the players these players really respond well to it it's a scheme it's multiple to play a lot of different coverages and that's both June the night is young Miami quarterbacks they've been mixing it up my confusion that it is blitzing and pressure is compared to to do his defense and a different demeanor Romick sorry quiet guys folks dog second false chart to the Kanes offensive line it was Orlando Franklin the guys were saying when the tutor was here of course he's at Notre Dame now to kinetic cocoordinating at charlie weis defense you can hear him hundred and fifty yards away walnut he puts two gets me and you write how many coaches you think I've done that the event it made that he did he set you guys now Barth has lots of time bucks to up the times of fires downfield the Hat call you're breaking open his cellar the tight end was also in the neighborhood and his fort out consider going for it here that's just too far you know it's too long on fourth look at it who put your defense back by the fit now they're gonna go for it water still on the field don't you have to obey it's 27 three down 24 make the play send a message here teamhigh give it good up for down to nine of 13 but this is for 13 yards away the divisions on the line here's Sam shields out here as lots of time fires over the middle it's pot it's a first down to Collier with ducks inside the 20 so no pressure lots of time for varmint 21yard gets you interesting interesting as well from day one that hit the most they've been putting pressure on virtual conversion for the cans here a man short of offense as a receiver wedding on the field late and he doesn't know what to do kind of gets to know thing that's a touchdown Wow confusion on both sides there is HAP's scores from 18 yards out the 13 finds the answer running in there great light was Kate Farkas and lined up in the backfield tell me what's incredible about that I don't know if Kane Ferguson knew to block your isn't inside he just kind of finds the white jersey that comes free it gets over and he's able to get in Tony Clark swirl wouldn't you guessed that he probably was on the sidelines and knew that they were sure to just happen to run on the field there are probably running backs that don't understand those protections Kane's partisan comes in and picks it up you know you could see Knicks running over there there was a funny confused on the sidelines he told Farkas indicated there and just get the backfield his blitz pickup Dallas barf to find that for 18 yards at Miami has life the jackets lead got that a 17

your suit and tell me who you are and cut the line or something that I get out do a lot of good Bobby Jones and the short kick breaks a couple of tackles gets across the 25 as we check Greece Chris not much running room on that kickoff return for the Pontiac gamechanging performance of the week there was just enough room for us sees CJ gable against Stanford on the farm cardinal bidding for a

week log on to espn.com search Pontiac can also enter for a chance to win a scholarship all right I vote there is thanks universe town Carrie keep her by Nesbit Marcus Robinson bag to Matthew 3 yards another look at that touchdown the confusion on the top here screen watch has you making the late run on the field is Cana Parkerson was supposed to be Collier there comes Marcus and I think because he was so late even the defense got confused right does the opposite know what they were doing Tony Clark the outside linebacker is licking his chops thick and this receivers never gonna see me coming off the edge but he gets picked up and it's got wide open in the end zone Nesbitt starts left comes back to right pitches junks stutter steps his way to midfield so Dwyer is still nursing that knee and it's Roddy Jones who picks up the workload and he gains 20 my counter option we study Syracuse kind of let the freeze option you remember that Donovan McNabb look at the bitch relationship Romeo Dave is it a tough night chewed out by his coach made that funky tackle and Nesbitt with a hand warmer now he's down on the field this is just no fun to play defense against is it now we talked about it watching this study and and Florida State they struggled with it and sure did you know great players are negated by this type of offense and that's why when you look at the upside the future for Paul Johnson and Georgia Tech gets big not sure is I mean they're gonna improve the offensive line they've already got great backs and take a break you know sausage biscuit dippers are a great idea I'm a breakfast sandwich that you can dip yeah but they're not just dip about their divebomber bow or highdiver ball ring sausage biscuit dippers new it's dawning three mini sausage biscuits served

press a button and you're watching your movie the enormous impact Saturday night for the VCS the big 12 South the Heisman Trophy Texas Tech Oklahoma Red Raiders to clinch the division with a win Sooners if they went still some work through they visit the Cowboys he talked a lot about obviously Harrell and Bradford and the receivers what about the running backs what about brown and DeMarco Murray barren batch woods for Texas Tech which switched animal running backs will have more success I think it's a push they both have really good running games underrated aspect this is a really good ring and this on the corner is Roddy Jones rowdy Jones leaving through people inside the turn 40 more yards so oldfashioned beat down here you know what if you go back and you look at the a back and the art block watch what happens right here watch out this delay and coming out with a block every people's freshman if you can do that if you can't do that you won't play that position we've seen so many different variables of the option tonight haven't we nothing has been the same Desmet has it and he's dropped by crook it's even hard to tackle you know Nesbit behind the line even though he doesn't maybe have that that explosiveness on the bad ankle but he's strong strong guy when he came in tonight's game rushing for 498 yards on the season that's the second highest total ever for a Georgia Tech quarterback and his story is really incredible he threw the ball 90% of the time in high school came to Georgia Tech because it was a prostyle offense that's what he liked was gonna clear it and actually planner Patrick Mix who's now the coordinator at Miami but he's fit in really well under Paul Johnson spread option attack second ago they pitch it in Jones the beige attacker in the backfield hampers cover to burn one card loss Stephen Wesley initially got their monkeys running soon wrapping him up talking about this offense and I guarantee the Georgia Bulldogs better get cinched up on defense it's at Georgia but this offense and this football team will have a lot of confidence going in playing between the hinges number one go right they said Nick Paul Johnson brought here number one go beat Georgia that was six in a row that's what cost Ken Ganley a lot of support here perhaps ultimately his job third and goal don't sing down to the two yard line as Lucas got split burst and then diving over was why inhaled and cut him down and save a touchdown it'll be fourth and goal just outside the one you know what the Phantom once wanted to do it I look at the point of attack and the lack of getting off blocks is that defensive line at Miami baffled Lucas Cox that had a touchdown a dive of the ankles by Ryan Hale but they will go for it on fourth down I think Paul wants time here to think about this did you set a Nesbit of a huddle inside of seven seconds on the play clock an old Oh God think about what you got to go for this come on yeah absolutely but just think about the white Georgia Tech over 400 yards total offense 360 on the ground this is a stunning blow for Miami's defense I think that you know Bill young the veteran coordinator has seen his unit improve in this five game winning streak they've held just about everybody down but they didn't expect to see this it's a different attack tonight you mentioned all those offenses that Billy young side has been able to hold now to help Tim Tebow in Florida 287 yards rushing Texas A&amp;M to 85 yards Virginia's 71 they held all these teams under they helped Darren Evans lost with 243 yards out there he had set a school record the 253 against Mario a different animal today in this option absolutely completely different animal I'm bill young this is not his first rodeo and he's seen the option before talking to Paul Johnson before the game Paul said you know what Craig and sometimes you'll see defensive coordinators still see somebody else maybe have a little success against us Virginia Tech for instance but foster used to know skies right on the center Florida State trying to duplicate it didn't work the Florida State worked a little bit for Virginia Tech so forth down ball just outside the oneyard line why are not in there it's Lucas Cox up in the B back position Roddy Jones in the slot Hasmik Itzik had dives into the absorb Bigfoot on senior night in Atlanta a long night the Kanes defense lots of the leverage and leverage beanie you know the angle of the block then at the pillar has no chance we met Josh Gilbert the guard diving across there Scott Blair boots it through for only twice tonight that could have three guys over 100 yards this keeps up Dwyer yet the figure may be done for the night with that knee they don't really need them obviously Nesbitt with 91 rowdy Jones 89 yards on the ground Paul Johnson troll is really the philosophy behind the spread option attack is to get fighters in space and that creates the big place you seen it tonight guys get out in open areas and there's only one or two guys that can tackle you and you break them they're gone and they've done it all game long doesn't matter what quarter it's been they've got and almost stronger as the games gone on you don't work there will be a lot said about this offense coming out after this ball game around a lot of folks gonna trip forget that this deep bitch played pretty darn well as well people look at this and they go how did this offense only put seven on the board against Carolina turnovers yeah they stopped themselves with some fumbles that's been the thing that if Paul Johnson knows if they can just cure the turnover problems because they've had 22 that's a lot if they they didn't have this 22 turnovers this team would be leading the division in command mrs. Harris 2:25 and push back Cody Clark great job and live back here he's also been a special team stud tonight again the NBA doubleheader tomorrow night 7 o'clock Eastern Time a rockets there Jameson rockets against the Wizards Hornets and the Thunder following at 9:30 Eastern Time ESPN 360 calm also where you can find NBA Friday I think the Rockets put their on the Hornets the other day I'm pretty sure we saw John Berry walking around in here get a little bit more than they did you say so he's still looking for us later is he recruited other NASA wannabes in the house tonight besides our friends from before I think big I would like a trip on the space shuttle right now has an incompletion a low throw by Marv he was trying to find Devon Jean Oh you and they think the best not a good resume for NASA right there just with the pregame stuff we're off at some point marv batted down at the line of scrimmage once again big ol michael johnson with the range not get it down check with Rhys we got Chris get you up to date on the 2k Sports classic benefiting Coaches vs cancer UCLA in Michigan on espn2 playing in Madison Square Garden the winner will get Duke Duke a winner over southern Illinois early tonight's a comma to attend hi get my thanks Chris it's not over for Randy Shannon the Canes even if they lose this game tonight still in the division race boys watch the time and he takes off that's been his best one of the night he hasn't been able to create plays with his legs and that's usually a component of the Canes offense Georgia Tech all night defensively has done a good job of keeping Robert Mars in the pocket not letting him get to the perimeter where he can hurt you with his legs and gets him back to negative four yards rushing didn't quite get the first down so it'll be another fourth down play they need to get just across the 35 we're gonna put him in the shotgun on 4th and a foot and is complete and now bottled in traffic and a sprung court at the 45 now the ruling comes incomplete no catch zelner couldn't hold it and no conversion and no running play a fourth of the foot and then others for and out now this Miami defense is going to be exhausted to see Radha Marva in the pocket is just trying to go over the football but what's the call you know what well if the umpire doesn't get away you got your bars James here though I know Craig but you got it you got to convert that into bars change is a powerful guy get under the center and then that's watch that boos back in the first quarter you asked about this offense there really is no rhythm there's no identity yet they're trying to pop if they have so little faith and their ability to move you can see Rio defensive on obviously lower or a lot of respect for that defensive line at Georgia Tech jackets take over inside the 35 Nesbitt he's gonna throw on first down looking downfield for Thomas stuff tall boots could make the catch headed hit his hands he beat Bruce Johnson in Pollock Johnson wants more about thoughts and going for the jugular and sudden change that's going up to his big wide receiver and I loved the call get a six foot three guy matched up on a smaller corner huh you cannot throw that any better if you're Josh Nesbitt he put that right up where you can go get it wasn't Thomas for using his right hand and kind of keep it made he's got to catch the ball and he has been their most consistent receiver so far this year Thomas getting the oneonone good first option Nesbitt touch back inside and ducks under for about four yards throat six passes tonight when they do throw it usually to Demaryius Thomas and because he gets single coverage you do it the chance as a receiver this offense to make big plays if you a lot of the ball will you do because with all those running plays these receivers and these wing backs are stocking the defensive backs they're always kind of running up there trying to match up to get these blocks all of a sudden they kind of stutter up they mosey in and boom putting their foot in the ground and they're running by it again wall of you to sleep on third down and Luca stops rumbling thinking about it cuts down let's watch the linebacker you've got to get line back there's over into his Lane and you get Curt off into it the blocking of putt prohibits the linebacker that gets hidden inside from given to his laying responsibility and it's an easy touchdown Lucas turn in the clock opinion 400 yard rushers but this kick the boys are going Scott Blair boots it 32 yards and you know Cox has 72 the yards rushing there's real chance you can have 400 yard rushers in this kicking nightmare for Miami they go on the road next week will not face the option against NC State but this has been just a nightmare E and what he hoped would be a showcase game Randy Shannon spice on like so much and so you played a lot tonight they talk about it's salty ol southern fights on you know they think it's jammed the arts rival George in there you read the lyrics up I'll get to the lyrics we have time in the fourth quarter I'll teach it to you before it's done let's go to the coast until now Miami again came in just needing to win this game and beat NC State had a chance actually to clinch this thing on Saturday if they'd won sign up some other things that happen it's dead now looks like the jackets are gonna jump up to five and three and Georgia Tech will be finished this is their last conference game they'll be in the clubhouse but it's a long way to go all these teams they will not be sorted adding out to November 29th Georgia Tech if they win tonight they need North Carolina Virginia Tech in Virginia to lose weight I still I mean it's way too complicated serious it is it to go through that the first tiebreaker is headtohead among the teams time and then in the Kanes amok that group would fare pretty well now they beat Virginia and Virginia Tech but it's too complicated the sword app you know people ask around the country what do you think about the ACC are they any good I think there are a lot of good teams no great team beeps in this conference don't 12 teams to kick it off this is my inhaler Thomas the kick off tries to come up with it and gets plucked at the 15 I mean Tony Clark has been down on almost every kickoff covering it making plays on defense one of the unsung stars tonight I'm sitting here at an observation for me at least to take away other than the ground game tonight is that Georgia Tech is well coached and they play hard and fast ball Johnson told his team good teams don't lose twice in a row either span they're just by the way there's a good year so far early Cooper cuts it back Craig Cooper gets ten yards hey you know playing the Citadel what does that do a little bit of a hit they'll take in the computer rankings tell you what yeah but they're they're fine there'll be Taliban close race then and there you know what you're starting to see coaches now start to posture in position themselves in the lobbying platform for where they should be at the end of the year well and if you're Florida that Citadel game the only thing that could come out of that is bad news I think because guys can get hurt it's one of those games where don't be surprised if Urban Meyer starts pulling starters early he's got a big game before his state following that match on Mars spins out of the pocket gets a block against Clark on the corner runs out but still loses two yards that graphs a good morning apt in my into giving him the most rushing yards and in 35 years and if we got a quarter we came into this game I think us before we us our crew good that had a lot of respect for Miami's rush defense that was given up 106 on the ground the record did we threat that perspectives warlords hooligans to offer Wow the jackets not gonna light up they're just gonna keep on at the same place if you don't tackle now you have 600 yards rushing Mars fires its Cooper about sex difference tonight Georgia Tech defensively tackled very well they've had a lot of bodies swimming to the football we talked to some of these players earlier Chuck the Daryl Richard he said they were doing rap girls and practice when they would elect door them the play wasn't over so the ball carrier was right wwr maybe things were done they do good shot attack we didn't have some rapid on the sidelines at the RNA pk Marvin's third &amp; Fire's incomplete almost picked off when the carom ladarius Johnson couldn't get it Aaron down to you hey Chris we talked about the beginning and the game just Miami talking about how cold it is well now that they're down bigtime here guys are standing by these meters this is the first time I've seen them trying to get warm guess what guys these heaters aren't even on getting better do they know that washer on the front that's not good news when they started whining about the lack of heaters right that's a shank it's it's all going wrong then normally reliable punter Matt bocher he said you know occasional shanks and the jackets offense like they didn't have enough success sir but he takes over at the 44 12 yard punt so they're at 395 yards rushing right now Jonathan Dwyer when he was in the ball game early on up the middle really accentuating those poor tackling habits of Miami's defense not getting to the ball not wrapping up not getting the legs and then on the outside as well it doesn't matter who's been carrying the football tonight for Georgia Tech whether it's Lucas Cox rowdy Jones Josh Nesbitt Jonathan Dwyer again everything Paul Johnson's calling is working yeah not Nesbit's been left at J Bo show the true freshman back up number 11 and to run this offense they had it straight ahead for a short game fifteen minutes to play mercifully for Miami 4110 a showcase for ball charts Sophos MLS Cup 2008 Columbus New York Sunday at 3:30 on ABC hello again everybody and welcome back to the much

Palmer and Erin Andrews in jboss Shaw just hands it ahead to Lucas Cox Jayla fled a couple of games when when des butts been injured Paul Johnson knows he needs to keep number nine a healthy for the stretch will rest him in a fourth quarter this guy you know didn't have great success his first year at native net like he's having this year they were two in tenement turned around quickly and won 18 games ten games nine games eight games and in the subsequent years well Johnson's one everywhere he spent under this only Tom Osborne Barry Switzer have won more games in their first twelve seasons everywhere Paul Johnson has been as a head coach Shaw the keeper a noche de Beauchamp diving forward first down at the 31 Georgia Southern he three straight division one double a championship games won two titles I think the conversation of coaches the year he certainly on your list Johnson wins the Bobby Dodd national coach of the Year award so he's won it and that's the right thing even has to be on the short list of contenders this year especially they could beat Georgia shop pits behind the man and it's a fumble every people's true freshman to true freshman they mess up the pitch and it's one of the rare instances of poor execution tonight their first turnover and dill shrimp the recovered it Jesse watch here the pitch relationship he had to take it to pitch it back back people's wasn't in the spot where he should have been and Jay bozo has to wreak lluch the ball and tried to kick it back to him that's now the 18th fumble on the year loss for Georgia Tech heading in at 17 that was second worst in the Football Bowl Subdivision you can see there's a clear drop off when Nesbitt leaves the game you wonder hi this offense put ten points on the board against gardnerwebb gomez what wasn't in there like that that's the way the deflection took the best job at Lebanon the Yellowjackets Harris at quarterback for the Canes Javaris James Namor's ahead for about nine building blocks at University of Miami Randy Shannon was telling us how he started back in the spring and then early in the fall and just taking a handful of clays and wrapping them and wrapping them and then scrimmaging at the end of that first week making sure that the players understood what they were trying to accomplish there so this is a building process a very young Mayan Frank's swallowed and is near the first down at the 44 also but it's been that successful season off the field by I mean how long history everybody knows about it and Shannon brought in to instill the kind of discipline what he's been able to do is get guys to buy into the importance of the season so they haven't messed up no off the field transgressions at all because they care about the season they don't want to ruin it for themselves and the teammates and that's been a big thing accountability it's a very young team but a very mature time he did get the first half Harris fires far side into traffic Reid went up over it almost had a chance at the pic but Richard Gordon third string tight end makes his first catch 22 got to give a little shout out there to Cooper Taylor his dad and I JimBob played at SMU together and JimBob Wooden there is tall is his son Cooper true freshman lanky guy 64 buck 95 he made a huge play was against Florida State the Noles were going in for a winning touchdown Ronnie Cooper Taylor ripped the ball out of the hands and then they it saved the game here his dad had huge biceps all he ever did was curls and he wanted to fight anybody that looked at him the wrong way got a South Texas I think San Antonio area Jim Bob would get after you to get some more jimbob's toys as Harris runs through five cars if we check back with race do we have two hours ready for another Jim Bob story port center in game stealers putting it on the bangles s scores not big Pittsburgh was moving at last check getting late in the third quarter up 13 to 7 Steelers trying to go eight and three before they take on the Patriots next Heys thanks Huck of the Texas Craig everies get two names Jim Bob he isn't either name good enough Paris makes the edges cut down at the 31 be a yard short of the first half mario down right Jim or Bob but why is down right Jim or Bob but why is gonna be Jim Bob Bobby Jack right Billy Joe hippies to Harvick Jesse Craig get over here upcoming I think they just want to be polite but a little bit more time for conversation the real first name is Jesse yes yeah that's BT confusing up here in 30 short firstdown yardage for bars James well that's the crazy thing his real first name is Jesse so he'd be Jesse James my middle name is James son Jesse James Palmer so we'd have Jesse James I check out Aaron did use her real first name he put this crew you know Colt McCoy's real name that's it that's it speaking of Texans yes flips it short James the onehanded x2 washed in some good downfield blocking and he cuts inside the 15yard line a touch Jeff Scott with a little trivia question well I'm thinking I've seen it I cannot believe at a gym med Tuscola Texas Cole man that name on him is you're not gonna get it he's actually born in New Mexico it or if you know that yeah born across the border Daniel but Colts a better quarterback moon oh yeah you got you got to be good if your name's Cole and here the trigger guy you better be good and he is it's also a good name plan in that state 10:28 to play over the middle catch made and a touchdown Leonard Hankerson the sophomore makes his first catch it finds the end zone to me when jacory harris has been in the ball game tonight this offense has been much more fluid and even moving the football way better we haven't seen jacory harris that much but when he has been in tonight I think he's done a very very nice job of managing the football game he had the pick and again you put that on bird not on him I always put him on the receivers so you guys know that he did though I'm gonna go for zoo here is that's what the book says right when you go down 25 empty backfield four receivers for Harris who looks to his right fires to the endzone and over the head no chance at all for Devon Johnson to make the play I'm gonna check the touchdown McCrory Harris perhaps something to build on for next week's game at NC State the Cadillac red tag event right now you'll find

stops that folks John the Heisman made in college football beat the heck out of Cumberland college right famous game here he was not that mercifully he was the original coach to run up the score and they named the trophy after him suck heisman in a second here first I'm bad at down once again Michael Johnson with 40 NFL scouts here lad up and show up on the Thursday night games and because it's Atlanta there are 40 Scouts here watching Johnson Scouts very familiar with these guys Michael Crabtree is quarterback Graham Harrell Colt McCoy off this week Bradford in the showcase game against Texas Tech and last year's winner is a sophomore Tim Tebow hollowfy good stats most folks believe that those five are the top contenders for the Heisman in the second year eris on second down is pressured dances from the pocket and skips out after about an eight yard game it's a weird Heisman race because you got an incumbent and you got four guys from the same conference in three quarterbacks will they cancel each other out is the question people are asking I think there's a lot of intrigue with the big 12 South quarterbacks right now and Crabtree is serving a great football players no question about that I mean he's I don't think they'll cross themselves out tbone making a lack a late season push to get back into mind as incomplete on third and short once again I'm Darius Johnson not able to come up with it you feel that that Harrell is that is a stronger Heisman candidate than Crabtree right now from that just from that team he's the triggerman and you know the quarterback said he's got the yards he's got getting it out there to them I Crabtree is a great football player and in this awards for cops football's most outstanding player now but sometimes we get caught up in the numbers in the marketing campaign well his numbers have been so good if you can go out and have a big game against Oklahoma now Jule Sam Bradford in the process I think that really puts him in a level of all his own you still have the big game down the road against Missouri if they're able to be bailed but Graham Hill right now in the driver's seat in my mind there's a fluid situation on fourth down Collier makes the catch but loses yardage Morgan Burnett the big play don't forget about the performance of this Jackets defense tonight the running game is the headline it plays some stop defense as well their defensive line has shown up and they've proven that they are one of the better units in the country and they're the ability to get to the ball their pursuit has been spectacular you see what a lot of people think this is the best unit in terms of defensive wounds and all college football and it's not just in the running game we've seen these guys batting down as Michael Johnson took the pick to the house burps active not on the rock not just in the running man in the passing game as well good we get to watch the JBoss Shah and enough the poll to see it laughs its last seven and a half you know Burnett his dad cap the NFL is cousin of Bruce Norton he plays for the Jaguars respect with him hi Chris time for a Sports Center right now the Phillies Chase Utley's going to have hip surgery it could be that it'll be missing from the champions lineup until June an NFL game going on right now bangles and the Steelers and Pittsburgh asserting its will up 22 720 highlights reaction on SportsCenter following the game we can stay curious p.m. news this is people's changed for the true freshman one of the a backs Miami territory it'll be third in about three you know if you don't mind I'm Jeff back into the Heisman Trophy and Sam Bradford Sam Brad wood is a guy that had just quietly gone about his business you know Graham Harrell it was Colt McCoy first right then gram carries the torch right now is the guy but Sam if Sam goes out and lights it up this weekend what about saying well nobody's throwing more touchdown passes in Sam Brad but it won't either front runner if he plays well when they went one absolutely no question and if Oklahoma wins out they're going to be a lot of folks saying why would an Oklahoma if they didn't beat Oklahoma State why wouldn't maybe the team JLo's shot thank you to the secondary and the truth questioning backup joining the party dropped and the 20 after a 27yard game you know fowler this is perfect for you because you scouted this guy out and said jaybo have the ability on the inside and the speed to get going yeah hey nice job J bozo add to that brushing number you got walked by a defensive end but that's okay it was a nice still 27 yarder offensive mumbles Allen good job he's doing he's doing a great job at the moon turn over this is he spins for about nine Jones posing in a lumberyard game I'm gonna join Jonathan Dwyer got another one for you guys just you know that the heartbeat of college football there are a lot of fans that have stopped talking about USC don't you get that feeling that the Trojans have kind of fallen off and they're not you know you know everybody's talking about Florida Alabama big 12 south nobody's even mentioning us well as long as Oregon State keeps winning people are gonna keep forgetting about USC and every week we think organ state's gonna file a lease again but they keep pumping out wins USC might not even win their own context keeps it muscle down at the 6 yard line by 20 cook and talked with mark stoops today arizona's defensive coordinator about his game with Oregon State this way that's a big one and then you know what Arizona I like Mike and Mark out there do a great job they got a good football team he said they went back to getting physical at practice this week they tuned it up Shawn the line of scrimmage yeah one if they can get two takeaways because the way to otama has been turnover prone against Oregon State Beavers want eight out of nine in that series I know it's a different Arizona team but that's what's gonna be closer than the first time the promise yet cuz it wasn't close the first pot I gotta tell you I like your zone in this game and I like them because when I heard mark tell us tell me that they got physical in practice this week at this time of the season it's an attitude adjuster you know you get a little soft and you're lazy and you're in your routine and it happens all the time you get physical let's see Jacquizz Rodgers fact that Oregon State leads the pac10 in passing that's what's in an interesting note because they run so long go that the foreyard lives Shawn and deflate it for the Canes really humbling this spine game winning streak will come to a resounding end but still in erased in the ghost of the trip to Raleigh to take on the Wolfpack a week from Saturday all right Chris fellow made all their time break stuffing who do you think the best team is in the ACC Georgia Tech it's okay take p38 old stop for no gain inside I thought UNC was the best thing that a sec up until last year

did enough in the first half up 28 and only took them 10 carry yeah pretty good out of it that's twelve point eight so it's really good now the focus to that met Georgia defense in the wild again Narasimha's own endzone fires lawn throated Don Johnson's at a very short gain as we check back to Greece all right Chris the dr. pepper conference update all eyes and it seems they have been almost every week this year on the big 12 South Texas Tech and Oklahoma Sooners have been nearly unbeatable at home under Stoops Red Raiders tried to beat Texas and Oklahoma in the same season for the first time ever and the division clinched race if the Red Raiders win Sooners before the possibility of a three Harris takes off 25 yard line before he's hammered guys we talked about the ball game there's also a huge event this weekend in Washington DC it's the Greater Washington Jewish Community Center 17th annual sports award banquet and a well deserved honor for our statistician Marty Aaron off get up the stool Marty given here this guy has been doing this job for more than 30 years he is absolutely the best in the business inducted into the Hall of Fame in DC well deserved honor great job great job man congratulate off the only Hall of Famer in this booth so the show could not go on without one of these great work era spires sand the juggling catch made by shields check it not shield it's Parkinson near the 38 yard line wonder if Harris is going to be the starter a week from Saturday they've had the pattern no matter who now plays well the previous week they go with mark I think I think Harris has had the giving a 39 it'll be an issue a eris goes down feel and as a catch made by bird Big Ten race may be decided here this game no hiyo state plays Michigan at noon and then Michigan State and Penn State Michigan State needs the Wolverines to shock who is a to have a chance to get to the Rose Bowl it solved the Nittany Lions Gerald Clark really had his only bad game of the year against Iowa two weeks ago we found it against Indiana last week got back to that efficient play I had a couple fumbles in the pic that in bet bad weather against the Hoosiers but you know I talked to Jay Paterno cooffensive coordinator he said that Clark took an unfair amount of blame from their fans he was 9 at 23 against I would had some drops was hit the protection broke down and in Penn State now practicing this week in the cold to get ready for that game on Saturday afternoon where it's gonna be pretty frosty and happy event so every time that happens don't you usually look for the defense to step up and that tom bradley defense that has no nickname no moniker I bet they show up and again challenge Devon England what is all that stuff kinematics eris firing downfield and over the head of Parkinson there's a flag in the secondary crowd booing and will be interference uncatchable ball is mario edwards neighborhood and see if they pick it up but they don't it's a handicap call pasen verse 46 defense 15 dog company that's the tickytack there hmm and it was way over the head of Farkas ooh what is all this stuff here it's all that stuff looks like it's the equations for throwing touchdown passes between Josh Nesbitt as they get the right combination drawn to scale just FYI is the guy in there I would've been a lot taller Wow after the penalty it's a first hand for the Kings Sarah's firing down the middle has a man in for Kison will go into the end zone so it'll look a little bit more respectable on the scoreboard because of some late touchdown passes from Harris that one covering 25 yards don't you think the mine the offense has looked so much more fluid when jacory Harris has been behind center and certainly Georgia Tech but not bringing the dogs right now they're not getting after him like they were earlier in the game with Robert Marvin but Corey arrastre true freshman he showed a lot of poise they're dead and he's still out there fighting so I look for accuracy that's what's been in my mind it just seems like Harris was far more accurate and throwing the football tonight than Barbara and stutter step on the conversion but it's not through by Boshart he still is perfect on the season nether reminder ABC primetime game breath Musburger Kirk Herbstreit and Lisa Salters in Norman Oklahoma or game day start the day at 10:00 a.m. Eastern on ABC 8 o'clock Eastern the Red Raiders and the Sooners talked about the amazing numbers of these quarterbacks total touchdowns puts the passing and the rushing touchdowns together III think that's that's ridiculous it's week 42 total touchdowns each video again it's like a video game there's Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell are so accurate and all the passes that they make short medium long and and I mean Bradford put on 15 pounds in the offseason and I think it's really paid off for him and watching him throw and standing behind Bradford and practice and when you see him deliver the football he reminds me of Ben Roethlisberger when you're behind him and you see the ball is it's there it's coming down at him well you know and what's most impressive to me about Sam Bradford is he's accurate but really accurate when they throw the football downfield he's pushing it down field to his targets 30 40 50 yards man he's on spot and you know what if you're Oklahoma's defense I think the key of this ball game for them is yards after catch they've gotten to hug Tech's receivers it may let those receivers catch the ball and move after it it could be a long night for him Manny Johnson one of the targets for Bradford getting healthier was has been begi they've been productive but they're a better offense when Manny Johnson is in there here onside kick is elected enough he's a member of the hands team but Derek Morgan taking up her game he wanted the defensive and got the ball 91 Morgan on it hey but you know that great to see Johnson coming back though he's the guy that had the elbow that really ugly nasty elbow injury yeah and it's just great to see him back out on the field you know I'll say this though Texas Tech is a football team I believe full of confidence I don't think you'll be rattled by the Norman crowd the owe you fans will show up they'll be gassed up out there who benefits more from the violin Texas Tech you see they got a chance to recover after those big games with tech or with Texas and Oklahoma State you know they got the third quarterback Calvin Booker who's a senior local guy mishandled the exchange avoids the fumble that falls forward so final minute here my annual head home deflated the win streak snapped but again still in the race here at NC State the jackets finish their ACC campaign at five and three they go in and they post that score to club out so they have to wait and see what the Cavaliers and the Hokies and the Hurricanes do in their final game but it will not be sorted out until the final weekend November 29th about 464 that works I mean if they hadn't really called it off if they'd gone full go fullbore here is their second I've left Nesbit in there I mean it's scary how many they might have remember Jonathan Dwyer didn't play at all in this out and half either I mean if these guys were yeah going and the game was still tight and had to keep pounding this thing away that number could have been way more way more ugly Nance that it's the most allowed on the ground for Miami since 1944 second most in history Randy Shannon strong defensive background he's seen his Miami defenses shut down the option in the past but again this is a different sort of option and a very young defense that's the key there Chris is it is a different type of offense when they shut Darren Evans down from fort Virginia Tech last Thursday who had just come off a 253 yards rushing performance school record the week before against Maryland I thought this defense you know third they're back but you know there's nothing predictable about it about a young team you know you knew there was gonna be one of these games remind me it was gonna look like a bunch of freshmen or sophomores and you know it's mostly because Tech came in outplayed him and it was sharp and aggressive from the start let's work both ways for both of these teams Georgia Tech did not look very impressive against UNC two weeks ago completely 2:13 there tonight it's Booker on the keeper and the senior on senior night this final home game for Georgia Tech gets a chance to rip off about a 7 yard game he's been pretty much a party here in Atlanta for the guys in the allwhite unis top rusher in the ACC Jonathan Dwyer again just a half but better 28 yards rushing and for Paul Johnson a very satisfying win as he turns his focus toward the Georgia Bulldogs the ACC race had more convoluted than it was three hours ago and the jackets very much in the mix sports hitters coming up next over on ESPN news will have postgame extra
