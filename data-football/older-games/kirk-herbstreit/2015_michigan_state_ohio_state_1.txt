============================================================

put any velocity on the ball and I think it's been bothering him all week and so would be shocked if he ends up playing so you're turning to a couple backups that don't have a lot of game experience Tyler O'Connor is to true backup the junior out of Ohio has played some he threw 11 passes last week against Maryland and then Damian Carey is a little bit of an xfactor to me more of a dual threat guy a guy who could run some zone read I think he plays a big role today if in fact book is out because as an athletic guy that can run zone read it's a good way to try to slow down and athletic Ohio State defense a massive challenge for both those quarterbacks in their first start in this hostile environment all the emotion of senior day and a Buckeye defense is playing lightsout football Buckeye often still looking to click with JC Barrett and the running game they've been strong but can we see some extra dimensions today well I think that's the big thing for Ohio State you're right they've been a bit onedimensional relying so much on V Kelly and starting today and they realize this JD Barron not just running but his ability to buy running create some oneonone opportunities on the perimeter I look for Ohio State to get the ball on the edge Jalen Marshall Braxton Miller Michael Thomas as quickly as they can because that pass rust from Michigan State is the real deal so JT Barron we looking to throw and run today against the sparks and you get a feeling with Braxton Miller who switched back to his old number five on senior day would love to have a big performance and say farewell with this crowd I think Urban Meyer might be in a sentimental mood so keep an eye on that got a feel for that yesterday you're right last game here at the shoe and after everything he's done for Urban Meyer and for IO state they may have a rink or two for number five but guys undefeated many say they've underachieved this is their first ranked opponent the national anthem now from Ohio Stadium so the cheerful face of Ezekiel Elliott lots of emotion pi/6 to Spartans and the eyes coming up from Columbus here eyes coming up from Columbus here in Ohio Stadium the rain arrived sooner than the forecasters expected it temperature 48 it will drop he could have some snow that's the blue when the radar approaching Columbus so the weather could become a wintry mix by the second half of this game a serious challenge for both offenses and especially for Michigan State with an inexperienced quarterback again we think Connor cook will be unable to go today well Matt Heather cook our Heather consignee when you wet sidelines all right all right Chris thanks so much Mark Dantonio told me moments ago that there was one determining factor as to whether Connor cook would go or not and that word was velocity how much zip what do you have on the ball during warmups remember Connor cook did not throw a ball all week long so this is the first time he truly tested that shoulder then Dantonio said we'll go into the locker room alqasim and make a final decision but during warmups guys Connor cook took one and about every six reps and really deferred to us back up and don't forget hunter cook and this entire team have been fueled all week by being the underdogs they've been striving and motivated on that but if Connor cook can go go that underdog status has got a whole lot bigger for sure Heather cook is not a captain much has been made of that but he is out with his Barton score the coin toss but the captains of this team massive disappointment for a guy Agri Cleveland area has never played a game in his home state so that the sidelines is a red shirt when they beat Ohio State this is the team that has pointed to this game the one loss in Nebraska really brought that ship back brought that edge back that this program is known for this I absolutely this a football team that has accomplished so much and in the last two years they knocked off Ohio State went on to beat Stanford the Rose Bowl last year great year and ended up with a big win over Baylor they kind of thrive on that underdog role they they embrace it it's going to be interesting and you take Connor Cook if he in fact in not playing you take a guy who's 32 and 4 as a starting quarterback and you turn to a couple young men they just took not played a lot of football Tyler O'Connor a junior who played a little bit of some mopup duty last week and got in the second half and Damian Terry really hasn't played a lot of football at all you know they big thing that I would do if I'm Dave Warner trying to get into this football game with a couple young guys and get them to settle in and try to find what they like what are you comfortable with in this environment try to get it to just get their feet on the ground and go out and execute against one of the more athletic and experienced defenses in the country you Joey Bosa there's been having a tremendous season one of the juniors that is in all likelihood playing their final game in Ohio Stadium as well as the seniors though of a talented group of juniors of the B draft eligible you see JC Barrett Michigan State perhaps wanting to go on defense first he did the young quarterback won the toss and deferred Ohio State will get the football to begin only the 44th meeting but there's a commanding lead they have split the last four yes both teams have a more up wanted rivalry with Michigan but really it's this game in recent years where the championships have been won and lost it each other's greens and that's the case again today Sparty big underdog without their quarterback their leader to kick off your the worst year Kevin Cronin diluted away Curtis Samuel is deep so we'll see JC Barrett who was absolutely on fire in East Lansing last year at a 300yard passing game three touchdowns Kirk he also ran 486 that suits us down when he really seemed to arrive as a playmaker I really think that was kids comingout party as a quarterback and really for Ohio State as a team when they went up to East Lansing and won that football game in the way that they did but you're right he ran and he threw maybe had one of his best games of his career and we'll be interested to see how Michigan State tried to defend him this year compared to playing so much mantoman coverage a year ago option look berrak a keeper hit hard and not down that was Lawrence Thomas the defensive end this is a very strong Michigan State defensive front really the strength of this defense along with the line back here exactly right if Michigan State's going to come on the road especially losing potentially your starting quarterback the defensive line has got to be physical they've got to win the battle at the line of scrimmage second and 11 they're looking to throw now tuck it and knock down short of the 30 it'll be third down and about six for Ohio State when you have a dominant defensive line I don't like week saw really last week with Oklahoma it can free you up to not have to take as many risk and play mantoman and isolate a inexperienced secondary it sometimes has been vulnerable this year so defensive line pressure on these first two plays a good coverage they on that play didn't allow Barrett to do anything with the ball recent years third and long against the Spartan has been trouble but this has been a trouble spot for the defense allowing conversions and will be docked joy so Chris fries in uttering his linebacker position of the Buckeyes go three and out and it's funny Chris bride who's from Upper Arlington Ohio which Chris is about a 9iron from right here I mean he grew up back close growing up and probably loving the Buckeyes he makes a great play right here coming all the way from the back side and because of his effort here that play right there prevented JT bear from getting that first down a straight effort by pride it's been a slow starting offense touchdowns and only two of their opening possession of this season so Cameron Johnston having the best year of any punter in the country I believe Ozzie boosted on and in traffic the fair catch is made by McGarrett Kings at the 25yard line so who will get the starting nod looks like it'll be they mean Terry the sophomore from Erie Pennsylvania who's a terrific runner but has had almost no experience throwing the football doesn't have a touchdown pass in his career hasn't thrown an interception what is three Kirk that's it yeah young quarterback one and three but he has run the football and he's known more really for his ability to run he's a big back I read a quarterback 63 235 pounds and again we got to reiterate you're losing Connor Cook 32 and four and now instead of being a tenant by the way it's going to be that kind of game I think they're going to be flipping back and forth instead comes into jr. Harry was in the huddle in O'Connor trotted out so he's making his before start Jerald home he's his detail back and he's done it point he was the words the work force is still fighting for yards knocked down after a very determined first down run yeah he sure did he did not give up on that nobody wrapped him up so he just kept keeping his legs churning and like Ohio State maybe lost in there in that pile but good effort there to pick up eight yards here Ohio State defensively you've heard all week about Connor cook he might play he might not like all of a sudden see the inexperience back there your PIN and you're in advance and you're coming after a young quarterback and then coming out to the bishop state running game second insurance home bangs forward he's sort of a marker O'Connor got early action in the win over Maryland they caught him by surprise it was marked Antonio just feeling that he needed some quality reps and what is that look like a smart decision now with Cooke getting hurt later on because they're things are the way it's gone they have not really blown a lot of people out and partners the backup hasn't gotten a lot of reps and what's up one surfer Michigan State is usually a strength of theirs has been their running game but they've not been able to run the ball this year that the way they have in the past most of the spin on their passing game need a HAMP yard and throw down and though Connor speaks it and they will move to change fourth year guy in the system so he knows everything about this offense and he's a better runner than Connor cook but this is just a big big cast against this defense that has been bothering people they think Ohio State playing better defense now than in the championship run doing great absolutely the way Joey Bosa has played and I think they're indeed the reps with bond felt rested he dies with the Josh parry they bring a lot of experience to the table they play with a lot of confidence right now the defense Boza jumps on and the whistle before the ball was snapped mosa only four sacks so the production in that department way down with contact defense number 97 fiveyard penalty first out but 15 tackles for loss a whole bunch of quarterback hurries 40 tackles having a terrific year Carmack's presents the bright side and look at this Michigan State program where's the 2013 upset of Ohio State denying the Buckeyes the national title shot went on to beat Stanford in the Rose Bowl they've got a poor bowlwinning streettype the longest in the country where it's been five after the penalty Inger and RJ Shelton front receiver not down after short game haven't got a lot of production out of those jet sweeps this year haven't known in that particular case so they just called it at the wrong time oh hi Oh state actually brought a blitz from the field and and shifted their entire defensive line into the boundary allowing Taekwon Lewis could not get outflanked he turned that back to the inside and even with the speed of Shelton he could not get outside of the Ohio State defense O'Connor the throw to the first time complete in the plat a flight comes down as Gerald home has knocked down short of the marker by Joshua parry one of the 18 seniors recognized on senior day holding offense number 75 10yard penalty second down the guard Benny McGowan from Centerville Ohio it'll try it out there and maybe a little bit of too much he'll try a little too much effort watch the left guard McGowan 75 he gets beat by guys he just slips he's trying to get a hold of Adolphus Washington Washington move by him so quickly he just ended up wrapping up around his leg so favorable down in distance I almost then they starting to go backwards here and Damian very Kirk he's the sophomore out of Pennsylvania who is a more explosive runner than O'Connor or cook for that matter little experience deeper all the way not much room as he ones to the boundary not got across the 35o to be further long imagine Dave Warner of the play call or the Michigan State offensive coordinator and it prepped all week with the understanding that they've night lose Connor cook you go from having a quarterback is thirty two and four to having a quarterback who's never started a game and now you got to start to put together a package and you're using two quarterbacks so it's premeditated they have a feel how they want to do O'Connor and when they want to use theory but it's an interesting challenge especially on the road with so much at stake it's very in there on 13th in dealing with the noise what and throw it on the ball good coverage on the far side by Darian Conley against Aaron Burr bricks to top receiver and it's for found and ohio state well aware by doing their scouting report of how athletic terry can be and especially on third down sometimes an athletic guy that hasn't played a lot of football the most difficult thing for defense to defend isn't necessarily him throwing it's him buying time and making the defense get out of position either running for a first down or getting a defensive back to come up and then making a throw that time they played it very very well and stuck in their coverage tricky weather for the specialist with the Jake part Barker the redshirt freshman hunters reflects the oh snap it's complete away which is too short for Jalen Marshall to have a chance to return so bounce it around it'll be down by the Spartans at the 26 yard line big wave 1st quarter Ohio State's second production coming up the middle of his stretch run as you take the Goodyear how is football playoff rankings in Michigan State down there at nine but remember they have a chance to beat Ohio State today could be Iowa in the Big Ten championship game cowboys and Sooners are going to collide next week one of those is going to lose probably Alabama and Florida in the SEC championship game so one of those teams going to lose Michigan State yes just by winning out to get to minimum number five any of the top ten teams went out they're going to be in the discussion bye guys second position minute Zeke Elliott was his first fairy Elliott with a 15 game 100yard Street coming in run back to the middle of last year 1425 yards and very much a Heisman candidate got two yards on first down saw him queuing up the income group during Senior Day for their a junior very emotional guy Barrett looks to throw off the option find his receiver it's incomplete sliding to the ground there with Michael Thomas and Wiley pull up then longhaired latest bullet of stars as far as the junior in the middle there number 30 watch him closed in these linebackers played down and Hill but I've seen from Ohio State a team that has struggled and pass protection is they respect Michigan State's pass rush in their defensive line and they are moving JT Barrett power the pocket almost every pass attempt so far rolling to his left or rolling to his right away from the pressure in Braxton Miller switching back to his number five which he wore as a quarterback growing his career for senior days in the slot the bear equip secure come Marshall Marshall has really put tobacco guards down at the 45 I think that's the plan Pro hioh State they've got to get away from the strength of Michigan State where the defensive line to get the ball out of space where their athletes can make place force the linebackers North the defensive back to tackle the skill and the speed of guys like Jalen Marshall Curtis Samuel Braxton Miller Michael Thomas and I think they'll continue to go back to that ball out of the hands quick from JT Barrett to these athletic receivers and in speed they have on the perimeter now in practice and Miller in the backfield to the left of Barrett it looked his way in the flat black didn't but we might throw the bow jerk but he decides to run with it for a fouryard gain as we check it with Cassidy hovers for an update from the studio Cassidy hi big birthday Hervey let's take a look at his gimmick don't presented by Wells Fargo over tie between UNC and Virginia Tech Marty Pulliam sequential for the win the Tar Heels clinched the Coastal Division ugly face Hudson Navy title game second and six Barrett design run it hard as he falls forward it'll be a third and short break Evans one of the defensive tackle to rotate in on the top it's their plan from Michigan State whether they're playing Ohio State or anybody is they like to get their defensive linemen to pin their ears back and get up here they also ask their linebackers to attack downhill so it is very very challenging to get any kind of push or any kind of successful early in the game into the interior of the Michigan State defense disrespect for that front empty backfield on third and three arms have been a very good sir in short the event thank you before not very good and third and long this year berry running it's the corner clock Tao wouldn't tackle lineup was Monty Nicholson the safety to deny a first down when you go empty and even though they motion in Nick Lynette this is who it's oneonone this guy against this guy can you get to the first down marker he's trying to get right in that 45 yardline heck of a play and he didn't hesitate something that Montaigne Nicholson would have done early in the year now playing with a different set of confidence different set of skill set that allows him to play and react much quicker that was a heck of a play to keep buried short of the first down just regained his starting job tackling has been an issue for him this year but not that time he got the message when he got on the bench you can't explain with a different attitude he last couple weeks urban thought about it first second fourth and one that sends out Johnson who will do what he does as well as anybody knocked that went deep and the fair catch is made by King at the 15yard line so Michigan State's defense makes the stop on third short gets the ball back Rose City Columbus ESPN college football presented by Kay Jewelers Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay the Home Depot more saving more doing an Nisa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy given the high honor on senior day as fourth year sousaphone player Neal Stephan's dotting the I before the game scoreless in our dr. pepper championship drive game of the week just joining us Connor cook unable to go at quarterback the shoulder injury suffered last week just not able to throw the ball with velocity and without pain so we're watching two different quarterbacks Tyler O'Connor who started and that Damian Carey came on midway through the Spartans first possession fair but backed up here at their 15 Laing the tightend lotions into the backfield fossa for the second time today jumped offside and the Spartans will get five yards Joey's Keita clearly eager today to to get a jump on Cody Kilroy there and give Jack Allen the center a little bit of credit or the head side defense number 97 fiveyard penalty repeat first down there you go on the road you go silent counter you'll seal fort about clap into Michigan State's today's mission the quarterbacks lifting his leg and then the clutch the thinner just that slight hesitation instead of putting his head up for snapping it right away joy boats are trying to find that rhythm here early and he's jumped a couple times but Jack Allen at the center on the road using the silac count deserves credit for mixing up when he's snapping the ball Jack down lows as a trick of the trade any doubt allamerican candidate a center captain of his team LJ Scott the true freshman tailback is in there but it's a keeper for Terry very much what we expect to see from this sophomore short game and I think that's the staff report that Ohio State has read on what number six comes into the game is you going to attack the option and then time boy they were glowing well as a unit linebackers coming down hill you called Taiwan Taiwan to us as well making a play now you see it or the O'Connor Horvath thrower coming into the football game second into LJ's freshmen who had some high points couple touchdowns against Michigan on his first start but fumbled the ball in his first two carries and rode the bench the rest of the way last week absolutely and interesting they go right back to him to show that they have confidence and it was a heck of a blocked by Donovan Clark on a trap block on Adolphus Washington opened it up and gave Scott enough room to be able to pick up that first down there'll be a lot of physical plays between these running back the middle linebacker Raekwon McMillan number 5 in the middle play action honor fire completes near sideline catch made by Aaron Burr bridge is 66 of this season in front of you like Apple and see that that when we came into this week that was the matchup everybody wanted to see his Burbridge going matched up mantoman against the Ohio State corners especially Eli Apple who is one of the top orders into big thin and how about the throw by O'Connor puts the ball low and away and give Barbara J champ away from the defender the heck of a throw is he again very early in this game trying to settle it a Sabbath the positive rubric as you know 2,000 yards the rear least giving errors second in for Scott Sutter steps and moves the chains again across the 40 go rotate the backs no Spartan Bank add more than a hundred Aires coming into this game so the opposite of what Zeke Elia does for Ohio State you mentioned the fumbles by LJ Scott watch him here with the two hands on top of that football he's not even thinking about bubbling the ball or at least trying not to fumble the ball after two attempts last week against Maryland and the two fumbles but you're just tuning in to this game and Connor cook is not in you're seeing both of these quarterbacks from Michigan State and I think this will continue the entire game you're going to flip back back and forth and back and forth I don't expect it to stick with one guy very back in there on first down and take the deep dive two guys tangled up in complete no flag run with bond fell defending on McGarrett King Wow got away with one minute that was shocking it was early in the round and a good job of creating a matchup they feel very very good about Kings matched up even though bond Bell has cover skills there's a lot of contact raps on to him that's why the Michigan State contingent was fired up it was early in the round not a bit late late later in the round it was early enough very very surprised the officials did not throw a penalty there on vaudeville and a terrific season Terry looks distant sky he cannot escape Joshua Perry drags him down at the 44 yard line it'll be third down one of those seniors is at him terrific career as a leader in this team yeah absolute great effort by shots with Perry I thought that play once the ball is actually thrown by Perry it looked like it was set up very nicely for Scottie and a convoy in front of him but somehow Perry was navigated his way through and only allowing a very short game boy it is tough to execute this prostyle offense all the verbiage for an inexperienced quarterback in this noise very knock down ball comes out Ohio State says they have it Sam Hubbard came around the hand hits the quarterback you know IO state defense makes a huge play Adolphus Washington fell on the ball well it's almost through Where's Waldo with Joey Bosa folks it goes all the way over here he's normally here this allows to see hover to get around watch how you see close to take up two blockers it frees up a oneonone matchup with Sam Hubbard already at four and a half sacks on the year he goes right by Keeler with that speed so the Buckeye defense forces it take away and Ohio State will set up shop with a Spartan 32 only the ninth turnover parade Antonio's team in querque tummy they blend category he can feel good about because on paper Ohio State has all kind of edges is turnovers bad starts to the offense here on state from the 32 Eliot behind Barrett in the pistol and he's got it very little Running Room against that tough punch plus 13 for the Spartans coming in and turnover typically very good Ohio State was 1 on the season like I said I've on vision state at Marc Dantonio and Carla Cornett Mike Presley you putting up a plan together against Ohio State you've got to take away see Kelly JT Barrett the running game your pen in your ears you're coming downhill in a hurry which means JT Barrett's going to have to make the play to the passing game to make to kind of get them to back off and then get back to the running game leans forward fighting hard down inside the 25 hear the crowd say relief will be a third grade I mean right now that that's the plan that they have come in watch them attacking and getting up feel this is an option game it has topped to do and you're getting penetration from those linebackers of defense alignment this is third and short yeah buffet feed is freed up look how quickly he comes down collapses and oneonone tackle in the open field and Nicholson made that play here's another third down this time pro high estate 83 and Elliot humor forward don't know the team into the red zone when a minute ago opening quarter and it's that you know they're attacking down here that is great blocking and a left guard Billy price right guard Pat L fine comes up picks up the linebacker right there with Rolla Bolla right on his back a heck of a block for the right guard l fine out of Pickerington they have been ruthlessly efficient in the red zone with Barrett at quarterback this year Elliott but inside of pull of flies former Florida pick for Sanjay hey you don't when you have safeties and linebackers flying dynast an hill like that you're either getting get them for a short gain or maybe a loss or if he keeps it balanced there there's no one left right then he's able to get into the end zone quick first quarter dominated by defense for the Buckeyes in scoring position back after this message and a word your local KBC station rainy day at the Shu ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers national championship trophy we learned last week and wake of its rain proof here once again isn't it by dr. pepper to the winner of the championship game Kenny Burrell Evans Mondale Arizona bug eyes behind four runs from Zeke Elliot have moved into position here following the fumble recovery by Washington and usually an area when talked about the red zone zone read where you have to threaten deke Elliot and GT Barrett usually comes into play for Ohio State down in this area can pitch Elliott for Susanne hammered hard finds Nicholson at the 9 yard line 23 red zone crypts of bereted quarter value 18 touchdowns and two field goals if there's one reason for free can you say why he regained the starting job it's that it's the red zone no doubt about it I mean the last five games you can look at the numbers by the way that would rank up around the top in the country that percentage is seventy close to seventy seven percent Georgia Tech right there it's 77 percent so that's how effective they've been the second half of the season through tight ends look to the left that way but is knocked down rusik play by Riley Bullard who just goes in there they hit the running back low but they do move to change first and goal with a block on the left side by Taylor Decker and Billy price short yardage watch the left side watch 54 and 58 you want to follow you want to know where to go that's where you go right there then you turn the right Gardel fine that's how you open it up on short yardage great shot by Decker and price and I'll fight coming around same formation this time Barrett looks to throw in the flat bang that makes ejection is not that immediately by Nicholson they rarely bothered throwing down here because the running game is so ruthlessly effective yeah I think it shows you the respect they have the Michigan State defensive line but you know typically they might try to catch you out of position they tried that time to catch the safety Nicholson out of position fighting down on the run and thought they made three up Nick than that but then Spartans were there I mean now you see him go back to that combination of pink and JT Barrett Barrett runs all the way has decreased time for the ends of an Ohio State make sure the ball cross before the Diamondback watch 81 that's locked right there he takes horn Thomas out of the picture this is going to come down to have to take a peek at that name he did hit the ground just as he was lunging toward the goal line right there yeah they'll take another look at this for sure nice putt there Lana denied of Raschke these are tough looks is the pylon can see if it stays in play there's that block by the way I was telling you about they took him out completely off the field there look from this angle need down there hard to see whether the ball did break the one part of that white line may not be enough to overturn the call it's a good look at it yeah looks like you might be on the about the sixinch line you think Kevin looks almost simultaneous there me down yeah the tough one let Dave Kataya come in and talk to us about what he thinks the expert take a look at this play and Kirk what you say and Chris as well it's too close to overturn it okay it looks like that he has broken the play of the goal line when that knee goes down but there's nothing here I see to change the call on the field and capron who's the referee Tom Herbert very accomplished replay official is the one in charge of this call well here's the other side here's a different look I think he broke the point Monica I think I think what you guys said makes a lot of sense is not enough to counter the call on the field of touchdown absolutely even from this angle you see the knee down here which is not the greatest angle right now but you can't tell to look at pylon cam you love this toy it's got four cameras in the pylon knee down to there the foot of the defenders in the way have you seen anything that's definitive that would counter the golf touchdown after review the runner's knee was down with the ball at the 1/2 yard line early clean nothing in common ok for 1348 1348 you never know in the big 10 no I one of those shots like the rest of it I thought the sixinch line but who knows they were also so close here I'm glad they're making that call not us just bided disputable I agree with today but seems and that's what you used to go with the Ponte field Galia didn't get there Michigan State squad was support from rescued a linebacker after the reversal will not be fourth and goal and with your right Chris risky and Riley bullet the two linebackers they're able to get involved as a nice job at the Michigan State defense line of getting low low man wins and he's bovine situation but to clean it up by bulla and rest he was very very key because you know he Kelly did the second third effort kind of back and that the linebackers took that second third effort away admirer has the offense on the field and there is trying to quiet the crowd that Spartan crowd in that film is making the noise Urban Meyer's for the 5yard line they call a clock down at one and Meyer was all over it the shifting they weren't ready to snap it there to the five yard penalty saved by the timeout here and admire tremendous confidence in this offensive line and his backs in this area absolutely and I think Michigan State has tremendous confidence in their defensive line and linebackers that's what makes this especially with a 00 game such a big point in this game for pound when you come back to Columbus spartans defend their goal line as well as any defense in college football to fourth and goal stops already this season what is Meyer call here on fourth down well his strength is his offensive line in the running of Zeke Elliot and that's what you would think they've spread about now with three receivers but then out flex to the right trying to create some better matchup I think they go up the middle here with Zeke Elliott they do Elliott dive down after the fumble recovery that drive was just about all DPLA bidding then he finishes it with the fourth down dot yeah when you get into a situation you've got to trust something you don't want to get too cute even though Michigan State has such a great defensive line great group of linebackers you've got a trust here in offensive line especially that left thigh led by Taylor Decker and then you give it to the big physical back Zeke Elliott you trust it and ends up coming through for you on fourth down Nurnberger won the kicking job over Jack Willoughby so the ball knocked loose by Hubbard recovered by Washington and venomoth particle drives and plays nine of them Elliott runs and he finally finishes off over the top on fourth down and the Buckeyes jumped in front in the second quarter in Columbus ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers don't you by New York Life here's a healthy she's good going you it proud partner of the NCAA and AT&amp;T mobilizing your world the captain Josh berry second to last and in rack stand Miller the last one out on Senior Day switching back to Jersey number five warm exchange deserve admire that senior class that came on the heels of a seven loss season it is forty eight and three in their careers twenty seven and one day beza amazing accomplishment and sting Braxton Miller there and everything that he's been through throughout his career the good and the bad the challenging our gauge Hilton will not bring the kick out we welcome in Chris pálinka Posey and dry in our truck with our Aflac trivia question for Byzantium bear what do you got well Connor cook would have had a chance for his second win over Ohio State today but unfortunately he's injured the Kirk I think this points up your alley our question today who are the only two Michigan State quarterbacks to have multiple wings over Ohio State I think you're going to get this one okay Fuzzy's had won for sure Billy Burke have two cousins had one here Billy Burke came in here one year at the Ohio State 98 doc munching Connor the quarterback comes in backfield rosid in the crab pick the ball in and out of the hand that's a play you've just got to make for your quarterback I'm going to guess Billy Burke and I'm going to go with Bobby McAllister black the answer to be on such repeating question mr. Herbstreit you are correct why two for two for two all right yeah get me knocked off that number one frontal highest 1898 and they're bothered McAllister for us but sports with royal tire yes pretty good let the walk off right there but you'd like that Bobby McAllister but you recall every Ohio State lost alright so I'm honestly in Bobby McAllister with the red the white that is great much therefore home a mystogan state more than any other team has ended ohio state perfect seasons when the Buckeyes have been in the top five one of them at 98 game when they were given a low percentage a chance to win yeah Cedric Irvin had a big game that day so now a real challenge rain continuing to fall wind in the faith of the Spartanburg a sucks down a third and I remember Joey Bosa always a factor here my estate loves to move him around gotten out his natural position brush floor closest roughing back the completion on the far side in a personal first town to Aaron Burr Bridge when we talked about that 101 matchup earlier and Burbridge is one of the top receivers in a big 10 against one of the top corners in Eli Apple number one they gave him time in a good job of having presence in the pocket and stepping up and away from Joey Bosa and there's the oneonone matchup very similar route to what we saw earlier and a great effort there by Burbridge to get separation make the catch I did not give up on it pick up a few more yards battle an apple is about a wrestling going on he's able to shake the tackle of the corner there looked like the right guard that time here move when number 64 fiveyard penalty first out the backup guard this Michigan State offensive line is finally healthy they've had multiple guys this multiple games with injury shuffled parts throughout they haven't played great football but they do have their group healthy for today which they've been good about and I think that's not only important to give him a chance on the road but when you take out a quarterback who has 36 career starts and you're going to a guy who has never started a game you need that obviously but they also need to avoid mistakes and miscues like them I apply for some 15 o'connor's + escape the pressure got him Adolphus Washington having a big start to this game Adolphus Washington with Mike Bennett moving on has taken over to the interior this defensive line Joey Bosa there's 92 right in the middle it's a great effort they're working around Brian Allen well that is tremendous athletic ability for a guy close to 300 pounds his great feat as his fourth sack now in the year and strength dude we just grabbed it with one arm the quarterbacks ankle and brought down and 225 pounder they want just the yard second in 16 on her steps up again what he saw bolsa coming off the edge harry cleans it up but this is a young quarterback who's very aware of the rush now and the thing you do is a young quarterback is you look at your primary receiver watch him look at his primary and when it's not there he bails he just starts to check out he's trying to follow his back home but look at the hit there by Josh Perry lowers the boom he's getting chased from Tommy shut from behind and then Perry hits them in the face again there's Joey Bosa where they moved him around on third down they're going to keep him on the edge he right here on the edge right O'Connor this on a stock pushes the ball down field coming out of bounds and then back in verse four stout they're going to call this a good catch that inside the 30 will get Dave in here but it's all about the effort to get yourself back in to become an eligible receiver you can't just stay out of bounds just because you got pushed out of bounds you have to make an effort to work your way back in it is kind of ironic that this happens to be the Michigan State team they've got this called against him there's the push but if he makes his way back he's fine Dave what do you think that he did he try to get back in play well he's clearly forced out and you watched him run he takes two or three steps steps on the sideline to me an arrest interference defense number 13 and tunnel CS decline result of the play is the first stop he just did get a foot back down on the field to fight just before the ball arrives he got back in time plus he reestablished himself as you say Chris by getting that book down in bounds you talked earlier about how physical kind of a handtohand combat between Burbridge and Apple that is going to be a great oneonone battle throughout the game that time they actually call the interference on Apple but Michigan State decline because of the reception 36 yard gain in 30 14 always from the iformation makes the cut nice gain of hot bangs for about 10 yards on the left side before Darren Lee forced amount a heck of a run there on first and 10 it's amazing after you hit a big pass play you have been able to run all game and all of a sudden it opens up the running game and that was that was really just good blocking up front the tide in Paul laying ended up having one of the key block it allowed him to be able to set the edge and he begat the Josh Perrin open that up a little bit more there for Gerald Hollins was a physical back to tight end look on second and one Holmes emerges from the scrum down at the 12yard line its first down Michigan State you know it seems be Kelly it has some chances and try to run the football but we've not seen him have much room to run and what's been taught for Gerald Holmes that these last two plays Michigan State offensive line getting a hat on a hat and creating just enough room for Holmes be able to hit a crease there and pick up some big yards on the last two runs Spartans have not been nearly as efficient in the rezident Ohio State with the young quarterback and may produce seven and three these in motion if they could film O'Connor fire for the end zone catch me down here the pylon by Previn Pendleton touchdown Michigan State the fifth year senior fullback one of the Ohioans on this roster which is his fourth catch of the season and a great effort and a great job here find a quarterback O'Connor of throwing the ball and throwing it instead of lobbing it into the corner he put a lot of velocity on the ball and it's the reason that's important as it gives his fullback a chance to catch the ball and hit the pylon cam there there's evidence that he got to the pylon because our camera went out they hit it right there how do we live without pylon Dale toy and plays like this see his elbow doesn't touch until he hits T until he hits the pylon you know review it as they do scoring plays the Michigan State a 75yard Drive highlighted by that third and 14 completion and watch how he's right here he's going to act like he's going out here and then he turns and Josh Perry is going to try to stay with him watch Josh parry kind of wait hesitates and so he's got to throw that ball with a lot he can't throw it just hang it up the way you normally would throw that ball he recognized where Josh Perry was so he knew he kind of tried had to throw it again with a little bit of heat on it and Connor cook slowly oh what a play the veteran display Pendleton rolling on a fearless touchdown seemed pretty easy for Tom Herbert and Michigan State has answered what a drive and potential confidence builder pro Connor with that big throw in third moment that the big throw it just changed the complexion of the tribe and the feel of these of the quarterbacks and O'Connor and the offensive line they was after the long path they ran the ball for a couple plays and then that set up a really nice ball where they got the fullback which they've not throw the ball to him much there's three receptions on the entire year so kind of against their trend what they do down in this area put some velocity on it makes a heck of a catch by the big fella and reaches for the pylon his first touchdown since 2013 and Michigan State has Takata Buckeyes here in Columbus on Tuesday night 25 ranking shifts on my chickfila you guys back in the studio this week after venturing did Chicago some of the boys are yeah I think a couple of them let me know I'm user Chris Davis Kirk in the panel also streaming live on watch ESPN app on an estate second in both holes ranked number three by the playoff committee behind Clemson and Alabama coming in to head a Notre Dame / Samuel back deep to receive the kick from Cronin who drives it low and it scoots through on the west turf touchback Oklahoma certainly wants to be part of that playoff conversation and the Sooners will host TCU tonight 8 o'clock here on ABC sad news the trevone Boykin Horned Frogs quarterback not going to be able to go is he made the promo but he won't make the starting lineup it appears in Jos dachshund so many guys for the Horned Frogs are out but the suit is we want trying to build on the momentum of the game we called last week and wake up ambitious legacy of Oklahoma can play with that same intensity you and I think those were really impressed with not just the wind but how they played and how focused they were on really both sides of the football and let the guard down bedlam on the road next week right horn frog is still still dangerous but guys from the 25 and again that that part of Michigan State was support from the Mexican wine backing group really playing well I remember Ohio State I got the turnover they went 32 yards in can play to go 32 yards in Michigan State's defensive line I said it on the first series they are the real deal they're athletic they're confident and they attack the line of scrimmage and the linebackers are coming down hill and I think Ohio State again they're going to have to make plays in the pass game to be able to move the ball consistently Aaron looked briefly to throw now tries to run and cannot escape his arrest he cleaned it up big Calhoun was quickly off the edge as well it lost it with the speed of its defense and you're kind of rolling out and once you decide you're not going to throw the ball look at this defense how fast flowing they are you decide you're not going to throw it there's just nowhere to go because not just Calhoun but you have rusty there yeah Riley bull is there almost on every single play looking look out Calhoun wharfs all for Taylor Decker there's just nothing to do there for JT Barrett it runs 21 plays Kirk just to have gained more than 5 yards in third and 17 empty backfield Barrett hooks it across the middle too high for Gailen Marshall it was high and behind him and the Buckeyes go three and out and momentum swinging to the Spartan side now down to Heather Cox Chris a little bit of a weather update for you this believe it or not is Ohio State's first weather game of the season they're using six balls on each side 12 total they've also got eight more that are approved to use once these ones get too wet they've got hand warmers in each of the ball to keep said the bag to keep them warm and also Michael Thomas the receiver switch buzz from a sticky glove to a leather glove to help them out you told us you might go back to the old school leather glove five snap Johnson a very location bouncing on the ground here picked up and now returned from the 35 Johnson a very reliable thought I was a funky looking fun and grace and Miller decided to return ative for you yards that rugby style kick and I don't know if with the wet conditions if he lost control of the ball or what happened there was it blocked let's be interesting to see what happens to the football he just is a total shank it was actually deflected off of a Spartan and then Miller the true freshman picked it up he's running right to where Halden Michigan State defenders are looks like it went off safety there and Zach Leinbach got a little piece of it but one of the top punters in America with a funky punt and the sparked is set up in great field position on a tie game there's some fun mishaps in the big ten but Zach Leinbach 42 there watch the ball could be in front of the line of scrimmage so this is just that goes that's a block but then he goes off and Ohio State Clarets brillante done number 25 the running back in the ball becomes dead right there that's why I said the the 23 yard line so it's a 5 yard punt one of the career punters in the country LJ Scott is the tailback watch the handle momentarily knocked down after a loss remember he's the guy that fumble twice last week psyche Juan Luis on the tax hike Juan Luis really good job of getting it some penetration but I don't know if there is it is this think the ball looked like it was in I don't know you bumble a couple times last week maybe you start worrying and thinking about a little bit two months for the true freshman just a big hall athletic runner that has a bright future in East Lansing they thought eventually you might take over and become the levee on bail for this offense this year just you know for some guys it takes a little bit longer but he will be a future star here my my over in Ohio lost four in the first town carry whistles and it's going to be a shovel pass flag before the staff offense we're not set for a second if I ruled it to the start fiveyard penalty second out Raekwon McMillan came running up to the line of scrimmage and just slammed on the brakes before the ball was snapped Emily on Michigan State Antonio knows this is one of those moments you get the break with the awful punt the great field position you paddle hard without Connor cook feel it you need police out of this Drive is your Dantonio yeah great field position the best of the day you lose yardage on the first play we almost fumble LJ Scott and you have a false start second and 19 O'Connor at the last minute flips it incomplete pass is the ruling there was the hesitation was it a lateral but O'Connor who's in the grasp just able to escape boast and get the ball away it's tough to deal with Joey Bosa and right now they've actually moved Donovan Clark who plays from guard and tackle in mounted right tackle that is a tough matchup one on one for anybody 76 look at Bose he gets pushed back just relentless never gives up on the play and almost comes up with it's at an example doesn't go down as a fact look one of the productive coy is one of the many made and what everybody says has been a terrific year for him despite the drop off his back absolutely not always about the facts of the numbers you turn on the film and watch the maybe seven he makes so many plays very much French field goal range in these conditions though in third and long they flip it short here this is Delton Williams the first touch for the junior from Erie he gets some of the lost yardage back to the 25 a more reasonable field goal attempt now that's one way to deal with Joey Bosa just kind of bade him there's a quarterback and then shuffle pass underneath him the very least that gives him a shot here two field goal to maybe take the lead for Michael Geiger a thirdyear kicker at a terrific freshman year struggled a bit midseason slump but he's worked his way out hasn't missed to kick in the last four games this from 43 into the breeze knuckles wide never really had a chance if he's going to miss one it usually does hook to the left so Dan Tonio's team unable to cash in the forefront a blown opportunity for Mark Dantonio for the Spartans and at the same time a big stop for the Ohio State defense after that horrible pun Michigan State giving great field position there is a young man who's probably happier than anybody now we said it's going to be very tricky conditions for the specialists all afternoon four and a half until halftime he gave stay sighs camera Johnston's had such a great year and even last year so that makes a mistake you got to be able to shake it off and get back to being the punter that he's been the last couple years he said so relieved it didn't cost his team berra throws near psychologist drafted everybody boggling with these wet conditions as we send it back to camp city hobart for an update Taco Bell studio at USC and Oregon Vernon Adams Darren Carrington out of 30 pass of the game dunk of 2114 this game over on ESPN elsewhere in the pac12 UCLA leading number 13 Utah ten to three loser of that game will be eliminated for the pac12 South detention guys but the Ducks to go to Stanford a win and now leading USC after many had given up on that at one point they lost to two of three games they're sitting there at three and three they may win out finish nine and three win a bowl game another ten win season we second attend shovel pass into heavy traffic and nothing they're just completely clogging the middle I was banette who got it they're waiting for that that's reading your static report and understanding it look at the linebackers just attacking downhill I mean they're not hate now Shane Jones number 49a back up to bola got quick ease in there I mean the net didn't have a chance but he got the football in the shovel pass he looks up at 49s right in his face they took every aspect of that away they took the quarterback Barrett away with Calhoun and the shuffle pass with the line and jokes when third and nine option look Barrett flips the tackle will be knocked down short of the first down by five yards Riley Bullough there's some grumbling from the Ohio State fans another punt coming up again continue to repeat myself until it changes but they are just attacking down hill at JC Barrett it's be Kelly it's a running game Ohio State and JT Barrett they knew coming in they'd have to make plays in the passing game and if they don't start getting the ball on the perimeter and trying to get the ball to the outside and down field it's going to be tough sledding against this Michigan State defense three completions total of 20 yards this is more like the camera Johnson we expect to see these things makes the fair catch at the 28 you got pretty close though as far as special teams have been much of my mind but this was nearly putting Johnson under pressure again it's wrapped yell the rugby kick and he went back to more of the traditional convoy Michigan State so close no noteworthy of course the fail fun identify Michigan so many big ten games have been closed down to the wire involving Michigan State and Michigan Ohio State hasn't had the complete scare yet now they go with Damian Sarah Kirk 3:13 until halftime of the two backup quarterbacks who are playing today known more as the dual guy he can throw but also has the ability to run the zone read and some option look the sprint run and Terry gets around the corner and knocked down after a 5 yard first down game without Connor Cook in a game Tyler O'Connor and Damian Terry they've had to be aware of what they need to deal with against this high of a defense and there's what with the Joey Bosa done if you take him away with a doubleteam it opens up for other defenders that time it was Sam Hubbard also what he can do as far as not just against the run of the past me it says relentless effort at time before so Connor to have to throw the ball before he was ready but Michigan State's trying to settle in and build their plan away from 97 with these quarterback second is five in the back you became it takes the hand there from the receiver does make a first attic flag comes in boast of a Lombardi finalist so unselfish this season always cited by the coaches Holdings often number 65 and yard penalty repeat second down younger Allen brother Brian Brian Allen just the guard was trying to make a block here he goes down on the ground and just grabs a hold of the ankle of Tommy shut the umpires I almost just looking right down on and saying that's another blunder another mistake that was an easy call for young fires right right right beneath them the Allen brother has been shuttered all the way guys played in the same conference in high school so you know that's going to be a battle in the pit well those guys go getting all the tricks for the trap second in 14 very looks near sideline you off the hands of Kings doesn't quite have the passing proficiency of O'Connor W no no I know they have a plan with cook out how they're going to use the two quarterbacks like just by watching them here in this first half I really feel that Kyle or O'Connor started to settle in a little bit and seems to kind of fit with what they're trying to do throwing the football run the ball will be back and tried to throw the football Tyler O'Connor that's where they've been straight to their came all year as the passing it comes off the bench he had a completion on the third and 14 the last time facing this situation yes sir what's new your sign is work completion and knock down as king so it's more found the conservative play call that's the beauty of being able to rush for and get pressure and be able to drop seven guys than in coverage play soft zone keep everything in front of you and still get pressure make the quarterback get the ball out of his hands but everybody rallies to the ball we're seeing both of these defensive lines making it very challenging on both of the offenses in this first half you know talking to cook about the challenges of a prostyle offense all the verbage you've got to get out in the huddle over this crowd noise a play like Roger wings shadows sevenweek toss naked right who's your alert spider 2 y banana that's a that's an actual play you're going to yelled out over this crowd noise in the huddle very famished very tough to do is a good food from heart Barger and Marshall feels upon the bounce of stage and knock down at the 35 so a minute five to go before halftime yes it's fight or to live a ten I did as a judge room special equipment what do you can't throw that off of it do i bananas Oh so watch ESPN app you can stream every game live down liner to go to watch espn.com essential for a college football fan I knew you'd appreciate the Gruden Academy of reference though but the fact is this offense the Michigan State runs with so many complicated sounding plays as opposed to what we see like so many other operas they worth the kind word they may have had to adjust that with with the backups playing and go to the wristband and allow them to be able to look at you that wristbands as much as they can but that matters a mouthful into on the road they get the wristband numbers signaled in but then he's got to spit all that stuff out what would the Buckeyes do different a slow grinding offense so far no big plays don't think you need to see some players in the past game in order to open up this potential this offense play action on first down though who the ball downfield cracks together to server his hands and a shot against Demetrius oneonone just overthrown see that's the match oh that's we keep asking when will they go to this when will they take some chances Braxton Miller matched up against the safety oneonone and you know even though Cox has ability to cover he played some corner this year because of some injuries it's still a matchup the Ohio State wants to take advantage of because of the speed of Braxton Miller he got separation that time he had JT Barrett just not quite on the same page and we change of direction Department that's a huge mismatch Miller oh gosh you saw it right there they got to go back to the enemy defense if they want to move the ball you have to make plays throwing and Barrett pressure knocked down Thomas makes the catch on the far side it'll be third down the Capital One halftime report John Saunders Mark may Mack Brown will have analysis of this one scores and highlights around the country in 44 seconds on the clock and running third and five Thomas is now caught a pass in 27 consecutive game is one of the juniors perhaps playing his final home game here I prospect well different than last year's collision between these two in East Lansing when Ohio State scored seven touchdowns in eight possessions after missing leave early field goal yeah it was really one of those games where Ohio State became I think a different team as far as respect and who Ohio State could potentially be with the first year the play off the night they left East Lansing it was a different team but I'll tell you what this is a different year and Ohio State is a different set of challenges as they've had all year with this office you know they can run the ball but if they're going to be teams like Michigan State down the road Michigan and if they get to a Big Ten championship game you got to have balance you have to have a threat to be able to throw the ball and they've not had that and until they show that tonight gonna be tough to run the ball against Michigan State we talked herb and I said do you mind the fact that even though your offense has been brutally effective it's a little boring of vanilla said I hate it I hate it but I like being that glass of wine after a victory at 10 o'clock at night so he does what's going to win in the games but he's not comfortable with this as a play caller oh no and I think I don't know if anybody would be comfortable with this as a play caller because urban miner typically has offenses that are explosive and are balanced and when you rely just on running the football as good as he Kelley it is as good as this offensive line is and running the football you play against better defenses where you just can't use better talent you've got to be able to kind of mix up and use the scheme you've got to be able to throw the ball and have the balance he said that after the game last week when they were in Champaign I our collective extend back hose upstairs that Warner the cooffensive coordinator offensive line coaches on the sidelines week 11 in the NFL in ten o'clock Eastern Time and if insiders Sunday edition gets it started in eleven o'clock Sunday NFL countdown I was made of Cam Newton's TD celebration last week find out what folks like white shoes Johnson ickey woods Terrell Owens thought of it all tomorrow morning on ESPN can't brag about the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals anymore now you notice I didn't say anything that's why I brought or not deceptive it was a rough Monday night to watch 38 seconds to go on this third and five if they could could Samuel Barrett will now flip it to him in the flat and he's knocked out about the short of the first down by Darian heck's the Ohio native is waiting a year for this game is there some mistakes that he made in last year's home loss but the Spartan defense does their job again well again they're they're attacking the line of scrimmage and they're playing a lot more zone than they have had in the past usually they play a lot of mantoman and I think Hicks took the loss last year at Ohio State personally because of those mitts tackles and he had beaten coverage and you can tell he's playing with a little bit of an edge the second round against Ohio State and JT Barrett absolutely missed the tackle on Thomas and that slant that really turned the game around in East Lansing back Johnston Kings did not call a fair catch at the for a while that's crazy in this condition it just filled in the pundit the poor takes the hit as Perry Maclaurin flew down there in coverage with 21 seconds to go that's risky it is especially when you're still you know playing a couple quarterbacks that you're still trying to get some confidence established and you don't have Connor Cook back there you should always you put your heels extend the 10yard line and if you go back you always just let the ball go especially late and a half length this whole McGarrett thought he was going to go 96th a you're not going anywhere you're going to take a knee in to kill the clock anyway so a first half deep fine perhaps the absence of cook shaped by the conditions and the conservative gameplan of Ohio State 77 if you're Dantonio and you've got 124 total yards and you gain 50 more then you're off opposition 1 after quarter but you're thrilled at halftime are you kidding me if you get real white Marc Dantonio they're sprinting off here they're feeling really good about what they did you're right they deferred to get the ball to start the second half a lot of tension in the horseshoe on Senior Day as the undefeated Buckeyes 7/7 with Michigan State the Capital One caps on pork it's coming up and hazard will speak with Mark Dantonio right after these messages welcome back to the dr. pepper championship drive game of the week set for the second half in Columbus ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers his swirling rain here in Ohio Stadium 7 apiece at halftime as Ohio State's offense Kurt has had for three announced their 1 touchdown drive was a 10play 32 yard drive after a take away it's been very strange Michigan State's offense deserves a lot of credit but so does the play calling Ohio State had 28 plays in the first half 16 of those plays were for three yards or less so I think it tells you a lot about how they struggled offensively and yeah let's face the use Connor cook within 36 career starts and you go on the road in this environment you start a young quarterback two young quarterbacks Michigan State's going to be very happy with how they play there was a two plays sequence there they all said good hand sequence here this is it this is the 1314 playing when Burbridge is pushed out of bounds fights back and makes a 36year and I think that was the turning point in a game it set up this touchdown a really good throw by by O'Connor and the way he was able to place the football and gave Pendleton a chance to reach for that pylon which are pylons damn caught and tied this football game up that kind of changed the momentum of the game it says it wasn't a tie game it really changed the field in Stadium and the confidence that the Michigan State team had without Connor Cook we knew this Big Ten weather will play a part but if you like your football close to the bat this is the game for you forget all that those deep shots all that big 12 stuff this is just grinding stuff a Pacific Life game summary 75 yards total offense for Ohio State Barrett had the one deep shot when Braxton Miller was open to the overthrow and you'd love to be inside that locker room and wonder and hear what what Urban Meyer's said to that team along with that Warner and sent back because they've got to make some changes we were calling for it up here they've got to throw the football they've got to throw the football even then four conditions if they want to open up their offensive try to move the ball consistently it's the only shot they have because they're not going to able to run the ball against at Michigan State defense if you align with excellent defense to make a play or on a fix defenders have scored four touchdowns this season this is mom it's a couple of yards again if you joined this late Connor cook Ohio native who's never played a game in the stadium was so keyed up but the shoulder injury he suffered last week against Maryland just couldn't deliver the ball with any velocity so he has had to sit this one out and watch O'Connor and Terry tread operated tough conditions tough for him personally he really wanted to play in the horseshoe growing up in Ohio at the stove wash shed to a high school up in the Cleveland area he played against Ohio State twice was 1 and 1 this is coming to tiebreaker he's had to spit it out and going to be impressed with what Dave Warner has done with Tyler O'Connor and Damian Terry in that first half let's see if they're able to avoid that disastrous play in the second half that is important as anything for the young quarterback Connor made its change in the play clock at one of these snaps it always has a little gap ran through the arm tackle of closer moves the file for a first down down to Heather Cox Chris you talked about the importance of this game to Connor cook I've been watched and throughout the first half he's very involved very supportive but a little bit more background on the week he had every intention all week long of playing he participated in every practice he didn't make any throws he played in all the running plays and then O'Connor came in for the passing plays he did four hours of therapy each and every day trying to rehab that shoulder stem and Intel warmup when he didn't have velocity didn't have zip on the ball he and Dantonio decided to pull the plug on him he had more hopeful than realistic Heather I agree with you this is Delton Williams again look at the injury that was suffered early in the game against Maryland cook there's a strong guy but he doesn't have the the bulkiest upper body landed on that throwing shoulder tried to come back in didn't have a lot of zip didn't agree the decision to pull him out at halftime but a bit reaction right there sold unit wasn't much serious than Michigan State was leading on this week are very vague and almost defensive throughout most of the week with the local media about his helm they were very secretive it but it was a bit of a block from crook as well he beat something he thought he'd be good he probably wouldn't be Williams this is way for a short gain it will be third and three Michigan State working ensued the wind the rain getting heavier perhaps snow on the way you really feel like at the next score in this game is just monstrous well I think if you're in a 7 7 game with weather and with teams struggling offensively truth by scoring points not only to give you to lead it gets the other team starting to feel a little bit uneasy and they start to panic a little bit so that next score for whoever it might be will be big for either Cajuns able to get those points edible because you put so much pressure on the opposing offense empty backfield on 3rd and 3 now they motioned Shelton back in Bakke Costello passed O'Connor just couldn't get a film and he's knocked down by Rick Quan McMillan and Darren Lee it will be fourth down I sniff that out yeah but guys with a very very good play there to start the second half on third down joy Bose is so effective you know it's not just the pass rush abilities but it's an ability to defend the run when they run option football he helped take away RJ Shelton that time and force the quarterback to keep it then ran down the line and it was involved in a stop keep him short of the first down now take our quarter the wind is howling in his face just open you could get the snap and get away you need a sense that every punt Kirk is the potential misadventure in this game for both sides absolutely beverage team touches it at the 12 a net for Ohio State will take over deadlock before let's take a look at who's been putting in work brought to you by car Hardin is the Michigan State defense been putting in work we've seen Malik McDowell make plays by getting penetration how about the defensive line who dominated the first half eating up double teams and freeing up Riley bulla and the rest of those linebackers even the back of Shane Jones who is out of Cincinnati Ohio closing in and making play so they are attacking the line of scrimmage and the Ohio State Office 28 snaps 16 of those snaps for three yards or less a guys have had the last three possessions be free and out with a total of two yards being Elliott knocked down yes they're tough conditions but this is a Michigan State defense that has been giving up huge plays lots of people not even great passing teams it started three true freshmen against Nebraska got destroyed back there everybody has really thrown deep liniments ooh it began to get things together last week yeah the Hicks came back from some injuries he was back at move Demetrius Cox back to safety Nicholson playing better cohoon so it's the best there second there is look the last two weeks pump fake from the jet sweep from barity star jizz board another conservative play call third down again but to your point and what we looked at all week and we kind of anticipated was with the way Michigan State secondary has been exploited the weakness clearly is their secondary even with this Stephen with Hicks back and cocked back and safety between the front seven and trying to run the ball against that front seven or trying to get them in space and throw the ball you rather take the ladder but Ohio State at this points only throwing for 29 yards against that Michigan State defense both Miller and Samuel in the slot the barracks left on third down he rolls that direction pump fakes and delivers off the hands of Jalen Marshall a couple of drops by Buckeye receivers today and a Michigan State defense that it only forced 29 three and outs 1012 in the conference the fifth time today they've done it they roll them away from the pressure but because he's late with the ball Michigan State's still able to get pressure on him and he had a wide open Jalen Marsh we see oh he's hesitant then he came back Jalen Marshall threw the ball with some velocity up high making it pretty tough on Marshall to come down with that catch for the first down anxious punters on both sides and now it's Johnston's turn to just hope that he can collect a snap and get things away that low goofy fun early this one is driven back to qingxue collected at the 33 man McGarrett Kings knocked down after a 2 yard return their spartans turn on offense on a dreary cold day in the big 10 ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers rockin by the restyled Accord from Honda Pacific Life for life insurance annuities and investments to specific life the power to help you succeed and I see hot Marguerite tens therapy turn off hey back with a dr. pepper

consecutive three and out Spartans give the first touch of the ball game to moderate London's they've used four different running backs which they've been doing this year but in tough conditions you come off cold invention and football the first time yes that means you have confidence is a group that they'd have gotten it done all year they've got to battle through some injuries almost all of them but that this game as it goes on and kills four more more like a game where both teams don't want to be the team to make the mistake they're erring on the side of caution and not being very aggressive because they don't want to have the lose field position battle and have a turnover or something bad happen to the offense street keeper is terry common he almost lost to handle the ball Taekwon lewis brings him down after a short games backtoback plays like Taekwon lewis a sophomore who become to the attention that Joey Bosa receives that makes Alana plays comes into this game with 11 tackles for a loss he has six and a half sacks he got off to the block and again with a c6 go in there they're not thinking as much about pass they're thinking about some kind of quarterback run game in that time nice play by Lewis to come down and make the play was out now he comes back in third and five London is still the back very straight run again quarterback tweet first down midfield steps out there so again cautious put that time effective yeah and a great block by price that tied in here on the right they just do a good job look right in front of you right there nice job is setting the edge there and now they got some room some speed thereby tarrying 235 pounds but it was the block there the doubleteam by Clark and price on Joey Bosa the got him to the corner I'm serious that's the right side not many seams run to the left of Ohio State Stevens very effectively where bolson Darren Lee and off and Vaughn belair patrolling it was a big conversion uncertain 5 it sure was keeps the drive alive and more importantly gives him great field position they're now in plus territory and they back it up with a sixyard gain with quarterback run game again with Damian Terry beam's motions to the backfield they give it to him here the footing may become an issue kind of a tentative cut by the receiver there throw down again I think they give Kings as many touches as they can just because he is so fast and had it all he needs is just a little bit of room and he can pick up 5 10 15 yards in a hurry it's a very different feel from all the other backs that they have were a little bit more physical and even though he's a receiver he had background in high school plants and tailback and knows what to do with the ball let's get one important for up in there London was met by Joshua Perry it'll be fourth down a good job at a senior read that played perfectly nobody got up to the second level is a good job I owe space defensive line of office Washington and company eating up those blocks he said you could see how easy it was for Perry nobody climbed up to that next level to get him it's close down on it but field position gets potentially adjusted depending on how this punt goes for the Spartans the Antonio elect not to attempt to pass in that sequence and now Hart partner try to pin the Buckeyes deep I kick into the wind marshal steps up to make a diving fair catch at the 15yard line that's trusting your hand shelter from the storm today we all state bus amenity all states with sweepstakes for a chance winner thousand bucks plus the VIP trip for the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game as well as weekly prizes throughout the season one hundred eight thousand nine hundred seventy five a new attendance record here although some fans that they have made the choice to set head home and watch this in a warmer drier place many are still here idols hoping their Buckeyes can can make a play here Barrett went to keep her happy face and that's the first first down they've made since their touchdown drive what's interesting here is Shelley Calhoun slips it fall watch money into the line of scrimmage he goes down and that's what gave JT Barrett a little bit of room to be able to get away from that pressure the he's felt on almost every single snap from this defensive line so the conditions in the pudding there of Calhoun opened that up for JT Barrett we wonder what's Meyer who back and it Warner we'll think about calling in this Drive varaluz creamer immediately by Joey Greg Evans there you know it's easier to throw this direction into the wind of the fourth quarters gonna be a little tougher again it will be the conditions are going to get worse and worse before how about Fred Evans a freshman out of Wisconsin he gets off of his block and shows the speed of the big fella 318 pounds closed in on the ball care boy he is this entire defensive line so far just has a great football game does Evans can again write he is four run stopper interior line the motion Miller out from the backfield is Barrett straight ahead our move backwards to gain yardage it will set up a third and free now adjuster will power from JT Barrett there was not a whole lot of room there once again into the interior the Michigan State defense the strength of their defense I estate continuing to challenge the Michigan State defensive line and linebackers he stopped right there for about a two yard game but just continues to get great effort he's not done yet picks up another three or four yards they need three on third down empty backfield again bunch formation to the right he's wouldn't bet against the quarterback keeper here these partners are ready for the plan bear down foot of the first Denison booze time I mean you saw it I saw it and you know more importantly saw it Harlan Barnett Mark Dantonio and the Michigan State defense in Harlan actually Damon Knox that time got off of his block seems like we're calling different names the entire time we've called McDowell and Lawrence Thomas Joel V Shelley Calhoun Dimitri's Cooper Craig Evans and now David not that's great point we've seen them rotate in with success the linebackers that made a bunch of plays hardly talked about this secondary food hamburger week it's because they have been tested by great you have to throw the ball to be able to talk about the secondary Johnson has been tested if you took him today the five and Decimus thank you can decide the game we just talked about these two teams are trying to avoid the disastrous play both teams are erring on the side of being cautious nobody wants to be the guy that's going to make the mistake and here's Kings making that mistake with the wind and the rain the ball gets away from them and a good effort by the Ohio State coverage team getting down there looked like the freshman Terry Maclaurin is able to come down there and get on top of the football there's the mistake at Ohio State now gets great field position to see if they can capitalize I'll say it you just Dantonio your kid believe it in a day like this just better let that thing bound like he's actually just trying to say hey you got to shake it he's not going to lay it to him right there maybe the fill broom but not right there mr. whirling wind looked like the ball got away from of the last minute to extend his arm so first and goal for Ohio State at this they're onehanded catch an ohio state takes the lead foot passes haven't seen in the second half they've been running and running and running and running it especially if I def 5yard line Michigan State is thinking more about the run game they were lined up to stop JT Barrett from running the football over proud of the line of scrimmage created a oneonone opportunity on the outside sophomore new murder last year's kicker was just ruining the job back with the VAD but guys 1470 here is Harris the linebacker here's Jalen Marshall but by showing rod you get the linebackers out of position and it creaks creates a nice big window behind them it's a matchup right there with Jalen Marshall against a linebacker he's going to win that matchup every single time and Urban Meyer ed Warner and sent back just waiting for the right time to try to call some playaction Paulson pass plays and they wait after the big turnover the first play JT Barrett fakes the linebackers in the oneonone matchup with Marshall inherits the Buckeyes for another touchdown for the touchdown reception for Marshall he's got a couple of drops today but the onehanded snag Antonia really felt like his team needed to be +2 or better and turnovers they are 2 today in the Buckeyes have passion both mistakes in a touchdown a team is plus 13 third the nation coming in on the road in this environment as you said they knew they had to be plucked and coming in to be able to win this game without Connor cook there they're at minus two and just want to do a boy that that that play that disastrous play that could it end up costing you a ballgame we'll see if it does which have been giving final days now why wouldn't be wait a minute back knees he touch back tonight on ABC at 8 o'clock down to the 12 expected in with winsome you seen here at CCU shorthanded no boyfriend no dachshund missing so many guys against Baker Mayfield who's thrown his hat in the heisman ring lately no doubt about it especially the way he played last week he has done so much but his team all year I would argue the last five weeks the Oklahoma Sooners that played as well as anybody in the country and it has a lot to do with Baker Mayfield he is the guy that they're feeding off to his energy not just playing well with the numbers but when you watch him play he affecting his offense in his defense into confidence overall the Oklahoma super team so now they go back to Tyler O'Connor there was Terry in the last for human women in this barn often facing a sevenpoint deficit the last time this office fell behind after a Michigan State misty they were able to answer Ohio save the long Casandra they're running into the boundary that Ohio State defensive line was actually slanting and angling into the boundary and as Dolphus Washington continues to have a great football game he just kind of waited and waited and waited with the block of Brian Allen and then got off of him threw him away and made the play on home they put it back to Shelton the change of direction their favorite breaks loose first down and more across the 40 corporate Miller drama actually got Josh Perry out of position watch him right here linebacker see how he moves out of the way and by him following the play to the field there was nobody there to be able to slow this down that he picks up a couple good blocks and there's the speed he does out Randall Dollfuss Washington and Michigan State with a big gain there little misdirection gets to Ohio State napping the first touch were Shelton who's usually a part of this often from this block position once women play of the game 18 yards home last time both the dragging down but not before a fiveyard gain where they are doing a lot of slanting watch the defensive line slanting and angling if they're moving this way it's really close to Darren Lee blitzing got to get off the block of Clark and pretty impressive with Holmes and a leg straight there to carry Joey Bosa for Bobby four or five yards and up close this is the heck of a nephron five sports free better step into the second area Michigan State moving another first hand of the Ohio State 37 about Jack Allen and just a nasty leader on that offensive line takes on Raekwon McMillan whose blessing right in the middle you'll see number five blitz right there boom 66 does a great job of picking up that block he also saw Brandon Clemons 64 some good blocks up front took Darren Lee out of the picture and kid Gerald Holmes with a little bit of room to run with Brandon Clemons the guard was helped down we got to give a salute to this this Michigan State offensive line and Jack Allen just like his counterpart Jacoby born both of them are finalists for the Campbell trophy which is the academic Heisman be given out in New York in a few weeks the center's there are three of the 12 players who are finalists but center so the cerebral guys idol of the oline they really are those they're like quarterbacks or the offensive line they make so many different calls that fans would be amazed how much talk there is between offensive lineman while there while the crowds yelling and making noises they're turning and making sure the guards and the tackles everybody is on the same page but it all starts in the middle there and Jack Allen is is a terrific player for Michigan State over the years or his down play with O'Connor eats it dimes before in the final minute of the third quarter Jalen Holmes made the tackle the rain has now stopped the wind is still whipping and the turnaround the fourth quarters would be at the back of Michigan State definitely see that wind he brought up a good point about the fourth quarter Michigan State will have the wind at their back in that fourth quarter who she can say this would be and he readily impressive performance by this offense that they were able to answer Ohio State's one play touchdown drive homes behind him Dothan he cuts back to the left he flying in there to make the fact of its Gailen home when caroled home yes and it'll be third down when the final quarter starts here Ohio State's 23 game winning streak will straight at home on the line as well as playoff ups for both teams final quarter coming up after this message and a word for local ABC station we all say good hands play Kirk is the best display of the hands we've seen in a chilly rainy afternoon Gailen Marshall with one hand goes up and collects the jump pass from GT Barrett and that's the difference right now 147 yeah the Ohio State is very fortunate with the 2tone turnovers they've had a drive for 32 yards and a touchdown and a drive for 6 yards and a touchdown so collectively they have driven 38 yards for their two touchdowns but the benefit of a plus 2 in the turnover margin is the reason they've got their points under 5 yards total often for Ohio State three three quarters Michigan State basting 1/3 an age when your fist is at four down territory for Dan Tonio's offense under Aaron Burr bridge it's the goto man in these situations typically the empty backfield fourman rush there kind of delivers in the pocket and if incomplete Raekwon McMillan who's all over the receiver Burbridge there and so now at fourth and eight they don't get anything in the third down play and will that save the decision it's a really tough call at the beginning of the fourth quarter you know you either going to go for this you're probably going to punt it and try to pin Ohio State inside the 5 or 10 yard line even with the wind at his back this would be a 52yard field goal attempt for Geiger which is a little too optimistic fourth down the Spartans keep the drive going whistle blows I came across into the neutral zone and then there was a flinch in the michigan state side if that's on Joey that's his third today it's gonna lie on state which makes it a much more comfortable fourth into three now he's trying to get a jump at the top of your screen trying to get around and its height in you saw moving and reacting to Bosa but he got back three the reaction from the tide in is what they called on Bosa you only have three penalties Ohio State all three of them at them both of that things benefit so now fourth and three O'Connor the in traffic here's the first down and more down in signed a 20 when I watched the push on the right side by Joey Bosa and Adolphus Washington they pushed him back but he gets around it and then put underneath the block of Hosea fright what a good push by Ohio State but a nice job by Tyler O'Connor of getting around it then picking up the yard the spartans operate with tempo after making the first down Holmes slipped down after two yards that father O'Connor they're crisper God that has not played a lot of football and is known as more of a passer Terry Moore the option guy really good instincts and feel they're on a crucial fourth down getting around that's that penetration and push of Washington and Bosa and then the feel to be able to get behind the block of Josiah price was a bigtime play there on fourth down by the junior you cross off and Damian Perry the sophomore comes vacuum Terry run all the way makes the cut collision knocked down by Joshua ferry it'll be a third and short Michigan State didn't attempt to pass in the third quarter and now Terry having to limp off he think this to be his kind of play on third and great four yards and drives have been very very tough to come by for both these offenses ten play than 53 yards so far on this drive for Michigan State Dantonio thinking few plays to get to three hours here and forget about the field open Oh Connor furry keeper makes the cut person goal what great patience I thought he might pitch it but he hung on to it he's going to get Eli Apple 13 right there put a good little head and shoulder fake Apple went out onto the pitch and another great job there by power O'Connor just a good feel running the option for Michigan State Michigan State he's moved 68 yards in 11 plays granular cover from the disastrous fumble points in tight end block Holmes makes the cut flip the baffle and powers down to the two really good vision there by Gerald Holmes sophomore out of Flint Michigan play was designed to go to the right but the higher state defense collapsed to his left like all great backs you got to have vision especially down inside that fiveyard line he's able to pick up some positive yards for Michigan State get it down to two yard line but that was just to get another good feeling division on 63 yards rushing he's out rushed Ezekiel Elliott the stud in this conference of that position so far looks like Luke fickle ran out of the field to call timeout so now state spends 1 on defense second and goal Michigan State trying to tie it Michigan State yards away from trying to tie this game early a fourth quarter this is kind of Flintstone football I mean the quarterbacks have carried it more than the running backs for both teams for if we have 12 completed passes for 120 combined passing yards that's amazing stat for Michigan State 22 runs only the one pass second down it's not third down yet second down the option has been pretty effective you know once inside this red zone you wonder if they might give Connor O'Connor a chance to run the football game down here home with the tailback and listen in the backfield your tone meant quickly but spins that reaches for touchdown now take another look but another great effort by Cheryl home I think he got across it is you're right about the effort he got hit right there by Tai Kuan Lewis the knee is not touched it just breaks the plane that looks like a touchdown to me a 75yard Drive in 13 plays took six and a half minutes after Ohio State had questioned the fumble punt for a touchdown what a performance of this offense with two backup quarterbacks today this team is playing with an edge to him we heard all week about how upset they were about how big of underdog they were they felt disrespected and they have played without Connor Cook they played with an attitude I love the option here to keep this drive alive by Tyler Akana got him down inside the five yard line and the rest of the way with Gerald home showing toughness running right through Taekwon Lewis and into the end zone for the touchdown to tie it up ESPN college football presented by Kay Jewelers Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay cialis and Mission Impossible rogue nation owned it on bluray December 15 like white contract thus to house a fans have to appear and regain right sure seems that way Michigan State to kick off now after a long punishing touchdown drive on the ground tremendous resilience shown by this team Cronin's proof again through the end zone our Pacific Life game summary we'll look at the misuse by Michigan State that set up Ohio State touchdowns Terry it by a Booker T Washington would fall on the ball and Ohio stay with you go 32 yards and a whole bunch of plays and then Kings fumbles the fun a one way touchdown drive I got to jail and Marshall for the touchdown the Michigan State how about the answer Tyler O'Connor keeping this drive alive with a couple option run so that Gerald homers goes into the end zone with some hardnosed running to tie it up at 14 and Ohio State offense now gets the ball back not only they have just 105 yards they have four first downs and the entire football game Wow in seven months Barrett option look pitch and Miller out of the backfield pushed out for a fiveyard gain by Darion Hicks Cassidy Aubert thanks Chris unbeaten Euston trailing 13 to 3 Connecticut House huh it's chance Allen to the 38 yard score right now it's 13 to 9 this game over on ESPNU you confidently Tom mermans Boston Houston new call to play as for Ohio State and their championship here this offense not presenting that group at all at the moment second and five Barrett delivers nearside catch made by Thomas with a punch the Spartans converge and quickly it'll be third and two you've got to get the ball to the outside to give your speed a chance to make plays against the secondary of Michigan State Zeke Elliott still sitting out the last play in this play as well coming up on this third and short but yeah is going to come back into the game and sometimes you know he can come into the game and just block I mean he is one of the better blockers you'll see in college football to help JT Barrett run the football as he can bust the long run the fourth quarter his streak of hundred yard games is in serious trouble at 15 Elliott 11 for 32 so far miss Barrett would good blocking by deep right on appeal it and they move the same a lot of times you know you expect the Heisman Trophy candidate to just be worried about running but if I'm the quarterback I don't mind following number 15 a nice job by the line also blocked by chase Paris but see Kelly just chops to linebacker right there Reilly bullet down and there's the room to run actually he got Darion Harris I chase Farris maybe got bulla but now you have better field position and still been waiting for Ohio State to attack down field throwing the football it's the one deep shot the over throats the Miller early on others in this flop to the left and Barrett Lauterbach looking downfield now just throws into the Banshee under a heavy pressure there by Lawrence Thomas and no flag well it's really really good coverage I think the coaches were thinking the same thing they wanted to go down field but they took all the receivers away and Lawrence Thomas came it's JT Barrett high after he threw the football but he was close enough that as soon as he threw the ball he made contact and he followed through and ended up coming down on top of him discussion whether or not it was grounding the ball did go beyond the line and he's also outside of the tackle box so as long as it goes past the line of scrimmage he's okay but Thomas brought all 305 right down on top of the quarterback there come on state and hundred five yards Kirk three three quarters no team all season are powerful had the lead after three with that New York Elliot just nowhere to escape got a yards at Thomas and Bowa closed it down yeah it's slow developing play against the defense it's attacking downhill defensive linemen and linebackers that are playing with confidence and don't feel threatened when you don't feel threatened downfield you just pin your ears down and you take away JT Barrett's running and you take away deke Elliot's running and it feels something happens to make you come out of that that mentality that's what you're going to do especially on first and second down so far boy I get Mark Dantonio in this defensive staff all the credit the world for the plan they put together a guy's need nine go down berrak basting a bliss delivers nearside catch made by bad net but not enough for the first down but before yards short see if he did get the feet down but that time if she can say brought a bunch of white pressure it sure did something we they've not been bringing a ton of pressure with man coverage but this time they did in Monty Nicholson was caught with his eyes in the backfield there was a big cushion between the tied in and the safety Nicholson who had him but because the pressure Barrett had to get the ball out of his hands quickly and my escape well for the first down made a change in punt returner RJ Shelton and after Kings mishandled that last one and he's not going to feel that just lift this thing bound and the Buckeyes do a tremendous job one of the best in the country they knock it dead down at the 2 yard line Gary and Conway a starting corner down there made the play in Michigan staple deep in bash taking over in this tie game Robert Kraft Patriots owner among the luminaries ticket in this game today as Patriots where they get to ten and OH Monday night against bills no love lost in that rivalry countdown is it about half will be at six o'clock kickoff at 8:15 to research under for something latest season weather here the rain has let up the wind has died down a bit and still at the fact that Michigan State he takes over at the 4yard London over there in front we haven't seen any rain the entire second half nearly raining it was kind of a steady drizzle don't tell Heather that and it's supposed to do the morning a terrific I'm trying to make it tough from the young quarterback and a true freshman tailback on the day Scott leaned the iformation Scot has it in birth forward nice game still running protecting the ball but making yard deaf to the 24 nice job being pinned back deep in their own territory Ohio State's thinking about flipping the field walks the linemen get up nice block again by the center Jack Allen we also saw get up to the second level and get with LJ Scott a physical runner you can see when you don't slow it down he's got some speed as well now a safe team that is used to bullying people the line of scrimmage they are being outplayed in the trenches on both those who drove out to the ball from the beginning of the game from the opening series of the game bucks it back picks up about five other well Christy noticed in that last party so that's a no Damian Perry option in the reso and the reason he tweaked his right ankle had it repaid over issue he's walking very gingerly but had a conic Trina Sally Noble told me he is cleared to return so Michigan State can go back to that suit quarterback system if they sued Heather thank you you can figure that was just being an emergency situation it looks like O'Connor's game Conor is really settled into the game it was after the throw that he made the Burbridge on that fade had set up their first touchdown to Pendleton he seems to just a relaxed and he's just playing right now young Scott and the freshman showing the strength again yet another Ohioan on this roster highly motivated to play as a young guy and bounce back from that to plunder for famine Plattsmouth it's a good point you know how a young back when he makes a mistake two mistakes last week's game how badly he wants to be able to get his hands on the football I admire the Michigan State coaches for going right back to and tonight they've given him the ball six times and averaging close to seven yards of carry Scott again fight for 42 and Kirk with the methodical pace of this game you checked the clock now we're down inside of seven minutes Michigan State would love to just continue to churn and chew and eat at the clock and perhaps just win the game on this possession remember the last possession that they had when they put points on the board they didn't have to put the ball in the air they moved the ball and queued up a lot of quality here Ohio wooden sailing one pass defense in the entire second half here Ohio State an offensive struggle throughout the entire game you go down even by a field goal here you start to get concerned Donna one second Amy's pressured has to just throw it away very quick penetration from Michael Hill a backup defensive tackle it's a zone blitz where they bring the pressure with Darren Lee right here but interesting they drop Joey Bosa and by dropping Joey Bosa gets into the throwing lane of where so Connor wanted to go with the ball he got in between O'Connor and Kings who he was throwing through it's an interesting mix up a change there by Luke fickle and Chris Ashton for the best pass rushers but he did it at the right time right into that passing lane of O'Connor Congress been able to convert a couple of dirty lungs with afternoon leaves a third time Gared oh hi Oh safe jumps outside it's a free play this time it was not both of a Tai Kwan Lewis the fourth time they had done that it's halfway done these these fourth alongs third longs to make it a lot more comfortable for this off absolutely they had been offsides a crucial moments we felt we saw it on Joey Bosa a couple times fourth down and eight made it fourth and three those be right before the big run by Tyler O'Connor now it's third down and long and now with another player offside this time Lewis and gets them a much much more manageable situation here late in this game on third down this opens up a few more pages to that playbook for Dave Warner biggest moment for this new Texan underdog here the crowd comes to life no Connor what's the throw broken up nicely by Tyrion Conley tried to get the ball to Kings on a slant at the sophomore corner was right there a nice job by Conley anticipating the quick slant or a quick trow on third and short it does a really good job of working his body around the receiver and uses the right hand and knocked the football away no pass interference got his body around it's a great eye so look at it right there and gets his hands around and knocks the football away to set up this punch so they decide not to try to run it on the third and pray and the Buckeyes defense gets a muchneeded stop hard bugger driving Marshall back Hilda what it found and now it's Michigan fish turn to do a nice job in coverage Ohio State backed up at their seventh 549 left captain the helpers with their studio update unbeaten Houston the battle with Yukon Garret Anderson on a double pass to Noelle Thomas 45yard touchdown pass but Houston just returned the kickoff 94 yards for the TD it's now 20 17 Huskies on ESPNU as we thank you Buckeyes worst starting field position of the game back at there at 7 yard line under 28 yards for Barrett in country total offense so far Marshall in motion what about looking at throw from his ends I'm looking for Thomas downfield jump all broken up almost intercepted Arjun Cole Kuhn was in coverage there and that's the problem thrown into a stiff wind best if win and also he got pressure from Lawrence Thomas and it looked like he may have thrown that football of his back foot he just didn't have a whole lot to it ball as well with the ball is thrown short of Thomas and really good positioning there by Cole hoon and it's one of the few times we've seen Ohio State at least be willing to take a shot and throw the ball downfield we talked about a Booker it's going to be tough in this quarter into this wound that when hung up on the feta cheese and whirling around now Eric knocked down again John resting the linebacker we will go to the strong position when vennett Davis got hurt preseasons played a terrific game well he's played a terrific game and he's had a terrific year this dolfyn the sophomore who you know you talked to these coaches Mark Snyder who's a linebacker coach was at Texas A&amp;M defensive coordinator said he's just been blown away by how consistent he has been understanding his role there in that Sam linebacker spot and now the Buckeyes need nine they can't get a first down here Johnson's going to have to kick into this win Michigan State could get excellent field position but they gamble a bit its Miller on the cross this one man man cannot escape Braxton Miller knockdown of the 11 wily bullet Demetrius Cox war crumbling from the crowd now now it's Riley bula who does a good job of containing the speedy Braxton Miller number 30 but you also see Demetrius Cox get involved right there bola gets into forcing back to the inside where Cox to the rest of the whites parking jerseys are waiting for him Buccaneers will hold their breath who's Cameron Johnston excellent punters already had a crazy low punt earlier in the game it's Kelton at midfield uniteq just knocked down by the wind actually the ball wasn't touched there by Malik big defensive tackle there must Malik McDowell got a hand on that ball they've been pressuring Johnston all afternoon he finally got to it because he ran into the punter after he punted the ball to right there you can see he touches it he ran into it and the punter looked up to say hey give me the call but the ball was touched by Malik McDowell meaning there is no running into the punter or roughing the punter just a fingertip touched by McDowell like their index finger his left index finger 37yard punt and Michigan State with 407 to play will set up in Ohio State Territory through the eight command of this division amazing you can lose a starting quarterback for three years thirty two and four and come into this environment with a couple guys that ever played a lot advanced addition to maybe win this game LJ Scott reverses direction we knock down after a three yard game you know when you lose and something happens like that to you you either panic and everybody has deer in the headlights oh gosh what are we going to do or you get you kind of rally around backup quarterbacks the defense says hey we got your back in the offense says hey man we're going to help you out and watching them play now for 55 to 56 minutes it really feels like they've rallied around the question mark of losing Connor Cook and I totally agree this is a team that has it shipped back in a shoulder after their controversial late loss in Lincoln this is the Michigan State team you sort of expect to see all years second meet gotta hurry play it one o'connor delivers complete farce sign Burbridge can't escape knocked down a yard short of the marker by Apple they're down great awareness there by Tyler Connor Gaia hadn't played a lot of football there a lot of guys that get out there that played a lot of football they're not aware of the play clock he was making some checks moving the line the way he needed to completely aware of managing the game and understanding the play clock clapped his hands real quick to let the veteran Jack Allen though he needed that snap and a little thing that could go unnoticed but a good job again by O'Connor it was the first completed pass by Michigan State in the second half in the game deep in the eye on 3rd and 1 but if the keeper O'Connor has got it how about a surge right there on third and short Jack Allen Madden leading the way leading leading the way up front a good push Brian Allen his brothers in their left guard Jack Conklin don't forget watch the fullback it he's got to get involved trend Pendleton he's gonna push try to help out to new rule now college football you can get behind and help out just turned into a rugby game first down Boop into play Scot stammers to the 30 and the clock becomes a major component here Ohio State wondering if they're going to see the football again frankly you know the wear and tear of Michigan State running the football now 47 times against this Ohio State defense those are body blows that Mark Dantonio is offense has put on the Ohio State defense and is talented if the Buckeyes are up front you have to endure that over and over and over again you start to see the Michigan State backs have a little bit more room to work and you got to give credit to the Michigan State offensive line for being that physical they are working the play clock now a minute and a half to play Scot he's knocked down at the 29 it'll be third and two Luke fickle and Chris anticipating a conservative approach obviously now we're down close to a minute to go in this game and a field goal potentially wins it they are attacking they're blitzing linebackers are bringing their safeties down try not to give up even another yard to give Michigan State a chance with Geiger to essentially hit the gamewinning field goal Geiger and experience Vickers his third year he is an Ohio kid from Toledo at the 47 yard er in warmup for this direction that would be about the distance that they don't get another yard final minute got again first down Mexican state now the Spartans with all three timeouts will begin to conserve time you believe yeah it's a good effort there look at him work trying to pull the senior Josh Perry there's also some good blocks on that right side Donovan Clark another guy from Ohio at a Cincinnati nice job being able to get up to the linebackers at such a component in this rivalry the 29 players from the state of Ohio many of them perhaps wanted to play for Ohio's they weren't recruited by the Buckeyes they go to Michigan State will always be extra motivated and they've never played a game in this state or in this stadium and a chance for a signature win if they can close this out great point and if you're Mark Dantonio and this team has come this far now it's about Geiger now it's about all the reps all the practice do you like it within these conditions on the right hash do you like it in the middle do you want it on the left hash where exactly do you want the football that's where we're going to put it for you we have two timeouts to try to pick up a few more yards and then you're going to try to put the football exactly where Geiger wants it you can see the Metreon Cox and others trying to keep him loose it's all good it's all good no problems you got this guy with the most nervous moment that's when you smile yeah not show the tension but this is a very emotional picture by the way he can be feisty and he's had his ups and downs this season this one left an ugly looking kick from 43 early like that's why you see the players coming over to try to getting it ready in the right mindset but where do they want to try to put the football Scot the duck you lose a yard here the Michigan State offensive line you'd love to say wait a minute let's not just leave it on the kicker here let's continue pushing let's try to make this a comfortable field goal attempt Michigan State will spend their first timeout Geiger continues to prance warm up for his big moment we send it back to Cassidy Hubbard all right Chris after to overturn touchdown Wisconsin still with a shot for the win fourth and goal six seconds mark Houston in complete northwestern holds on for the 13 to 7 win Chris are we back to you Wow surprised already in the big 10 Michigan winning earlier at Penn State Michigan in the position having to root for Ohio State of all people to keep alliances in division and that's the thing I think is gotten lost a little bit this week there's been so much talk about Ohio State being testing a chance for them to justify their rankings I think people forgotten about Michigan State after they're lost a couple weeks ago in Lincoln and they come into Columbus to knock off Ohio State they beat Penn State there's a team that's going to the big 10 championship game to play maybe an undefeated Iowa and you win that game Michigan State standing there saying why not us why can't we be in the top four so this is not just about Ohio State it's about Michigan State as well Penn State the final opponent for this apartment in East Lansing next week 25 seconds Barton's with that timeout remaining love to get bagger close at the moment it would still be a 42yard extent that they don't get any closer Scot make the guy but macmillan can go no farther than the 23 Vaughn Bell combining in the clock ticking down 13 seconds interesting that they had the ball in the middle to field and now they're on the right hash very very different very very different from the middle of the field to the right hash remember he hooked one earlier he missed one earlier in this game in a second the wind is swirling around is very tricky and Michael Geiger Toledo Ohio a junior a chance to snap Ohio State's win streak at 23 give the Spartans the command in this division keep their dreams alive within the conference and making the playoffs tell me his pulse rate isn't about 120 right now he looks calm under Ohio State with the two timeouts will freeze him or if they'll let him go ahead and attempt this without calling the timeout from 41 yards Geiger Myers standing next to the official call timeout he waited this until the ball is snapped and as you suggested it freezing the ball not through the Geiger we'll have to wait with a longer lasting the watch Urban Meyer because he he kind of walked over and said hey listen I'm glad tap your shoulder I want the timeout he walks even standing there for maybe 10 or 15 seconds kind of whispering in the guy's ear and then he eventually taps the official and he's probably telling as soon as I touch you want that timeout so with one more time out he decides the freezin Michigan State went to wait and wonder whether this junior can deliver a victory that would be extremely sweet for this team that entered the season with tremendous expectations off the Cotton Bowl win over Baylor guys like Cooke and Calhoun came back because they believed this was potentially a national championship team haven't hit their high note all season waiting for a complete performance we still got a timeout Kirk if Mayer wants to freeze Geiger again he can but he's not standing up to the official now this is a Geiger from 41 for the win Michigan State as gutsy as it gets Boyle's senior day snaps Ohio State win streak and takes command of the big 10 East behind here backup quarterbacks and an Ohio native picker and a tremendous defense pretty incredible to think that LJ Scott last run moved the ball for the middle of the field to the right hash and Geiger would probably be the first one to tell you he didn't necessarily hit that ball to clean instead he's ever kicked a field goal and it had a little bit of a spin on it was moving to the left in a hurry and if that balls not on the right hash I don't know if it goes through the uprights but it went it ended up getting through I think Tyler O'Connor deserves so much credit for the effort what he did replacing the quarterback Tyler cook from Sabre pepper Matt max wood with the hold and Geiger knocking it through and then he did about a 22 whit Mills of the right arm running down the field that has about as sweet as it gets for a kicker back in his home state to beat Ohio State grew up in Toledo went to Ottawa Hills High School up and northwest part of the state of Ohio and can imagine he's dreamed about an opportunity like this his whole life and Michigan State Kurt continues to be one of those programs that when they are counted out or doubted just steps up and delivers again and again and this one sings for Evan Meyer this would be the second potential national title shot denied by Michigan State and what's been a brilliant four years here for urban the other all right Chris coach congratulations on the win you come in as an underdog you guys played with a chip on your shoulder and preps all week that way without your starting quarterback how did you guys get it done we have no we just keep reaching higher I guess you know we just keep talking about it just be mentally tough and we said coming into this year that we need to reach higher and this was the day we had to do that chips are a little bit against us and I thought the one thing that made a difference you know we've been chased all year long so far in ten games in this game we got to be the chaser so we could chase this game and so we could play on emotion and it seemed like a lot of that came from your defense amazing to think that they held the Ohio State Buckeyes under 150 yards how are they able to really limit anything that the Buckeyes could do on the field first thing we had to do is wind up front on both sides the ball and I thought we did that second thing we had to do is allow no explosive plays obviously gave way to turnovers but big turnovers but we rally back and that's just an attitude you know we rally back you said that all of your goals are in front of you how does this win help you achieve those goals well I think if we win the next game we'll go in the big 10 championship game so that's the start going to the quick start notice on Connor cookin his availability for next week well we hope we hope I think of you back you know but if it's a daytoday thing you know a human body give you amazing things with it well let you enjoy this Lenoir incarnation total team win for O'Connor in that defense AT&amp;T strong performance looking at strong defense from Michigan State five first downs for Ohio State 132 total yards Meyer will certainly be criticized with a game plan very few downfield throws but Michigan State's defense had the answer for everything they trying today you know we've talked all year with Ohio State about their potential and could they ever live up to their fence with potential and we said two things are going to happen either they're going to start to live up to their potential offensively and show that they control the football are they going to lose the game and today we kept waiting like we've waited all year for them to throw the ball we never saw the balance we never saw the threat downfield and against a great defense like Michigan State who is just attacking down hill against the Ohio State running game there's just nothing that they could do as far as creating rhythm on the offensive side all of the FBS team this year the buckeyes 132 yards is in the bottom 10 offensive performances all season long by teams in the FBS at Michigan State Dantonio knows it they're right they play Penn State at home next week win that win the division go to Indy with perhaps a real chance to make a late rush like Ohio State did last year in the bracket we talked before they ended up winning this game about how was it just about Ohio State coming into this game they're in the top 10 they have a lot of teams that are ahead of them they're going to lose football games and by beating Ohio State a team that's up in the top three you knock up Ohio State the committee is paying attention to that especially in Columbus especially without your quarterback now you have Penn State and you maybe get an undefeated Iowa as teams ahead of them lose if Michigan State keeps winning despite the loss in Lincoln they're going to have a real shot to get back to where their ultimate goal was absolutely just a complete gritty performance here you get the true freshmen Ohio making the runs in the last couple drives the kicker from Toledo knocking through the winning field goal a moment he'll never forget and for Kevin O'Connor is fourth year in the program if you do all the study watch all the tape you prepare for a moment like this when the starter goes down for everybody out there Kirk OOP who prepares and wonders if they'll get their kids this was a game for them I don't think you can really put into words how tough it is to imagine losing a quarterback there's a threeyear starter who is 32 and for the winningest quarterback in the history of the school and Connor Cook is signaling in plays that was his role today still provided emotional leadership but Tyler O'Connell Damion Terry boy they will go down forever remembered as the quarterbacks that led Michigan State to a big win in Columbus against number three Ohio State Park has done the Buckeyes take command to the east and step very much into the playoff picture 1714 is the final in the horseshoes tonight on ABC playoff contender Oklahoma against TC presented by Walmart for Kirk Herbstreit Heather Cox and our entire crew Chris Fowler's saying so long the scoreboard and Johnson is coming up right now all right Chris thanks a lot you can see the celebration still going on in Columbus of
