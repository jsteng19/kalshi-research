============================================================

welcome to Evanston just north of Chicago as Northwestern gets ready to take on Wisconsin two of the best runners in the country Brian Calhoun for the Badgers and true freshman Tyrell Sutton Northwestern and Wisconsin right now welcome to Evanston Northwestern getting ready to take on Wisconsin the Badgers one of 12 remaining unbeaten teams in the country northwestern coming off a bye week they lost in heartbreaking fashion two weeks ago here to Penn State course they're taking on Ohio State today the weather in Evanston it is overcast but at least no rain is in the forecast temperatures about 54 degrees with the winds whipping up around 10 to 20 miles an hour's we are just off the shore of Lake Michigan and we welcome you to Evanston Pam Moore joined by David nori and we think Wisconsin football through the years David it is the running game they have Brian Calhoun now a terrific running back but really last week against Indiana was John stock Oh in the passing game yeah well typically with Wisconsin to beat Wisconsin you think stop that power running game but defensive coordinators are finding out it's not quite that simple last week John stock o the Badger quarterback showed that he was capable of opening things up to early touchdown passes to Brandon Williams he has bigtime playmakers on the outside Jonathan or at the flaker position and Wisconsin has proven that they can go up top if you're gonna load up the box this is a very talented team offensively now Northwestern known for its spread offense and they have a 50year senior named Brett Bazin a who really runs it to perfection well Brett bass and they had this team in position to beat Penn State two weeks ago they had a week off bassanese hitting over 63% of his balls I really think it's gonna be his decisions not only passing the football but also pulling the ball down selectively running the football in this game that could make the difference northwestern has a shot to beat this Wisconsin team Randy Walker now in his seventh season at Northwestern the sixth year in which they have run this spread and Barry out that Alvarez could this be a magical 16th and final season for him he will stay on as the athletic director but will step down as the head coach when this season is over and Wisconsin gets the football first short kickoff is taken by Zach Hampton and Wisconsin will start in very good field position around the 32 yard line as that short kickoff did not quite pay off for Northwestern so Wisconsin gets the ball first John stock oh the second year starter quarterback and again three touchdown passes last week against Indiana that was a careerhigh tying mark for him two weeks ago he looked very shaky against Michigan but the Wolverines can make you look that way on offense and stock oh really answered the bell last week Indiana going eight men up on the line of scrimmage and he made all the plays in the passing game for the Badgers in Bryan Calhoun number two in the backfield to transfer from Colorado we have the numbers three and four Russians in the country and there's Calhoun trying to bounce it out to the left side and picks up a couple of yards the Nivea for men's starting lineups on the Wisconsin offensive side Jonathan horn Brandon Williams both had over 100 yards receiving last week in that win over Indiana and again Brian Calhoun averaging 145 yards a game Badgers loved to run on the left side of that offensive line Matt Lawrence and Joe Thomas MANET Donovan viola has been really the bedrock at Center for several seasons now the senior from Honolulu second and eight for Wisconsin and once again they give it to Calhoun and he's able to slip one tackle and it's going to be about six yards short of the first down the Nivea firm ed northwestern defensive line ups their defense a third to last overall in the entire country true freshman John Gill starts his second game of the season at defensive tackle the linebackers the strength of this unit leading tackler Tim of garble has more than twice as many stops as the number two tackler as we take a look at mark please polo dangers return man on special teams he also hopes to of Northwestern's five interceptions on the season third and six with the baggage their very first possession the exes stay inside of them pick up the first down so northwestern came with the Blitz on third down and stock away to pick up nine the stock go is a very disciplined quarterback in the pocket and you figured that playing for Barry Alvarez and he feels a little seam right up the gut doesn't have a lot to see down the field in terms of open receivers a nice decision to move the chains early for Wisconsin Wisconsin second in the big 10 in time of possession averaging about 34 minutes a game something you would expect from a team that has a great miner like first and 10 Brandon Williams coming around and gets it on the reverse but the defense that's timber gargoyle stands hosted near linebacker maybe will make the stop after a couple of yards of a game four capped for Williams now let's go down the third member of our team Jimmy dykes Thank You Pam talking to northwestern's coaches before the ball game they feel like Wisconsin is a team yes they can throw the ball but they still they want to run it then they want to run it as a changeup they're gonna run it at you and they're not afraid to tell you where they're gonna run the football pay attention today to Wisconsin's tight in especially number 84 Jason Posey at Northwestern feels like a lot of times he's a guy wherever he lines up or whoever he motions to Wisconsin's telling you that's where we're coming with the ball are you big enough to stop it and that has always been the eternal question another running and he finds a little bit of a seam and gets another northwestern territory it's interesting you know picking up on work Jimmy dykes left off there that is the key to this football team I mean Barry Alvarez both offensively and defensively they want to bully you upfront they want to say hey we're better than you are man for man down in the pit and this offensive line he was not real excited about their play last two if they did not play well in the running game up front they were not getting much push against Indiana you know Barry Alvarez made his points to this offensive line during the week of practice he's pretty grumpy after that 41 to 24 win his fingertips as Brendan Smith the true freshman from Andover Massachusetts was in on the coverage and we will get our first look at one of the best punters in the country Kenda Bush and we best punt returner in the country mark we skal leads the entire ncdoublea division Friday at 30.1 yards per return of course Brendan Williams is a terrific returner on the other side for Wisconsin divorce has strengthened stop and then just died around the oneyard line Zach Hampton able to cover up and northwestern will take over on its one the Badger special teams across the board are loaded with stars and Bush is one of the most talented punters in the country he has been uncanny punts inside the 20 directional punting that's a heck of a play by Hampton to prevent that ball from getting over the goal line that is the 11th time the bush has been able to nail one side with 20 and he can also blame him but he's terrific as you just saw get in touch on the ball so northwestern has 99 yards in front of them Tyrell the true freshman running sensation able to give them a little bit of breathing room as he takes it out to the six and Brett Bazin egg and the fifth year senior running this offense starting since he was a redshirt freshman and really has evolved over the years to be a great leader Allen and we found that out a year ago the upset against Ohio State he's been a very capable player over his four years at Northwestern I really believe he has to have one of his better games at Northwestern to beat Wisconsin this afternoon Ohio State with a separated throwing this time Goodin under the defensive tackles as we take a look now at the Nivea for men starting lineups the northwestern skilled players you already talked about Tyrell Sutton 132 yards a game on the ground best for all freshmen the entire nation Sean Herbert leads the cats with 28 catches for dears Cardos act straight the right tack a big at 6 7.35 also a huge influence on the other offensive linemen then first year starters 13 for Bazin a armored home and he cannot find his target as he was going for jonathan fields and three and out for Northwestern and should be good field position coming up for the Badgers the Bazin a chose to be conservative with the placement of that ball you don't want to make a mistake down under the shadow of your own goalpost both teams coming out early in this game trying to establish the run shocking for the big turn cam and Brandon Williams ran one back for a touchdown last week against Indiana 63 yarder also took one of the house against temple that's a lie right to the hands of William strength that's a 40yard pot in a 16yard return of Ryan Petersons punt and boy Wisconsin also a team that depends so heavily on field position and so far they're really winning that battle pammi you know you're so right did Barry Alvarez talks about the hidden yards and special teams and his special teams have been tremendous throughout the course of this year and you look back at his last two Rose Bowl teams and the late 90s very similar they had great special teams play and you see the possession and position we will be keeping track of that your position right now how about start now one yard line Brian Calhoun nigo taking very close to the first down marker as he is induced to go out of bounds by Tim magar go well this is a big zone blocking running attack it's not manonman blocking this offensive front for the Badgers comes off in unison and you watch them on tape and you realize two things number one they're very much left hand and they love to run to the left and also Calhoun has a tailback not very comfortable running between the tackles he loves to bounce it outside and use his speed they will measure for the first down Calhoun actually they're not going to measure that go ahead and say it's a first down Calhoun transferred from Colorado where he played his first two years let's listen in so a game clock issue they're going to put a few more seconds back on it referee today Calhoun his first couple years of Colorado and then transferred to Wisconsin he is from Oak Creek and was an allamerican high school player and the first Colorado wanted to make him into a wide receiver and Barry Alvarez obviously failed to get to Madison from the 21 point is being established here well and as we said Alvarez not real happy about the run production a week ago against Indiana and they're gonna stick with it Calhoun eventually went over the hundred yards but when Barry Alvarez is upset after posting 41 points with his offensive line you know they're gonna be they're gonna be working on the run game throughout the course of the week in practice fact he said his offense last week with sleepwalking and he emphatically let them know that in practice this week second seven Calhoun we caught from behind by Barry Cole field the senior from Cleveland Heights but he still picked up a couple of more yards Wisconsin in the red zone has been lethal on the season as they are now facing a third and for coming into this game 25 of 28 in the red zone and 22 touchdowns that's an 89 percent success rate I tell you that's lighten it up those are bigtime numbers when he get in scoring position now on 34 in the red zone stockcar going up top in Wisconsin again successful such a big part of the redzone success for the Badgers is stock oval Stock hose ability to hit inside routes working against Cory dice Jonathan or he had success last week against Indiana on the post route 6 points for Wisconsin telling no ha what's through the extra point Jonathan order huge game last week four catches for over 100 yards and a touchdown he already has one score here in Wisconsin breaks on top John stockist on his eighth touchdown pass of the season his fourth in two weeks as he found Jonathan or for the score in a very short field as they started from the 31 and that again goes back to Kenda Bush the punter the hip yardage that Barry Alvarez talks about Penn northwestern on the one the suing a short field when they took full advantage take over from the 20 down seven or nothing so the Wildcats at least have some breathing room starting from the 20 but Jonathan Warren company had put them in a 7 nothing hole in evanston unbeaten wisconsin has broken out to a seven nothing lead over northwestern as we join you from Evanston for the second time today the Wildcats have the football they're averaging 32 points per game with this offensive that fascinate Pass is handled by jonathan field who picks up 7 the Nivea for men starting lineups focusing on the nation's 9th best defense for Wisconsin Matthew Shaughnessy making a big impact as a true freshman at defensive end dante's sanders and marks a loose key of the Badgers top two tacklers Lamar Watkins joins them in the linebacking crew and Johnny white elevating his play over the last couple of weeks in the secondary he is starting today Joe stell mocker continuing to recover from the effects of a stinger against Michigan a couple weeks ago very close to the first down is Tyrell Sutton and Bret Bielema in a second season as a defensive coordinator of Wisconsin in the heir apparent he will take over as the head coach next year the talk Badgers you know they're very stubborn about running the ball but they're also stubborn about stopping the runner on defense this is one of the top 10 units in the country against the run they like to play man on the outside at the three safety over the top you're going to have to hit passes against the mantoman coverage to have success on third and short to Sutton and he will pick up the first down northwestern's first first down Jason Chapman and Johnny white coming in to make the stop and Tyrell Sutton a very special player a true freshman from Akron as that Street puts his big old hands upon his head thanking him to get in the first down the first game of the season it needs to there's a top freshman running back in the country and you sit down he visit with him he's well beyond his years the coaching staff marvels at his maturity this is complete to mark still more picks up eight yards as we check in with rece Davis Risa Florida State trying to keep rolling right along in the ACC he was just engulfed Marc Zalewski maybe the best linebacker on this team coming up and just grabbing the Zalewski really reacts well on this play he's going to read it he closes with the buff flip ball in the air and that's the way you shut down passes behind the line of scrimmage screams you got to have the recognition Zalewski as you said pan really the featured linebacker on this defense the loss of two yards that philosophers in ski this year leaving the Badger team pressure from Shaughnessy coming up and he draws to got to the football when it hit the ground and Bazin a is a guy who threw an interception in his last pass of the game against penn state doesn't throw him out of pics and now was a little fortunate they're typically fashion is very safe with the football but also he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders against this wisconsin defense and the ball does hit the turf but that is awfully close to an interception by Bell Kim Thompson was his intended receiver as peterson comes in and this time takes it out to the six LD flag strive for peterson a 60yard punt you see an evil bloc Pearson that 60yard punt ties his careerhigh and Wisconsin is backed up I'll tell you Pam Williams didn't have to bring that ball out of the end zone he muffed the punt the ball went back into the end zone he could have gone to a knee and given the Badgers have all out at the 20yard line I'm taking one last look at Williams trying to secure the football he could have gone to Annie Randy Walker looking on from the sidelines as his team trails Wisconsin by a touchdown but Wisconsin with the clipping Holly that was ultimately called back it's three yard line and Wayne's questionable decision to bring the ball out of the end zone we'll talk about that more in a second but first Calhoun tries to get him out of try picked up the yard let's go back to that Brandon Williams again a fabulous proper Turner but kind of messed up on this and he sees the football coming back into the field of play and he decides to cover the football even in the end zone on a muff you don't have to do that you can go to Annie the beautiful but to be fair to it Pam no you don't practice situations where you're fielding the ball inside the 10 typically so Brandon Williams was being safe it wasn't clear in his mind and he was secure with the football and absolutely your first instant has to be my gosh the ball is in the end zone I got to get it out of there and Williams is one of the best going returning breaking it to the outside gets up to the 10 mark we skull makes the stop at that's 7 more yards for Calhoun now Wisconsin already we've told you they're 5 and OH on the season 2 and on the big 10 this is their remaining schedule in what you will see at the bottom take note they play neither Ohio State nor Michigan State party that would be for Barry Alvarez to win the Big Ten title and our course candidate for the national title game if they can run the table in the big town take on a Minnesota team next week or so Kowloon steps out of bounds around the 31 yard line but give him 20 calhoun opened up the season with big numbers in the first three games the last two weeks against Michigan and Indiana you know the Wolverines and the Hoosiers had success keeping him between the tackles he's not real comfortable running inside but if he gets outside to look out and he is always looking to flash his speed and if he's running on the perimeter it's gonna be a long day for Northwestern he takes a break Booker Stanley checking in at tailback Calhoun already half 109 carries 54 yards and it's first down start go repel the attack so he takes off and slides down around the 38yard line the finishing touches on the slide buttstock Oh picks up about seven this Badger offense really puts you in a bind because as a defensive coordinator you know that you don't want to come out and watch them dominate the line of scrimmage control the ball all afternoon on the ground against you you have to put numbers on the line of scrimmage you have to take risks on the outside against talented receivers and it's just a real tough task for a defense makes it even tougher when stock hoes making nice decisions to pull the football down and run with it he did pick up seven makes it second and three Stanley still in the backfield gets the football to pick up another noted yard is Beryl Cofield haven't got no game on it but hopefully they look like Adam stop for a walk as we join it from Ryan field the campus of Northwestern University David Murray and Jimmy dykes joining you unbeaten Wisconsin taking on Northwestern and Bryan Calhoun already with 54 yards on only nine carries he's third in the country in rushing averaging 145 yards a game in Wisconsin coming out here trying to establish ball control who has checked back in the past pattern that stopped up to the third time today takes off his pair field twice close to the first down let's go back to restate the Virginia Tech off to that quick start against Marshall and we will have a measurement here to determine if the first down was picked up I think he's gonna be just short on that scrambled John stock oh good six inches short of the first down inside your own 35yard line typically pots in this situation fourth and inches and the offense is staying out there stocke Oh coming back out fans about two and a half hours from Madison the opposite side has warmer than don't like this decision you're up 7nothing three minutes 25 seconds to go in the first quarter I think it at best here Pam you try to draw northwestern offsides I think this is an early risk you don't need to take mr. defense 7 for 7 opponents have been against them this season they have not stopped anybody on fourth win Wisconsin snapped the ball they do and stop gets it so now opponents against northwestern 8 for 8 on the season on fourth down including this risky one in Wisconsin side of the football field yeah I mean the odds are you're gonna pick up inches whether it's 3rd or 4th down but typical decision was very Alvarez I mean he's a bit of a throwback here the run game the bruising physical style the Schembechler Woody Hayes type approach and they typically don't see Barry Alvarez go for a fourth and inches on his own 41 was the Dyson worked out so now a first down from the 43 stock Oh gonna top and stretch to the 46 McArdle again in on the tackle for Northwestern and we're going to be saying his name a lot decisions early in this football game he's pulled the ball down taking advantage of some openings and some creases in the defensive line in the pass rush throwing some nice balls and he's building on that great performance last week at home against Indiana his 20 rushing yards already a career high for John stock Oh second and seven again test and slicing their coalfield one of the seniors on this defensive unit that again is third was in the country their worst in the country don't leave NFL draft a mate of coke fields along that northwestern defensive line Tokyo got off to a slow start this year in the first two games but he's come on like gangbusters he's really stepped up this game and he's allowed to handle mantoman inside for an offensive lineman back he was terrific against Penn State two weeks ago three pass deflections three quarterback hurries a sack and a forced fumble and that was a great play on the elusive stocker and they picked up a first down you love to see this from a running back yeah you're a quarterback you're under duress in the pocket watch taco again he's going to slip outside use his feet and then he just drops the ball over mcgarrigle's head the minute you see that linebacker turn his number on the back of his jersey to you you know you can throw it out over his head and that's a nice play by Calhoun to help out his quarterback Calhoun showing you that he was a threat for the backfield if 15 catches on the season coming in he has two so far today making the blog area on John Gill but it's still three more yards for counting ESPN's College that is a shot of a Baha'i temple just north of the are here in Evanston second incentive Wisconsin driving the foot now the 12th player this drive stock makes a mistake to the true freshman stock go down a little green the quality to it he's going to try to fit the ball into Jonathan or this is going to be a misfire he's gonna fill the ball wide to the outside and how about Brendan Smith and Northwestern they lost Brian Hines our strong safety they're experienced veteran strong safety has been a real problem spot for the Wildcats Brendan Smith is coming on and he makes a big play early as a 23 yard return on his first career about a yard and what should be the final play of the first quarter stats about that new Shaughnessy so the big pick by Brendan Smith snupps out that Wisconsin drive and northwestern down by touchdown trying to pull even as unbeaten Wisconsin second quarter about to get underway Wisconsin leading the Wildcat seven and up in but northwestern thanks to the interception by Brendan Smith has the football back and near midfield Brett Bazin a was step for step with Allen Langford has that falls incomplete let's look now at our Napa game track Jonathan or 15yard touchdown catch put Wisconsin up seven and Ave at a very short field and Brian Calhoun already with 56 yards in this game but John stock oh here's your mistake as he throws to pick two Brendan Smith possession now a third and Shawn Herbert the leading receiver for the Wildcats picks up the first down we pick up least three four years thirteen yards in the first down we mentioned at the top as he's gonna have to have one of his better games not just throwing the ball but making nice decisions this is a play called in the huddle and a free child bypass today to pick up the first down a nice crisp decision to go to the turf and move to change and we asked him yesterday cuz he's not a fast guy why he's such an effective runner and he says fear it's all about the fear from the big guys and he picks up her first down play action again that should be another first down for the Wildcats that is an impressive job by bass ma you know he checked the right side he checked two or three receivers came all the way back away to the ball control controlled the ball for twothirds of the game against Penn State and that I mean typically it's the Nittany Lions that are doing that to other clubs in the big ten when they're rolling like they are this year this northwestern offense is capable with their mix of running pass they still lost that game remember they had to settle for five field goals finally is able to track down so more who tried every which way he could and was still snuffed out and Randy Walker she likes to throw some razzledazzle into his offense that's going to be a clipon errand car number 44 the big tight end for Northwestern and tight ends don't get a lot of opportunities to play for the Wildcats here's the handoff vasin 8 trying to get into the feet of big Matthew Shaughnessy and let's freeze it right here big air and Cobb is going to get caught for a pretty flagrant clip in the backfield and that didn't show much discipline from the previous five repeat first down you know that's a mistake Pam from your tight end that it's very critical you're down seven points you're playing against an undefeated team maybe the team in the driver's seat to win the big ten and he can't afford those types of penalties I mean three officials were off or on top of that cliff not in tough one to call it was a busted play anyway they were going to lose ground but the clipping just exacerbated it as second floors over the back Johnny white the junior from Portland Texas the Maude Watkins in on the tackle let's go back to our possession and position graphic in Wisconsin 1111 all in the first quarter and their average start was very much helped member they started their touchdown drive on their 31 were backed up to around the three because of a who had branded Williams not able to not being able to handle a punt club they say they sort of cancel each other out second and 25 tonight forest and again you see the decision process Bassem a doesn't have untalented throwing arm that he takes and dunks and gets the ball out on smart guy in the field check out this play he feels a little space to his right and then he snaps that ball off down inside the 10 that is a big time throw from bassinet that's a 27 yard gain and it's now first and goal from the six for the Wildcats his knee really gets it down to the 4 yard line on that last play he had Sutton coming out of the backfield a couple of choices but was patient and waited for the man to come open and he got the 1st and goal for Wisconsin he likes to bounce it outside but Sutton the true freshman he's comfortable running the ball inside he's not afraid to lay the shoulder pads and helmet on linebackers now second ago it's a touchdown they're just sneaks it into the and Northwestern s score this might be a review opportunity for this big tent officiating crew but again thousand a decision making I'm not sure he quite got to the goal line there tough to see their from that angle but what a play what an effort from the senior quarterback stretching that ball forward and they are going to look at it we've talked about this you know throughout the year Pam that the big ten officiating crews and review crews upstairs have done a heck of a job you know Bazin they might have just gotten a piece of that goal line all you have to do is just break the plane with the football you're getting back to the review crews they've done a super job and I think this has been a great addition to college football remember you got to have indisputable evidence to Revere to reverse a call and come from those angles to really see clearly that he did not score Dan Capron is on the phone with dick Hoenig upstairs the technical adviser they use going to take a look at at the computer communicator Tom Quinn the replay technician Joe Hall and of course it has worked wonderfully James Delaney the Commissioner putting it into effect last season and just about every other conference has copied it boy what's the matter like there was some green between the ball and the goal line tough to tell from that angle but from that end zone angle if we can take one more look at that end zone angle it broke in the plane the big 10 crew upstairs stuck with the ruling the strict ruling and that is you have to have indisputable evidence and I don't think he had indisputable evidence to reverse that call nice job so give Bazin a credit for the touchdown run his second of the season performance against Penn State but Brett Bassett again making terrific decisions in the passing game and then punching it in for the gametying touchdown see some of the Whitecaps there on Lake Michigan the wind whipping up a little bit here in Evanston Brett Bazin a with a finger ER touchdown run he had a huge 27 yard pass to mark Fillmore a second and 25 karlie chat about that right now the sidelines and the red zone to get moved back on the clipping call that was a huge play bassanese gonna have to make those plays to beat Wisconsin this afternoon and a short kick that is fair taijuan Roman gets it they're gonna start about the 28th as we go back to restate Virginia Tech trying to hang in there is one of the unbeatens but Marshall has tied that up and again that kicked off they're trying to keep it out of the hands of all the dangerous returned man Williams but consequently it's a 29 they start from the 29 nonsence taco ticks off again pick up five yards let's head down to Jimmy dykes hey I'm talking to Brett Bielema that at Wisconsin defensive coordinator before the ballgame he said the problem with northwestern's offenses they are not predictable they run the same running play out the same pass place pregame snapper presnap set he said the other thing about northwestern is they keep you out of a rhythm the reason why rep Bosna he feels like in the big ten as good as there is of manufacturing and managing the ballgame and that's exactly what we saw on that last drive on the northwestern both Bielema and why this offense worked so picks up three to the 38yard line mcCargo and again on another tackle because they played Indiana last week did Wisconsin and Beal both talked about almost like it was a double week of preparation Terry Hebner was at Miami under Randy Walker and then took over at Miami of Ohio so the offenses are similar we asked him what was the main difference if it was the weapons he said no it's Brett bazevich and Barry Alvarez the Badger head coach he says it's all about talk to us about the northwest yes for Wisconsin down asthma gurgle cable and gave him a nice head stanley able to pick up another first down for the Badgers this big offensive line for Wisconsin they just come off like a dance team five and unison the zone blocking schemes and look at everybody picking up upward jersey is the kind of mauling style physical style inside that's you know so typical of this wisconsin Ronnie game so a great poll there by the left guard Matt Lawrence starting finally as a senior at the Sussex Central High School in always dangerous Brandon Williams picking up a first down gets 18 Brandon's first catch of the day he was magical last weekend against Indiana well and Joe Thomas is really the star on this offensive line watch number 72 he's going to get outside within a release him outside get that block the big guy has the running ability and the athleticism to get outside and get a block for a wide receiver bigtime town Thomas six eight three oh three on the Lombardy watchlist one of the best in the country and another first down to the Badgers so Tim embargo his senior from Chicago busted that Playa look like he this is my gardener it's been frustrating we know secret this defense is giving up a lot of yards but he's just gonna come off the edge and he flatout beats the right tackler vaq McGarrigle one of the top tacklers in the country a year ago for northwestern and just starting to reach his stride this line back he was number one in the entire country and solo tackles last year and third in total that is his first sack of the season goes against the grain we mix a couple of guys miss takes it down to the 37 yard line as we go back for another update with rece Davis Thank You Reese wait next week traveling the PC to take on the emus in Chestnut Hill and down down to Florida State and six Wisconsin has converted five of seven so again since northwestern defense punt of the time force taco he decides to go to this has to be frustrating for a defense Northwestern it's only gonna rush three and Megara goal locked up man demand a man on Calhoun this taco the quarterback found the mismatch at Calhoun too much speed for a middle linebacker to be watching out in the flat mantoman see his numbers already with 15 touches 56 yards on the ground for Calhoun averaging 145 by John Gill the true freshman was able to twist around quickly and stop Calhoun and six year arts for Bryan but a good play by Gilda's stop him right there Maurice Castillo over a year ago and they got some true freshman playing up front and whoa his Dave John Gillis stepped in Randy Walker says if Gil reminds him quite a bit of Castile as a youngster and that is quite a compliment and Gil is a true freshman but just scooches inside the 20 picks up a couple more and get a feel for Calhoun's quickness and his lateral ability is one of the sidestepped him in the backfield the pickup's apposite your ditch sporting a Randy Walker is gonna be playing in the National Football League someday and that Wisconsin has been it's inside the redzone this season there one for one today another for down third and two gets to keep the ball and the chains moving and you have to know that this warms Barry Alvarez his heart his legacy three Rose Bowl wins at Wisconsin flinging back a program from the brink remember this this Wisconsin team Pam had only won one bowl game before Alvarez picked up that that first Rose Bowl win back in the early 90s and he loves to see his team moving the ball with rhythm in the running game and the big Heavy's up front having their way Calhoun has carried the load 68 yards Stanly no slouch himself running the football showed it on that carrot he's not the typical badger running back that alvarez would like to see in his backfield when he talked about his physical stature he's a smaller speed back the hooker Stanley he fits them all yeah you think Ron gain and guys like moss and Fletcher and because they've had some ski backs as well along the way Anthony Davis and Michael Bennett but badges like to go up to that physical running stock cool we are games to bicker including mom headed in the season okay first of all from the five Stanley again and big burst and 215 pounds it's his second rushing touchdown of the season again rent Meester one of the fullbacks filling in for Matt busting continues to be out and will be out indefinitely with an injury another impressive drive for the Badgers two for two in the red zone today as much as the extra point so to give Brian Calhoun a break bring in Booker Stanley the Badgers in the redzone Rooker Stanley talking to the big guys in front of him his offensive line who helped him get a five yard touchdown run capping off the top place 71 yard drive out of a typical badger scoring drive Brian Calhoun in the mix both running and catching a ball but it was Stanley who capped it off on that drive vercinix 20 but the flag is way back at the 28yard Northwestern but it probably won't hold up big part of Wisconsin's success is they don't beat themselves and they play solid in the special teams Barry Alvarez his teams like to make you make mistakes and they like to let you beat yourself and that was a big return by Roberson huge play to get northwestern right back in this football game that's Reggie McPherson with the penalty let's go back to restatements Reese all right Pam came forward the American League Championship Series between the Yankees and Angels has been rained out they'll play Sunday night 7:35 eastern time with the Angels trying to finish the series it's a college football Saturday I know you're gonna be watching anyway but if you thought maybe you peek at the baseball game just stay with us we've got Iowa and Purdue that's after college gameday scoreboard this afternoon about three inches of rain in New York today no surprise that it was rain as that gasped carelessly thrown towards Sean Herbert and falls incomplete let's check out today's Aflac trivia question ten years ago Northwestern won the Big Ten and therefore went to the Rose Bowl we want to know who was the only player from that team who is still playing octopus in the National Football League I'm gonna take just a quick crack and I think maybe Dewayne Bates that's a quick answer yeah you know I keep the right Jonathan shields who stopped about three yards short of the first down marks a loose key the linebacker coming in to make the stop that's the third catch of the day for fields Beulah will be in charge next year that Muskaan sir spend some time to Kansas State as an assistant lot of guys with Iowa roots bill map late of Iowa and also coached under legendary Hayden Fry this play is a nogo something was flaring out of the backfield yeah and set and moved early just before the snap false start number 19 still third down you know Pam Sutton has had tremendous success as a true freshman running the football and he's really good top freshman back in the country in my mind and certainly has the best numbers but what has really surprised this Northwestern staff is his ability to block his ability to pick up the offense in the preseason camp Willie a rare mistake by Sutton granny Walker marvels at the way Sutton is played as though he's a third or fourthyear player mentally on this football for very mature is push back on third and six and Shawn Herbert comes up with the grab his third of the day fascinate shows a lot of nerve in his own in trying to fit this ball in I mean that is a tight window and a super throw 5008 use accuracy on that throw but you have to have perfect timing that Bazin a has been up to the task so far at this football game against the badges herbert has led northwestern and catches in all four games this season on his way it is caught by Sam Cheatham a sophomore wide receiver from San Leandro California and on paper Cheatham dead figure a big part in this football game today if he keeps on making these kinds of throws you know and down the stretch in the Big Ten Conference they're gonna be some NFL scouts are gonna want to take a look at it ie checked again two or three receivers vertically and came off to cheetah the outstretched hands of sixfootthree while slain boy Ross Lane another big wide reciever Wildcats have a lot of depth at that position flag on the play vasin a missed an opportunity on that throw that would have been backtoback big plays in the passing game holy number 63 on the offense 10yard penalty from the previous spot repeat first downs resolving that's the very talented right tackle Zach Strief Streif really the taking over is a great leader on this team with this the other four starters all firstyear starters he's been starting since he was a redshirt freshman says he's personally responsible it feels that way for Bazin is healthy remember this Wildcat offensive line lost three starters to the NFL Nick Hayden coming up early from his defensive tackle spot we'll see if he was drawn off ties one have any tighter ties and Bret Bielema next year's head coach how about this he actually has an Iowa Hawkeye tattoo on his left leg I asked me if he has any plans to remove it and he says no and I'll tell you why after this play he's test to quote former president Thomas Jefferson who said I never met a successful man who isn't proud of where he came from it's a great quote to hold on to for Bret Bielema but a Hawkeye tattoo on a badger it just doesn't seem right you know yeah but that Thomas Jefferson quote doesn't play well in Madison I'm sure he's not going to show visibly have it covered up with socks or pants a bandage or something but laser surgeon something yeah as northwestern gives the ball away this is a huge mistake by Austin Matthews execution between a center and a quarterback he cannot make mistakes like that if you're gonna beat an undefeated Wisconsin Wisconsin takes the ball over in northwestern territory at the 47 on a very ugly drive for Northwestern as you see the possession position update Wisconsin for the second time today starting in northwestern territory in that last northwestern possession three parties and tumble that stock Oh cover up he's gonna lose quite a bit ERT Barry Alvarez dismayed by their sloppy play last week well we talked about execution between the center and a quarterback a bit part of the execution and play for a quarterback as the handoff and that was not a good mesh between Calhoun and stock Oh the Badgers lucky to get the football back so now they are back in their own territory is a loose five second and 15 Thomas again number 72 with the block there are a couple quarterbacks on the field that are not going to want to play much longer in this football game if Joe Thomas keeps releasing free on the outside let's see if we can get a freeze on contact right there I mean look at the play here that's what you're looking at as a cornerback against Joe Thomas releasing as a tackle and Brandon Williams just slip them with that left foot stepping on the sideline or he might have been gone for six episodes slip that got him out of bounds as he planted first in time those dude played Brandon Williams and we talked to him last week says he wouldn't want to throw the football his talk to the coaches about let him try but he misfired after last week they ought to let him sell popcorn yeah the big punt return couple touchdowns receiving and you know Pam that's where that we get a chance to break down right outs throwing motions but let's let's take a stab out of here and look at the blocking I mean as a whole hide receiver you can't hope for any more time than that throwing the ball down the football field they look pretty good on the road his first career pass attempt falls incomplete he was fabulous last week he had 220 240 yards allpurpose yards including three touchdowns against and on to Brian Calhoun and he has taken down at the 24 yard line picks up five more our Aflac trivia question it has been 10 years when northwestern won the big 10 and went on in the Rose Bowl the only active player from that team in the NFL it's a defensive guy my undefeated streak has been broken it was knocked Wayne Bates good guess but a defensive guy Barry Gardner i backer for the team in new york and they're honoring that team here today there's a bunch of guys about 60 or so from that Rose Bowl team Wisconsin seven four nine today as flags come down on a third and five and a third down conversion rate has been a huge factor in the first half number 63 on the still third down you know and as a defensive unit northwestern needs to take advantage of the break here on the penalty they've got stock Oh in a third and long situation there's a pretty good linebacker from that Rose Bowl team Pat Fitzgerald aligned the linebackers coach now very animated on the sidelines and Randy Walker giving him a lot of credit for the work he has done that was an exciting Rose Bowl against Northwest and Keyshawn Johnson taking over that football game way stock Oh dumps it out to Calhoun and picks up the first down so Brian Calhoun and he's not killing you running the ball can come out of the backfield that's his fifth catch he needed 10 yards and got 18 on the last scoring drive it was a third down conversion pass to Calhoun that really killed northwestern and again look at Palermo 52 and not a lot of interference to run out front not a lot of traffic in the big 23 20 win against Michigan that has kind of set up this wisconsin season i thought it was the past catching ability of calhoun that set this team apart offensively not is running the goal it's seven catches in that game that's a record for any running back in the Barry Alvarez era as lineman gets it down to the four picks up six more Barry Alvarez is missing a couple weapons in that Burnstein a big fullback really lines up and it's almost like a guard in terms of his physical stature and also Daniel's Owen Daniels a tight end see those two players back down the stretch excuse me northwestern takes the timeout Owen Daniels hurt his ankle very early last week against Indiana we have not seen him right now 15 love to go and Wisconsin looking for another score those folks happen that after UK Wisconsin will indeed be six vino on the season badger fans have always traveled while we talked about Alvarez his first Rose Bowl championship team back in the early 90s and I remember I broadcast that game for UCLA on radio Pam and I remember looking out hundred thousand tickets at about 85 thousand were dressed in red and you know we we all know that that's UCLA is home field during the season Willis it was quite a spectacle but not a home field when the Badgers come to town now second and goal from the floor Nick Roach the junior from Milwaukee one of two Wisconsin natives who get significant playing time on this northwestern team made the stop have you talked to both of his coaching staff this this matchup and in this mini rivalry in the big ten between these two teams said a lot of physical games over the last five or six years and they're really throwing the leather around down on field level today Camp northwestern with another timeout we will take the time now to go back to reach Davis all right Pam coming up on the pontiac performance halftime report the horns have hooked them first in the Red River Rivalry will show you exactly how Seminole is also putting together a pretty scary offense in the college game day game in Happy Valley but work them and while Wes constant doesn't look pretty but they do keep winning on a consistent basis everybody talks about these Penn State linebackers yes they're great Ohio State's much better total house state has some great defensive backs awesome you know alright we'll talk about it halftime C in a bit visiting with the you three guys coming up Coors Kirk and Lee both picking Ohio State to win that big game Penn State today well I have to agree with Coach Holtz you know this is the prettiest team offensively or defensively as we look at a tremendous number for Wisconsin in the red zone but court Hawks pitched hit the nail on the head there's nothing fancy about the style is Wisconsin team they don't pull you over with many star players or now featured players offensively or defensively but they don't make many mistakes two rocksolid fundamentally and they play great specialty a third and goal from the five and another penalty comes down another penalty flag substitution breaking the huddle with 12 players Barry Alvarez that's the kind of stuff that will drive you crazy yeah especially when you're coming out of a timeout I mean occasionally you might have a slipup break in the huddle with 12 lining up for 12 but after a timeout that's that's not real fun for a coaching staff now Wisconsin will call time northwestern had called the last timeout as he as a stock Oh goes over there our crow offensive coordinators for Wisconsin Paul Chryst and Brian white sharing the duties and coming up before that game Iowa will be at Purdue on ESPN so a full day of Big Ten football on ESPN and early on in this Big Ten schedule it's been a sentimental journey of sorts with Barry Alvarez and Joe Paterno both undefeated we look at the standings really the exception of Illinois these teams are all bunched up within one la a one game in the loss column and we're very early I think Michigan is going to be heard from before the season is over and Wisconsin gets a big break not having to play Ohio State or Michigan State northwestern kicking themselves for blowing at 23 to 70 the Penn State year too there Stockard oxen Gardo gotta end on it but the ball hit the turf when you think of that play call and he was right at the 10yard line the line of scrimmage with a lot of guys well I think they set up a 2 a 2 juego meeting a two way decision for stock Osaka first had the ability to swing the ball out to his left he didn't like what he saw and then they set up the inside screen to Williams that's dangerous when he get a deflection Wisconsin failing to score a touchdown for the first time today after getting into the red zone Taylor melhoff a sophomore from Aberdeen South Dakota nails it from 27 yards out and Wisconsin takes the 10 point lead so maybe a minor win for that northwestern defense just giving up the field goal and boy there's some horses in the big ten great running backs Laurence Moroney Mike Hart just torched Michigan State for the second straight season Antonio Pittman 171 against Iowa for Ohio State and Tyrell Sutton was seeing him here today a couple of touchdowns in a puck 12 against Penn State two weeks ago and Brian Calhoun fabulous against Michigan and that does not even take into account the seven catches he made and look at the numbers and look at the carries for these guys that's what really jumps out at yes you talk about workhorses and packing the mail I mean Calhoun is averaging over 30 carries per game when Ron Dayne won the Heisman Trophy for Wisconsin the Barry Alvarez he only averaged just over 24 carries again winning the Heisman Trophy remember he went about and a big penalty earlier he has stopped at the 20 Northwestern has one timeout left and in case you're wondering who is number one in the country it is a fabulously talented DeAngelo Williams at Memphis who has been even more fabulous because the top two quarterbacks in Memphis went down with broken legs already this season and that kid is amazing and when you don't have a pass game it makes it so tough not only in a running back but an offensive line you got to have balance and speaking of balance you get to look at northwestern's offense finally bent over backwards at the 28 marks a loose key among those trying to lasso him in I've been so impressed with Tyrell sudden we've had a couple chances to watch him this year we've got the visit with him and I really think he's one of the class kids that I've gotten the pleasure to meet and college football and some time really handles himself well Western short of picking up the first down going to be looking at about a third and one Randy Walker when we visited with the music or Sutton number one freshman running back in the country is Walker wants a timeout but he says he's not quite ready to coronate to hypergirl something yet as the next great thing but maybe a little bit of that is psychology but when we talked to Tyrone yesterday he had no idea that he was number one in the country as far as freshman rushing notes as far as we know college kids they always like to give you that touch of humility but they read the papers was he terrific against Northern Illinois Tyrell Sutton in 14 yards and four touchdowns how about that Big Ten player who leaked the first game he ever started he replaced Brandon Roberson week one against Ohio and ran for over 100 yards in his first game 214 yards in his first start Jimmy dykes has more on Tyler well he's used to having success as a youngster playing with older guys back when he was playing peewee football as an eightyearold he started on the tenyearold team and one of his teammates from that Akron area NBA allstar LeBron James Tyrell says that the LeBron James me definitely made the right choice by choosing basket license a tenyearold wide receiver LeBron James was not very good Tyrell was an 8 year old linebacker on that team and they both have prospered in their respective sports huh and they're both they both made fabulous decisions obviously and employ LeBron James both of them from Akron off obviously that's where they knew each other but LeBron went in to play high school football is a big guy just kind of wanted it to all right high school players Sutton gained over 2,000 yards as a freshman in high school mr. Ohio for us in one play here was some kind of run in a cop drive status inside a minute puts the clock stops on first downs in college football as they set the chains Fields Hampton Inn on the coverage is going to be a pass interference call against I could guano where Wisconsin northwestern might get a break and get the ball back here we have offsetting penalties holding number 63 on the office pass interference on the defense repeat first down that's a second holding call against the veteran the vocal leader of this team Zach Strief the take down on the left side of the screen and then I could guano contact with the ball in the air negates the interception by the badger the interception there that was negated by Hampton first intend now with 46 seconds left to go from the 42 you there are not many quarterbacks in college football that can make this throw this is dropped right on the money when he had Filner along the sidearm beautifully tailored triple Gilmore does not have a lot of room to work with this is tight coverage and he saved some room to fade that was like a deep fade pattern Fillmore used his big size to leave him some room Bell had the coverage but the tax was better Herbert stretching it out clock stops now with 32 seconds left to go Bazin a had what he wanted and fascinates being careful with the football times he doesn't want to make mistakes he had six there if he just has a touch more accurate with the football pervert ran a nice work for handsome we've depended 64% of his mass is coming into this game 11 for 16 so far today second and goal from the 9 time outs left for Northwestern no doubt is the ball is caught you still have time get up to the line of scrimmage you don't know downs clop stops with nine seconds left and Northwest will have at fourth and goal and that's a situation where quarterbacks will yell clock but if you burn the clock there with an incomplete pass you force a field goal attempt you'd like to have a codeword that get you into a great pass play in that situation that way you don't throw the ball at Turf you get a shot into the end zone and that's that's an area I think northwestern has to practice up and have a play they can go to there instead of burning the damn yeah because they did have time to at least take a shot in the end zone if it's incomplete then you bring Howl's in Joel howls from 21 yards and he punches that one too Northwestern unable to put the ball into the endzone but they do get the field goal from Howells from 21 yards out two pulls it within a touchdown even getting the three points that's still an impressive drive and it cuts the lead to a touchdown what a throw by bass and a two Fillmore to set up that field goal for Northwestern and I think that gives them a shot of adrenaline and momentum going into the locker room taking a look back at the throw that's set up the three points for Northwestern look at faz name and he's been sitting in feeling some pressure and drops that deep fade route over the outside shoulder to film or film or a he can't he can't say enough about his route there and keeping the pressure against the cornerback and then fading out and leaving some space senior quarterback Northwestern history with as far as caches are concerned and he does have the 27 yard that helps set up Bazin A's touchdown run and then that beautiful catch that helps set up the field goal from Howells the realities which kickoff kicker Lester and the two seconds walk it is covered up by Jarvis mitten only receivers on this Wisconsin team the pontiac performance halftime report is coming up next here on ESPN we'll go back to Reese Davies coaching Holtz and Mark met this is an interesting situation where you look at a quarterback some quarterbacks you know they top out throw on the ball about 60 yards other quarterbacks can throw at 70 75 yards they'll be interesting to see if Wisconsin takes a crack down the field on a Hail Mary it looks like they may just go to a knee I think they're going to win in that formation to go into the locker room with the sevenpoint lead over northwestern Wisconsin moment for almost 20 minutes with Brett bass and they able to leave that drive as they are down by a touchdown let's go down to Jimmy dykes is standing by with Randy Walker coach you get three points to finish off the half but what happened on your third down play there well we just decided to go clock and stop it I didn't want to take any chances of not getting some points out of that driving if we have an inadvertent snap or a sack we're out of the game then and so we got women to get chance score points how concerned are you about the time of possession that they have right now on you well that's the least indicator in college football success you know you got to make points to make plays when you have the football I thought we got things going the second quarter thanks coach so playing it safe there to go for the three points when they had it third and goal so Randy Walker's team down by a touchdown as we head now to Reece Davis in the Pontiac performance halftime report all right Pam glad to have you along the ponty high performance halftime report the performance at the end of the first half by the Northwestern offense good drive get down there but you didn't like the way they handled it around the goal line without the timeout no not at all it's poor preparation in my opinion and not only that you have a twominute offense you're supposed to be prepared you supposed to have a package to go down there nine ten seconds left on the clock plenty of time to throw a fade pattern into the end zone take a shot at a touchdown still have time for the field goal now offensive lineman you think that way but let me say that the most damaging thing that can happen to a football team is to be two scores down by making sure they had three on the board kicking a field goal they're only one score down when you're one score down there's a big difference in being behind yeah but coach my point is there is enough time on the clock for them to go for and if they don't get it there's still time to kick the field there's no doubt that I agree with in that respect marking for an offensive lineman that's impressive I really am aren't you all about that points on the board all right the coach says get the points on the board the offensive lineman says smashing man I'm leaning to I'm willing to take it a shot coach you're gonna have to convince me at some point we'll talk to more football in just a bit welcome back to Northwestern where it is 17 to 10 in favor of unbeaten Wisconsin at the half Northwestern 7 for 21 yard field goal at the end of the second quarter by David Morey and Brett fastened a the senior quarterback from Northwestern continuing to make big plays now this is a tough with Scott's of team this is an undefeated badger team very good on defense Bosnia at 150 yards in the first half his plays are gonna have to make the difference in the passing game in the second half if they're gonna spring the upset he did drop in a beautiful pass to mark Fillmore that helped set up the field goal here was the Napa game track Brian Calhoun 140 total yards catch very versatile the transfer from Colorado Tyrell Sutton they all the leader excuse me rushing yards for any freshmen in the country has 48 yards on eight carries that was his career long run right there at 28 yards towards the end of the second quarter and northwestern gets the football first and I think northwestern is going to have to stick with some selective doses of the run game with with Ty Tyrell Sutton yeah they can't abandon the run in the second half you got to keep Wisconsin honest along that defensive ton and deciding to take a knee in the endzone Roberson and northwestern will take over you take a look now at the first half statistics and again the time of possession David and it's really telling a story of two weeks ago northwestern's last game against Penn State almost 40 minutes of possession for this Wildcat offense and the Badgers have turned the tables a bit this afternoon only nine more yards of total offense for Wisconsin even though they twelve more plays and held on started here in the second half and most forward for about a four yard game as we head down to the field and Jimmy dykes Pam I talked to Barry Alvarez just prior to the kick of the second half and he said the theme in the locker room at halftime was to finish finish box finished tackles finish our assignments he said look for some adjustments in his secondary defensively he said offensively he's happy with his balance but they do want to throw downfield some in the second half from stock owed to his receivers Pam it's interesting that he would say balance 31 rushes and only 12 passes he was known for his play selection is is involved as Sutton gets that carry Barry Alvarez isn't interested in balance as long as he's running the ball effectively he'll run until you can stop him and conversely this offense from northwestern you know their whole story is balanced they want to spread you Annie Walker talks about going heavy Swettenham men Bazza May along with something they're going to have to mix up the room and pass effectively third and to Sanders coming in on the blitz Bazeley goes the other way a very important spot as fields caught it and he is over the first down marker he slid down for some college football you don't have to be touched and signature down Bret Bielema thneed offensive coordinator and no one has scored in the first five games in which they have played in the third quarter in a mine go back to that balance thing yes in as far as play selection was concerned it wasn't balanced but they were balanced in yards 112 rushing yards 113 passing yards for the Badgers in the first half second breaks he's been so impressive the first four games of the season for the Wildcats remember this is a true freshman for the best running backs they become out of the state of Ohio and his numbers grew but he's had two or three highlight film runs in this game and what's really setting in the park camp is he is running through tackles now over 100 yards again with fourth 100yard game for him and that was a 45yard run a new careerhigh to all the sudden catches his breath the body goes to Hamlet who had the Torian was unable to grab it all sorts of time on that play bonus goes as an incompletion probe as an a he talked about his running ability his ability to pull the ball down that time still call runs to the quarterback but I think he's been exceptional in this game buying time behind the line of scrimmage he said some opportunities to pick his spots to move left to right and then fine receivers and the biggest decisionmaking is continuing to be solid at the quarterback position sup let's check back in as a tailback on second down he was and he is laughing at himself because we talked to him about it yesterday second described his running style the box and not pretty and this was both of that you hear about players on artificial turf they'll say hey the turf monster got me this time the grass monster got him he was free and he was gonna walk in for the touchdown still passing a what a kind a real decisive cut to create that seam in the middle of the field first and goal from the four he's looking to put it up Western the more his first touchdown catch of the season of his career and yes that's the first time Wisconsin has given up points in the third quarter this season so in Wisconsin hands so a huge block on the extra point but Bazin a his running wasn't pretty but this pass was Fillmore gets the touchdown and they're back to within a point look at a nice tall ship sailing on Lake Michigan that's not what the oars is a David no often goes yachting typically it's to south of France in the Caribbean what a beautiful sight though this venue is Western continues to keep it away from the dangerous Brandon Williams with their short kickoffs was giving north or Wisconsin short fields as Jarvis Minton fields that kickoff again let's go back to the failed extra point this is gonna be a low kick Robert Rogers number 22 is gonna get up he's going to get a piece of the football but that rests with Howells the kicker and that was not very good execution you gotta get the ball up with trajectory and a lot quicker than that to have success and you kind of hold your breath if you're northwest and wonder if that play later on the strip ball game better being a tie game to one point Wisconsin Calhoun gets the first block kick for Wisconsin this year and how was his a kicker did kick that 21yard field or earlier today but that was a little bit of a knuckleball that didn't get a lot of elevation on that kick as you get deeper and deeper into the Big Ten schedule the weather becomes more of a factor there's some wind down on the field level the elements start to take charge and the twoplace kicked him out of three so you know I know scrimmage but Calhoun was able to break free for another yard making the stop this defense for Northwestern has been the line did they did give up over 770 yard shares of the state they gave a big plays against Penn State the at Penn State on the roads fifteen about a minute ago gave up a fourth and 15 two weeks ago they'd settle down and there open up the second half that fronts up this would be a huge stop here on in Wisconsin's first possession of the second half and he does for the first time today northwestern gets it three and out on defense and you make adjustments in the locker room at halftime drive through Wisconsin for staff though converted to Calhoun underneath that have matched up against nine backers early in the third quarter here Northwestern reacting to Calhoun as he slipped out of the back to you throwing the second time today Wisconsin apart the bush had a 46yard that he pointed beautifully at the 1yard I'm Way back in the first half mark please call Wisconsin special teams Lamar Watkins when the linebacker is coming down there to make the stop North Winston's already scored in this half and they have the ball again undefeated Wisconsin with its hands full right now with Northwestern northwestern has already scored a touchdown in this quarter they have the ball for the second time on their 27 wedding sensation gets it up to about 33 as we go back to bounce back game for Virginia who just got the beast of by Maryland Maryland school 45 points in one game huge game as Northwestern and Sutton stopped about a yard short of the first down Brett bassanese numbers both running and passing and he should have had another rushing touchdown except he tripped up around the 5 you're going in on the next play for a touchdown the Bazza may needed some help from Tyrell Sutton and the running game were hard to come by early in a football game but Sutton in this offensive line are starting to give Bazin a hell Sanders says Sanders seemed to have him stopped for nine maybe 190 pounds able to keep it going dante's Sanders couldn't quite hold up at the point of attack that gives you an idea eighty seventy fivepound Sutton fivefootnine though he is not a big player but he has tremendous lower body strength and he won the battle at the point of attack already over a hundred yards and there is a bit of a crosswind down on field level he looked relaxed on that delivery I can't find much fault with the way he's played in this game he has not only kept the Wildcats in the football game but I think he's given them some prospects of pulling an upset here 13 for 22 so far does have a touchdown pass now on second and 10 the first down by Johnny White as we get down to the field again Jimmy dykes hey Pam Brett Bazin a is a fifth year senior but Randy Walker says it's taken him four full years to really step up and understand what needs to be a leader as a quarterback he said finally this year Brett Bosnia has gotten away from being a politician running for office you know where he tell everybody what you want to hear all the time and now when he steps in the huddle he's holding guys accountable and he said because of that every time he steps in the huddle all ten other guys are instantly a better football player but it's taken him four young long years to get to that point and when you're when you're in the quarter when you're quarterback and you're stepping in the huddle especially at this level of play looks like the Wildcats picked up the first down yeah it's not about making other guys everyone you have it's about having guys around you play better and respect and Brett phazon a is that type of player it's really gonna be kind of sad Pam to see him leave and the Marquis put on this northwestern program still a lot of work to be done here in the season we're early in the Big Ten schedule he's having himself a football game this afternoon Randy Walker says he's sort of a consonant pleaser and once he realized he didn't have to be a friend everybody things started to get better they took a lot of talks to get a man loss of a couple yards for Jonathan fields another update I'm coming from rece Davis all right Pam how about a little Beamer ball for you Virginia Tech and Marshall Bernie Moore's going to try to throw it for the Thundering here that's the severe tactical error Vince Hall pick six head it's the 99th nonoffensive touchdown to be Moreira they've added another is 31 7 used to see in that from Virginia Tech and that wasn't the biggest quintessential illadvised and takes it down to the steps of the barrels at the 45yard line picked online a couple weeks ago we talked to the Penn State defensive coaches and they said you know the real key to playing this offense for northwestern the spread offense is to get them off schedule their murder on you if they can get that 13:33 situation Bazza made with his quick throws and his selective wards has put his team in good positions and third down situation 69% and get the first down catches now for Fillmore the senior from Reynoldsville Ohio it's so nice as a quarterback to have a receiver like Fillmore a receiver that's respected he doesn't have the best speed in the world but we've seen a couple big plays down the field in the deep passing game you got to respect that on the outside and that's like stealing candy from a baby when its pitch and catch three to four yards per his ankle on his first punt returning the season enfermo finally getting Roberson gets the carry and he is tackled down and a huge one Happy Valley so big our College GameDay guys are there distributes the bomb just about everybody well he not only distributes the ball but he is making money throws this is an NFL caliber ball and he's made about five or six of these in the game not an easy ball right here and Lane is a big receiver running that inside route on the skinny post ball was delivered on time and perfectly so a first and goal from the Sabbath just short today by the way now over 200 yards passing today that is a northwestern record 20th time he's gone under 200 feet so he's gonna leave with a bunch of records and this is this is a Wisconsin defense will the top 10 units in the country stopping the run and if you're a badger coach and player you're thinking about this time on the sidelines second and goal this wanted Wisconsin deep where to the score touchdowns on both of its possessions this has some viewers right over to here could take you know it take a lead of seven points I like taking the point early in the game 552 to go in the third quarter take the point move on hey I agree with you as Howells that time much better form as he punches through the extra point Brett Bazin a leading the way but it was something you took it in for his night touchdown of the season 23 pushups now for the northwestern cheer squad how about a 73yard touchdown drive 80 yard touchdown Drive Northwestern so far here in this third quarter 100 yards again the only game in which he did not go over 100 yards he at 98 considers on a state didn't get the Aries in that game so Wisconsin beaten and the 14th ranked team in the country is down and again Brandon wins one his hands on this kickoff she guys it is taken at the 26 yard line Taiwan Rowan gets it Wisconsin down by six with the ball first and ten from there 26 taco and he finds time his favorite receiver so far today and he picks up the first down up to the 39 Adam Bella makes a stop Wisconsin going with two tight ends nice job up front this offensive line you know we mentioned that they didn't run the ball effectively last weekend against Indiana I think Barry Alvarez was equally disappointed with their pass protection he said they were lethargic you know Pam you mentioned he is common that they were sleepwalking but they're holding up well up front and stock Oh is doing a nice job of continuing to come with seven catches equals his career the quarterback's taco this defense gave up yards against Northern Illinois Arizona State Penn State and it's been eating at Tim magar go one of the best tacklers in the country last season with great intensity this afternoon two sacks doubles his career mark coming into today shiftiness Brendan Smith finally gets him out of bounds but not until he's lay down to the 36 at Northwestern the biggest win of the season for Wisconsin against Michigan game on the line stock Oh went underneath the Calhoun on the gamewinning drive and remember Joe Montana playing with the 49ers the way he used to drop the ball off to Rathman his fullback and Roger Craig his tail back comfortable that they could get the job done after the catch and picked up yards and I think that's the confidence the kind of confidence at stock Oh receiver today stop gets the block from his fullback Chris Presley stocke Oh Abel to get it down to the 31 picking up about five you hear about MIT game management making smart decisions making the right play and both quarterbacks have executed so well and you can see it in those total yards numbers 369 200 yards against us usually defense second yes stop very cold field among those in the middle of the northwestern lining only picked up about one right here pan you get about a third and three maybe threeandahalf this might be to four down situation pick up the first down here be thinking about a fourth situation than me old stock Oh he puts just a little bit more on that ball Jonathan or that has the capability coming up with that catch but I got stock goes short on that throw a bit a little more one cats today for 15 yards this is a 46 yarder Hotel now would be a career high for him a career and he gets it the sophomore from Aberdeen South Dakota puts three up on the board for the Badgers álvarez showing some real confidence in Mal ha this punter to Bush have been weapons in the special teams department this year Mel Hoff has been so impressive we got a nice little wind born this place kicked their Pam right through the cross one in between the crossbars bellhops only previous miss was 51 yards and that was against North Carolina nails 46 let's go down the Jimmy dykes hey Dave you're talking about John stock oh maybe short arm in that last pass he told us last week he actually has a checklist that he goes through in his mind within a game when he starts throwing balls Rowley and make sure that he's not over striding and he also makes sure that he is driving into his throw and it's not often we hear quarterbacks talk about within a game thinking about their mechanics and here's a former quarterback I would like to get your thoughts on that well Jimmy he played quarterback it all starts with the feet that's your foundation that's your base number one you got to get back here depth quickly in the pocket and then you have to have good balance and stock Oh has had some problems with this balance threw the ball terrifically a week ago on that ball or on the last Drive didn't look like he had great leverage on that back for it that might have been a fact takes over from the ESPN the Bengals jokes have subsided across the country yes showing that strength gets it up to about the 28 yard line Lamar Watkins hanging on but Sutton again this is a guy who was listed at and is probably closer to five eight and he said that he was told he was too small to play high school football forget college football there were people who told him he was too little for that well he wasn't highly recruited but there were major schools that were after a Morandi Walker that was a masterful piece of recruiting to offer Sutton Earl and cruises stuff by picking up a force down and the first guy he's just going by he's not going down with the first hit well and with the spread offense you don't expect the team to run the ball physically the spread offense people think pass spread them out throw the ball the outside but Sutton is breaking tackles on the initial tackler the chose in the holes and this northwestern team is moving the ball and getting nice push up front from their offensive line as Sutton takes a break there is a Wisconsin defender on the field the training staff all around him we join you from Ryan Field in Evanston Illinois the home of Northwestern University Wisconsin is number 14 in the country unbeaten and atop the Big Ten standings but they are trailing Northwestern now 23 to 28 I roll Sutton 132 yards on the ground the true freshman who leads all true freshmen all freshmen period in rushing has put on quite a show here so far today and while we wait word on the injured player Casey Hogan let's go back to rece Davis in the studio Reese Demon Deacons give him Florida State and Bobby Bowden dose of their own medicine I mean that's usually Bobby Bowden faking punts in his own territory and running trick plays and Seminoles find themselves in a fight hold them finally on the part he gets a nice hand from this crowd as he is taken off a lot of fans again making the trip it's about two and a half hours from Madison Wisconsin here to Evanston which is the first suburb north of Chicago and and boya you mentioned it back in the first half Wisconsin travel well to California no they're gonna travel Game two half hours away just great fans yeah and there's certain universities and college football worried your visit and you play in Madison I played there as as a as a college football player when I was back at UCLA in the 80s they have great fans classy fans fans that understand football that's the six fields this offense just continues to click the success in the long game gives that playaction fake some bikers and giving them some openings in the short intermediate areas of this pass offers another first down northwestern Bazin a bitches it richard freshman from fort lauderdale florida picks up a few let's take a look at the possessions very successful yeah points on four of five drives the fumble the ball out near midfield on the snap shotgun formation goodness the last three drives seventy five eighty and seventy three four scores Thompson with the 52 yard touchdown catch Ryan field is buzzing as howl's comes in for the extra point I live by the sword and you die by the sword Bret Bielema the defensive coordinator for Johnson they love to play man across the board stop your run but if you can beat them mantoman on the outside you can have success Jim Thompson Jonathan do to speed guys the deep threats for Northwestern we talked to Brent Bosna he said we worked all week long getting deeper the style of play that Wisconsin offers you and once again as you said Pam a perfect we said at the top you had to have one his best games at Northwestern this is the best I've ever seen him throw the football fasten a now 24 28 with a couple of touchdown passes and we also were just talking about Iowa's concen was concentrating on not plays and there's a 52yard er really bites up and this guy Brandon Williams number one when the best kickoff returner 'he's in the country has not gotten the football the only player in the nation in the top six impart returns and kick returns and they continue to kick away from them and they're taking the trade they're taking relatively good field position in exchange for Williams not touching the ball growin again gets it instead of Williams and they will start from the 27 now remember Pam this defense gave up a fourth and 15 if Penn State was facing a fourth and 15 from their own 14 yard line with about a minute to go two weeks ago and if they don't allow Penn State to convert that play there this game against the very good Arizona State team ten Wisconsin Henderson in Wisconsin is known as a lefthanded team they left to run to the left but this time the zone play to the right side great blocking up front that was Craig Erick the right tackle that created a crease and usually you're gonna see Cal who take this all the way so Henderson in the defensive backfield Calhoun was not taught from behind on the Paterson ran him down Williams finally getting his hands on the ball this time as a receiver he picks up about six is that been a football game the last two or three years but the last 16 times they met Michigan has won gets second floor we're standing breaking it first school but he shows a nice little burst of speed and just runs right around Paul close up for three guys so Stanley set up that move to the outside whoa Brian Calhoun back in now first and goal from the 6 for Wisconsin Western touchdown in a hurry as organs emotion to stock Oh again making the decision to take off and head towards the goal line but my bar well this is a guy I don't know if I've ever seen a Miss attack it's a soul in town he look over fairy Alvarez the three Rose Bowl championships goes out to Pasadena wins three times and the mark of a championship team is responding and fighting battle drives Wisconsin's put a nice drive together here second and goal for one and the Badgers respond and very quickly and cut the lead back to four points and they got most of the martyrs on that drive thanks to the legs of Brian Calhoun Stanley also with a nice chunk of yardage and Calhoun with his 11th rushing touchdown that needs the treat as Mel ha puts through the extra point Brian Calhoun is a speed back and he's not a traditional badger running back there with power and and a physical nature inside but on that touchdown run he showed some will at the goal so we have a couple of terrific running backs who talked about him at the top of the show and they have not disappointed both over 100 yards rushing and look at Calhoun about to get the double only five yards away from a 100yard receiving day Sutton the true freshman doing this part for Northwestern how about that drive five plays 72 yards in a minute seven yeah they're college football teams across the country that goes south when they're down points on the road a momentum the home team Wisconsin came out who made it look easy this team is not going to go away Jenny the minute 15 left to go in the third quarter separate number 14 Wisconsin and Northwestern we wanna freeze here back at Israeli back instead of picking up instead of looking forward Roberson and it allows two Wisconsin team to recover what a play on the return by Hamlin watch Roberson laid there number 11 he's looking back instead of picking up the block deal still Hamlet continues on down the football field and will also went into Canada purple shirts and white shirts there for a while a remarkable running back for Hamlin who came into this game ninth in the big ten and kick returns averaging just under 20 yards per return that that one was 82 yards took it all the way down to the 14 I don't think we're over soon as his lead blocker was figuring he was gonna pull that type of run back down and special teams that's huge in Wisconsin's area slang Second Battle and a decides to get it five games heading into this game and now they've given up 26 third quarter for Northwestern pitching a shutout in the third quarter this season event and eruption is he all time lady back in Ohio highschool history you can't give him that kind of space on the perimeter hanging onto the and then Sutton had nothing to greet in front of them and what do you think Bret Bielema is thinking right about now the defensive coordinator for the Badgers well when this northwestern offense gets moving and they're having success on the ground fascinates making the throws that he's making in this football game there are really tough offense to defend they rollerskates as a defense when they're pickin and shoes in the runnin past who said at the top Pam the fasten a would be the key and I think he's having his best overall game in his career at Northwestern they've been a pretty good games for Bazin a over the last four years miss Carson coach he's talked about his day in management he always seems to put him in the right calls and he has made some terrific decisions today will not get his hands on the kickoff today gets it short to Rowan who gets it out to around 42 let's head back to all right Risa Florida State getting a little bit of breathing room here and again Wisconsin giving up a ton of points here in the third quarter something they had not done all season they've given up to this game 29 yard line so Wisconsin continues to counter Jonathan or has looked great the last couple of weeks in Wisconsin fans we deliver on the promise of his freshman season yet forty eight catches was really a breakout player in the big ten a couple seasons back and he's doing a nice job is settling in the seams and opens down the field another good ball from stock in over 40 cats as you mentioned as a freshman as a sophomore he only had seven catches even though he played in every game he's two catches today American for a touchdown he is taken out at the 15yard line in Calhoun now over 100 yards both receiving and rushing so impressive to watch this big offensive line if they're all athletic they all run so well let's freeze right there one two three across the board picking up their blocks and you know I haven't seen an offensive line that likes to get out and move like this since the last time we watched Minnesota you know that's winger and setter strim this is a now from the 14 from his constant hi Dan Jason Posey act picks up about three as a very third quarter was to a close Wisconsin given up 27 points to Northwestern in the third quarter but they're still very much in it Northwestern fans still celebrating that explosive third quarter which their team 427 points up on the board against a Wisconsin defense it only gives up on average 18 points of gain but right now being tested from the 12 just underway and a good job again the garden pick things but if you're the Badgers you'd love to have a touchdown in this situation but you also have to be cognizant of what's going on the scoreboard you're down ten points you want to come away with the score it's very similar to the situation that Randy Walker for the first half we wanted to make sure that he won in the conservatively got the three points up on the board John Stark make sure you don't make any mistakes with the football keep that 40 points in your back pocket big is this Wisconsin Stan well John stock oh and company responding very well alternated touchdowns here makes it a threepoint game once again the Jonathan or the senior from Detroit has a 15 yard touchdown catch and then grabs this one from John stock go with plenty of time left in the fourth digging up for with crazy window here Northwestern Leeds Wisconsin 37 to 34 as John stock Oh has just thrown another touchdown pass to Jonathan or to cut the lead to three there's a good look at or poeta good game last week four catches for 128 yards in a win over India Indiana he is picking up where he left off with two touchdown catches today Rickon on him about 27 third quarter points as we look at the Napa game track 27 for Kim Thompson that's a 52yard touchdown catch the perfect pitch to Ty Ross takes it in from 14 yards out season Jews rejected let's go back to reach Davis personally here at second and six in Wisconsin fans are really making some noise Bazin a tries to quiet them mark Zalewski is a terrific linebacker taken backwards by a driving bassinet this is a read by Bazin a yeah he's gonna bake underneath he's watching the defensive end we reach the defensive end down here scrimmage and shows some Street finishing off that 1,000 days to swim the ball we'll touch an accuracy this afternoon but you gotta love us in addition to his passing abode picks up the first down close to the 30yard line Wisconsin number 14 in the country unbeaten on the season five and overall chouno in the big 10 but they have their hands full with Northwestern and northwestern hasn't stopped a lot of people either look at the total yards up to eight second be eight between the two football teams with most of the fourth quarter left to go Wisconsin that's the fourth catch on the day for her were picked up 22 to play the quarterback position with clearish and bass is going to sit in until the last count and he's going to take a shot on delivery and still deliver the ball perfectly outside pocket to Herbert that was a helmettohelmet glow they could have easily dropped the flag in the back here so now first in ten direct traffic he's like a surgeon out there Bazin a six catches now fulfill more resume continues to get great work upfront whether the offensive line working together blue jersey on white jersey given him time and finally he finds still more down the football field with another bigtime throw and Bazin a now over 300 yards on the day his fifth career 300 game and he's going for more and Bazin it goes down to the arms of Gino Cruz but he'll still pick up a couple more as the clock continues to all now inside eleven and a half minutes left to go here in the fourth quarter second and eight now and ballet the first down marker by Brett Bell and that was something to Randy Walker deflective as me about he said you know you know you're not watching Payton don't you put a note those do key moves just trying to go down fought with much of what Bethenny's done today it's about cuts decisionmaking vision as we mentioned at the top as Annie was going to have to have a great day with his decisions not only throwing the ball but running the football that Guinea makes the right choice on the shovel pass he has 64 yards on 10 carries of career high rushing for Brett bassinet eight catches four fields and you talk about a team you know just an internal sink in the rhythm everything is in favor right now for this office well as we mentioned on the last drive when this team gets that combination pass spreading the ball around to the receivers it's very difficult to defense we saw it a couple weeks ago against Penn State and the Wildcats jumped out to a 23 to 7 lead in that football game and Bazin a is pushing all the right buttons and you know that that's a bitter taste still in their mouths losing the Penn State fourth and goal from before but Zach Strief moving a little bit too early yeah this is not been a streak streak has worked well up front and he's done a great job blocking for Bazin a and Tyrell Sutton but Strief is going to make another mistake down here with early movement he's been hit by a couple holding calls and in this spot on the football field in a game this tight you can't that mistake as a senior leader on this team so they get pushed back now first and goal from the 9 that was the first penalty by either team in this as he was going towards his eyebrows so second and goal from the 9 coming up he had a shock there little backdoor opportunity to something up along the side line and tried to sneak that ball into the goal line area I'm 44 left to go and there is a flag and looks like in a unsportsman like conduct call after the whistle and a touchdown stands so Tyrell Sutton able to get in catching that touchdown pass that's his third touchdown today two of them on the ground and then that one goal and northwestern continues to shred this Wisconsin defense in the second half battles puts the through northwestern has five possessions in the second half all five of them culminating in touchdowns Tyrell Sutton with the latest and the lead is back to ten the 44 points northwestern has scored today the most Wisconsin has given up all season and look at the second half yardage Northwestern were 337 in a quarter plus about 5 minutes and 15 seconds of playing time they've scored 5 the Yankees down two games to one gonna have to wait to play until tomorrow at the earliest is Calhoun gets it Western offense led by fifth year senior quarterback Brett Bazin a boy this is something you might want to just put on the tape and show her a coaching clinic now run this office so Brett thousand a guy is in a tremendous rhythm and he's getting some great play calling from his offensive coordinator Mike Dunbar and we keep talking about the balance between run and pass and Bazin a is really having his way stock o has been up to the task and he's facing a 10point deficit that's right we can't forget what the Wisconsin offense has done I seizure that's Brandon Williams number two so he's made a couple of big plays but a flag is back at the line of scrimmage that's going to be a 26yard catch if it holds up Williams is working against mark please call the top cover man repeat second down Joe Thomas the left tackle and that hurts the Barry Alvarez watches a big pass play get wiped off the board's right here Joe Thomas the big left tackle that is not a hold in my opinion I thought he was holding up solid looked like a trip to me not a hole at any time a defensive lineman goes down like that I just that's that's the feeling is that it was a takedown and that's how the officials ruled it Barry Alvarez understandably upset that was a huge play to Williams that was negated now and Joe Thomas I mean people are gonna go down when they latch up with Joe Thomas he's six foot eight goes about 3:15 comes pretty close to blocking out the Sun and I thought he was rock solid in production on that floor so instead of the big because to second and say push back to the 48 of Northwestern cozy at the tight end in motion second in 1737 teen user situations situations second alone of dirt in law and Gary Alvarez knows that he doesn't have much time to work with Brandon Williams is split to the white stocke Oh dumps it down to cow the present in the garbled air along with Adam Candela well John stock awareness that's it made soar into the sideline they wanted an opportunity to go for it on fourth and 12 the northwestern territory Barry Alvarez showing a lot of confidence in the defense that's given up 34 points still down 10 points to punt this football away so the 10 point lead time ticking away mark Cui's Cole has only have one return for five yards and bush the bush is a master at killing the football inside the 20 this one killed the two that's twice now that he has gotten the ball inside the five once on the one once on the two Bazin a takes over with the long field ahead of them seven minutes and 28 seconds left to go as northwestern has taken over on it's three after another great two Bush punt and they're gonna give it up to ty Wilson true freshman gets it up to around the 8th as we get you down to Jimmy dykes on the field came I go back to what Brett Bielema Wisconsin's defensive coordinator told me before the ballgame he said my worst fear his northwestern getting in the rhythm offensively getting on a schedule ii said again their favorite run plays and their favorite pass plays were ran out the same formation they are unpredictable and from standing right here watching over us as offense operate the whole second half that's exactly what has happened to his Wisconsin defense in this ballgame Dave well in the Wisconsin put those yes defenses appeared to be back paddling in the I think it is that bad the suckin takes it up to the 12 you'll be about a yard short of the first down as Dante's Sanders makes the stop in Brett Bazin days numbers impressive to say the least that's a careerhigh 64 yards of rushing from four hands got three touchdown passes and the numbers just don't really speak to the Laningham is this offense he's done a lot more than post numbers in this game and you know this is where you can finish off a game if you can run the football Northwestern being careful not to get caught narrowing and first and second down plays makes us a one school ball game and I'm 31 gets the clothes down a stateless Reis great grab by minds and that game knotted up at seven apiece as they try to rebound from the loss to Maryland last week an enigmatic Virginia team lot of talent Bazin a flag comes down looks like with manifold coming up against Northwestern holding number 56 on the office that penalty is half the distance to the goal repeat first out Brian Keenan the junior from Westlake Ohio flag for the herd first three down to this time going to the run three consecutive times and picking up the first ground and not not a lot of yards but one of the most important sets of downs for Northwestern because it keeps the clock running now after this penalty Pam I think if I'm Wisconsin I use some timeouts here you've got them you got northwestern pin back and a first along situation I think you start using their timeouts to score twice something picking his way just past the 10yard line clock continuing to roll Wisconsin does have all three of its timeouts remaining if you use timeouts here you really put the onus on northwestern to put the ball in the air potentially stop the clock with incompletions very opera is going to be comfortable to use them later planets it's not a perfect science but Wisconsin has the northwestern offense than a disadvantage in terms of your position and down distance second and 14 that's a 207 you are Gannon was most importantly to Northwestern and hang on the football took a lick at the end of that play that's a backbreaker if you're Wisconsin's defense you can't afford to let northwestern convert on a second in law and Bazin a again coming out about the confidence in bassin a to call a pass on that spot of the field and then thousand eight converts to herbert and that goes a long ways towards solving this football game away if northwestern can continue to take care of the football pervert the junior out of Oxon Hill Maryland but that huge first down play Tyrel suddenly two hundred and he has three rushing touchdowns he's also for the touchdown pass and this one just shows you the kids speed Tyrell Sutton again makes the burst offender miss and watch it pull away from Lamar Watkins the Suttons not known for speed I mean he's not a blazer but he's got great football speed and if you woke up this morning and tuned in the ESPN's game day you would have hurt Kirk Herbstreit give you northwestern as his upset special and Curt nice going you hit this one right on the nose Tyrell Sutton a careerhigh 228 yards rushing he had 214 in his very first start against Northern Illinois in Game two and he just continues to pile up the Northwestern freshman rushing records and Barry Alvarez has to sit there and just go how the heck did we just give up a half a hundred points to anybody this defense has been terrific all season well they're experts at pad Wisconsin in the driver's seat with the remaining schedule he give up 51 points on defense to anybody Western says kicking to Brandon Williams once is plenty another short kick from Villarreal as we head back to restate week I know Michigan fans have been waiting for Breaston to break free and what a time here 4:18 left to go Northwestern with the huge lead is Brian Calhoun sup the first down and then is Wisconsin couldn't ask much more from this offense a stock Oh continues to impress he continues to improve Calhoun's had a great game as well but look at the total yards and Wisconsin's gonna have to go back to work on defense you can't win a Big Ten Conference we've given up north of 600 yards in a big 10 game a bad this badger team that graduate are out of town along the defensive front they've been unsettled in the secondary and they'd look like if today they're gonna get the flag as he was locked up on the sidelines with the ante battle they were four five left Wisconsin gets the interference call Wisconsin defense giving up 658 yards pass interference that 15yard penalty is assessed from the previous spot an automatic first down that's solid work by Brandon Williams picking up that penalty against battle down the sidelines and as a football team you never give up 405 to go and Wisconsin's got a hit quickly here potentially an onside kick but you're always trying to win even 17 poets down again picks up the first down and kills the clock inside the 10 battle again on the coverage the Brandon Williams who had a spectacular game last week against Indiana getting into the act here late and just joining us he's a terrific return man but Boyd northwestern's done a great job keeping the ball out of his hands on special teams at least now you've got just short of four minutes on the clock gets taco and this offense can punch it the Badgers still have three timeouts this game has not been decided stop go that's a touchdown touchdown catch of the game and Wisconsin did exactly they needed to do and that was strike quickly northwestern didn't burn a lot of time off the clock come along touchdown run by Sutton and stock oh and this offense did what they needed to do to give Barry Alvarez some hope and walk a little uncomfortable over the northwestern sideline so his team 123 to 7 lead here against Penn State two weeks ago in their last game melhoff again adds the extra point Johnson or now three touchdown catches on today the Badgers have some work to do on defense but this throwing game is going to make real tough on defenses to key to run this season against the Badgers hey Jonathan or that's just a disciplined route to the outside stock oh this tackle came into this season with Wisconsin fans but across the big ten is really the question mark on the office take a look at all his numbers but stock over the last couple weeks has been Randy Walker the head coach at Northwestern told us and he thinks Jocko is flatout underrated says he's really improved from last year this he's showing a lot of poise in there northwestern putting up 51 but 41 points here for Wisconsin stock Oh 21 for 26 with three touchdown passes does the one interception bucky the badge are gonna get some was it biceps and stuff developed doing all these pushups here today well on this kick off i think if your wisconsin now they may go with an onside kick but with three timeouts i think you might want to save the onside kick after your next score i think you might want to kick bill appear and try to stop northwestern in their own end with the three timeouts Randy Walker looks like he's going to go the other way five blows off the tee so I'll have to reset it Northwestern hands to myself Barry Alvarez was juice the play it the other way but pervert film or my nose after the hands team to Northwestern right into the hands of as we go back Teresa Thank You Reese meanwhile here under four minutes left to go in the 10point lead for Northwestern Ross Lane one of the wide receivers on this team is the one who grabbed that cost and Erick onsides kick and now it's up to Bazin a and Tyrell Sutton to kill the clock we already mentioned the end of the Penn State game two weeks ago this was the biggest play of the game fourth and 15 in the fourth quarter isaac small Cole his first catch of the game and then this Michael Robinson Western about twenty three to seven at one point they lose to Joe Phan company and Mort not for that play assuming they hold on to win today this northwestern team would be twoandoh in the big ten and you know a team probably in the top 25 well that's assuming again that they win this football game we've still got some some football to be played here and if Wisconsin can get a stop they can make things interesting and you know Penn State you get them fourth and 15 you feel like you really can convert in that situation heat you not only have the NIT knees on the ropes you have them lie on the ropes and they couldn't deliver the knockout ball on defense if devastating laws especially going into a bioroid as we look back now at the Big Ten standings you see northwestern trying to even up at Flynn apiece and Wisconsin trying to stay unbeaten there's somebody between Penn State and Ohio State will fall from the ranks of the unbeaten in the conference later on today that game tonight on ESPN Wisconsin trying to get the snap or get the ball back obviously as flags fly again ball start fiveyard penalty still second down that's been a tough day for Zach Strief in terms of lining I've had a couple penalties for early movement a couple holding calls but you know all in all across this offensive front this team has played big enough to post over 50 points against Wisconsin with the penalty pushback now second he loved it Northwestern first jonathan.felix number one the whiteout repeat second down that is exactly what they got Randy Walker a guy who doesn't cotton much to mistakes made by his football team seeing some crucial mistakes here in what could be the game killing Drive we're handed and you don't want to make that type of mistake with your office when you're trying to bleed a clock Wisconsin has taken the timeout with 330 PhD makers and the hawkeye's takes on some more importance when you consider they both have a loss and that in some ways is going to be an elimination game tonight between Penn State and Ohio State it could be a prediction on that one I think Ohio State's gonna be too tough in the end but when you look at Justin King and Tara Williams those two wideouts for Penn State and speed and they're scary on the outside never put it past Joe Paterno especially in front of a home crowd at Penn State and now second in 16 Wisconsin is down now too yes she did was now you give the boat here to freshmen and he's been error entire season but you know the Badgers are coming up they're trying to strip the football that was DeAndre Lavvy watch him finish off the play you see number seven come up he's going to strip just before the tackle and Wisconsin is our that play will be reviewed the previous play is being reviewed the question would be what did his hand hit the ground with the ball in it well and sudden continuing to fight three yards I think that this play is going to stand the levy comes up and he just gets a hand on the football before sudden goes to the turf I think this is going to be Wisconsin football and with 331 to go on the clock the Badgers still have a timeout if they score quickly here they don't even necessarily have to go with an onside kick I mean you score quickly and get a stop against Northwestern this is why you never quit then you never give up you do what you have to do to try to win a football game Wisconsin a couple minutes ago was down 17 points and looking at that angle it did indeed look like it will hold off the ball coming out of his hand before he hit the field Terrell Sutton did fumble against Northern Illinois and Randy Walker hates it when his players fumbled holding on the ball is the number one priority and Tyrell told us that he had to do a lot of up and downs and practice after he fumbled against Northern Illinois and if this holds up he's gonna have to do some more of it this week and how about the heart that the Badgers are showing on defense I mean they're bad or they've given up over 50 points Joe Marnie made a great play the previous play stands his call down the field was made after going upstairs and Wisconsin still breathing down 10 331 left to go northwestern about the play by Joe Monte and the strip by lady for the badges starker Jason cozia down after 5 yard game the Badgers going nohuddle status and if your stock oh you want to try to avoid throwing the ball short of the first down stakes that keeps the clock running don't get greedy but try to go to receivers beyond the first down James again just the one timeout left for the Badgers catches it goes out about stops the clock now with three minutes even left to go tell you what the Badgers are in great position here they've got the northwestern defense reeling stock O's making it look easy on some of these throws and you know to add insult to injury he's making these throws to the sidelines the receivers for the Badgers are getting a lot of open ground out towards the sidelines with time heading towards Ramsey lays out official says he was juggling it aren't uses case but to know that great effort by Williams the Williams seems to think that he made the grab stock oat delivering it low into the outside and that's a play that Williams has to make I think they may review this one to catch he kept his hand under the ball that they play on just at the best in time the nick of time and I think this warrants a review his play is being reviewed again I think they saw enough upstairs here that this call is going to be reversed nice taco you talked about that and they all afternoon buttstock oh this match Jim punch for punch wellthrown ball Brandon Williams ends up securing this ball with his right arm he's going to use his left hand to brace the ball and I think he's got the hand underneath the ball the whole time the ball did come loose but when it was loose it was in between the hand and the jersey I think it's gonna be the Badgers ball first down inside the 10 he was cradling it I agree here's the call after review the previous play Stan's has called on the field and disputable I suppose it was into play but that looked like a catch from up here interesting you got a call Mike you see him I thought that was a catch so instead its second and ten left to go and this Wisconsin Badger team is resilient as it gets Bucky has life misako was in his own he delivered that door right on the spot taking advantage of his high so Tyrell certain head the ball stripped away funneled it and Jonathan or for sports 51 to 48 let's head back to Reis games all right Pam just as soon as you guys are finished with this Big Ten shootout which we've seen a lot of lately Lou Holtz mark mate with me for the College GameDay School Board presented by Acura gets you up to date on the latest from the Red River Rivalry also the battle for the Little Brown Jug which is going to the wire and also look ahead to Penn State and Ohio State tonight I'm going to tell you how Texas it's just physically taking it to Oklahoma on both sides of the ball if you want to know why one team wins another one losses look at the big plays and the foolish penalties I was looking at the scoreboard thank you is it's all about the bottom line isn't it 51 to 48 is our bottom line here and how about eleven hundred and sixtyfive yards of total offense in this game Jonathan with four touchdown catches only the second Wisconsin receiver ever to have four in a game Lee Evans had five against Michigan State two years ago this is an interesting call here by Alvarez coming up dftba you got a timeout or do you go on side and again it's not a perfect science if you kick deep now either way you're gonna have to stop northwestern on downs but you give the ball to Northwestern and pretty good field position he got a lot further to drive if you get the ball back when you opt for the onside kick on the other side of the coin Sam you could always recover the onside kick so you got to figure it out to the outside and this time it smell hog and again it is recovered by Northwestern now hog keeping it low to the ground they also had standing out there another kicker and with 248 left to go Ross claim to the second time today wide receiver has come for the big recovery of an onside kick looked at the clock here with one timeout and assuming that northwestern runs the ball on all three downs if Wisconsin can get a stop they're gonna have plenty of time to come down the field and attempt a field goal or score a touchdown well over a minute the kicker Taylor melhoff has hit a career on 46 yard field goal in this game another penalty flag and thrown in the direction of the offensive line of Northwestern and if this is a hole do you take the penalty because the clock is gonna roll if you told the town holding the clock is set to factor here Pam if you take the penalty I think they're going to decline it they're gonna decline it because the clock put continue to roll again on first down right again David Maury because we looked over and Barry Alvarez wait and they're going to do that the clock the most important thing right now for Wisconsin and it does start to roll now and Bret Bazin a as much as he can it's tough for Northwest in the club pass I'm second or third down he thrown incomplete Wisconsin saves the timeout they pitch he goes down in the arms clock continuing to run to 15 Mike Dunbar the offensive coordinator for Northwestern and Randy Walker this is why you firm the big money you gotta make the decision here do you put the ball in the air because you could also an interception and a so you told him Pass Wisconsin's going to get the bar back and they're going to keep their timeout I think you trust is good for your senior I think they're going to try to put the game away and hit a ball beyond the first down change threat Bazin a walks over to take the timeout the last possible second Northwestern now down to two timeouts Wisconsin hanging onto their precious one Mike Dunbar is the offensive coordinator for Northwestern now in his fifth season running this offense on this situation Dunbar's on the headsets and he's talking to Randy Walker but she also bring Bazin a over and you talked to your quarterback about what play is he comfortable with you make the decision are you gonna run the ball you gonna pass it I think they'll put the ball up here you don't want to give the ball back to Wisconsin the way that's Taco and that offense is moving the ball for the Badgers but you consult Bazin a heavily on what he thinks badger a all always has the option if he doesn't like what he sees down the football field to pull it down and run for the first day trust him not to make that crucial mistake on third down and even if it is incomplete you hope that you could get a good putt from Ryan Peterson to knock it down HD polish cable operator or satellite provider today to play the game at least but stays inbounds the clock keeps running Jack I could wanton coming up to make the stop worked these situations inside five minutes masterful he couldn't have drawn it up any better he saved that time out for third down and as we've said well over a metaphorical Barry Alvarez in his 16th and final season as the head coach at Wisconsin coming in and taking over a program that was as dormant as they come and of course when he has three Rose balls and for him if he can come back somehow and win this game keep that perfect record intact he's a great legacy there's no two ways about it an undefeated season is on the line here and this team looked down and out they were down 17 points more than half the way through the fourth quarter I think this guy can still coach with the berry basket the college football I mean my reaction is coach how can you be stepping down I think he's really at the top of his game still and of course it's always a personal decision he leaves a great legacy threeandoh and Pasadena the Wisconsin's become a major factor in the big tap you go back to the 80s people didn't think about badger football it's a huge 100 million dollar renovation at badger Stadium fantastic facilities now of course Alvarez will stay on as the athletic director Bryan Peterson in do the Badgers we're looking for a fake kill you want to mix crying you don't get caught on 4th and 5 Peterson is going to kick it away from Brandon Williams and that's about it Wisconsin takes over at the freight you're playing on Sundays you might be worried about the clock here but in college football the clock stops on first downs and as long as taco can get time you don't take sacks and you try to knock pick receive her short of the first down markers a minute 23 is an eternity to get your team in the field goal position so they get it from and Peterson for the second time to the two touchdown passes too what a time to Reggie Macpherson to get his first career interception and a stock oh let this come back he had most of his success to the outside where you can see the danger you can see the threats he gets a little greedy on the first play of this musthave clock drives and he pays for he was looking for Jonathan or and Macpherson you can see just had a terrific break on the football and stock oh what an effort for him today but they will fall short he's thrown for well over 300 yards and four touchdowns couple of interceptions in that one McPhearson Northwestern needed a player to step up and make a play it didn't look like they're going to stop this badger team on downs Wisconsin was moving the ball at will in the passing game on the last two drives and stock Oh had some great chances down the stretch to pull out a miracle victory didn't quite get it done no timeouts left for Wisconsin they will take on Minnesota in Minneapolis next week and their undefeated season is nexium player of the game of career highs 64 rushing yards and also three touchdown passes it's here senior northwestern pulls off the upset beating previously unbeaten Wisconsin 51 48 despite Brian Calhoun going yards in both receiving and rushing first timer Wisconsin back has ever done that so northwestern takes at 51 to 48 this has been a presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports we'll be back with more shortly from Northwestern after a wild game let's first get it back to the much Commerce to do Reese all right Pam glad to have you on College GameDay school board presented by Acura Lou Holtz and Mark May alongside you know that is a score that bill Carmody and Bo Ryan could be proud of the basketball coaches at Northwestern and Wisconsin 5148 Wildcats do it again reminiscent of a game between these two in 2000 that finished 4744 Big Ten's a shootout lead these days but let's take a step back here guys is we've now dropped to 11 unbeaten teams will be down to single digits by the end of the day we have a couple of battles of unbeatens coming up a little later as you look ahead now at the Penn State Ohio State game Penn State goes into Ryan field they are able to get a win against this highpowered Northwestern team Wisconsin couldn't do it they were unbeaten coming in does it change the way you look at or is it too dangerous to daisychain games together it's always dangerous to daisychain but the way did I look at these games there are only two teams that can play defense and solid defense in the entire conference and both of those teams play tonight and come back to the scoreboard show because we'll tell you about him later that's Penn State and Ohio State all right coach gonna hear what you have to say about this game in just a minute but Jimmy dykes working the sidelines for us at Ryan field the northwestern Wisconsin game Wildcats come out with a victory Jimmy your basketball guy you had to like that kind of scoring well you can always like what a coach does in the locker room Reese oh I gotta ask you coach what adjustment did you make in the second half offense ly to get on a roll like you did last old bad start getting them going no we felt like we had stuff all day we felt like there were things that are offensive we know that we could do and make place I got to give a lot of corrective Bret bassinet he came out and got on fire and held our football team together we knew it was going to be a game like today and as I said off the air we make it interesting it and but I really like the way our kids had their poise they just kept playing and it was great to finish the game today your young freshman Tiger lymphoma bent ball and actually left Wisconsin back in this thing what'd you tell him after that I did not talk to him it was in his best interest that we didn't visit maybe you know that happens I think he was just trying too hard I don't think it's a mature player doesn't know this situation it was about getting yards he was trying to get yards I want talk to him at your play real quick bread what were you seeing defensively out there in the second half Hahnemann like we thought going into it there and try to man our guys up and they thought they could out physical us and our line played great you know my hat's off to the receivers they obviously wanted one and when you get them the ball they make someplace we talked upstairs during the ball game that you look like you're in zone what's it like to be in a zone in your home field against a top 25 team you know it's great it's a tribute to the team obviously you know nothing happens without those four guys up front Zach played great and the wide receivers really came to play like I said and you know Tyrell and I were joking around we needed to have big games and you know he sure did and I'm just so happy about our team I'm a congratulations thank you for Pam let's go back up to you Thank You Jimmy a fabulous game there for Brett Bazin a as they are able to upset Wisconsin and one of the best offensive displays you're ever going to want to see Brett thousand a a lot of teams that they play spasm and he plays at this level it's going to be tough to stop northwestern and this score is going to get the attention of a lot of defensive coordinators across the league baza may a career day we said he had to have one of his better days I think he had his best day as a wildcat we will have them next week at Purdue we've got to put into Tim magar goal how about a career high 25 tackles for him today northwestern beats Wisconsin this has been a presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports coming
