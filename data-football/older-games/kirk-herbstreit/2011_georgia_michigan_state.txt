will see Aaron Murray and Georgia on the field first we check in with our sideline reporter here at the Outback Bowl Jenn brown hello Jim hello Mike thanks so much well I caught up with Kirk Cousins Michigan State's quarterback just moments ago and asked him what it felt like to put that Spartan uniform on one final time and he said Jen it wasn't until I got to the stadium and I got in the locker room that I started to feel a sense of urgency I looked around at all of my fellow seniors and realized all that we had gone through and really wanted to put a final stamp on winning a bowl game here today now head coach Mark Richt for the Georgia Bulldogs told me that they're looking at this game not only at the last game for the 2011 season but also as a springboard for the 2012 season almost as if it's the first game for them of the 2012 season quarterback Erin Murray told me that he feels great about their returning team for next season and he thinks that they're gonna be able to contend for a national championship Mike ok Jen it's a very common theme around this Georgia program what's gonna happen next year of a lot of players coming back it's a little bit cooler than was great in the 70s all week a cool front came through last night and it brought with a north wind left to right 16 miles per hour as you watch this game here this afternoon from Tampa different places these programs with Spartans had only been to one ball in five prior years before Mark Dantonio came from Cincinnati where it coached the Bearcats is turned the culture around clean things up in East Lansing it's a program that holds its head right there with Michigan and Ohio State in the Big Ten and Wisconsin who you'll see on the Rose Bowl later on ESPN and Jen referred to it with Georgia with all the talent they have coming back even though the SEC is stacked and will give us a sixth consecutive national championship a week from tonight on their LSU or Alabama dogs have the people to get it done and the expectations will be high in 2012 see they get started with a springboard here today Kevin Mumma from Detroit Michigan one of the best in terms of touch back to the FPS this year's set to kick it off from Tampa Brandon Boyd in the field at the to the seniors who Fayetteville Georgia across the 25 and Aaron Mario bring it down to the 26 yard line we mentioned John only three miles down the road where he played his high school ball couple years of Georgia he showed a lot of Pro Tools he has great production this is a real student of the game notices athletic ability today he can get away from pressure and create with his legs at the end of the day he is surrounded with very talented wide outs here at Georgia and he can really throw the football going off to his left there number seven Orson Charles how's his high school teammate at plant high school here in Tampa what those guys hoping for some big hookups here today first pass complete to Marlon brown highly acclaimed out of high school in Memphis as it produced to that acclaim just yet right away Georgia is jumping into the no huddle offense they want to try to wear now Michigan State they're right inside they've only got a couple defensive tackles they're gonna try to wear them down Kent Malcolm is a running back the outside was it Georgia first down as he's just shy of the 40yard line hjl worthy firstteam AP All American at juniors together taking a look at the NFL we'll see what happens in this game but John he's gonna be on the field a lot has to be he'd better be playing with great stamina today because this is a third snap already for this George off next no huddle and keep an eye on middle linebacker max Bullough Michigan State when he sees Murray audible he's going to try to Auto their backup for the Michigan State Spartan defense forties in the 43 yard line I say Lewis baby chat with some impact players for the dogs when they have it Isaiah Crowell a running back who led them into Russia but it's not starting and 40 Glenn they're left tackle very important protection as Spartans are led obviously by Terrell worthy you talked about he's a dominant inside presence and max Bullough is a coach on the field as the middle linebacker for the Spartan defense the end of only a couple of yards one headline smart fans Trenton Robinson a captain second team allbig Ten coaches selection their free safety now the bass City Michigan sat for disciplinary reasons to the opening of this game Robinson quickly on the field the team rule violation he's back out there now and important down 32 it's except for Murray Jabbar's came in here stop shining the first down so the Spartans with Marcus rush after one first down will force a pump less his great team defense by Michigan State balls thrown quickly on the perimeter you're counting on your receivers to get a block but you really just rely on effort if you're a Michigan State Spartan defense they do an excellent job running to the football nice play by Russia second of the big ten top 20 in the nation he shot Martin back for the punt of truth Butler catches the Chaney and let it go it rolls down to the long field coming for the Spartans his plate sailors went down to down it for the final time interesting State's offense is led onto the field by the senior quarterback Kurt cousins third cousins we've talked about his experience and I think what's really going to be important for Cousins today is to find some kind of running game against this Georgia defense they do not want to fall behind in the down in distance against the Georgia Bulldogs they rush the passer as well as any team in college football gods relate to the party they're on offense but defensive set big cousins on first down throw to the ball break the plane it did not a safety Brandon Boykin with the tackle of Keshawn Martin they throw a lot of bubble screens and Boykin who looks like he injured himself on that play tackles Martin bear inside the end zone and it's a safety Todd Grantham the defensive coordinator told us they'll be no bubble screens in this football game watch the left corner number two Branden Boykin recognize it he's going to fire away and beat a block and make an impact tackle backed up for the Georgia defense lakyn can do a lot of things for this Georgia football team he's an excellent returner he's played offense and he's a top flight corner look at the injured Boyken after the safety as Georgia takes an early shoot Oh lead well as to nothing start here for George's they take the lead that's Russ was the interim mascot there it's Todd Grantham the defensive coordinator who has an NFL background and also has a background with Nick Saban yes he does and I do know this about Todd Grantham he does not like easy completions against his defense no bubble screens and he proved early in this game pic and bringing it out the 45 yard long well there's a loaded box they're gonna throw the bubble screen out to the wide side of the field in point that makes an impact tackle for a safety you see Cummings come across in motion you can only block one bulldog the other one's got to make the tackle and Georgia does an excellent job in oneonone tackling situations that's why they're a top 5 defense Mike in college football all 11 defenders can tackle and Todd Grantham has an NFL system they do a great job on defense you saw Boykin into this we went to break stay down for about a minute worked his way off the field so Erin Murray with good field position and a twopoint lead Malcolm runs to the while Smithfield and mouth it's a Spartan territories were first up here's Jeff Brown well quick update there I'm Brandon Boykin about five games ago Boykin actually fractured his teeth and that's what he was getting looked at over here on the sidelines he had actually knocked out a couple of his teeth six five or six games ago the SI d just told me and but he seems to be okay drinking some water and it looks like he's gonna be going back to the game player for this Bulldog team put on the brakes there were Spartans weight forms to gain only two yards for the freshman from Valdosta and it didn't take head coach Mark Dantonio very long to get Trent and Robinson his team captain back into the football game it's gonna be a quick screen throwing up top I think you're gonna see number 39 Trenton Robinson rally and make a nice open field tackle Robinson who leads his Spartan defense with four interceptions good to have him back in the lineup and Malcolm just popped out in the lineup the running back for Georgia it is left arm on the sideline Richard sag on the fourth what's up talked with his Georgia running back situation they've started four different ones over the last five weeks Isaiah Crowell the most productive SEC Freshman of the year but has not always been with the program hasn't been doing the right thing so it was opened up at camp for the bowl and Malcolm are the start without he's over the sidelines get that left shoulder checked out and sang goes the backup that playful mood and complete attempt to Chris Conway the freshman wide receiver defense in the neutral zone number two it's a fiveyard penalty and replay third down that's a nice job by Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray using the snap count in a long yardage situation I'm sure he saw number two William Goulston and pregame warmup and he said we're going to use a hard count on Goldston because this young man for Michigan State sure looks the part has NFL size he's their leading tackler in this defensive line nice job with the early snap count by Georgia good genes remember his cousin Vernon one was Buckeye firstround pick of octets he can work out there 34 Larry had shine has the first down about the Mitchell the 30yard line came in I'm running it all starts with great blitz pickup Mike on the left side of your line you're gonna see the Spartans blitz and watch the Bulldogs slide right into the Blitz and wad it up pick it up blush and that gives Murray a chance to find his true freshman number 26 Malcolm Mitchell's who's made a lot of clutch plays for the Bulldog there's the game within the game right there Bulldogs look to the sideline their offensive coordinator Mike Bobo tells him what he wants to run and that's bola the michigan state changes the defense took place tonight and a flag the pass interference Aaron Murray loves to take shots right outside of the red zone and be they got the matchup they want with Tavares King pass interference defense number 31 automatic you know the nerd has been hurt number 31 for Michigan State they say he's healthy nice job by this Georgia staff targeting him early to see how healthy he is so the ball moves to the 14 yard line Georgia has two number ones who play on up told about Isaiah koel the freshman leading rusher on this team there's also the defensive player number one Brandon Smith the starting quarterback who's in the Lyla Smith had an impact on office four five in a gain of nine listening to Mark Richt Mike Bobo the offensive coordinator they want to get speed on the field and the fastest Bulldog running backs or defensive backs so there's Brandon Smith on a jet sweep on the perimeter you'll see Brandon Boykin number two later in this football game but they inject speed into their offense they don't care where they got to go to find it goes through their starting corners if they have to then malsum with that so they're demon okay he's back in as Murray looks over for the direction on second and one in the backfield by Goulston William the tackle a loss of three gulstan we just talked about his genes here's a guy that was a high school linebacker he's unblocked there's a mistake clearly in the Georgia football play right there at tight in no one touches bolston he makes a big tackle for offset no pickford down there time and Orson Charles on the to the left high school teammate of Murray and that first time he was born not picture oh were these shovel pass they're selling a sprint out pass to the right and you're gonna see Charles number seven on a little shovel pass off that right side it looks like it's gonna be a little short fine play by the first team allamerican were these Georgia coming out for a field goal attempt but Mark Richt is taking a timeout here the fourth that once the dogs for five see if they reconsider go for the field goal after the timeout ESPN's presentation of the Outback Bowl on ABC brought you by Outback Steakhouse it's always fresh in the Outback Jen were take a step every day to keep your promises Bud Light it's the sure sign of a good time here we go and the Ford f150 available with the efficiency and power of EcoBoost must fit when it comes to the Tampa area Busch Gardens both teams did events of the Outback Bowl out of the fans as well wells forth in the yard and John on second consideration George is going to go through go for it find out about your freshman tailback send a message your offensive line then Malcolm in the Richard Preston back he's got it by the Spartans Michigan State with a hold and they'll take over it's the kind of way you need to make if you're a Michigan State Spartan what ball player in a bowl game they run right into the strength of this Michigan State defense good penetration by the defensive line nowhere for Malcolm to go good second effort defense that's a huge impact play by jorel worthy in this Spartan defense big one to stop the momentum of the Bulldogs so the safety scored for the gorge defense an opportunity for the dogs to add on to make it a nine nothing game they stopped to the touchdown don't get the field goal and Michigan State with drat ran a play from the two and had a safety that runs its second play from its own six because the lady on down about four for the sophomore from Reynoldsburg Ohio nine hundred yards this year hundred to six in the championship game against Wisconsin EMP tape cutting ham the alltime leading receiver Michigan State history the key impact eyes on office well George has got a great pass rusher number twentynine Jarvis Jones led the SEC in but Bari Rambo a Paul Hawkins for an interception machine at the safety position has seven this year well first career goes to Jones and Rambo first teammate he allamericans his heels after the game of chords back to town biotic Ogletree John's a guy you like number nine for Georgia this allegorical tree hurt early in his season against Boise State missed several games a former safety this guy will smash it watch number nine ol goal tree fall right into this tackle against the big bag Todd Grantham the defensive coordinator said he has star power this guy right here number nine a lovely mobile tree great future ahead of himself at Georgia as a fraternal twin Alexander is the lead flow back on that stop fourth down a moment ago they're three to the senior cousin and he's a former quarterback first down for Michigan State that's a great throw Georgia blitzes they don't get much of a reroute on the outside and dozen throws the ball perfectly between the corner and the safety to the light side of the field that's a big play when you get backed up but there's no reroute whatsoever by Cummings number 19 as Shawne Williams has no chance to get there nice play by Keith nickel who's a great story in his own right game 25 for nickel a Spartan war forever he's the one who caught the Hail Mary complete from Le'Veon Bell right across midfield stripe right at the midfield stripe again a 13 well you learn a lot about Kirk Cousins right here he's under pressure we talked about Jarvis Jones coming off the left side Cousins gets hit right as he throws his power that's an NFL throw by cousins but look at Jarvis Jones just get after left tackle France from Michigan State Jones is a he's the big time pastor goes down the back up back any wooden stake go to the right maybe three yards hit on the sideline by Pocari Rambo just before he hit the white paint the Michigan State with a couple of good bags we mentioned Bell led the team with 900 yards this year last year the top back was this junior from Highland Park Michigan Edwin Baker at 1200 yards both packs have a little completeness tree they can catch the ball as well in the passages I think that's what really separates these two Spartan bags Marc Dantonio told us as though number 24 could play tight end if they asked them to he's a natural pass receiver promising young talents thank you nice wings Keshawn Martin look at the space there's nowhere to go Shawn Williams with an eraser of a play a loss of nine tackled by the junior from Damascus Georgia Michigan State might lead the nation in gadget blaze but you're going to see Shawn Williams number 36 recognize this double reverse they're going to posit the belt clip it back to 82 Martin and Shawn Williams read his tip sheet this week there's a starstudded cast of underclassmen here Mike for this Georgia football team Williams is another way 13:50 lieutenant Olympism stays at the block Jabba's chance got in around the ends and ends up pushing the sack by over tree hold the trees getting printed in the statute Joe into the coaches film room well Jones is given Michigan State fits and he's off to the races here he's gonna beat France again and the two linebackers for Georgia I call him green dog Blitzers their study in the two backs and if the back stay in and block they're gonna go rush the quarterback and Ogletree makes his second big play of this Drive Georgie's got a lot of speed Mike Sadler lefty punter the Spartans kicks it away putting on the other ser cut by Boyken dogs will take over at the 11:30 left to the opening for dogs by a deuce it's a nice area you live in this Tampa area I like it my fans families teams enjoyed some beach activities it was in the 70s good part of this week cool

every game with George in the last two their procedure penalty on the dogs on the number 79 the five yard penalty it'll remain first out Justin Anderson the seniors switched back from defense this year and he's one of the tackles along with 40 Glenn this offensive line has really made great progress remember they gave up six sacks in the opener against Boise State everybody had talked to around here credits their Center Ben Jones as being the glue of this offensive line he's done a great job year in and year out for this program 40:19 final game for the senior from Centerville Alabama is farewell with his second rush not going anywhere the Spartans wait for them on defense I know some of you watch that baylor washington game up and down with talk about Case Keenum and the offense

Larry Houston rush steps up takes off what's the football picked up by bandits Spartans ball on the turnover Chrissy in to top defenses in the country Mike just as advertised that time it looked like Murray had a lot of room to run through and this hole closed quickly you see Chris Norman number 10 put his hat right on the football that's what this Michigan State Spartan defense is known for what Patton our doozy walk in and say effort he's fun to watch and it made tremendous strides defensively under Mark Dantonio another Nick Saban kronas J that's a great play by this part in defense first turning the Spartans tick over at the 41 which pass away beyond and we gained a couple yards Alec over three over there speed of George is going to make some of that wide stuff the Spartans run hard to get into today they they go to an unbalanced line they're gonna motion across a formation and you want to see a fast middle linebacker watch Alek Ogletree show up from no place sorry we didn't have time michigan Stinky's dumped the ball in oil Georgie likes to do but he got a little three live another tackle it's tough picking of three I think I'm gonna be coming agent I'm gonna knock on his door first that's about his pork tackle in the first 12 snaps today he's comfortable in any situation who can play in space he can play in the box getting better every week while some flags in the Sun false start offense number 59 it's a fiveyard penalty it'll remain there down let's stand France John's we were talking between quarters the offensive coordinator damn Rocha it's a problem there happened here the left tackle well there's no question and when you line up as a left tackle against the prized pass rusher like Jarvis Jones you have a tendency get a little excited you have a tendency to jump offsides and France needs to settle down because we're going to continue to bring pressure twice in the last year okay I was 15 senior tight end Brian Linthicum and it'll be three and out after turnover for Michigan State's office we talk about statistics how both of these defense are in the top five a lot of it has to do with their third down defenses both of these teams Georgia and Michigan State get off the field on third down another great job by the defense with a Georgia boy Brandon Boykin back from the mics at the pump line drive that's tough to catch I'm going to bounce it is 47 yards and Georgia and Erin Murray off the turnover takes over 212 wish you were here stinky feet and all the great scenery here on the west burger it's good to be back but this guy hello Aflac trivia question for you here now Michigan State in Georgia both have a couple of former players who are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame think about give me answered a little bit have you peeked do you know the answer I got a pretty good idea on this pot that you work at it at home gumpa program has been playing football over a century some great players from championship teams over

beating Penn State in what was the final game for Urban Meyer next coats Ohio State complete the michael bennet good open feel play by dark as Dennard needs to gain for michigan state likes the blitz and when they blitz they play a zone blitz coverage on the back end deep shells in both corners have to be able to tackle nice job that time by number 31 dark as Denard sets up another feed third down Janardan operative Tabares he was sloppy at the bar at the bottom of the screen we should say or as it always passes against the pressure another completion listen first down Malcolm Mitchell brings it in after a gain of 11 this Malcolm Mitchell he's the best receiver Georgia has against breast coverage this time he beats Johnny Adams how about those hands Mike excellent job by the true freshman out of Valdosta Georgia snatching a football away from his body look for more of Malcolm as this game unfolds the best guy against press coverage 6 1 185 Southeastern high school the sophomore from Detroit with a little bit of food on that one seeing way too many tackles for loss from two good offensive experienced teams gulstan second penetration tackle for loss already this state already six tackles for loss three bicoastal Flitz Guttman wilson full of checks out of the Blitzer if he brings it pressure on testing there we go she's pushed into pieces out of the tackle box with no grounding no no receiver over there well max bolo the middle linebacker checks out of the Blitz watch Goulston he's unblocked again and William Goulston is going to be the player of the game if he's up blind he's got tremendous size and he's been very productive this season for this Spartan defensive game and he's been unblocked octuplets ah he's taking advantage over Greg Goodell of them every play 15 and read Marlon no grounding turbine 12 the eCos Allen secondteam allbig ten and what about the defenses in this Outback Bowl this D'Amico's al and he leads the Spartans with ten sacks that's his 11 coming in here the ex safety watch him come off this edge and beat Justin Anderson easily with speed the linebacking core was supposed to be the weakness of the Spartan defense and has quickly become the strength because the guys like to heat those out one on the kick fair caught 36 yard line so this you can stake it a little bit better field position Georgia especially on third down ESPN's

the gain of one and we asked a moment ago time that we get an answer here question answer Pro Football Hall of Fame Spartans Bulldogs to a piece who are they her bat early Joe de la loire terrific offensive lineman Fran Tarkenton and Charlie trippy with his final Georgia game of Oregon played all 60 minutes and the alltime leading receiver in Spartan history with a game of five to the 43 yard line and they move him around in this offense and it's important they get him into this football game quickly he can line up on the outside that time he plays in the slot sets up a third medium so then she pitches on the year that the first of the day Brandon Smith to flex it Michigan State sideline wanted a penalty there's those involved its fourth day well that's what NFL scouts want to see they want to see cunning and oneonone with a guy like Brandon Smith here he is trying to cross face I think Smith times it perfectly once again great third down defense by this Georgia Bulldog football team it's been a game of field position important at Michigan State fins Georgia back again backtoback greenhouse Brendan Boykin hopes to get a return in here great kickoff return goes all the way home so touchback 37 yards of net Erin Murray from campus plant high school the point to the tired games worth of stats in the first half for kena season they cannot end soon enough against a

but Erin Murray's been up to so far here in this game oh he's throwing the ball well he made a couple nice throws on third down here's one to Malcolm Mitchell the bomb on third long backed up the cabarrus King a thing of beauty just haven't been able to sustain any offense too many negative plays on early downs to get these folks pulled down by Christa Norman at a renaissance high school of Detroit gain of four states right area fans know Matthew Stafford the former Bulldog Murray asked Matthew this year in touchdowns now tarik sire David Greene on the alltime list ahead then when you throw 57 touchdowns in the first two years in the SEC that's saying something he's committed to finishing his career at Georgia being a fouryear player I like that you got a dig down deep behind away Isaiah Crowell just went off what else is new Georgia fans have heard that a lot Justin Anderson flag for the second time John's been a injury filled season sprained ankles and missed the Kentucky

Yetta Herschel Walker that's a lot of fresh 37 pin Malcolm's the back he picks up the pressure though his Brewers incomplete as Malcolm Mitchell kept running it's backtoback 3 announced for the Spartan defense a Michigan State has Georgia clearly confused wide receivers busting patterns quarterback not quite sure what was going on there and another brand out through pumps gonna kick it a key shot Martin the man Jim Martin has a touchdown each of the last two seasons like sailors second good special teams play on a punt coverage in his 1st 2011 scrapbook for the Spartans beat Michigan four consecutive years when a halfcentury said the Spartan Bunch can say that the moment of the college football season for many the Hail Mary overtime victory over Wisconsin in East Lansing in primetime then the loss to the brass get gauntlet of a schedule they couldn't handle the last one in Lincoln only conference loss in the season they represented the new legends division and laws to the chance of the lead Wisconsin everyone beaker can't go anywhere Christian Robinson with the tech you know you run a 34 defense you gotta have a nose tackle and Georgia found one junior college player John Jenkins he's hard to single block and you spend so much time blocking Jenkins you can't handle these run through linebackers and Kristen Robinson capitalizes Georgia's massive up front to monster nose tackles led by John Jenkins number six forty eight plays 12 tackles for loss the wrong way they carry by Edwin Baker with allocable tree and Christian Robinson with the tackle now John we talked about this Michigan State season in term I live in Michigan hear it all the time it was SOS same old Spartans Michigan state would have prosperity then they losing game they should win it was an unstable program guys in trouble Marc Dantonio came in after his three years at Cincinnati and really clean up the shop as this the only thing missing from this fiveyear run because he's a true freshman when it started with the first down right two yards shorter they're not going to get it as Brandon Smith tackles the g20 Venice for consecutive three announce for Georgia we said it earlier Georgia as good at tackling defenses we've seen in college football and keep an eye on these Spartans Mike they use a lot of trickery in the kicking game Mark Dantonio known for that as the head coach at Michigan State here on fourth and little more than to keep an eye on all the way through a touchback in Georgia was started a fifth drive in a row inside their own 20 2011 season in Athens the loss at the Georgia Dome the Boise State into South Carolina oh and to mark bricks on the hot seat he's not going to survive they reel off 10 wins in a row winning him by 21 points including Rick's 100th career victory meet the volunteers that beat the mighty Gators for the first time in four years represented the SEC East in the title game and Georgia fans are used to see in a game like this remember it was a dominant first half performance by their defense LSU had no first downs and only 12 yards in the SEC title game then the honey badger took over Tyrann Mathieu had a punt return for touchdown another big punt return LSU's offense kicked in and the Tigers remained undefeated and won the SEC title Richard sandals now the back Marie's protected as a chef inside the 20 tremendous execution by Georgia and a brilliant throw by Aaron Murray it's a gap protection maximum protection they sprint Murray out to his right naked King oneonone with a safety and a balls thrown perfectly 80 yards 40 bars King on the paths of Murray touchdown 34 on the season the point giorgia scores first touchdown of the game to take a dime dumping weed well it's going to be a sprint protection you're gonna see protection on both sides of the formation it allows Murray to move to his right and right there in the slot you're gonna see Tavares King on a double move and that ball is thrown perfectly watch King push up the field nod to the outside and then win to the post and he beat a good safety and Trenton Robinson second big play for Tavares King number 12 he were there being a safety a guy like that King and cumference well they have the right protection Mike they keep Charles in on the backside they moved the pocket to get away from worthy and they give Aaron Murray a chance to set his feet and launch one and George has got a ghast a great young receiving prospects they had a guy here last year is a good receiver Mike AJ Green Cincinnati Bengals one of the playoffs Andy Dalton the quarterback John's brother Jamie offensive coordinator that's the longest play in the 26year history of this ballgame the quarterback Marie big hill around Chelsea Michigan speech Aaron Murray on that touchdown now part of setting a Georgia mindset with this game for next year I think our guys are hungry you know I said we were we got anywhere from 15 and 17 guys coming back next year we're a young team and we feel like we could take it all next year I think this would be a great way to finish this season and I think there's only been I want to say seven eight teams in Georgia history to have won 11 games and we would love to be one of those teams to win 11 games to send our seniors off the right way 17 the last one to do it cousins pass complete to Cunningham 1st down 43 yard line your office the end of CA office where we see the quarterbacks come before the draft you got a chance to have both quarterbacks over there I sure did I couldn't get ready either one of these guys cousins and Murray loved football but this Erin Murray special and I'm biased because he's drunk Tampa been well trained by Robert Weiner at plan high school enjoy being with Erin Murray I think he's got a promising future cousins almost there pick six go on the up and I only have it on his hands he couldn't convert both quarterbacks John when you visited with them with a good football acumen and understanding of the game and put those necessary quarterback hours in giving the defense's they see I think that's a credit to both well coach this starts at the top with Dantonio huge third down Michigan State gotta find a way to get a first down and get some rhythm on offense Georgia takes a timeout baby 12 on the field as we at the time outlet sent it out the field of the Rose Bowl and check in with our colleague Chris Fowler see what he has for us now Fujin go just ahead on the H&amp;R Block halftime report highlights to the other two SCC versus Big Ten bowl games plus how Case Keenum sliding at the Nittany Lions and how they heat here in Pasadena combined with talent and tempo make it tough of the defenses they Kirk and David Pollock which would be alright Chris thank you College GameDay as jeez we used on Jan 1 with Jan 2 this year out of the Rose Bowl and you'll see that game over on ESPN coming up at 4:30 Eastern Time followed by the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl tonight Andrew Luck's last collegiate game against Oklahoma State and Brandon Weaver's seven possessions Michigan State against Mark Richt and the Georgia defense two first downs and only 60 yards so far it has been a struggle and for Michigan State to get that elusive bowl victory they're gonna have to earn it today sustained some offense Le'Veon Bell next two cousins stirred a couple in the time and held on to by Sanders stay left momentarily took the second shot as the ball went out of bounds shy of the first down I do believe check out the player first he took a second shot lost the ball he's shaken up these are the kind of plays that work all season you get them ready for these types of situations and once again Georgia is not fooled by anything Michigan State has gone Adam today Bryan with the CIM the fiftieth senior start his career at Clemson took that hit right there and his legs got twisted and said hey hey watch me one more time I'm hella cold the true number nine has been all over this Georgia defense hustling standing next answered Maxwell the backup quarterback Linthicum helped over to the Spartans training tape start his career at Clemson three touchdowns there is freshman here the transfer to Michigan State along with helped Garrett sell it to brother Brent Celek of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles and beyond sim for three tight ends Michigan State he's shy of the first down so that's another three now boy can get mash boy he beats this dress status just changed Mike he hit that like a rocket reverses his field finds the lane and he is gone Brandon Boykin not many players in Sec history have returned the football better and a lot of it he does on his own but what tremendous vision open field elusiveness and flatout finishing speed Michigan stays got to be careful Mike they could get blown out of here 92 yards that is the longest play in Outback Bowl history it erases the record that stood for all of a minute and a half on the clock when Aaron Murray its of ours pink 480 yards a moment ago Boykin who has four career kickoff return for touchdown one of three men in the SE C's history to do that that time brings a punt back 92 sometimes when you're a coach I used to say pitcher he was at the 10 and do not inside the tent I never coach Brandon Boykin though he obviously has the green light to pick it and get with it that's a great return by Brandon Boykin he has because opponents have been kicking the ball away from him because of his tremendous resume but remember Boykin causes the safety early in this game and he just returns up all 92 yards for a touchdown mark brick proud of his senior Brandon Boykin he's making a play for the MVP of this Outback Bowl two touchdowns in 87 seconds Michigan State into a spas who's wearing paper where's it from Cory camera these two teams have played before in bowl games eating I was the Gator Bowl Rodney Hampton that name three tough said those big game in Georgia history the farewell from Vince Dooley in Georgia V Michigan State by seven and the Capital One Bowl in Orlando few years ago Matthew Stafford Knowshon Moreno on their way to the NFL Georgia beat Michigan State 24 to 12 Stafford's three touchdowns coming on the final 18 minutes of the game and he won the MVP Georgia player injured on kick coverage Connor Dorman strong safety down looking at his right leg right now Michigan State obviously enters the twominute drill they have to find a way to get something before intermission I think they also have to be very careful with this bulldog pass rush they've got to get some help so there are two tackles who have both struggled in fast protection so far today we could helped off by the training staff seems outstanding Walcott for defense the end the spring ball this past year at a Peachtree Ridge High School in Duluth state takes over the 27 with very little offense so far remember it's a Michigan State team that was blown out last year in the capital on Bowl xlix to seven by Alabama five straight three notes could they get a first down intercepted by Sanders covens Curtin Cousins has no rhythm whatsoever there the he threw that awkwardly off his back foot wasn't sure if he I'm fooled by coverage but that ball should be intercepted don't ever want to see a ball thrown into that many red shirts if you're wearing white the johnstons Michigan State offense is that power play they run with one bag and some of the bubble screens these school is on this week and we have not seen what to that check down down Le'Veon Bell this is patented spin move and a hurdle begin within two yards of the first down Shawn Williams went up high and he came down hard Bell's a 240 pound back that has really come on here at Michigan State has a runner and a receiver watch him catch this little check down screen and go up impressive for a big man chuckles start here shortly they stopped it for Williams who was dazed on that play he's walking slowly over to the toward the sideline try and tell everybody was okay but the officials did a good job of stopping the plane get him checked out properly good job by this conference USA food Spartans definitely need a first down and we got a flag or movement line judge throws it I only wasted 16 seconds with the audible give the option here on this penalty motion procedure penalty last minute with the tensecond runoff that added this year on the offense number three it's a fiveyard penalty the remaining third down by rule will write off ten seconds on the clock those are the worst kind of penalties they're twominute drill at Michigan State try to take the time out here and alleviate that back end of the penalty we have a timeout Michigan State the timeout Queens up the tensecond runoff so the mob stays at 47 seconds Georgia leading 16 to nothing the second celebrating its 60year sponsoring the good hands field goal that's all state thanks contributions to participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kick today at allstate has contributed more than 2.6 million dollars in scholarship funds uation to that great program here this year Bojan we talked about all three phases of the game offense defense and special teams they've all put points on the board for Georgia a safety touchdown on the 80 yard pass by Murray and then the Boykin 92 yard punt return for substant and keep an eye on this Georgia defense I really think this is when they're the most exciting to watch is these third down obvious passing situations we've talked about Jarvis Jones the pass rusher you've seen plenty of Brandon Boykin their outstanding corner puts their system of Defense under Todd Grantham it's an NFL system he's had plenty of NFL background in his career and Todd Grantham he can attack you a lot of different ways man blitz his own blitzes threeman rushes you name it he's got it and his Georgia Bulldog has got defense has gotten better and better under his tutelage the last two seasons we saw that the SEC championship game and throughout the conference season I like what Mark Richt just wants a replay to doublecheck that the clock was accurate after that injury that happened and the clock restarting properly done so we're back at 47 seconds and 37 I like what Mark Richt said though Mike he wasn't looking for a 34 defensive guy he was looking for the right guy and Todd Grantham was that coach he was looking for he's really done a great job watch his Bulldogs move around on defense towards the bus to the right that procedure penalty made a 137 and Washington was whistled down as Santa's coming stops it short of the first down Georgians got one timeout left there you can see you on the turnin clock almost look like a site adjustment but when this ball is caught this count the number of Georgia Bulldogs there's one coming there's Washington at Stu Robinson I see Georgia Bulldogs doesn't happen overnight by the bull committee Outback Bowl 2012 here in 1016 nothing Georgia's reset to start the second half Mike Tirico Jon Gruden with you here in Tampa it is Michigan State offense that the speed is Kirk Herbstreit mentioned at halftime the SEC speed of the defense of Georgia they can't get anything going and they better find something quick and they've tried everything they've tried double reverses throwback screens they've used the no huddle nothing's worked and a lot of that has to do with this Bulldog defense they are good and a terrific player as well and Brandon Boykin who's change the game with a safety of the punt return now we take a look at his in our expert breakdown brought to you by farmers in sure well three big plays in the first half in Boykins made to of areas at left corner he sees Keshawn Martin coming across in motion Cunningham blocks one bulldog and Boykin says I'll take two points then he returns a pun inside his own 5yard line he goes to his left back to his right he seen Lane and he turns on that speed and it's a huge impact play and specialties watches Cam Newton Stretch Armstrong celebration he does George's got some firepower I think Mark Richt wants to prove to everybody that they have a top5 football team coming back in Athens next year they need to stay on the gas pedal and Erin Murray he's made a couple great throws in the first half as well Mike that 80 yard touchdown Tavares King comes to mind right away very few incompletions as well for the sophomore Murray I'm glad you mentioned that John that top 5 for next year or top 10 wherever they end up some polls the early polls have them in that 5 or 6 range it's what Jim Brown asked and what Mark Richt said before the game that it's an important stepping stone for 2012 you always want to said your senior class out with a whimper that a thousand times a million coaches but that next year this BCS system having a good place to start from means a lot Georgia knows that few years ago there won the Sugar Bowl blowout Hawaii started the season as number one with Matthew Stafford injuries around him and the rest of the dogs didn't lead to a good season boy can play in his final half in the red and black of Georgia defense will be on the field first against Michigan State 16 to nothing Johnna thinking about Mark Dantonio the coach of the sparked tube shared with us how his team this year has had those flurries at the end of a half a defensive play a defensive score special teams they were on the receiving end of the flurry at the end of that first half yes they were there's been no flurry so far from Michigan State but Blair Walsh kickin it big Keshawn Martin from two yards deep taking it out shy of the twentythird special teams play for Blake sellers here today here's Jim Brown thanks Mike well a little update for this Georgia offense their running back Isaiah well will not be playing the rest of this game he went out in that second quarter with that left ankle injury is a re injury but something he had done earlier this season I talked to Mark Richt about it he said Jen don't worry we've got plenty of axe it's not gonna affect us we're we're ready to go obviously we're ahead so or not that's one thing they are not deficient in number of running backs Jen with four different ones who started the last five games Spartan offense nothing happened in the first half starts the same way in the second half and guess who Brandon Boykin it's Le'Veon Bell for a loss of three oh he's a primary support player they're playing to deep zone and watch him just come off your right side and he's unblocked what can my tea the MVP of this game Mike a terrible way to start the second half Michigan State has had way too many plays gopher negative yardage and most of them on early downs there'll be a good interview says he wants to be a sportscaster it's all said and done various treatment off the edge now back in coverage his cousins find some open space takes off their pleasures gets down by the 22 yard line show you some numbers here from the first 30 minutes early Outback Bowl only four rushing yards 72 the total yards for the Spartans as Georgia had 80 of those hundred eightyfive cast yards on that one big play 82 Tavares case and this was two down and they weren't all third and long zip Michigan State struggled with a lot of them in the third and three to third and eighth grades the older tree at the bottom of the screen here comes Georgia who's not he's coming plus it's got ready to quit but wrapping up his Shawn Williams to keep inside of the first down depending on where the forward progress is marked these are literally sure yep an excellent drive and grow down back there by the young safety twice that Shawn Williams had grabbed up and kept the smarts the first down so do have same story threeandout michigan state we spent a lot of time with NFL teams this year Mike and walking around as Georgia hotel you just felt like you were found in NFL seen these guys putting them work playing great was brought back by Boyken for a touchdown it's one away from Boykin with a friendly bounce for the Spartans 30 54 yards in Georgia balls at 21 yard line when we come hey fanciest pants new football game you are the most explosive player on the field Jerome Simpson their return man hit the gap break tackles take into the house free and ESPN return man calm like to rebook John Burton jitan Brown with you 2012 Outback Bowl here in Tampa Jim mcvade president CEO does an outstanding job with this ball both teams talked about how this is right up there with the best Bowl experiences and weeks that they've had it teams so strangers to bowl games George's 4750 pin a row then I'm harm's way in a gain of a halfdozen Michigan State comes out firing with blitzes they need to make a play on defense clearly their offense has struggled look for Patton our doozy the defensive coordinator of the Spartans to blitz Aaron Murray and try to make something happen they need eternal to death turnover desperate all the arts on two big plays other than magic done okay one of them took me to the house though Ken Malcolm a yard shy by the happy hour travelers down here the place made by Tavares King jr. from Mount Airy Georgia 3015 backedup changed field position then a double move watch him turn to the outside break back to the post ball zone perfect please Tavares to finish two big plays SEC Championship game then we've got a 40 no glyph changed the tenor that first half and the Georgia Dome whereas gonna throw through were these birth through forced it out quick but it's complete first down 35 yard lines Malcolm Mitchell with the gain of five in front of Johnny Adams instant pressure at that time on Erin Murray he eludes it slides to his left makes a big third now conversion once again Malcolm Mitchell shows his ability to reach out to snatch the football Georgia has a lot of respect for Michigan State's run defense Mike look for them to continue to throw the ball quickly in these one back sets jorts into 17 runs 24 yards here today Marie playaction once we got picked up intersection there's the turnover they needed dark pres dinar gets his second on the season both amorous gang started the block II thought Murray was going to put it down and run Murray changes his mind Layton fools Tavares keg watch King turn and look for the pit ball he sees Murray scramble he gets the block balls intercepted that's the quarterback and receiver not on the same page that's why they have all those scramble drills weekend week out big turnover by the Georgia office sets up Michigan State with great field position not only is it the best starting position it's three yards away from their deepest penetration in the game because it's down the middle passed nearly intercepted limpa from the tight end at a tough time getting out of his break he's being jostled well Christian Robinson carries Linthicum right down the middle that's what an inside linebacker asked to do in these two deep zone defenses Michigan State they need one of those flurries we're talking about they have up in East Lansing this time of year now seven straight 3 that's 9 possessions 8 of them is not game to first down only the fourth snapping Georgia territory screen is covered Frances still given to Keshawn Martin it was incomplete you see the speed of Georgia and that blue fried one he showed bubble screens today I love it you know you take away a big part of Michigan State's bass defense I think Boykins the nickel Gummer guy in the slot right here he presses he gets off a block they're just ready for the quick bubble screens that Michigan State utilizes nothing has come easy at all for this part in offense today we always talk about the D beef the Cornelius Washington to the throwing wave there for his cousins to come down and eat it say sorry not for the first down DJ Cunningham so there's the first words down a long time in front of Sanders coming up led Cunningham's name came up timing pattern to the outside outside foot is back he'll count seven steps and roll it to the outside balls roll perfectly you just need one foot in college football huge first now for Michigan State he's his penetration of the afternoon the spark according to pull for but again the speed and again Boykin gated just 1/8 to get too excited about this guy that falls bouncing all the way out to the perimeter you got it get off a block get off a block and then go make attack a look at this formation showing some wrinkles saw them practice this a clothespin ot the tackle coming out to the left pass over the middle caught by hip to toe hurt in the first half back here to the 18 first down gain of 17 that's a good call head bubble screens not working fake the bubble screen fake the bubble screen up here and throw the ball down the seam here tight in that's an excellent job by Dan rauscher the offensive coordinator seeing what Georgia was doing to take away these quick bubble screens take advantage turns your fans down this end welcome to Spartans to the red zone for the first time in 2012 bouncing outside stiffarming Boykin and out of bounds of the 14 gain of four lot of work to get four as well Dan rauscher is seventh year coaching with Mark Dantonio all five in Michigan stayed two before that Cincinnati was a quarterback

Spartans keep the shy of the 20 nice job by the officials to keep everybody from Pacific Life game summary here in Tampa what's switched a moment ago was the first down bow confusion Hebrew thought Aaron worry who's going to start running Tavares kick started blocking Murray threw the interception couple of first downs picked up Le'Veon Bell the touchdown for the Spartans and then the twopoint conversion to the 50years seat your tight end Olimpica again this part of the story of this Michigan State team those of you don't follow a big tent it's a senior class that helped change the culture and turn this program around for the one thing they don't have and the other guys who are not seniors want to send this group out with is of all victims they're decades since they beat Fresno State doesn't exist anymore in search engines the batch with the ankle injury Robinson some play an update now with that Denver alright Mike it is the Gator Bowl on espn2 early in the third quarter Ben Buchanan's punt is blocked by Chris Rainey Rams Stewart will take it to the house Braxton Miller and job Brantley both have touchdowns a piece of 21 10 to floor early in the third and Case Keenum putting on his show over 500 yards passing against Penn State's number 5 pass defense and this Michigan State took to run on defense being heard from there comes the flurry led by Darrell worthy number 99 watch it get off the block by Samuel great play jerel worthy third down and 11 Michigan State using the three down three linebacker nickel package that has given Georgia problem it is incomplete bounced before King to get it free now Georgia here comes the Spartans they come out in this second half in a blitz that time number five Johnny Adams fires off the weak side and you're going to see Erin Murray feel the need to get rid of this ball quickly good drive by number 31 to fill corner dark is there's a nard and Michigan State's going to get position the ball made this walk before love Michael James the Oregon Ducks walk it into the Rose Bowl for the granddaddy of all CREP Musburger Kirk Herbstreit at the Rose Bowl game presented by Vizio Oregon Wisconsin coming up 4:30 Eastern Time but an hour tempted to now over on ESPN's will all roads lead you to the Rose Bowl game as the Bowl Championship Series begins on ESPN first nine drives by Michigan State generated to Georgia points on the safety last drive they got eight and are within eight wanna catch with the come again the tight end 23 on the game what a great catch by a big tight in live to come down this scene nods to the outside back to the post lays out and picks up a huge first down for Michigan State Jarvis Jones earlier on a touchdown run by Lamia Bell as they cut him he was shaken up and Jones not as effective pass rushing gave a hair more time to cousins called start on Joel form to the left guard and Jim Brown you can add on Jarvis Joe well yeah he came off the stile and he actually fell to the ground I talked to the athletic trainers they said he'd sprained his left MCL it's actually reactivation of an injury he had earlier in the season they put a brace on it he took some cuts on the sideline and as you'll see he's in the game right now Jen he told us redshirt sophomore he is staying in school went to USC missed our spirit Southern California victory ended up not being medically cleared back to Georgia star year 13 half cents second single season David Pollock he's back on the field is in with Baker carries for a couple of yards to the 45 yard line already more Spartan offense in this third quarter than they had with an entire first half and you just get the feeling it's gonna fall on veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins shoulders there you just saw their one back power play they're known for Georgia stuffed it they're gonna make Kirk Cousins beat him with the passing game second in 13 cousins hit as he throws a pageant complete with the flat Cornelius Washington was bringing the pressure for Georgia cousins from that pass a moment ago to lifteth on the tight end as Jeff smoker alltime passing yardage leader Michigan State history 89 54 Stamkos check on their this smoker went by him with his fouryear career and now Kirk Cousins who has most of the other alltime passing records at Michigan State adds the yardage mark as well to get to the 32 to keep the drive alive for manuals incomplete hey Shawn Williams is back there and he got him to see through well it's good pass rush but once again the penalty on an early down the false start and Michigan State's inability to run the ball of any kind of consistency put him way behind it and down at distance and very important at Michigan State pins Georgia back inside their 15 right here and they have the punter to do it Sadler's a good night ten times inside the 20yard line this year for the freshman Rapids got the bounce he's got one would see state did I mean 99 yards for Georgia there's Curtis Drummond got down there about the lefty punter get in Georgia headsup football right there ball doesn't break the plane where the ball is not the man and college football it stopped the one that's a long field good job by Sadler and right here is where jerel worthy Mike gets off the ball hood he'll even risk it a little bit of fiveyard penalty he got off against Wisconsin earlier this season in a backedup situation he'll do everything he can to penetrate and cause tackle for loss right here and turn this game around Georgia got to be real careful careful he'll replace selection and Malcolm the freshman back in there rich if it's a space max Bullough meter no game that bolon name has been around Michigan State football was so long Hank Boas brother the most familiar to many fans because of his time further in football that's his grandfather Shane his dad played linebacker uncle's doctor Chuck played as well many years many Spartan defenses had a bullet this one's pretty good replaced a good player in Greg Jones yes he will to playoff bound Giants seeking space Robinson plays in a hurry I saw Georgia run this play seven straight times to finish Georgia Tech North Michigan State has had no problem defending this power attack of the Georgia Bulldogs Patton are dizzy and takes a lot of pride and stop the no run and setting up these obvious passing situations so he can use this three down pressure package that has reaped huge dividends for the Michigan State Spartans this season and that freak of nature number two whooping Colston wake left running down against the free the first down so Malcolm runs it and Jonathan's the question you get the threeman front and plate coverage and Georgia does a great job to be a great job you're gonna see a double team on the right side left guard you see gates escorting freshman Ken Malcolm right up the gut gutsy call on 3rd 9 on your own two yard line this Dorman left his doctor to pretend becomes this lecture freshman from Decatur Georgia to the 33c big runs those free the gain of 21 well it's a shotgun run you're gonna see Malcolm start to his left cut back to his right bolston was playing the quarterback there's nobody left 410 Malcolm good cutback run and you can see why the Bulldogs are excited about this freshman Ken Malcolm Burwell gets all the ink but Ken Malcolm is carrying the ball in the Outback Bowl now Brandon Smith defensive back who had a carry in the first half for nine yards at 11 carries during the regular season that's too huge second half interceptions and the knowledge takes is the fashion trips to the field I see Michael Bennett running into the frat I don't know Marie saw the narva the narcos flat he's not backing up he just jumps us ratrock Dixon to the house McMurray Clapton art was going to backpedal at Blake quarters coverage completely fooled by the coverage this veteran Spartan secondary and she can say to listen to the town we're cousins back out there legs maybe on metal to the air several cars Avery Jones big play he makes and stop the shovel pass apart and it's a twopoint game with 147 to go in the third when you look back at the interception is really a three deep so Denard backpedals he's going to backpedal and see Bennet show into the flat he just drives it watch the rotation go to a three deep song Denard this recognize the pattern jumped the flat route touchdown Spartans Michigan State can beat you with their offense their defense or their specialty impressive second half rally art question art is from the state of Georgia Twix County High School dry branch first full season as a starter and Mark Richt has seen what many coaches the big Tennessee gonna Michigan State a good place and all of a sudden bang bang bang big plays turn the game around 16 14 all of a sudden it's a big day it always a big time period for the big ten their team's trailing in all four bowl games right now the closest walk down to torches short pitch their confusion forked Ovaltine the fullback brought it to 28 yard line the Rose ball Monte Paul walked in there last year with Wisconsin this year he comes in with

balls accomplished with significantly in college football still a totally cheap sport here today Whichard Samuel the fourth carries it for a company well it's Michigan State that could get out of its own way in the first half Georgia selfinflicted wounds in the second he had two big turnovers and both really Murray has been fooled once by a receiver on his own team and once by a Spartan defender Denard making a great play for Michigan State but Georgia's got a weather this storm get something done on offense run the ball effectively against Michigan State today everything else today taking runs for a first down it was Boykin in the open air in the Georgia Dome Ants Boise State on the first run of his career took at 80 yards yeah he's not coming out of the game either wakin on an underneath handoff picks up his pulling guard bounces it to the outside gets it first down Boykin already caused the safety return to punt for a touchdown that went that time he just picks up a first down as a running back let's part so you see nothing you too denzel's roamed at a plant city down here in Florida makes the tackle as though it's a storyline when you have big ten teams that work root down in the state of Florida come back for a bowl game today means a lot to Michigan State you don't think they're tired of hearing about all this SCC owns the big tent stuff Michigan State would love to prove that they're a top ten team today with a big win against equality Georgia tired of hearing the facts the SEC has been better on the field with the big ten let's see what happened to this

Cunningham oneonone game on the line and Brandon Smith is up to the challenge great throw by cousins somebody's got to step up and make a play to win this game for Michigan State on offense in Georgia

Georgia defense that's what you said before John it's the pro concepts with these great Georgia athletes and perfect coverage by Williams on the back end a return of 45 and now the dogs to score game and mouth in the back never got a block from his fullback loose Figgins first Norman with another tackle for loss let's see if we can replay this and just listen live for ourselves SEC versus Big Ten in the hall let's get football mother took the snap and tripping me to try and force and encroachment violation and then once Murray got hit it led to the post play pushing each other that's the old fries play yep and you know the official coming in from along the line of scrimmage head linesman had his hand up saying it was a play and no game teachers center to snap the ball if there's a neutral violation by the defense and that's just what Ben Jones did but was it what not youth without even a note the pensive off side its third down take a look at it sees a little bit of movement and he went up and nobody was in the newsroom that's a really good call as most in rose up there then he had all the stuff would happen after the play but initially you're thinking of course he's in the neutral zone he took the snap he wasn't there so I wasted down 30:13 the Senate Ben Jones plan his 49th game snaps it the South dawnmarie brothers tavares ping fell down fourth down well they're

offensive coordinator must have seen something they're trying to get some activity selling these bubble screens the Keshawn Martin and throwing it down the field that Cunningham at the time Georgia says we're not buying it third down and goal from the seven tough spot for Michigan State they're going an empty backfield set touchdown bag twelve this year so much credit I didn't think there was a chance they could come back and get the lead in this football game after that first half of misery but Mark Dantonio Spartans have just taken the lead and echo on a sharp post pattern in the slack gives Michigan State the lead twopoint attempt coming try to make it a threepoint game Keith Nichol who went to Oklahoma the quarterback did not beat out Sam Bradford came here to Michigan State didn't beat out Kirk Cousins turn into a big receiver memory of the great memorable pets of the Hail Mary against Wisconsin other big plays during the year 3rd Spartan attempt 40 then reaching 40 in the regular season remains one good job by Brandon Boykin and Brandon Smith for Georgia's defense well third and goal at the 7 yard line look for number 7 nickel coming on your left side of the screen just a sharp post pattern he goes up and gets it he beats Brandon Smith number 1 mr. wellthrown ball you have a big receiver a physical target in nickel let him go get it and I've seen nickel he's thrown about a hundred passes here at Michigan State himself Mike he's a really interesting prospect at the next level a lot of people think he could be a safety in the NFL but Mark Dantonio probably one of the most unheralded coaches in college football you gotta give the bread jeesus hold the phone on the exit Oh give me a little high five there for this quarterback who's in3 Maxwell his shot as well number ten he's the quarterback who will replace her cousins next year this is gonna start the game Brandon pointed can he make magic happen again his poor kid from the six the dogs who down for the first pot to go Elsworth on the tackle centreline page summary those he watching some of the other games shooting over this tool is competitive but these games weaken to the Rose Bowl on ESP s coming up at the bottom of the hour it was 16 nothing to Georgia Michigan State had to first down to the first half their offense was horrific they turned it around on the third quarter with a couple of stories of turnovers made him cash in and after the dogs extended the leaves at 1914 that Michigan State touchdown drive a moment ago cousins to nickel 22 19 Michigan State and now sophomore Aaron Murray from playing high school in tap a few miles down the road intercepted twice this half takes over I'm now committed on the sidelines Mitchell 36 yard line in a 17 that's not an easy throw I don't know if it's a back shoulder fade or there's a timing depth on this but this ball stone perfectly the Malcolm Mitchell just a freshman Watson surged up the field ball strong perfectly Georgia does a nice job of these fly stop patterns see the half dozen different people in the backfield for Georgia today now Carlton Thomas of junior the most dependent on the bucks khloe's seeks the silvers so far his king who has set the Outback Bowl record for receiving yards closing in on 200 watch this at illegal bars gang what a great throw here's the bars at the top of the screen mr. stutter go on the outside number 39 you see Trent Robinson get beat great job back to the deck by Ken 205 receiving yards Kaneko's Alan with the knockout shots Wow another tackle for loss tanks want to get some Gatorade 205 yards Mike not just a pole record a school record any game in Georgia football history hundred fourteen years most receiving yards in Tavares King the junior out of Mount Airy his biological dad Anthony inside ended Clemson in the late seventies Georgia trying to retake the lead and field away it's ruled nothing right now at sea clear ruin rolled in completely incomplete on the field William ghost in with the contact the Heather hurt William goals Grilli gets off their Blitzen drunk his Allen whip Goulston and once again a breakdown in pass protection if you're gonna blow a protection don't blow it against William full speed he's six six 280 pounds for a called in a very very well officiated game here today Brandon Boykins the bat the star of the game the Georgia other than Oh how do you play touchdown at this level of football granted Boyka he comes right out of the back and you're going to see him disserved right down the middle no one covered it he has scored on a safety as on michigan state's very first play he tackled Keshawn Martin in the endzone then he had an Outback Bowl record 92 yard punt return for touchdown and their catches the touchdown 2nd receiving touchdown of the year the lady wife 5 Georgia will go for 2 and the back Carlton Thomas just came in off the sideline a student Mitchell that way mature so do you put the ball on the left with a righthanded quarterback when you're gone for two and you flood the field with wide receivers at time I think third down big to play conversion when a drive the response by Georgia let's see what Michigan State can do dogs on top again Ron Thomas and argue 63 career touchdown passes quarterback try to add to that number in the Rose Bowl or seen you see those great helmets uniform combos changing uniforms at halftime all part of the flash there's a lot of substance to what arghya does in the football field as well bargain Wisconsin Rose Bowl game presented by Vizio coming up next over on ESPN coverage begins at the bottom of the hour cousins to try to respond to a Brandon Boykin show pop up kick off this time and obliterate his Nico palazzi league fullback lately a Brandon Boykin in case you just joined us early in his game he forces a safety with a great open field tackle how about this get on a punt return inside his own 5yard line he shows you this stuff a 92 yard punt return he's made tackles in the open field against big backs in just town he comes out of the backfield on offense and scores a touchdown to get Georgia the lead out trying to st. Kirk Cousins in the offensive here they Le'Veon Bell the completion out to the 36 yard line we welcome those of you once South Carolina in the victory of the Capital One Bowl over in Orlando South Carolina be Nebraska 3213 today used to beat Penn State 32 1410 trying to find a win in this early window on Jan 2 this year we match up to get some of the best teams in the country he said Martin looking for space to throw because it's Linthicum having a day of his life and his final day in the Spartan green and white tackle by Shawn Williams was down this gives John Martin he's one of the few guys in college football and have scored five different ways he can return punts he can catch touchdown passes he can even come in motion except the handoff and throw the ball to a tight end what a creative play Michigan State pulling out all the stops right now isten 10 Michigan State trying to respond to Georgia for cousins out of the flag here comes fullback Todd Anderson there's his six catches Anderson rumbles to the first down mark over by the 35 yard line a welcome to those of you who watched the Florida Gators beam Ohio State 24 to 17 here in the Outback Bowl Georgia led 16 nothing Michigan State scored all 14 of the third quarter moving back and forth with scores here in the fourth the last one from a local resident Tampa Florida zone Aaron Murray the Georgia quarterback to that guy Brandon Boykin Fayetteville Georgia what a star he's been today maybe on Bell carries to the 33 gain of about three and watching his Georgia defense all season they've looked at number 29 Jarvis Jones as they're closer they've been able to give some leads I saw him against Kentucky against Tennessee they get a lead and then Jarvis Jones rushes the passer and ends your day so far in his second half Michigan State's done an excellent job against number 29 Jarvis Jones of the Georgia Bulldogs lincecum the tight end in motion he's got 110 yards today cousins throwing his way there he is stumbling out of bounds over at the 28 yard line if you get a minute or two or 10 minutes it'll take him get on YouTube and go put in a youtube search for Kirk Cousins speech Kirk Cousins was asked to speak representing all the studentathletes in the big 10 at the big 10 kickoff luncheon in Chicago in August 165 thousand views by added one to it this morning you need to see it for those of you who are against college athletics and say that no it can't be right and done the right way listen to this kids words to go with his great resume on the field unbelievable kid trying to get a first down here on 32 Philip Jenkins comes away with the pig all 351 pounds of Jenkins the beneficiary of the athleticism of Ogletree they're running a white corner rowdy now golden tree it shows his first round talent this balls going to be thrown to the corner route and Ogletree goes up makes a great second effort dip play and that's a nose tackle John Jenkins 357 pounds finishing the play for the Georgia defense and I'd love to see big guys get interceptions I solved this Wilfork get a couple this year like for the Patriots John Jenkins look just as good right there this Ogletree been special today sophomore and a Newman Georgia get outs Ted 356 left full complement of timeouts Michigan State can they get the ball back for a gift of Samuel another tackle for loss Michigan State will stop it again if you were watching some of the other games the Spartan defense top ten in the country in points and yards allowed that's now 16 tackles for loss today how they force 40 sacks this season I'm watch it jerel worthy and I just myth miss Anthony Rashad white making another tackle for loss they've got two outstanding interior defensive tackles and Mark Dantonio told us they need another one so if you're a young prospect out there you're looking for a place to be a beat the big defensive tackle see I get so excited I can't say it you gotta look at in the Michigan State yeah coach D said the Help Wanted sign is up you're a defensive tackle you wanted in East Lansing season Russell Wilson quarterback to Wisconsin they won the inaugural Big Ten championship game so they represent the conference in the Rose Bowl game presented by Vizio 15 minutes away from our coverage beginning on ESPN and working towards kickoff front Musburger curve over there Jenkins qingxue talking with that pick four years now he can't stop them John mentioned the first half huge edition junior college guy at the point of the three for added this year that's well stapling Saheed Murray rolls it and throws it complete it bounces Malcolm Mitchell Michigan State stops it again after the game of four there's 346 and a really big third down our date Tonio putting all his timeouts into this series another great play by Chris Norman outside linebacker it's one thing to be able to play in a base defense it's another thing to be able to play in these open formations Mike and in college football the way the game is being played nowadays you have to have outside linebackers that are big enough to stop the run and athletic enough to play in space and Michigan State has two of those guys Norman's one of them and quarterbacks have had a very good days they've thrown a couple pigs each but their leadership and what they're doing you have to remind yourself again again these are two of the elite defenses in college football Michigan State was 15 yards allowed only the Alabama and LSU defenses that you'll see a week from tonight on ESPN the Allstate pcs national championship game gave up more yards than the Georgia defense third Nate two freshmen receivers at the bottom of the screen Conley and Bennett running back is Samuel worthy came over a little bit early was he induced though there's going to be an offside though first down but it's going to be third much more manageable offside on the deep end number 99 made contact it's a five yard penalty and it'll remain third down second time we've seen this happen Mike you see worthy trying to get a jump and you mentioned earlier in the week he's done that a bunch of this season seen that happen in a lot of key situations Georgia in a nice job with their heart down Jenkins who made the picture take him back to the locker room now they look over to the sideline and adjust the placement there third and three when a big play Maria throw and it's incomplete but a flag down as Johnny Adams was there castling Marlon brown that's gonna give Georgia a first out if it's on this the junior corner atoms cap interference defense number five the ball we placed at the spot of the foul and it'll be a first down tough call against the Spartans with 341 to go gives Georgia the ball Martin they're on yeah he's gonna run a hitch Mike I can see that call kept holding on to his shoulder as he pulled by after the initial contact grounds are not free to get so backtoback penalties for Michigan State that pull of the arm is why the calls made that's a first down with the only one timeout the clock stopped here for a moment at 3:30 which they want to use it to last time out here not sure and our Dido coming over to explain to Mark Dantonio pick come over complain about the call or or what it's not gonna change it Michigan State is challenging whether the ball was it was a catcher an incomplete pass ball is marked 42 ball clearly comes down was an incomplete pass lose the challenge get chance to guess the official come over complain about the timeout but you lose that timeout here I guess that'll stop the clock back at the point that it happened because we're outside of two minutes so a completion there would have been a first down and then the play clock at 40 and it starts the clock by challenging here what you do is you burn that time out and then what happens to the back end at least the clock is stopped at 3:30 where it happened we'll do the only thing I could see him doing here useless and I'm not I'm not criticizing any official I'm turning over a new leaf this year except your ad is ruffling some feathers last week keep doing it keep changing big call in this game though Michigan State with one timeout left because the pass was real complete going to the ruling of incomplete will stop the clock there so Mark Dantonio Mott that challenge there watch the timeout situation will not have enough timeouts to get the ball back just with timeouts and working out healing to play the pass was incomplete therefore they fifty the fall for pass interference the clock should not have started we're going to put 343 on the clock and the clock will start on the snap well explained there by edge so even with the time back on the clock Michigan State's still in a world of hurt they hang on to that one timeout because of the success of the challenge there's still plenty of time to stop Georgia here and get the ball back on their own very important at Michigan State now after this two or threeminute layoff stuffs this early down a run you cannot give up a first down or they're in real trouble Richard Samuel will be in the back here at 3:43 Sam you're looking to cut back and it was closed off by Marcus rush to Richard freshman out of Cincinnati's molar high school you'll see erinmarie use every second that he can he'll snap this ball inside of three seconds georgia leaning on their big backs in these situations Richard Samuel the fourth remember he's the back that closed out the Florida Gators earlier in a season ball security vital and they would love to bang this ball for a first down just joining us Isaiah Crowell the freshman did not start injured his left ankle in the first half second in nine to give his second off the clock hero stranded to the right stout Spartan rush defense with the stop Michigan State's gonna hold that timeout here and this one will take us with a snap at about 210 now is the call of the game if your offensive coordinator Mike Bobo head coach Mark Richt Georgia has had a lot of success thrown the ball to Tavares King the interesting to see if he gives Erin Murray highly touted sophomore quarterback one more look and throwing the football tonight's the game of the first down here it's goodnight up the middle Michigan State will use that final timeout where the plays whistled dead at 206 so it'll be a punk to the Spartans as Danny goes out and max Bullough make the tackle and Michigan State will have a chance without timeouts try to move it down the field Erin Murray two touchdowns two interceptions with his return down the roads where he claims high school ball here in Tampa Florida now her cousins a 50year senior probably for his last drive as a Spartan unless his overtime trying to lead one more Michigan State comeback imagine the quarterbacks would match with the defenses and was billed as such and has delivered here in LEED 2012 Outback forward anything goes in this situation if you're Marc Dantonio we all know he came after Wisconsin's butter and a Big Ten championship do not be surprised if they bring all they have in this situation Isaiah Lewis to the quicker they go after the kicker this time don't get to Cutler that bouncer is tough to bring in for them so we'll be 85 yards you need to drive against the Georgia defense here walk striking right about midnight the long ball off the facemask of BJ Cunningham into the waiting hands of Keith Nichol ruled on the field at in his short in the end zone but then on review the look down the line show that he had the ball he broke the flame bedlam ensued nice Lansing at Michigan State had a dramatic way what can they do here no timeouts 85 yards but 55 to go remember us buzzes shut for the middle there's Nicole is fifteen the first down lock stops to move to change pay protection they sent help to the right Bopha no D got it versus Jarvis Jones and now Jones is gonna come to the top of the screen and work the other side his Cunningham 8 a 7 o'clock spins Benton I have to go this is where you want to see Kirk Cousins watch him run the show he's going to tell everybody where to line up he'll call the play signal it and off he goes second inquiry Cunningham station to the 41 if he got out of that sack Lowe is a footrace blocks tops to move him 111 left in regulation that's three great throws by Kirk Cousins look at him executing at crunch time this is what he loves the most final minute Michigan State trying to time housings ready I'm Bella the backfield gets as much as he can gets out of bounds very wellexecuted moves John if they've gone 47 yards efficiently and effectively no question they've mixed it up with threestep drops fivestep drops he's throwing the ball to four different receivers and right now Georgia needs to find their vaunted pass run been awful quiet number 83 Washington top of the screen gotta find some heat second and seven for the senior cousins steps up in his face takes up he's got a first down point now for blunts cousins inside the 20 pounds inside the 20 cousins trying to lead a gametying drive in his final game in the Spartan Bremen would play mantoman coverage sometimes you don't account for the quarterback everybody scatters planned mantoman coverage underneath and over the top and Kirk Cousins not only scrambles for a first down but he stops the clock they've got plenty of time Michigan State what a drive when they needed it the most Brandon Boykin 2 for Georgia's been the star of this bowl game can he make the play in the red zone the game on the line cousins plays nickel with the catch out of bounds at the 12 is Keith nickel 43 seconds remaining in regulation what's up quick cousins gets rid of this football he catches it in the shotgun throws it off his back foot perfect location and his veteran receiving make Keith nickel stops the clock but this calls out to hurry to throw perfectly this is a tremendous job by Kirk Cousins and his partner teammates nicholae Keshawn Martin go to the top DJ Cunningham bottom of the screen fortythree seconds left Spartans for the time fuzzums for Cunningham that was a great job of the line of scrimmage by Sanders Cummings max in conclusion yes Sanders Gummy's rises to the challenge here Michigan State's alltime leading receiver bump and run coverage they're trying to get the feed at that outside pylon tommy's does a great job finding the football and pinning BJ Cunningham in to the boundary ESCA defense he plays to get four yards in the first down or gets 12 yards and a touchdown Novak set that success throwing the ball to the post the number seven heat Nichol earlier in this center as in spires touchdown Sparky's great consigned by Michigan State this will get looked at I'm sure upstairs to make sure that he's in watch the end of the play me down there shy to go along on that first book that take a longer look at it he does make contact with the ground we softened my first angle even shy of the goal line so I think it's inside the one for 34 seconds left so Dan Blum the replay official buzzes down at our Dino get on the headset to confirm her cousin grabbed that helmet get back to work still hard to go how many plays does Michigan State have watch they got a empty formation they're gonna have four receivers after Martin motions to the field he's gonna start to the flat and then break it back to the inside balls flow perfectly but Michigan State Mike they have all the patterns they have all the formations and you can do this when you have a veteran quarterback like Kirk Cousins and you got to love the way that Martin number 82 Cunningham number three you've seen Linthicum and cousins the way they perform at crunch time in their final game as Michigan State Spartans John here's the definitive look down the line lead down ball right at the warm with 34 seconds left it'll be a first out the clocks would stop to move the chains but then the game clock would start when they're ready to go four plays form a yard out if what we see there is what Dan Blum the replay official upstairs is telling you at our D though he has cousin six is seven on the drive 65 yards a touchdown pass and a 20 yard run to get a first down as well and here's a tardy dose after review the runner's knee was down prior to crossing the goal line the ball will be placed on the oneyard line it will be a first down for Michigan State and the Spartans will have enough time on the clock to run it one time if they want to hand it the lady I'm Fidel their big 240 pound back they can kill it if they don't make it be interesting to see this here we go it starts on the ready to pull Kristen go from the wall to get it comes down whoa what a big penalty this would be with no timeouts 26 seconds left and a flag coming in from the line judge watching the side there the facemask during Iran personal foul face mask and a defense of our 19 after distance to the ball replay first out go to the half yard lon that social goal thought they would see there we go with a quarterback sneak here if the Spartans run it they do have time to kill it if they don't make it timeout taken by Georgia while the foul happened behind the line of scrimmage so Jerry Osmond who is the Comfort us a supervisor of officials and was the referee for two Super Bowls joins us here up in the booth and just on the administration that why he gets keep half the distance to the goal dough hit the runner was tackle behind the line of scrimmage so it's a half the distance from where he was tackle since it's a defensive foul and that moved it back to the oneyard line two Super Bowls see Jones start to do your the referee John was always a great coach to work with on a sideline CJ thank you to have your up here so it's first and goal inside the one for 26 seconds left this is the way Michigan State games have been the last couple years tight and taut against the good teams to the finish can Georgia make a stand from a half yard away get asteroid of Cunningham yes we covered by coming 22 seconds of man second and gold that's great designed by Michigan State they bring Cunningham is short motion and try to change the coroner's coverage mechanics they had mind you over on ESPN coming up pick up about 20 minutes or so away in the Rose Bowl game presented by Vizio Wisconsin and Oregon the pregame coverage underway with Chris Fowler and company game to kick shortly second and goal Spartans another chance movin up front early the quarter distance to the quarter yard love offside defense number 29 was into half the distance to the goal he'll remain second out Jarvis Jones anticipated they look out there in that Georgia lineup number 99 they don't get bigger then Kwame gathers remember John Jenkins was taken off to the locker room after he made the interception earlier in the regular nose guard so gathers is over the center now second and goal spartans way beyond contact they did they went to their bread and butter power play and lady hot Bell says that's why I'm here at Michigan State is a 240 power that give it to me when the game is on the line in inches situation and I'll score right off the right side they use their all big 104 minute left guard is the escort and s good hard running by Le'Veon Bell Dan Conroy's made every extra point this year missed only one in his career to tie the game this hat was no and the kick is good Brad sonntag did a superb job getting the ball down he's a fifth year senior part of that very first recruiting class of Antonio's at a Saginaw Michigan in just his first year as the whole to watch the job he does that is good stuff we are 19 seconds away its impart to the whole by Sonntag from the third overtime and the history of this vulgar I was some driving no time out to 85 yards down the field well that's a drive of the ages Michigan State when they needed the most turn of their threetime captain gutt cousins he finds three different wide receivers and then he uses his tight end has set up a touchdown here at the regulation but cousins did it with his legs as well scrambling for a first down manage the clock perfectly he shot Martin down to one foot fine tail baptizing great football now you've got Brandon Boykin back the star of this bowl game waiting against hands on it one more time and here it is at the five he scored on safety on a reception on a punt return he's brought down here 22 yard line 13 seconds and one timeout for Georgia the long field goal Erin Murray is able to take a shot down the field again in a field goal position the long field goal for Blair Walsh the 56 yarder against Coastal Carolina that would necessitate getting the ball to the 39 yard line so they need 38 yards and 13 seconds with one timeout this is taking me Mike we've had she was over times an Outback Bowl history start the decade on Jan 1 2010 offer northwestern a fabulous game Mike Kafka through its 78 times in that game remember that and then the dogs Perdue when Georgia rally from down 25 nothing against Drew Brees and the Boilermakers refreshing the overtime rules will have the coin toss and the choice most everyone takes defense first the top in the bottom of the inning each team gets a possession no game clock only in the play clock and if we go to a third overtime you have to go for two sheriff s has got all of the controller so this is Murray on the other side to Georgia once a senior once a sophomore very similar and strong leaders you have to really be impressed with the way these two teams played particularly with the long layoff Mike there's always a concern about teams that lose their championship game that go to play in a bowl game that are a little lackluster because of that feeling after a defeat but these two teams they look as excited as I've ever seen that's the team that came back to down 16 and now the Georgia side some of their players are trying to get their guys rallying up to do the same but clearly the momentum on the team that came bad side of the team had came back from down 16 Oh Georgia hanging their heads a little late her cousins an NFL quarterback John I don't think there's any question and I was at that Manning passing camp this summer and he was there with about 30 of the top quarterbacks from around the country he's got as many physical skills as as any of the other guys he really does in our dino our referee right the winners going to have a choice that going on offense defense or choosing an end offense defense or an end okay but Michigan's stay here from here there's visitors there's your head there's your tail what he gonna call he's gonna call tails guys to call us tails here we go there's a head Georgie you want to play defense which end of the field want to play the on tight end okay very good Georgia wanted to talk and elected to play defense we'll put the ball and play first down on the 25 at the South endzone for Michigan State guides and Sparta's with the ball first overtone of the Outback Bowl coming your way after these messages and a word from your ABC station back at the Outback Bowl in Tampa John Gurdon and Jen Brown Mike Tirico over John first time for these teams this year and the third time the 26year history of the Outback Bowl Michigan State starts on offense twentyfive cousins will get the lady on bail middle and is tied up by Avery Jones with a big play earlier on a twopoint conversion a gain of three and Michigan State having more success running the football there's that one back power with the builtin bubble screen we've seen all week I think Michigan State's gonna throw it right here with trips to the right side of the formation Spartans love to throw it here seniors over here we're cutting a damn nickel or Marten pressure up the middle swinging out for battling complete his cousins had to hang in there and take a shot Jarvis Jones well look where he comes from Mike I mean they weren't getting pressure off the edge so let's bring them right up the middle EE gap blitz right up the middle number 29 Jarvis Jones hey if I can't beat your tackle I'll come right up the middle and that's the beauty of this scheme huge third down for Michigan State this is where Georgia has relied on pressure throughout this game on third lon he'll go from here is just under 40 yards with the wind at their back just we get protection up front of the line there's the senior president we're out the energy grows it's intercepted and taken away by the car Rambo's out of the 26 yard line so now with a flag on the back end of it now Georgia will have a chance to win the game with points Sanders Cummings it's Sanders Cummings comes on a short quarter bliss just like they did earlier in this football game they create another turnover the post play after the interception it was contacted looks like a late hit which Rambo is hopeful to score and in the game with a defensive score at overtime now the administration of this flag after the play very important determining when it happened number one here's a tornado during the return in a personal foul on number 36 on Georgia by ruled out penalty it's automatically defined it will be first and tenth now for Georgia at the 25 Matic declined because it's after the interceptions of possession has changed hands so that foul doesn't change who would get the ball it's Georgia ball no points at the top of the first ot Oh Sanders Cummings is going to come off the short side of the field he's not going to be blocked and it's just a great job by Georgia blitzing and playing zone coverage behind the Blitz and when you have a veteran safety like Rambo that's when they flourished the most Rambo has 13 interceptions he's made a living playing in this blitz happy scheme of POD Grantham he's got a tough decision should he turn throw or come back to Athens next year all these Bulldogs come back he'll be a top five team I've been Mike he's a ball monkey who safety who is said I used to be a hard hitter now I'm turned into a ball halter back there and he like many of the other players we've talked about today will make that decision now all Georgia needs is a field goal to get the win I expect Michigan State to be very aggressive knowing that trying to knock the Bulldogs out of field goal position and look as in the game at running back for the Bulldogs Carlton Thomas all 162 pounds of them 5 7 Thomas gets the handoff left open sealed contact made by Isaiah Lewis strong safety out of Indianapolis has been Davis High School they have all these young backs in Georgia and I think Thomas is the guy they trusted the most picking up blitzes handling audibles carrying the ball or catching it not be surprised at mark Rick doesn't hand the ball off again given the fact that they are in field goal position in a field goal wins this game for tomorrow bucks mark did tell us yesterday John's my most dependable back well Tim Thomas started that SEC championship game this is gonna get right to the middle of the field here and from near a field goal is 43 yards they're gonna go for it on third down and bring out Walsh interesting decision here you want to mess around anymore go to walls to his sophomore year won a game against Arizona State he has a chance to take the alltime Georgia points record on his final pick as a bulldog he's missed 12 this year Michigan State is a time out to ice him they'll use it before the attempt by walls Walsh has had an up and down year this year Mike two years prior to this you only had five misses combined but yes he's had a dozen misses this year and Michigan State has the perfect man to block this kick either Goulston number two or 99 worthy both have a knack for blocking kicks so many great college programs and George is right there with them it's about family and tradition of generations over the years the snapper is Ty Fritz his dad Mitch snapped for Kevin Butler one of the great kickers in tortue history you see Ty and Kevin's son Drew's the punter is the holder so a lot of Georgia history connections to Kirk Cousins hoping that his last play as a Spartan design interception there's worthy 9998 Anthony Rashad white they're going to push right up the middle 42 yards for the win on the way he has missed five field goals between 40 and 49 so the decision is to center in the middle of the field not get further down the field pasta scoreless overtime number two after this a reminder coming up ESPN already underway with its coverage of the 2012 Rose Bowl game presented by Vizio game has a kick get going to in a few minutes it's Oregon and Wisconsin kickoff at 5:10 eastern time so about 1617 minutes away glad to spending that time on the way there with a spark Rick's kicker missed the field goal they put back bowls of Georgia may get the ball on offense first after a scoreless first overtime Tampa Florida is Erin Murray with the high school four miles from here he's little nut downfield from Malcolm Mitchell in complete with Johnny Adams step first step cover s is great covers by Johnny Adams he had flagged earlier in his game but Malcolm or going on a corner routing his oneonone coverage in Johnny Adams does an excellent job I think at the end of the play Wow good tight cover no huddle offense Murray gettin this play from the sideline watch max Bullough the middle linebacker of Michigan State pill counter with all aboard his own like this better part of three and a half hours this play killed Alston false start on the offense number 71 it's a fiveyard penalty and it will remain second down and now a kicker is missed 442 if they don't gain any yards well after making 47 yarder and now we're going for the most part into this north wind 10 to 15 miles an hour he got a credit worthy Rashad right they haven't slowed down they played a lot of snaps to the big players today you're right John worthy some pretty well today second at 15 learn from the 30s coasting company he got brought down Marie keeps the play alive on the roll it's going to get out at the line of scrimmage third down coming up no game good defense by the Spartan while they're running a double move to freshman Malcolm Mitchell he's going to run a hook and go and Isiah Lewis says I'm not buying it it's going to be on the other side of the screen on the left side of the screen but they tried to get Malcolm Mitchell number 26 on a double move you'll see it right here and Isiah Lewis wheeled nicely to cover him gotta get to the yards here at the Georgia third day the back is called to Thomas we play Marlon brown the intercepted as dark quest Denard was in front of tomorrow's King and we will have it 47yard into the wind field goal attempt coming up here plus a four deep zone you're going to see a four deep zone and the Spartans run over load pressure with it so Murray has to get rid of the football and again it's just good solid defense dark Wes Denard good zone recognition big field goal right here Walsh needs to redeem himself Georgia for the lead pick great to see a senior not in his kicking career on that missed field goal helps a great kick right there was they lose five yards and those who are critical of the college football overtime rules we had this fodder to your argument or three plays lose five yards still get a chance to score points Kirk Cousins on that last Drive we've been looking at his hand too during these two possessions for Georgia believe him cut his hand is coming back in there for this last drop so Walsh the kicker one senior almost had his career end on a missed field goal but he got a chance at redemption Cousins threw an interception now he gets a chance at redemption he gets a chance to win the game first bowl win in the mark Dantonio era and for these seniors if they could score a touchdown fuzzy Burl's tee shot Martin first down 13 yard line gave him 12 for that time Martin just runs a quick out in Brandon Boykin a field corner gets gotten a runout technique watch Boyd can run out of their balls roll quickly to the outside Martinus me might have gone down there Mike good call by the official John it was seen upstairs to have either good chicken in replay growing on the field to catch see if Martin's knee was down when he had possession of the ball clearly down looks like me Mike yep I'm going to be right they'll bring the ball to the 18 yard line right there nice job guys look out that huddle at Michigan State these Spartan offensive linemen I see these guys doing this every week they just love football look out there number 62 Chris McDonald Foreman number 67 this offensive lines come a long way in the last seven or eight weeks and they've taken this game over I think in the second half like they've done a great job blocking these Bulldogs for the most part this was an offense held under 75 yards in the first half and had only two first has at seven consecutive three announced at Michigan State's offense late first half early second half and then spun around with an interception the opportunity to take the game over now you see saw the lead here a couple of times job Mike and I really think the winner of this game potentially is a top 10 team so there's a lot at stake I do believe these two teams wanna finish in the top 10 said earlier both teams had a chance to really finish this season with a lot of glory just the big call right here this replay challenge probably least five yards after reviewing the play the receivers knee was down on the 18 yard line they will bring them yard line it'll be second down and three on the 18 yard line we've credited a target on this crew damn Blum upstairs replay officials done a nice job this afternoon here as well mm one last time Michigan State won a bowl game beat Fresno in the silicon valley bowl only went to one ball on a fiveyear stretch now that become Bowl regulars last year they got their heads handed to her by Alabama when SEC Big Time beat down 49 7 trying to get a bowl victory that's guarantee look back up tight end in motion puzzles looking as he threw it away as Linthicum was blanketed Cristiano Robinson the linebacker and then the DBS in coverage as well right now Michigan State has three tight ends on the field just one wideout and one back and here comes the veterans number seven who scored earlier Keith nickel number 82 P shot Martin back in the game and feature back baby on bail Michigan State has quads four receivers to the field it is third and three for cousins with the pocket throws it took the end zone court nickels good coverage and the pressure made the difference there again Jarvis Jones so Michigan State on second and three and third and three didn't choose to run the ball with bail through it both times and now a field goal attempt to tie the game yeah Jones gets off in the bottom of the screen and each day in France the left tackle from Michigan State it's on the foot of Dan Conroy's second year as the Spartan kicker at a Wheaton Illinois Mark Richt as a timeout he'll use it to let the junior think about his 35 yard potential game tire to send us to a third overtime well no matter what happened to this overtime I think it's a pretty clear vote for who was in our eyes to stand out player of this game made plays all over the field for Georgia started the game on Michigan State's first offensive snap for the safety as he tackled Keshawn Martin in the end zone then longest punt return or longest play in Outback Bowl history Brandon Boykin a 92 yarder and then a reception touchdown and so Brandon Boykin the senior is our capital one player of the game men who thought it'd be a starry as mob practice with them interviewing him with a pencil replaced the microphone will be interviewed a lot about his performance in this ball game don't lose sight of the faith if you're Georgia reminder Michigan State capable Annie then special teams for Conroy hasn't had a gamewinning attempt in his career this is to tie the game it's 35 to 4/3 overtime West Snap is bad hey it's on the way and we're on the way to Ooty number three so two overtimes six points set out the first one of the steel balls here at the Sekulow a job on the whole by sonntag we're tied at 13 well congratulations to Jim McVeigh the president CEO of this Outback Bowl everyone associated with her they put on a great week and the two teams they invited put on an even better game yes they have 3030 over time number three Georgia with a choice and they played defense cousins in the Michigan State offense start with it the score touchdown now you have to go for two cousins drive to slide incomplete Le'Veon Bell couldn't get to the spot where Alec ogle trees been hanging out all day long using levy on bail and a lot of different roles in this second half trying to get him to impact his football game that time slant route well played oval tree he's been everywhere tonight miner the Rose ball game a few minutes from kicking off over on ESPN as argued in Wisconsin set to take the field in Pasadena second in ten here comes bill to the right and he get past poetry yeah but the receipt still came with Sanders Cummings that tells you what kind of back Le'Veon Bell is he took Sanders Cummings at six to 217 for a four yard Rock gonna see penetration off the right side balls gonna bounce to the outside he gets away from older here comes Sanders Gummy's and he holds up Bell long enough until his teammate Rambo can clean up the pile Sanders coming is that a nice day today sure has Sanders coming West Side High School in Augusta two miles away from Magnolia Lane where they play the Masters a lot of pressure so far into the short side of the field we keep an eye on that boundary pressure at the bottom of the screen timeout taken here by Michigan State you get one timeout per overtime the timeouts do not carry over to subsequent oaties third and seven coming up here it's turned cooler mentioning a cold front came through yesterday overnight really was in the 70s all week to the 60s during the game and now the Sun has started to go down and the cool north wind is blowing into the 50s it feels that way right now we continue to remind you the Rose Bowl look at that great setting there in Pasadena this has a stealth bomber flyover one of the great scenes in all of sport feel perfectly manicured the colors of pageantry great Rose Parade you saw before us here on ABC and then the game itself granddaddy of all just about set to kickoff on ESPN as soon as we're done here you can enjoy that another Novak's said you like these open formation is the only question you have when you don't have a back in the back field as can you block Jarvis Jones and this Georgia pass for us with no help 13 18 to 23 and lifteth on the tight end is that a career day comes in motion shows cousins what they're doing there's Kirk for the snap throw some Le'Veon Bell got the first down so they go to Bell a good receiver John mentioned it earlier he's third on this team in Pass receptionist go they blitz from the field and they chose not to drop number 29 Jarvis Jones and they throw a little smash route right out there the baby on bail good work bells days 79 yards to scores the 14 this would be the 79th play the Spartans run today 51 of them have been passes they've come back and down 16 nothing and there goes Bell up the middle at the 8 yard line I would have done it down there when they had second and 3 I keep banging him for unbell what Georgia looks tired now in Michigan State runs right behind Joel Foreman number 67 who started as many games as any offensive lineman and Spartan history remember John Jenkins the nose tackle is not playing for the Bulldogs gathers number 99 has taken his place and right now Michigan State's taking it right to the T that Georgia's run the offense for to the first down 8 for the touchdown it comes limp again in motion another block of the bear exactly poetry this bill has a great straight arm an Ogletree makes another superb tackle but what's the straight arm lay beyond death there's a powerful back number 24 and I can attack her by although through but the first time they've been today you might have to give it to him again I really think Belle is feeling it right now six to 237 on a Reynoldsburg Ohio quick snap cousin playaction in the flat Keshawn Martin had a first down maybe a touchdown would have been him and Rambo at that front pylon hard playaction fake the lady on bail and they try to leak Keshawn Martin out in the flap well than a perfect throw but I've seen Martin catch those all year for the Spartans Dan Conroy Brad Sonntag the holdest and a good job it's a new snappers for this game Steve Moore and that GM Papa who suspended the regular snapper Morshead t safety ones leave the flat timeout but a flag is thrown here way game offense number four to five yard penalty and a remaining four thousand we forth and 7gm papa the freshman who's been the snapper most of the year was suspended for violating team rules so steve moore the redshirt sophomore who has seen a bit of action early in the year very close in their battle for the job and he lost it more has been the one snapping here today see how this way time get in town Conroy's people Watauga through 33 to 30 June when the touchdown wins the Outback Bowl most hash marks make kicking very difficult I think the closer you get to the goalpost I'm not so sure they didn't take that five yard delay a game penalty just to improve the angle of the kick and it's another great hole I'll tell you what we might want to rethink the player that we cleared a game here santé well that one that one's better snap he's just waiting for the ground ball now we got the high hard one get down there and not the bruise so pressure kicks a couple of times here for Dan Conroy from Wheaton Illinois Orson Charles that tight in from right here in Tampa Florida Tampa plant High School been awful quiet outstanding receiving tight in wouldn't be surprised if they didn't try to find Orson Charles found the scene Michigan State's done a good job on Charles just one patch two yards we got an NFL prospects Junior Erin Murray in his hometown touchdown wins the game corsets he takes a shot incomplete as the pastor's attempted toward Marlon brown recovers from Trenton Robinson forces second down and we thought Trenton Robinson wasn't gonna play it's a good thing he did today for Michigan State because that's the fifth time we've called his name out in key situations the senior All Big Ten captain of this outfit really playing well today violation the team rules didn't start was on the field during that first drive only out for a player to second and ten Georgia's missed a field goal already in overtime field gonna keep it going cuts down to win the game Mauri with time is depicted and it's almost intercepted would have been the game winner Marcus rush dropping back in coverage got a hand on that we have third down coming up will they come after Erin Murray with double a gap pressure and watch number 30 Carlton Thomas come through here and cut down this Blitzer mac lower ball just thrown into his own Blitz coverage and you got to give credit to number 44 Marcus rush the defensive end buzzing that curl zone under way in Pasadena Rose Bowl has begun as we wrap up here in Tampa third overtime to plays no yards well my constant back at the 40 so a field goal is going to be about 47 yards with the wind in his back to try to keep the game alive William Goulston saving the best for last number two he's beaten number 72 gates at left guard and Golson has done it all day long here in Tampa Florida 47 yarder Mike Blair loves to send us to a fourth overtime is it senior class it was worthy right up the middle Anthony Rashad white butt penetration right up the gun watch it it was Rashad white who got the hand it's all taped up in there it's gonna look and the big min up there you make this in Big Mike now 16 to nothing at halftime Michigan State finds away to get Marc Dantonio his first Bowl victory and they sent out their 3time Captain Kirk Cousins with style and not just cousins to an entire senior class that changed the culture in East Lansing and a program that has to battle Michigan State and Ohio State Notre Dame in recruiting some of the great programs of all time he's gotten back in the right direction thanks to that group of seniors some big plays made throughout especially that young man who represents student athletes as well as any one of the our final score a triple overtime biscuit state 33 ESPN with John Gert and Jim Brown our entire crew Mike Tirico saying goodbye from Tampa this has been a presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports thanks for
