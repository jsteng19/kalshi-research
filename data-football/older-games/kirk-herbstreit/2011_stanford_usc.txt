============================================================

welcome to Saturday Night Football presented by Southwest Airline you are looking at Memorial Coliseum where two top quarterbacks prepare to face off in Los Angeles and the USC Trojans will be the best test yet for the Stanford Cardinal you know Herbie I can't remember a game in which we have had two quarterbacks that are valued as much as these two when you look at the statistics and how they're performing this year both are having remarkable allamerican type season it's incredible you know the thing that stands out the completion percentage and both the touchdown to interception ratio that's the most impressive thing because I think it speaks volumes about the experience that both of them have and their ability to make quick decisions to get the ball out to their play makers for Andrew Luck it's going to start tonight with his running game they've got to be able to run the football to take some of the pressure off of him set up their playaction and then for Matt Barkley he's got to find playmakers in space against a very physical Stanford defense you know Herbie I thought that USC played its best game of the year against Notre Dame how about their defense versus Andrew Luck now it's going to be a challenge obviously because of the balance and versatility of the way Stanford can attack you big offensive line big tight end undersized USC defense because of that they're going to have to commit eight sometimes nine guys up to the line of scrimmage take their chances in mantoman coverage but you're going to have to do that to stop the Cardinals of running game remember last week Stanford rush for 446 yards against Washington a school record so they're coming in with a great deal of confidence in their ability to run the ball Andrew Luck versus matt barkley balls on the teeth of the trojans Andre Hadar was nicked up a little bit a week ago is back to kick it off and Chris Olson the number one wide receiver with a cardinal effective and our journey begins mostly from the 117 yard line our we had there comes Andrew Luck and I know that you rave about his offensive line yeah I love his offensive line but obviously his leadership will be big tonight I think he has a calming effect on his team and a lot of analysts have talked a lot of said a lot of things about him over the last couple years but I think one of the things you'll see tonight is the way the intangibles can impact the football game and the way he leads with such poise especially in a tough environment like this there's people ran for over 400 yards a week ago Stephon Taylor Mansfield Texas will be the first running back and look like there's a like the substitution situation is they bring in another tight in late onto the field and Zach Ertz came out so a cleaner for Lolo there you can see in the back there they not to show power later in July back and give them a dose of that power running right away to the 23 yard line well the impact players tonight Andrew Luck is obvious Stephon Taylor last week had a big game you can also catch the ball to the back field Coby Fleener they'd love to get him the ball if you commit too many men to the line of scrimmage and respect the running game look for Fleener to get behind that kind of coverage and chase Thomas is a transplant out warrior to the Stanford defense we'll see him number 44 when the cardinal take the field on that side so they've got three wide with the ability of the fight is is completed and he goes to Chris Awards who returned the kickoff for the first down to the 35 yard line the simple read off to his right and it's the balanced attack that Stanford has it did such a good job of complementing one another Andrew Luck for obvious reasons gets most of the attention but if you talk to defensive coordinators in prep and try to get ready for the Stanford attack first thing they talk about is you have to commit some guys to the line of scrimmage and because of that it opens up someone on it one off oneonone opportunities for Roxy to pass again right stoned at the line of scrimmage by beyond Bailey number 18 a redshirt freshman from Lakewood and he leads the Trojans in tackles he's undersized and that's a matchup to watch in his game Rennie the former safety that they've moved up to outside linebacker to give them more speed on the field he's only 200 pounds so it's his speed tonight against his size and the execution of the Stanford offensive line and that time he used that speed to get right by those big linemen and make the play at least relevant market the left side play action and luck looks downfield steps up got wide open target and a good catch at the 45 yard line Coby Fleener and Andrew threw that a touch hi but cleaner went up for a 21yard gain even on second down and long you still see a lot of people up close to the line of scrimmage and how quickly they respect the running game but I think it was a welcome the balls thrown a little bit behind cleaner but it was just the the route and the execution the safety got lost in coverage and it opened things up to the outside there Purfleet ER so far Stanford offense to everything the backward tailor and he has stopped again and Bailey jumped in and made his second tackle of this game see that Brent because of Bailey's quickness to get this offensive line put it aside to these guys and I would say that we've seen with Taunton but I'm going to put the Stanford offensive line up there with anybody as far as being the top offensive lineman in the country now Wilkerson and Gaffney checking through those colors are firstround draft choices Jonathan Martinez de Vaca Castro answer left out at the bottom of your screen right now so here comes our poster play the Wildcat yeah the direct snap is the captain he tried to find the edge on that far side and he is short of the first down you've always got a wonderful when you take the ball out of number 12 and after flight if you got a home run play I won't say yes or say right but if he doesn't does the ball I'm after second good it's not because he doesn't have the athletic authority to run it's more they want to protect him when they decide to give me a little changeup and a little wrinkle to defend it was his third and manageable which is important for Stanford and I to stay on Central these days on the field the moon place for the first down to the 15yard line risk Waylon here's the poise in the pocket you can almost feel the NFL analyst breaking this one down look at the field does it pan just slides a little the right actually throws the ball on the move show some toughness after the throw but puts the ball right on the money and here's a relationship between luck and his receivers Grif Whalen on one side Chris Owosso on the other who's more than big play receiver but third down he looks up Griff Whalen shows that poisoned toughness to make the big Pro this team is perfect in the red zone 30 of those 38 scores have been touched on that's even more impressive 30 touchdowns for Andrew Luck and now he'll start on the 15 and this play is whistled dead before it starts we've got our first penalty luck on the night is perfect with his free passes 457 right on the offense in the cloud fiveyard penalty is something you know maybe very awful but bring it other than that penalty you talked about David Shaw and it's offense being kind of clicking on all cylinders doing what they want to do seven plays four runs three passes three four three four love nice mix now for pep Hammonds annotated make sure he gets that signal early so who can pass it on Gaffney comes in motion Sanford will TP the backfield for the postman if you delay the fix comes back to the middle with a completion in traffic toilet Oh one of the three that it is watching what a move he makes coming off the three wide to look right back in the middle and guns and that's why when you look at Stamford and you think about okay Stanford Rose the ball quite a bit they've given up two sacks all year not the combination a great line play but also it's a great job by the quarterback of making its primary rate looking for that next receiver and it immediately finding the check down he always is in rhythm when it comes to his progression that feedback that's minded so Jeff Monken with his first carry he's a junior from Lynnwood Washington doesn't get too many carries during the game but they thought they could ambush that front and hand it off to the lead man the last third down if he got pressure and luck rolled to his right and eventually found railing for the first down now that they're down if it's 10 yard line they love the tight ends if they have mantoman situations because of the mismatch because of the size of the bigger tight ends because these linebackers and safety u.s. get behind that they but I believe you got the first down now they're saying touchdown now the field judge is saying that he got it to the pylon that was terrific effort that die by Tyler Gaffney from San Diego rain I think it's the initial effort to impress both you and I and everybody else you thought he might be down there that was short of the first down tremendous job of getting his hand down to maintain his balance after the initial hit and then not only then he fights to get the ball to the pylon for the touchdown that's a bigtime play by Gaffney not tonight Eric Whitacre will kick the extra points he's number 46 Jordan Williams not meeting that Duty and it is 7 nothing Tyler Gaffney powers in for the first touchdown of the night Stanford 7 UFC nothing Matt Barkley with his second possession of the game the first ended with a punt they have lost tailback mark Tyler that is good the wide receiver alongside him and now motioning and they're going to put clear to him the best defender on the Stanford team and hot pursuit chase Thomas tracks him down Curtis McNeil in at the line back and Berkeley fires that there is the freshman mark you believe he is finally stopped at the 45 yard line this is going to leave a third and five coming up for the Trojans Lane Kiffin at the USC coaching staff really really long not just Robert Wood but Marquis Lee true freshman great high school athlete participated in a lot of sports and they feel that he's got a chance to continue to be bigger and stronger and faster he gives you a little shake to the outside that's what u.s. he wants to do get the ball to Lee in wood and make stance or try to make plays in space because of their size which motions barclays checks that direction goes doing my outside for the first out a beautifully thrown pass out of bounds at the 47 yard line that is outstanding accuracy you love this fetus from Matt Barkley is able to have woods in motion he gets the matchup that he wants he's got soft coverage and that's a safety Michael Thomas he's a great player on the back end and Roy's a leader with Solano how out of this game but the timing there there's really nothing that Thomas could do perfectly thrown ball by Matt Barker and the Trojans with an inside run with Curtis McNeil the Richard jr. right here in Los Angeles and he bangs just short of the 40yard line if us he wants to be able to run the football enough tonight to make this three for Stanford defense recession last week McNeil had 118 yards against the Notre Dame defense you know and I think they are coming into this game with confidence because of the more they're having a little bit more balance and success and running the ball tonight they want to run just enough to make Stanford appreciate it and then get the ball back to the outside they come back with power second effort may have got the first down with McNeil see where the spot is Brent I know you saw the same thing I saw this week mentally on this us the offensive line I think they got a little tired of hearing about Stanford's offensive line they said you know we got something to prove ourselves we want to impose our will on this Stanford defense forget about the Stanford offensive line please last two series the last two plays rather within this series we've seen that line get a good push there and we've McNeal some room to work with movement dancing the middle homes is pushback by the nose man Stevens was the nose man for the Cardinal aside on the st. first down there's another little thing that sometimes gets his unnoticed by by fans is Berkeley think row he has an accurate arm but mixing up your snap count your Caden it cadence can a lot of times help your offensive line out and you can really try to get that defense even more on their heels because they start to get into a rhythm with the snap down that time you did a good job of mixing it up catching them off guard big man right side and he overthrew miscommunication between Woods and Berkeley that time he had his oneonone coverage that time Stanford brought the Blitz and our guy chased Thomas who tonight he is the enforcer the Stanford defense and Brent you mentioned that earlier they move him around quite a bit that time they brought him on a blitz and as soon as Berkeley got rid of that football I think he felt 44 closing in on it which is out and Kyle Prater another ballyhoos recruit from Maywood Illinois is out to the right on this second down to the project quick strike to Prater Prater moves for a first down Terrence Brown had coverage and it looks like he has a forward progress first down how quickly the ball did now to the hand is something that I think Wayne Tipton is most proud of it here's Prater who breakfast talks about the difference from crater to woods and Lee is his size for a freshman at 65 215 pounds he gives Berkeley and I started out on the outside that was craters first pitch of the year which is back he's out one on one to the right on this first down Berkeley fires complete place he's gone to the sidelines with nice throws at that time Randall quell fer was a redshirt freshman California here another talented young tight end for the Trojans well that is great job of coming off of his receiver you can see he finally times the man and he wants maintains his his balance and footwork any quarterback out there always tell you that the accuracy has everything before is your footwork at that time Matt Barkley good job of coming off his primary defining Telfer there downfield McNeal with Ellis and offset Berkeley pump fake come back right side to the fiveyard line and that is Telfer again a beautiful pump fake and his tight in was right where he thought he'd be and he knew that he was eventually going to come back to Telfer two quarterbacks their veterans he's using his eyes and even a shoulder how many times you'd be true breathe through that in the NFL game Peyton Manning Tom Brady little look to the left come back to the right have to trust that tight end who's a freshman but comes back without even looking and throws it right to his side in four nice big gain aggressive play calling there by Lane Kiffin on first and ten so suck it down and two from the five yard line so forth simply look to target parents ground from Torrance California was on him Stanford brought one more than the US the offensive line could handle and eventually they the pressure got to him just stadium and I have a new agree with them that is tight coverage there is many face guard any college football but you can't make contact like that Harris brown definitely right in the face is the pressure came that time from the backside goes out again Bartley stays airborne and complete and again there was tight coverage in the backfield that was Carrington working back there on the target take a look at this I think that one was better coverage she actually had red elephant out of the flat that time he may have locked in a little bit there to krembo red Ellison the fullback flipped out of the backfield I was standing all alone he would have seen him that would have been a touchdown Lane Kiffin may have wanted one of those balls back might want to try a running for down there when they had been second in short but as it is 22 yard field goal by Andre Atari puts the Trojans on the board and it is 7 3 Baylor's backers the running guy look Rose drops it off underneath to Brian Hewitt slipping out of the backfield and he was wide open as he crosses the 30 yard line to the 27 for another first down and this is the answer look at all those jerseys the defensive jerseys up close to the line of scrimmage so a misdirection booth where look has a chance at you cover his receivers to run the ball back to the boundary but U is wide open so he just bit the ball out of his hands quickly but a great call because of the way SC defendant first agenda last two series break ball playaction Nathan runningback Kathy to the 21 yard line he scored the game's only touchdown about a pass from luck on their opening bride of the game but the Cardinal threatening here again two yards away for the red zone or luck and the Cardinal have been absolutely lethal this year come back with Gaffney and Gaffney Puckett breaking tackles all night long to the 10yard line it will be first down for the Cardinal he keeps his legs turning here and this is the one thing that you love to see by a stable of back sir Taylor gets most of the carries but Gaffney comes in and he shows that he's got the power as well and that fires up the defense Harper Lee with the big interception got the eye black on it'll fire up the rest of the team McDavid saw Brown and I got to punch it into the end zone 11 yard line pick up one yard on first down in print this week David Shaw telling us the importance of ingame adjustment against Monte Kiffin what an important thing kind of a chess match he knows the Monte Kiffin is going to do Monte Kiffin knows that David Shaw is going to do the matter of making the adjustment and who has the upper hand at the right time play action always very successful for this Stanford offense down in invariance there is Monte Kiffin he was up to the left of the ball cap on father complain today check again and walk back under gun but close a snap in the late game I think again delay a game on the offense number flower 5 yards hackers may 2nd down the second diamond I hope you coming a problem seeing that play clock of the top lefthand corner time he was making some adjustments at the line of scrimmage something that he's going to have to be aware have you see him reading the plays here off of the big center there second down and 14 Stewart and Gaffney along inside the quarterback takes off fires on the run to the corner of the end zone incomplete cleaner was breaking free toward the back of the endzone and as luck was in trouble spotted him at the end and tried to dread the pass and I think maintaining your vision as you're running for your life is the challenge the ball hits pretty good effort that time though by Fleenor Monty kippot Zola said the one thing Andrew Luck does it's very unusual moved to the left and throw accurately he said in the NFL when he defensive coordinator a Tampa he didn't see many quarterbacks could move hard to the left and still throw accurately absolutely and then it just had you pressure him and where you come from with your bliss tbird and 14 this fires incomplete and that would have been up for grabs and Wiley the quarterback had a shot at it in the end zone again this run for it's starting to really play football when they get him to third down they're not bringing pressure to poor guys there's a Sun a little twist up there to move Perry back to the inside but they're just doing a good job of using the athletic ability maintaining and putting seven back in coverage and look has nowhere to go with the football lucky that time it wasn't intercepted my wife Whitaker for me three our field goal mold it and it's going to be good 10 3 but Lane Kevin's defense coached by his father is causing Stanford Trump Barkley's South County multicore lead diving and complete mark easily broke open with that speed we've told you about and he just couldn't quite hang on this is a great job of using his eyes he brought it brings two young safety carrington up he has the oneonone matchup they're going to keep going after bana Massey the bigger corner he's one on one all by himself against the fleet fleetfooted freshman a little bit more air under that and leave easily walks underneath it and force a touchdown provide on this second in pen and out loud you I see so us a time out of the Hat it's called their 32nd charge timeout charge timeout if we remind you that our aerial coverage has been provided by Goodyear everything Goodyear has learned making tires that go the distance inspires what they roll into yours Goodyear more driven it is very interesting when you talk about a quarterback matchup you sometimes forget the defensive coordinators are getting paid to and I dare say both of them they're doing outstanding jobs here against these two quarterbacks I agree with you I mean Stanford opened up the game the first drive much like our Wisconsin game last week against Michigan State they went right down the field 10 plays put seven points on the board Andrew Luck was five for five but boy Monte Kiffin made some adjustments and also let's give credit to that front four from USC we wondered how they would match up physically to what Stanford wants do when they run the ball but so far Stanford only 70 rushing yards in his first half so Monte Kiffin doing a good job as well Stanford talk playful fall on the ground picked up by McNeal big launch storming in chase Thomas they make sure he can't get up again anymore that is back at the 43 yard line well it with the clock moving and starting to move into field goal range at the very least exactly what USP could not afford now and set them way back on this third down in 17 McNeal just dropped the football right his hand Derek Mason and Jason Harbor are the defensive coordinators for USC Berkeley comes back to the middle sort of the 30yard line and that is Xavier Grimble a redshirt freshman from Las Vegas making the catch in the middle of the field that it'll be fourth and eight interesting and looking at dukes and looking at the clock and working the clock here a little bit before they maybe they get their timeout he's trying to shrink it so that luck doesn't get a lot of time this is a fourth down and Lane Kiffin deferring the opening coin toss tonight they get the football back to start the second half now you have call the Tatas had the official over alongside of him and told him exactly when he was going to use it so here's your fourth down now and they are going to go for that long 50 orders Barclay is the holder remember that dari is on the hip this he has take the 47 yarder this was bang hit good a 50yard field goal for Andre hidari a freshman from Bakersfield California there was a lot of talk this week that he had this ankle injury last week in defending Notre Dame on that big kickoff return for the Fighting Irish he's been on crutches questions on whether or not he'd be able to go Lane Kiffin kidding this week about our talking to the student body about tryouts but hidari comes out here and does a good job at stepping up and get some points again they get the ball to start the second half ty Montgomery is now on is one of the return them along with Stuart so a 50 are still vote for now they kick it along the clown eating up as much time as they can man Andrew look her be only with nine seconds left here I should be a little bit careful because I can remember last Saturday night right each Lansky never put your back thinking about Michigan faith is trying to get it into overtime put one up in the air but Stanford the ways is this pathway ended probably just to get out of here and make some adjustments at halftime you're exactly right they come right out with a halftime formation content to go in up by four they'll be playing defense as you pointed out Lane Kiffin in us you will get the ball start the second half done forget that Stanford holds the nation's longest winning streak at 15 and that is in jeopardy here as we head into the second half first of all if you're Stanford's offense and Andrew Luck they've got to be able to get back to establishing the running game and then eventually take your shots downfield when there's air and if you're USC they've had some oneonone matchups on the outside eventually they're going to hope that Berkeley is able to find his receivers lead and woods to make those Stanford defensive backs pay for that oneonone coverage Robert woods coming out from the end zone and down at about the 21yard line out of bounds we check in down below were there at Andrew's friend tanks and taco Lane Kiffin come in off the field he said yes you're completely out of sync on offense I asked him if that's because would miss some time in practice he said he believed so but they look to make the adjustment also just spoke with Stanford's David Shaw talk to him about the pressure that they're getting on his quarterback and he said for us we just have to do a better job like Kirk said running that ball normal down in distance he's looking for here in the second half guys right and McNeal continues as the running backwards approaches Mark Tyler injured on his first carry of the game Robert Woods on that slip screen to the outside with Ellison out in front of it you're talking about with woods can lead to the more closeup receivers in the pac12 and right now it's a matter of Matt Barkley and that offensive line working together and Barkley can get just a little bit more time and sometimes it's just a split second give the quarterback some time and let him evaluate the defense and he talks it over with lanes ship and of course they had time at halftime to see if they can try to exploit the secondary of Stanford in battle Massey the corner to the left side of the offenses out of the game right now thank you bad Barkley fires to the 38 yard line and caught by Robert woods under heavy pressure makes the grab for the first down Trent Murphy just about got to Matt Barkley again his compressor coming to the offense his left side how about Murphy going up against an allamerican there and Matt Khalil gets around him eventually the Barkley doesn't good job of hanging in there with woods and one of the rare connections downfield that we've seen what does a good job of using his body to keep comments away from the ball so it'll be first down and 10 from the 39 yard line for Berkeley here's McNeil big hole on the left side the crepe reveal breaks the daylight kurtis McBeal the junior from Los Angeles who exploded last week for 118 yards in South Bend now takes it 61 yards for the stroll what a great job of blocking here the left tackle Khalil we just talked about is a good job I watch Robert woods right there with a block on Carrington downfield and the speed by McNeal I think mayor Claude Stanford off guard a little bit bearing browning the corner taking a poor angle but outstanding blocking a good movement speed in the open field by USC you know as a matter of time to the Trojans would eventually have a chance to strike for a big one dari adds the extra point and this is news for the first time this season Stanford trails in a football game remember they've won 10 straight games by 25 or more points they're in a dogfight there was a great signs on game day to day one which my favorite was Stanford has luck so did the Irish where's Matt in ten at the Stanford 30 are nine woods motions to the left part way out Jericho keep to the end zone double covers on the freshman that was Lee Marquis lead and Stanford had double on he had a free play there might as well take a shot put it up in the air and see if your receiver can adjust and get a touchdown and the key sense that he had offsides that time by Stanford offsides on the defense number 99 fiveyard penalty remains first down that will move the ball to the Stanford 25yard line bad at masti the right corner to the offense his left is back on the field USC has been really attacking him when he's been isolated out there oneonone against the u.s. fleet footed receivers hand up here break the bands on again for Curtis Neal he backs up in 61yard he's now hit a hundred yards of the night and two touchdowns so on a night in which the Trojans lose their starting running back on the first play of the game number 22 steps up big and another undefeated team is in trouble today ten and a half Praveena here in the third USC leads it by 10 a wusu of the 3rdeye Alley covered up at the 25yard line because accidents touchdown and we McNeil was able to explore granted Carswell goes in motion right here comes in and bottom Aussie comes with him so you eliminate the corner and then you just have a block by Khalil a block by the tight end and it opens up so watch his cars welcome in the inside van amazi follows Apple makes a nice block locks up their linebacker I think felt that he was told late Jacob Lancaster with the tithing and left hackle make the blocks and it opens things up there to McHugh Jonathan Martin back up left tackle and if you're wondering when is what's going to put it up still not yet as Wilker says it is the money back and forced out of bounds and it continues to be a conservative attack second down now luck goes down feels this time for first down and Weyland at the 40yard line and that time he was able to get a wide receiver open that time TJ McDonald the safety walked up from here to here now you have a safety in the middle of field in a corner who's going to drop it gives you a seam right there of course lux able to see it mcdonald up tight look at that huge seam between the corner and the safety puts the ball up in the air and a good adjustment that time by whaling to make the catch Zach urghhh was the OP a 12 players in the huddle at the same time so then 5:12 in the huddle main first down uncharacteristic here by Stanford and David Shaw this is where you really want to test the fortitude in the middle of a football team you're on the road you're down ten everybody has high expectations for you got to face this adversity and fight through it our four major Taylor trying to get back to the original line of scrimmage in pants this is going to be second down and long let's check it down below with Aaron Brad you guys are talking about the Stanford team being tested for the first time in Andrews lock before he took the field was yelling at it's offensive line this is what we mean this is what we over come to see if we can move forward to go see how they handle it Aaron they have dominated every team they have played in second half out scoring in 188 233 and tonight their town 14 to nothing just did in second half alone played by far the most talented opponent of the season let's offensive end with soft eyes what steps away now fires hi incomplete so that was Wiley Isaiah Wiley at the coverage over here on a wushu Nick Perry man gotten away with lining up outside his helmet and tan right close to the line so once again it's answer look not being able to just fit in the pocket he got to step up avoid the pressure that front for trying to get the ball to a rooster who has not been able to be involved at all tonight and it's Stanford offensive attempt they're down Stanford only three of eight Graff and now it is four of nine Wayland he goes back to him and that's his second catch on this drive it keeps it alive a huge play for 17 yards and this time the offensive line does a good job of giving him time they keep him running back here and he steward it and there again is the receiver using his hand to be able to make a catch and a pivotal one there on third down involved nice pattern run that time I will soon wide open it's to the 35yard line it'll bring up second and short Stanford trying to show patience with a few first down throws we've seen here from them in a while trying to get back to having more of a balanced attack still plenty of time in this game assuming they can come up with points on this Drive I think just for their confidence they need to come up with points on this side the way this game has gotten away from them straight ahead step on Taylor back at that running back spot shorten Stein the Castro Yankee in the middle of that offensive line so Stewart had replaced Stepan let me correct myself that wasn't Taylor but that was true at that time for that first down now Taylor comes back in if ten straight win of 25 points or more the interesting to see how this team does bounce back as we continue to talk about that here too which is going to blitz fires complete against it and cut by Weyland Weyland in a fiveyard line the ball will be spotted there first and goal and the Blitz unable to get to luck Brett did you see how I used it cadence to get USD to tip their hand where the Blitz was coming from uses the cadence he shows the linemen where it's coming from the two back stay in to help out both Taylor and to it the line the fax everybody does their job and they finally give luck time to throw the ball mr. tater wide open touchdown they walk in they hit huge Ryan Hewitt the fullback HVAC from Denver Colorado and a very impressive Drive as Andrew Luck I showed you why the pros are so high on this young man what a drive that's how you have to answer as a football team and Andrew Luck a big part of that Aaron just talking about how he's challenging his offensive line getting them up giving them a bit of a wakeup call they showed great poise they're down by a couple scores to be able to get back and be in position here to be back in this game Merrick would it hurt next on the extra point every luck back under center stephane Taylor for a first down and 11 yard run to the 25yard line kind of sticking to their guns showing that patient you know going back to the beginning of this year with David Shaw taking over as a head coach and pep Hamilton taking over as the offensive coordinator the one question I think a lot of America wanted to know about with with David Shaw on the his coaching style with his team be able to maintain their edge that aggressiveness that Jim Harbaugh started to become so familiar and so popular with luck is now out to the outside this is the second time that they set a wildcat they're going to give it to him later throw it going to go deep down the middle going to go for storage strike tackled at the 15yard line ty Montgomery the freshman from Dallas and as soon as you see Andrew Luck out here to the outside it's got to alert you as a defense here's the receiver that ends up getting behind coverage but is this when you see Andrew Luck out there you've got to know something's up especially when he starts to go back to the ball is they're going to pitch it back to him tremendous job of getting it to him downfield and Montgomery makes his only third catch of the year 62 yards 14yard the backwoods Gaffney who is a tough runner and he crosses the 10yard line where he suck it down coming up and without truly having differencemakers and wide receivers their best receivers a loose there's a nice player but their tight ends have been the big play receivers for him this year when you don't have that speed like a Robert Woods or marketing sleeve you kind of come up with a few wrinkles like that to get some receivers downfield behind coverage look into the back there Jaffee seven yard line before he is brought down basically at mantoman acrosstheboard empty the backfield like that quarterbacks got to get the football out of his hands quickly and you said it was mantoman across and he's got to find the oneonone matchups getting one and he tried spit it out to his running back Daphne it is a phobic for help there with a block to be able to get be able to spring loose into the end zone Coby Fleener goes off to the right basically a slot man what's going to take it himself and in short did he get the first down you did not brings up a very interesting decision here Nick Terry made the stop and shock and either kick the field goal for the tie right now try to get the first down of the touchdown its fourth ensured you know what luck wants to do bring it into big boys here the Jumbo set big offensive lineman and Stefan Stefan Taylor the running back timeout here down 22:10 they kind of cranked up the intensity as an offense here these last couple series Stewart and a full house the first down so it'll be first out in gold her Stanford did not need the touchdown unfortunately for a lot of the fans here at the Coliseum I think they were thinking it was for the core think gold a little deflating when they saw the first down marker pop up there after that first down but he therefore needs a yard or two they're going to get into that jumbo set he's going to let you know it's coming matters have you match up to their physicality and then third that fourth and forth Stewart that Rouge Louisiana keep it touchdown Andrew Luck great sleight of hand I thought he had given it to the lead fullback but he kept it himself and then took it in on quarterback delay and Stanford regains the lead well there's the composure we talked about and Andrew Luck delivers for the Cardinal the last two drives they've needed points and they believe they dream bring them all the way down and put two touchdowns on the board and regain the lead Eric Whitacre tacks on the extra point and you love this because you see Peyton Manning and Tom Brady and others watched the hand get in there and see that shot just the hand it's the head in the body language he fooled the defense I don't think they realized he had the football so it's not just a hand it's the head and the body language hides the ball does a great job with his technique and there was something he worked on hard even last year with Jim Harbaugh as a head coach being a former quarterback any kind of advantage you can get over the defense you always want to take those are the small things that Andrew Luck can do for an office well the torch has been lit for the fourth quarter here in the Los Angeles Coliseum just posted a couple of Olympic games through the years Travel of the procession out flame was ignited and now we'll see if the Trojans are ignited will we start the fourth quarter and that was partly making the stop for the Cardinal Tarpley has been active they have done a good job of rotating bodies the Cardinal habit linebacker they've played seven or eight different defenders in that area therefore linebacker spots and all of them very similar with their physical attributes of course chase Thomas number 44 is their leader their anchor that they count on but have done a good job of trying to keep those bodies fresh matching up against Berkeley and espied offense third and four from the Cardinal 38 but you're coming they run away from it to the first island McNeil Curtis McNeil stepping up for us see we sure has and I think like all great back more you get the football the more you get into a rhythm and he's starting to feel it without a doubt and you know Brent that that injury to Terrence Brown the sophomore corner number six when he tried to tackle McNeil he's out of the game and Johnson battle Massey 27 is back in the game in fact matched up at the bottom of Robert woods and at some point USD will feel that they need to try to go after number 27 deal Washington thirty's in the 28 yard line the reason right now they feel that they have to run the ball that's the answer to a defense putting double coverage on a wide receiver they've got Bhanumati up tight on woods a safety behind him you've only got a certain number of defenders in the box you've got to be able to run the ball defensive circle live from the Stanford sideline pressure off of it on the slant got a man touchdown more peacefully the Frenchman finally broke free and there's a penalty flag in the endzone two of them come quiet the touchdown is good after the play honking number nine on the offense that penalty will be enforced on the ensuing kickoff coaching him up right you can see what Lane Kiffin is talking about if this young man is the full ability but he'll learn he's a true freshman not only on the sidelines with the coach but in the film room when he just ridiculed and embarrassed by his he made big coaches part of being a true freshman professionally as a physician bred as you know Azari Nexon the extra point USC leads it 53 but because of the penalty Andrew Luck should have good field position coming up and Sanford is hoping that Andrew Luck is the last man standing USC is hoping it's going to be Matt Barkley so here we go Stanford defense does their job then they get the big return by Terrell to set this drive up for Stanford bootleg again and he's going to take it all the way at the first down another element that Andrew Luck can bring to an offense is I love the call first and ten you're taking the power game a naked there's nobody running around that's just hoping the defense buys the play fake gets the quarterback to the outside and the edge and he had speed he turned that corner he's thinking about trying to get that ball into the end zone soccer player is the Oscar throwing up in first down and ten for the 15 boy action breaks away with his strict now fire 4d in zone and his receiver had broken it off a little bit easy so in fact he threw it away wasu was the intended target there was pressure from Perry they did not live together they have money Tiffin doing a good job even the two facts that we've seen tonight where they mix up their coverage mixed up there at times disguising their blisters at times they're coming after him this previous play they did not come after him they just rush with four they have a lot of stunts working form up front you can see the pressure that's been on luck all night you use Taylor try to stretch it out and he barges to about the 12 yard line calippo making this not Bryzgalov oh now it is third and nine Stanford down by a field goal looking at a third and nine with six 20 remaining this is where USC has had some success in getting after Andrew Luck on the third down in long situation let's see look down at the bottom breath deluxe neck toy and gaffney glam at the 12/5 pollard the large made to stop number 10 haze Pollard thank you and I are sitting here wondering third down and long you got Andrew Luck and they decide to take the ball away from Andrew Luck and put it into a running back pan how hard with a big hit there to push Daphne back but surprising call by pep Hamilton and Stanford Airness not Glau blocked a chance to grow it ever now that maxsa little has blocked more kicks this year and Eric Whitacre sets up now for the twenty nine yards slides it right got it whoa that was close Kathy texted it down as a running back for Andrew Luck take that inside handoff go back a little too high with that mess and it is incomplete to Tyler Gaffney who slipped out of the backfield as a receiver drip Whalen caught a lot of attention from the USC defense you can see calippo and Bailey both cutting starting to sink in into coverage you see to touch there by locked and put a little bit too much touch on that football floated on him a little bit second intent is Taylor checks back into the cardinal back hill véra running to the left for the 28th Keynes his balance and let's see where they mark this this was a heck of a run by stefan taylor who got over to the outside and watched this a tremendous effort great block by the castro hewitt involved but it's right here that extra effort the way he's able to get away from glyph oh and get up feel there's hewitt involved in a block on macdonald to tied in now you see a shake and bake up field doesn't give up on it your middle high Packer you got to wrap up when these guys are out in the open field I guess they want to see if he steps out of bounds on that far side they're giving it a first down let's see what the mark is going to be out there checking if his right knee at collision with calippo if it may because he the way his body moved his right knee may have may have touched maybe that's what they're looking instead of where he stepped out of bounds Jim Fargo pants is our replay operator up close to us and he's taking a look at this and see if the knee went down after contact it sure looks like it can you tell is it indisputable it's a great look right here I'll be able to tell you in one second yes sir down Herbie says turn it over no first down sir let's pick this big decision coming out here Andrew Luck heads on back outward personnel after review the runners me look down the ball be places of penny three yard line third down and three yards to go and the clock will start on my ready for play and go 3:18 left in regulation hi game the fall and Andrew locks hands right back an infected touched the youngster from Florida dick lob all of five foot eight inches he's a favorite of the coaching staff and a pick six as the extra point printed third down and three aquel Robi jumps the route take the chance off to the right you can see him break on the football even really before Andrew Luck threw the ball he was taking a chance it was a gamble it's third and three and it just goes to show you even a talented veteran quarterback like Andrew Luck trusts his receiver his third down in short and the USP defense was anticipating a short route you take a chance and sometimes it pays off Chris takes great athletic ability there biro b58 165 pounds sophomore from Florida happens to the best of them mister we're Kirk Herbstreit in our attenders I'm Brent Musburger as we settle in for the conclusion of what has been a dandy rock 12 showdown here in Los Angeles plenty of time for Andrew Luck right Kiska 23 yard line Brent we've already seen undefeated Kansas State go down undefeated Clemson go down and out undefeated Stanford on the ropes and this is a play potentially that could be the game changer Roby to corner to quell Roby jumps around on third and three a bit of a gamble take the chance but goes with his instincts on third down it takes the chance at depth in front of an Andrew Luck pass and takes it back to the house for the goahead touchdown so we've had four leaf changes in this game Taylor will be B Stanford running back 20 degrees to Montgomery picks up a first down so we're seeing more and more of the freshman from Dallas e6 to 205 ty Montgomery we've seen Andrew Luck earlier in the game with us he had a 10 point lead drive Stanford down and deal with the pressure and now the game on a lot authority has steps up fires a wushu who was on that far side and that was Montgomery again so Stanford with 15 consecutive wins now Whalen comes to the right side steps up drops into the camera can't get the handle thrown a little bit behind him he was juggling it and it'll be another third down coming up this defensive line deserves a game haul from my kitchen at Lane Kiffin these guys they face one of the best offensive lines in the country they've held up very very well against the run only a hundred ten yards rushing against a team that averages 219 yards when luck has dropped back to pass even when he completed walls a lot of times he's been under direct not always been because it's ellipses a lot of times it's just the front for doing their jobs and using their athletic ability hit by Stanford is to reach the 46 yard there's a flag they hit him up high it's a personal foul on TJ McDonald who I think got real unlucky on this play let's take a look at the replay he got it up high a wushu is down it's going to be an automatic first down I also thought there might have been some sort of illegal block personal foul unnecessary rough it's number 7 on the defense 15 yards anything automatic first down take a look now at TJ McDonald and see if he's not unlucky he's coming from outside the play a wushu now goes down if you have to call I have to call it it's a controversial call right now in college and pro football you talk to a defensive guide that's sitting right now at home watching if Matt Millen is watching this he's saying that's football that's football but it's an effort that we've seen from the officials based on what the coaches have asked that when there's contact into the headgear you've got to make the call here's why I say it was unlucky watch number 81 start to go down it becomes a lower target if he had stayed up and believe me these guys are moving fast enough they can't come off back now and that's why I thought TJ was very unlucky you have to call it yeah got him a pie there's no question about that you just made a great point about these players are playing so fast and now they're being an aspect to being trained their entire careers since the time they're in Pop Warner canal of a sudden okay now you've got to always hit receivers low when you've been trained your whole life try to separate them from the football but nonetheless Stanford got to the point in a hurry they lose a big target hello sir who goes off for the sidelines now Montgomery and Whalen and of course Coby Fleener the tiedin who's been relatively quiet now takes off can you get the first out yet for the 30 dives to the 29 yard line and here he comes two minutes to go if linebackers are bailing out to Tampa to that Monte Kiffin is made famous in the NFL in college calippo the middle linebacker just bailed he got right back in a deep fer the middle of the coverage you called it luck recognized it and took off so ruck is back this time fires to a wideopen Whalen he's to the 24 yard line before he's wrestled down by Roby and Andrew Luck is in complete command right now we're under two minutes Stanford has two timeouts time at this point is really not an issue for about execution and doing what they need to do with his football farthest right to the 13 yard line where Lolo so when Lolo is a junior from the Mesa California days one of the tight ends on this team big sixfoot eight inch target only to stick catch by a tight in in this game Stanford came in throwing predominately too tight in going thick tonight we come back for the running play and breaking his Taylor and he picks up nine strong yards crosses just crosses the five it will be very close to the five yard line and now Stanford not in any hurry they have confidence and their ability to execute down in the red zone it's been a strength that there's all year they know the quarterback on the other sideline there's Beckett David Shaw has four Lane Kiffin and Matt Barkley so they're at this point not in a hurry got a timeout called by Stanford timeout Stanford that's their first charge fine out suck it down and here it is in front of Hera play action chose for the endzone battle for it down there in the corner incomplete it was intended for cleaner and print what a job by Shane Horton he knew at that point they're going to look for cleaner what a great Pro up in the air we're cleaners can have a chance to make a play on it this is that call where's the continuation and most officials right there you got to be able to hold on to the football through the catch it's not just one foot down it through the catch the ball is it's a bead rolling over the ball comes out that's the right ball in the field third down and tie rods I take another look at it upstairs Stanford that's their third and final charge timeout this may be a 30 second charge timeout they can't get somebody tackle they can't get up at sack you can't get a first down and stop the clock third and 2 so they're trying to do thanks for the first down and a will quickly stop right so with 44 seconds the clock has not been started yet on his signal not winding and don't touch down we are an extra point away from a die about that for an answer by Stanford 10 Flay's and 76 yards with make sure Taylor gets the ball across the plane he does for the touchdown tremendous job by the Cardinal in the offense there and remember that 15yard penalty on TJ McConnell so if ever there was a time the Khalil was going to try to get another block getting airborne the Whitaker gets it off in time and high enough and we are tied at 34 with 38 seconds to go coming back from a pick six Andrew Luck drives the Cardinal to a tying touchdown through luck tonight when he's had to run they put a lot of pressure on in seven different times he's run the football for 23 yards he's had a couple times where he's been able to pick up valuable yards it's not so much how many but the yards when he's been able to pick him up also his scored on a touchdown I can't believe that Curtis McNeil who's been a workhorse is back here with Robert woods as the he's okay good and reveals got a pretty good chip on a coverage man it's out to the 25 and so here comes Matt Barkley Herbie 22 of 36 194 yards one touchdown of one interception and not only that Brent you think about the the kicker tonight a dairymaid a 50yarder so you're thinking you got at least you try to get to between 235 in the 40yard line of Stanford Berkeley has confidence in his receivers it's just a matter will he have enough time to throw the football it's been an issue at times throughout this game barclays straight back fires complete the woods all three timeouts pop cops obviously in the first down Andre hidari who picked up 50 orders at the end of the first half warming up huh fate wants to go side on wood incomplete it will be second in 10 plant and go double move tried to get the ball and try to get the corner browning to bite on it now it might be a clock problem is the officials the back judge came running up the clock kept running in second 19 seconds so they'll put 7 back on I you know Harvey has this been a wonderful week if you're a sports fan remember to remember last week when we were Michigan State and that Hail Mary pass Achatz Wisconsin Cathedral sorry though Game six what a world Hilary a week and then the Cardinals come back to win it and where we are tonight 19 seconds away from ot 20 yards away from a shot at a field goal mark Lincoln got it get it off the sideline and you guys just get it off the Telfer Randall Telfer for the right tackle on that dead play Kevin graph looked like he got away with a hold on Ben Gardner watch the French 77 he blocked in right there did right there he just grabs it no call the referee is looking right at it I was waiting from the reach for his flag they get away with one and pick up huge art filter for timeouts left they're closing in now then get the careerlong 50 or him into the first man Burk plot it on the release in the complete and Carswell the intended target we haven't called his name very often here tonight Brandon Carr as well hadar we mentioned 50yarder he's going to call a timeout he was nine second he has plenty of time ousted to use to be able to get this play that they want there needs to be even a little bit more urgency there from Berkeley he's sitting back in the pocket need only has time the game clock is ticking down every second it's valuable to Matt Barkley he essentially needs five to seven yards five yards to at least give his man a chance at a potential gamewinning field goal when he's sitting back there holding on to the ball those seconds are ticking off barclays going to set a screen in the middle towards which running away coming to the left out of bounds as the clock runs out the questions going to be Brent did he get to the sidelines tough to see from the game angle because of the Stanford players but did he make it to the boundary the game clock ran out overtime overtime both teams will handle the ball this is not going to be suddendeath started from the 25yard line there will be a play clock and if we hit the third OD we're going for the twopoint conversions and with USC winning the toss of all the college over times we've seen you always want to start on defense you have to have a chance to see what you're facing if you look at it like an inning kind of the top of the first right here you always want to be that home team to see if you need to touchdown to tie or fuel goal or whatever it might be how great is this chance to see these two quarterbacks tonight now to see them in overtime let's see who's able to execute better to try to get a win under luck against Matt Barclays Andrew Luck and regulation 25 and 36 298 yards two touchdowns and pushed on it over time hand off the Taylor and Thaler is being pushed back after Damien four yards getting close to the 20th we spotted around the 21 yard line there's been a long night to these teams and you're facing these quarterbacks you're facing a physical offensive line and running game their abilities of question mental toughness is really being challenged right now for both of these defenses see if either one of these defenses could come up with a stop Mabry continues at right tackle her name was injured first down on their luck scrambled within 13yard eyes again the pressure is coming off of the edge and Andrew Luck knows that he's got to step up into the pocket the linebackers clear out here's the athletic ability here's the speed and quickness there's Pilar Hayes Pollard a freshman trying to bring down 237 pound Andrew Luck to speed and a toughness their luck on display on the running game so Taylor continues his workload here tonight Taylor on the game has carried 20 times for 84 yards remember the stats in overtime count that power play this offense lives and dies behind they will continue to run it they never lose confidence in their ability to run the football with her Taylor back there or Gaffney they pull the backside guard and leaves that fullback store and Gaffney check into the backfield quick pitch into our little preparation on the hook and ladder and Stewart comes around and takes the lateral top here Brent back into the boundary you're trying to get a big offensive tackle out there and Jonathan Martin you're hoping that the defense reacts and follows the receiver but gum rebut kind of stayed home pretty well third and one some right substituting going on now by Stanford ever they had 12 in the huddle once tonight third and one Stewart is the running back over the top go for it Jeremy Stewart from Baton Rouge Louisiana appeared to pick up the first down it'll be first and goal for the Cardinal there's that jumbo set they bring in some extra lineman some tight ends and steward who's kind of a hammer of these this quartet of back that they had shows a little bit elevation there by the big trail I get up and over the top there for the first down and be careful to playaction pass here on first and ten side the 5yard line by luck to kind of find inside an insolvent power again and Stewart is short of the end zone Lyman is trying to create just enough of a crease David Shaw again he he believes in it they told us all week until their opponent the matter of can you stop it you know it's coming can you match up and defend an SP for the most part tonight has done a pretty good job look at that MACD they were handed over the top becomes touchdown SCS defense aligned submarine Stanford and then they sent their linebackers and safeties over the top trying to meet Jeremy Stewart have hooked for a collision to push it back but Stanford that time kind of did it the oldfashioned way by running the football Andrew Luck had that one night scramble for a first down but for the most part runners they ran the football combination of McNeil running the football Barclays trying to find Li and woods there have been some tribes where they have been on and there have been other drives where they just for whatever reason have not been on the same page especially woods in Berkeley was in motion the Quebec word McNeil and he slapped it across for 2009 on that first down in Curtis McNeil having a great night an offensive line facing this threefour defense they have done a really good job at times of being able to sustain blocks and give McNeil room to run I'm worried running back he has buried below and again break3 battles for that first down marker at the 15yard line and it's going to be close in print you got to remember this guy's about 180 pounds and you know how big these stanford linebackers are this is a threefour defense when you play a threefour defense you're playing with 245 250 pound linebackers that can run and they're asking him asking him to run right into him on most of these carries he's showing a lot of toughness tonight so with the first down at the 15 that would by himself at the top oneonone coverage and say the same thing I'm saying see him at the top one on one against crowning if you want to looking in that direction turns it to the endzone run catches it just what he saw he saw the oneonone coverage that we saw from up here and when you see it you've got to be able to capitalize on it and this time Berkeley and woods are in sync throws the ball away from the defender right to where woods can make a play on it and he checked to that at the line of scrimmage good job there by Matt Barkley Troy hidari slides it through all right we'll go to the second overtime Stanford will be on defense first and Matt Barkley and the Trojan offense will come out starting at the 25yard line to see what they can do and because USC just scored in the manner in which they did be surprised to see the Stanford defensive staff leave these corners on an island and more than likely they're going to protect them with safeties which means you would think the ball will go back into the hands of Curtis McNeil see if they can run the football maybe the Lee Malone will see if they get oneonone matchup Terrence brown checks back and there's less Horner monthly is ready after I the defense and that's exactly what they're demanding better with Brazil there is a penalty flag thrown on to play facemask that time on Jarek Lancaster see McNeil coming up clapping hey personal foul face mask under 35 on the descent half the distance to the goal first down every mistake can add up lancaster reaching to make a play grabs ahold of the visor more than the facemask but it's still a penalty personal found half the distance so the ball will be spotted at the 12 for this first down card as well is split out now which will go in motion Barclays a role in that direction fiery John hooha he had cars well open he got a matchup that he liked Woods got a lot of attention he just put a little bit too much on that football heap rolling to his ride got a lot of momentum going that way and he just put a little bit too much velocity on the football and away from cars well to make the chance and make the catch second and ten straight back some kids under me touchdown Randall's helper one of the tight ends would not be stopped but that is an amazing effort by a freshman helper watch this watch him fight for this extra yard the extra yards he keeps his feet inbounds and then he's just being held right here by Bonamassa he just said let me just extend this across the plane for the touchdown what an individual effort that time by Tilford Midori necks on the extra point and now Stanford the seven points to force it to a third overtime Andrew Luck's turn tailors is running back look takes off stopped at the 20yard line it'll be second down Bailey was there rent one of the few times we've not seen luck in grip Waylon on the same page us see corner to the right of the offense Roby as the ball is being snap he dropped in coverage wailing continue down field with his route and he should have broke it off that's what luck wanting to do this time left lined up to the right they have thrown off this and they have run they're going to run Gaffney Gaffney for a first down mentally flag comes alive holding on the offense number 10 and your penalty in the front of the foul remains second down where was the ball spotted Lane Kiffin is out on the field right now the ball is being put in play on this what's in underneath to Montgomery Montgomery battling chorus at the 14 yard line I think you're right Lane Kiffin very upset about where they spotted at that football after the holding call but meanwhile the freshman out of Dallas Texas time of gum Rican tin use to be a receiver that Andrew Luck is looking up here in the second half and making plays six to 205 pounds first out for the 14 yard line tailored to the 10 yard line actually they're going to spot it at the 11 they live with another stop here tonight Bailey has been active just giving everything that he has and he's actually down now remember undersized former safety 200 pounds and they're taking on those linemen and also the back back to running hard and as a result a freshman frame at number 13 was check did you see him moving now he is coming on the outside look lots got 101 touchdown I believe yes it is indeed toy Lolo number 11 and right away they throw against that freshman linebacker who had come into the game could call Brent into a low low is six eight let me say that again he's had tied in like a power forward it's six eight 262 pounds welcome to the game true freshman trey Madden first play he's in the game Andrew Luck and David Shaw pep Hamilton dial him up and go after him and the big man come down with a catch this will be our last kick of the evening pulled up badly left got it and now they have to go for two after every touchdown sellout crowd here in the Coliseum most of them still with us as we're tied at 48 and headed for our third overtime with a couple of cardinal streaks on the line here 15 consecutive wins that's school record six straight on the road and that's the most century early night it so now it will be Stanford going first in the third overtime para taillight 20 and he is out of bounds at about the 17 yard line second down and two playaction throw in underneath so the first down and it is Brian Hewitt a penalty flag on the hit the late hit and he also hit him high definitely a personal foul here after the play personal foul a hit number 29 on the defense half the distance to the goal first down this is Starling who was one of the heroes of the win over Notre Dame in South Bend a week ago he hits him lately also hits him hot and it's just a nono and we're in overtime now the third overtime these kidney these players are being tested in more ways more ways than one here mental and physical fatigue setting in let's ease back to the front touchdown and now they must go for two Taylor first across and I think whoever you made a point that we are really seeing now there is real petite guy no question about a part of both of these teams and when you see fatigue the defense and their ability to tackle and reading their keys that starts to slip the advantage can go to the offense there's not a lot of emotion in this Coliseum right now which is also affecting the FSC defense make it's the middle of fakes here the last few series and Gaffney checks into the backfield a third time out and you're looking at a team that hasn't tried a twopoint conversion all season Stanford casting motions out of the backfield for Andrew Luck so Zack wide open got it 56:48 Coby Fleener with the twopoint conversion and that was a beautifully designed play cleaner was all alone and luck knew he was going to be there and Brent guess who he went after again he looked off to his right but here's the true freshman and here's one of the best tight ends in the pac12 watch him look off to the right watch cleaner throw the freshman Madden away there's nobody there to pick him up second time they've tried to go after the young linebacker that has not played at all tonight until Deon Bailey had to check out of the game there's that that knowledge of Andrew Luck knows were to find the mismatch in the it's going to give him an advantage in the passing game now the Trojans need the touchdown and the twopoint conversion to force it to a fourth overtime Berkeley fires woods kind of cross died to the is on that bleep marquees leave the freshmen what a great effort by Lee Marquis Lee and Robert would just continue to show what they have in their athletic ability he steps out of bounds but Fred he came across the middle the ball was thrown accurately it's like he stepped out of bounds on the board in it yeah he looked like he got a bounds at the four got a touchdown pass earlier tonight on the game seven for 94 yards in one score he Barkley has time to throw comes across and this is this is what the coaches love about it doesn't give up on the play it's able to get away from Michael Thomas of senior safety almost comes up with a touchdown and from the top the screen to the far right of Barkley mark Barkley shows good patience there there's the special athletic ability from Lee who's up and off the field so Lee will be out for this play at woods number two comes to the bottom where he's got a corner on it out there it is first and goal for the Trojans who are down E real football Cardinals win it the win streak continues a dramatic night comes to it devastating in for USC fumble into the end zone recovered by the Cardinals let's go down on the field here's Erin Andrews well first of all I know you want to talk about your teammates talk about the effort right there to recover the ball in the end zone unbelievable there's characteristics of this game you know don't start never quick so proud of you're part of this team unbelievable Andrew after you threw the interception and regulation I saw your expression over on the sidelines you got upset but how did you calm down I realized no we stopped timeless no time to atone for your mistakes I was very grateful for that all right Brett when we're guys trust Ameer I believe me able to go back out there and score what did you learn about yourself in the final drive to tie it and then going into three overtime I don't know if I run it I'm glad we have and I don't over it'll be a learning experience down the road I was just relieved to score finally you told your team when you ESPE took the lead to begin with we need this adversity what did your team prove against their toughest I'm thinking no I think obviously you have two great team and what an unbelievable upon us to go against but uh there's tough times during the season still glad 14 for sticking it through for some believable so happy well Harvey another dramatic Saturday night just amazing and you could see the emotion right there on the face of Andrew Luck and even in his voice talking to Aaron they found a way to win it's not always going to be pretty when you have specialty things but they put it together and got it done so what a great week if you're a st. Louis Cardinal or a Stanford Cardinal that's the loop you come up a big winner remains unbeaten thanks for watching ESPN on ABC
