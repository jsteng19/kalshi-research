============================================================

seven a powerful experiment that could change the world I believe next Oprah now time for the first half music highlights presented by Sprint featuring a special performance by u2 see the complete premier of u2's performance at espn.com search Rosebowl video lowscoring first half with Bob Davie and Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger back at the Rose Bowl game presented by City Bob what surprised you the most in this game what surprised me the most zero penalties only one turnover in the tackling has been outstanding three things that you normally worry about in a bowl game because of the land long layup that this shows me there's two focused football teams out here even though there's not a lot of points in this game yeah and I know you're a defensive guy and I love to see good defense and if you missed the first half this was not sloppy offense and for a three to three halftime score this was outstanding defense on both sides of the ball and I'm a quarterback in this game promise senior offensive lineman I'm gonna get right into the face of my offensive linemen and challenged them because both offensive lines were completely dominated in the first half whoever comes down to second half better prepared on the offensive line is gonna win this game Home Depot coaching adjustments and let's start with Michigan card it goes back to the point about being able to establish the running game Michigan cannot win a football game without having the ability to run the football to set up the pass and a bumpy Carroll I throw the football in the second half we tried to run it in the first half Michigan number one and in the country Rudy's got his confidence back the past protections been pretty good we are a past first team let's throw the football if I'm SC John David booty 10 of 16 in the first half for 102 yards no touchdowns obviously with no interceptions and he will handle the ball to start the second half Chad Henne on the other side was 8 of 12 85 yards and no interceptions either just that one turnover was a fumble by USC and so Garrett Revis with the ball on the tee the stunning starting to sit here in Pasadena and this will come out on the 20 yard line for John David so our first half stats here Kirk and they look this way Wow the thing that stands out of course is at the bottom here where you see five sacks for the University of Southern California and if you think about that you'd think boy what a great advantage they must be winning this game but because the way Michigan's defense has played coach no penalties for either team we've got a tight ballgame and that's the great news for Michigan it's only three three they're a run first team Kirk so they don't have to abandon what they do best run the football even though they're struggling right now on offense they open with Jarrett in the slide Patrick Turner is a with Steve Smith so three wide for the Trojans and they will put it up on first down Smith coming through the formation he's going out of bounds on the 29 yard line Willis behringer the safety so the impact players for the Trojans their big three there we gave you John David's numbers CJ he has been held down only 17 rushing yards but he'll get more yards six catches already for 58 yards now a second down and short but just did you suggest it Bob they put it up on first down remember Michigan gave up 316 yards passing and four touchdowns the old football gable is the tailback trying to get the first down and Michigan defense very stout Prescott Burgess number six is in there short of the first down and now the Trojans will face a third down they have used as a fullback Alan Bradford the freshman from San Bernardino he goes off to the side now it's amazing USC had gone 63 straight games scoring more than 20 points prior to the UCLA game in sport man here they are stuck on three but against that break the offensive tail Mike burning ham in it I'm in they threw toys but he is lined up in a power fullback formation here you'll lead the way for gay ball and the Wolverines jump the play at the point of attack Terrence Taylor gets there first number 67 the sophomore from Muskegon so much talk about Allan branch and Lamar Woodley Terrence Taylor often as a sophomore goes unrecognized boy deck punch it in breasted fair catch signal at the 31 yard line and so there Chad Henne and the Wolverines will have their first series of the second half the Rose Bowl game presented by city tied at three of Mike Hart averaging just a little over two yards of carry he is in a deep set you can see behind Chad Henne they're gonna try them right away a little bit of a gash his longest run of the game was the opening offensive play ellis making the stop we look at the Wolverines we gave you hinnies passing stats there you can see my card nine carries for 21 Mariel Manningham with only two catches Kirk for 30 yards talk about my heart at Michigan having to establish the run here in this second half he's the sparkplug he's the emotional leader I'm sure he is challenging that offensive line to step up and help him out in this offense out Manningham's off to the left they're gonna run hard again got the first down so it looks like they picked up the tempo a little bit but they're running more to the right side Bob they favored the left side to that first half well the other thing Brent my cards one of those guys the more you give him the ball even though he's small the better he gets but four times this year he's had over 30 carries don't put it on his background his second half and it was one of the first times we've seen since maybe the opening drive the offensive line getting a good push and getting up to the linebackers there and giving my card some room to run Harrington and Gregg Matthews are the whiteouts Matthews is off to hennas right they're gonna keep it on the ground you know you always talk about in the sonne blocking scheme that the running back has to be patient I also think the play caller has to be patient there's times when we're gonna take the zone away take the zone away but then all of a sudden somebody's going to break down on gap control for the defense Kirk and there's your big run so not only the running back down the play caller has to be patient as well and one of the adjustments we've seen here from Michigan early from Mike the board is trying to mix in two tight ends and going with Mike Hart back there by himself needing eight yards on a play fake under pressure wanted the screen throws a pick the USC ball at the 39 yard line is Lawrence Jackson the defensive end blows up the screen attempt both outside linebackers Keith rivers and down the starts from the outside to see Chad Henne on the little playaction here comes sucks and he panics and close the football the number 96 Lauren Jackson cooked but again the pressure with the double outside linebacker blitz pretty good feel there that time by Jackson as a defensive lineman to read the quarterbacks eyes and realize he had his head on a swivel looking for a backhand the ball just happened to hit him right in the chest it is possible but it was emphasized at hitting during halftime that he had to get rid of the ball he rushed that one a little bit first down and 10 now for John David booty up a play fake completes it to Smith takes up about six yards on that Morgan Trent the defender for the Wolverines in the last time Bob that the Trojans stocked the endzone they turned it over on a function exactly and go back to that previous turnover by Michigan Michigan leads the country in the fewest number of turnovers with only 10 and 12 games so a great opportunity right here for USC Chris Graham comes onto the field defensively Allan Bradford is the Trojans play fake booty rolls hard to the right throws in underneath and picks up the first down with Bradford catching his first pass of the game so the young man we heard about today from Pete Carroll he said he liked how he's practiced he's a redshirt freshman from San Bernadino and they are coming out doing exactly what Coach you and I talked about at halftime and you said here start in the second half is Hale you leave the running game with the exception of from time to time sprinkling it in to let Michigan know you have that ability to do it you put the ball into the hands to your quarterback and you mix the play calling up try to move the launch point around which they've done a very good job of a moving booty around here to start this second half straight back slurs to the big man first and goal Dwayne Jarrett at the two yardline John David booty delivers a strike 25yard and what is really tough about that John David booty rolled away and a great little hidden faith by going Jarrett to get inside Morgan friend Dwayne Jared sets this up perfectly in the timing Budi anticipates that in throws the ball why jared is actually in his country play stopped on the field as you know every play upstairs is a review of previous play is under review so they'll take a look at it make sure that sure it had possession it's certainly from the naked eye although we certainly didn't have a look at the front of the of the reception so let's let's take another look at it that is once the contact comes over safety doing a nice job of separating Jared from the ball it's a matter of whether or not his knee is down before the ball comes out I thought his right knee was down but I'm certainly not the decision maker of this process there was no question the ball was loose but then the whistle blows down there too so let's let's not forget that exactly because the whistle blew nobody recovered the football I think he'll be down right there I think they're gonna rule that knee was down and then the football came out you'll see it was the ball was loose in there I mean it was there there there's no question jack children's the ACC referee has got it and it looks like Lloyd didn't like the 1st and goal from the 2 yard line puts girl talking to Dwayne care to go back on a story we covered the first half this well could be Duane carrots last a game there's a pretty good wide receiver down at Georgia Tech by the name of Johnson who had a huge huge game in on many lists he would figure to be number one these youngsters have to way if we stay another year wool might be be next here comes John David booty wide open touchdown nothing doing as McCoy McCoy Chris McCoy rose wide open for the touchdown breakdown in coverage that time and John David booties first touchdown pass in his last six quarters so just take advantage of the Michigan turnover Janelle slips it inside the post so the afternoons first touchdown boosts the Trojans to a seven point lead 10 3 8 43 remaining in the third quarter downtown Pasadena and we're at the Rose Bowl with USC leading ten three John David booty first touchdown of the game on a pass on busted coverage let's see what Rustin can do if he handles it Beeler with the ball on the tee he's handled the kickoff duties today for USC high and short here comes Preston from the 12 short of the 20 yard line the men discoveries let's go back to the score and this play action on the touchdown is really difficult to defend for this defensive back right here playing mantoman coverage he gets action right at him the Chris McVoy runs alway from him and that's stealing right there throw and catch McCoy getting away from the defender into play side defenders I think were consumed with Fred Davis too tied in who was right in front of them they all collapsed up front making the easy trail McCoy in the back of the end zone trailing for the second time this afternoon shed any change you that the line running apart and there was mama looka as we checked them with Bonnie Bernstein Bonnie from michigan defensive coordinator ron english up in arms after the bus play on the touchdown that was example a of what it has driven him crazy the entire season he said we have veterans in the secondary yet they haven't paid heed to the analogy that if you touch the hot stove once you don't go back to the hot stove you're supposed to follow your guy play forward execute follow the goals we sent the beginning of the season he doesn't have an explanation for what happened for Michigan's pass defense all year second down and eight coming up for Henny and incidentally Dallas sarch number 42 is back on the field in this most of the second quarter here's part and he's been taken down by Keats rivers the junior from Lake Mary Florida he's a youngster who got away from the Gators it was between Florida and USC he told us that he opted to come West and Keith rivers told us he went back home to Orlando Florida over the Christmas break took a lot of grief from the Gator fans but that time again one thing the same play usually does on blocking that takes away penetration and that time he will just shot the depo those linebackers are flying downhill right now to michael hart before he even has his hands on the ball third and seven any of the Wolverines need to get beyond the 30 in trouble under pressure and could have been picked off that was Thomas had a shot at it man am the intended target any under enormous pressure this is starting to remind me the USC UCLA game that you guys did about a month ago but on the other side this is the opposite because both defense events lawrence jackson and cow more almost forced that thing into an interception right there nice blitz again mixing up the looks confusing the offensive line is exactly what d carol wants to do now mishko early on in this game he was under enormous pressure where's Reid forty illegal block was strong that is the first penalty of this Rose Bowl game and it game was 626 remaining in the third quarter Grenn I think they were gonna get Mike Brittingham it's our guy the fullback who made an impact catching the football on an illegal block in the back right there during the return number 30 block in the back by the offensive team at the 10yard penalty first down we mentioned the first penalty that game a pretty obvious one right there with the block in the back so the Trojans will come up after the penalty they'll have the ball on their own 30 yard line Chad Henne has been under enormous pressure that's the highlight of the game the Rose Bowl game presented by City the sun's starting to set on the Grandaddy 2007 we're aware there's a time throw first down at 10:00 now for the Trojans they lead it by a touchdown and they have done it Jarret juggles that one incomplete they have done it the way Bob Davie suggested that they do it they've gone airborne in the second half they have thrown on first and ten every single time here on the second half and relying now on John David booty his group of wide receivers that was the advantage coming into the game if booty would have time to throw with his offensive line they felt that they could attack the Michigan secondary and that's what they're doing here in this second hand it's like we've got a timeout call by the Trojans and John David will go over to Pete Carroll's sideline to talk about it now here is the interception which led to the television or to the touchdown yeah this is exactly how Chad Henne did not want to start the second half maybe forcing it there getting rid of the ball in early and it's setting up this easy troll for John David booty after recruited the SC office live right down the field with his arm but again it's all generated from the pressure that interception was a direct byproduct of the pressure that Pete Carroll has continued to bring on this Michigan offense and you know one thing if you're Michigan's offense might talk to Lloyd far about this yesterday when you commit to the zone running game I only have two running question inside zone in an outside Sun and the fear is when someone takes that away what do you do if you don't have it counted you don't have a lot of misdirection plays and right now USC has been able to take that zone running play away and unleash a lot of smiles over there on the USC sideline that's right Brendan was that play that's when this USC sideline came alive players it had been pretty quiet down here until that point after that defensive interception and the leading to the touchdown players no longing no longer just standing on the sidelines they are waving their arms jumping up and down on every play tight end coach Brendan Carroll even jumped up on the bench turned to the crowd waved his arms and said wake up to quietly here Brett well the Wolverines you have lost three straight bowl games of the ROI car are down ten three right now the defense on the field and you can doze our second penalty folks you can book it that's a pretty good penalty getting that 315 pounds moving in one direction that's a number 67 contact fiveyard penalty down Michigan is without a sack we've talked a lot about the USC five sacks of the first half for 30 their yards and losses this very good Wolverine defenses without a sack of John David booty they have moved the pocket with John David a little bit but he has played very well his release has been quick his to protect second down and five of the Trojans there's a play fake booty rolling again throwing in underneath picking up Davis for another first out and there is no question Bob but that John David booty is more agile today than he was earlier coming down the stretch against UCLA and no today there is no questioning that's the adjustment USC has made again if you don't blitz against this playaction pass those kind of crossing routes you see Fred Davis right there they're virtually unstoppable against zone coverage with no pressure I think a lot of people wondered how USC would be able to slow down miss suit Michigan's pass rush after the UCLA game and as we've talked about it's it's the snap count it's chipping on the defensive ends it's moving booty around it's a bunch of different things that have added up to a lot under pressure hit on the release incomplete booty standin tall in the pocket that'll be noted by the coaches they and teammates appreciate admire toughness when you know the heats coming then you stand here like that you're gonna take a lickin against Shawn flavor and the outside linebackers the top of Fred Davis they kept the tight in instruct mentioned he just couldn't block Shawn Craven and fortunate Luke booty was an injured right there because he was in a vulnerable position Tevatron English is going to start to turn up the heat himself by bringing those linebackers more and more they've had a lot of success when they have block number two the short drop Smith on the snap runs us for size five breaks free 35 30 brought down from behind at the 21yard line Leon Hall the senior calls him down and it really reminds me right now of the Ohio State game the quick pass missed tackles by the Michigan secondary this is exactly what got him in trouble against Ohio State the goal of the game for Steve Sarkisian and Lane Kiffin was to isolate two safeties and the corners put them in space utilized the speed of Steve Smith and Dwayne Jarrett and forced those Michigan defensive backs to have to tackle first down and ten now it's booties turn to change it up Washington's his runny back on the slant touchdown USC Jerry there's a memo to Keshawn that'll work and how about the check by John David 30 missionary straight man to man who just went to the slam bow and go ancient with the big body just outmuscled Morgan front to the outside and a great flow to the inside away from the defender and that's a mismatch the lane Jarrett against Morgan Trent you will take that as a quarterback every single time and all of a sudden guys John David booty is in rhythm getting back and getting rid of the ball on on time hello mrs. this went off to the right sixteen three on the missed extra point so here is Jarrett breaking free eight catches a hundred and five yards and now on touchdown Pete Carroll the Trojans are dominating suddenly so the Trojan sideline all smiles they have scored touchdowns on their last two possessions they have taken a 163 lead as there was a missed extra point in that maybe the forward pass turned it around well there's no question USC is a pass first team and John David booty is in his comfort zone right now 10 passes and only 2 runs so here comes crusted Wolverines need something good to happen right here he votes to the 21 and bread let's take a look at what John boutté John David booty saw at the line of scrimmage is a pretty easy read he sees Morgan Trent 1dp right here the next DB is clear over here so that means he has all this area to work with with no defensive back and once he recognized his head and mates to check it's just a matter of the best receiver in the country are one of the best receivers in the country getting physical and just being just a lot stronger than boring a training a great position to the inside is that this should have been a penalty right there with that little plane away jump shot like the New York Johnstone right the old already started about three the old already started about three weeks ago check any reaches now to my car like on the left side to the 25yard line and Lawrence Jackson who made that big interception just prior to their first touchdown here's Ron English now trying to keep the troops fired up trying to keep keep their heads in the game we saw this Fishkin team in Columbus down 28 to 14 we we saw a lot of enthusiasm when they came back into the game he's talking about his jump shots around side we saw a lot of enthusiasm in Columbus when they fought back right now we're not seeing any enthusiasm they need to play to spark them second and sixth any sees the Blitz are coming steps away from the pressure drops it in underneath and Manningham to the 41yard line and a first in ten before thomas turns him upside down when the few times USC doesn't bring pressure and you actually see the quarterback Chad Henne coach but sometime to throw the football exactly and what bought him even more time he stepped up again and you see Mario Manningham on the crossing round right there good lick right there by Terrell Thomas who's came into this game with really a separated shoulder he did that in the face of a safety blitz from Kevin Ellis and he saw the Ellefson coming all the way and Ellison was picked up by Rueben Reilly who did a great job of picking up the Blitz him down and ten now for the Wolverines there's a quick swipe over to the side a couple couple yards but not much as keith rivers is over there with Carey Harris the corner and Manningham quickly escorted by one of the side judge could officiating over there and I go back to this the experience of Chad Henne 37 start could come out as a junior and now authorities coming back to Michigan a lot of players would panic I don't think Chad in he's gonna panic because that Michigan still has a legitimate shot to get back to me and win this football if the offensive line don't help him he has a shot rusted and man I lose it or run it right Arrington's down there tumble on the side jumping it over the top sa recovered it no question at the 31 Jack Childress is right there Brian Cushing his third sack of the game forces the fumble Brian Cushing let's try to find it becomes on an inside with stunts right during youth inside from his defensive end position he ends up beating Adam Krause number 57 you Jackson Lawrence Jackson who made the interception recovers the fumble and Carol and the Trojans sideline explode this is on its way to being a Pete Carroll clinic film he's going to be able to use that when people come in during spring ball to talk about his blitz teams this is exactly how he envisioned this football game going with his defense against his Michigan offense first and 10 and Pete Carroll telling us the other day he's about to bring in what he thinks is his best recruiting class ever as John David booty throws a strike almost onehanded by Jarrod had the left mid on it over let him just a little bit Jarrett had broken free at the end and John David knows it just a few inches difference and that would have been another six they had exactly what they wanted right there a little outside moving in stem back inside and he beats the safety Willis behringer and even when he doesn't catch it it kind of looks spectacular done well behringer block on to the post quarter to the outside making it so easy and well that's one you typically would see booty and Jared connect on now second and ten for John David tops it off in a flighty overthrows and was it a lateral there's a youngster reacting well to that as Gable went after the ball case it was thrown behind him and it would have been a free football all the violence on that side second half talk about bowl games and intersectional matchups pac10 Big Ten first half not so much but second half we're seeing a lot of speed from USC against the Michigan defense in an offensive just cannot stay on the field with the USCT right now ten complete short of the first down marker comes to Fred Davis his junior tied in from Toledo Ohio nothing that Harrison makes this time one guy we need to talk about today is Powell Williams number 78 the offensive tackle I mean this guy had three false starts against UCLA he was crucified in this city for his performance he left the team for one day came back it's good to see him playing well and bouncing back I'm gonna go for it fourth down empty the backfield to have five targets for John David and strike me the main coverage across the board it keeps it himself so John David booty takes it right straight ahead for the first down though you were talking about about the tackle the right tackle Kyle Williams over there let me see where exactly well he got the spot did he not get it Lamar Woodley gets credit for that for that stop and you were talking about the tackle by VIN Kyle and of both the Sam Baker they were both criticized for their performance against UCLA they've held up very well there's there's Kyle Hebert 78 here comes here comes this measurement and I may have missed called this nope first the little guys that was what pure they felt the pressure from the outside and what a gutsy call here on fourth down you're gonna rely on booty try too little unorthodox way of picking up a first down but the pressure first down and ten never thought he was gonna you telling me he's not going that that's what he's telling everybody and play fake in trouble and incomplete so it'll be saying that that folks oughta go back to practice a couple of days ago we were if we were out of crisis that man right there is the first head coach I have ever seen come down the field on kickoff coverage now they were they weren't full pads so don't be misled but they had about fourteen guys coming down there his coach Carol running down on every kickoff he was trying to strip the ball and yes he was blocked a little bit by one player later then afterwards he got into a passing drill he always had an injured shoulder this year but he was snapping off stripes it is really different when you go to a Pete Carroll post practice and he really enjoys this completely do it it's actually genuine absolutely I've been to a lot of his practices and he's the only coach in America that has a loose practice on especially the day before the game but at the same time they're getting stuff done they're moving around but the fact that it's genuine the enthusiasm from him even right now on the sidelines that is who he is and that's why I think he is a perfect fit in college football he gave me a great answer I said how long did it take for the pain of the UCLA loss to go away he said you know within two or three days I was back to work but he said part of me will never forget and that's the way it should be when you lose one like that third down and ten John David firing middle strike to the 9 yard line at a first down that is Smith's so Steve Smith now he's a senior and he'll be interesting to watch because he'll get a chance in the national football played too and we talked about Cowell Williams 78 right there you see John David booty step up and deliver the football something against UCLA he didn't do stepped up then panic right there because Martin Lamar Woodley was coming around the corner and a thing that I see that Steve Sarkisian Lane Kiffin are having John David booty do attacked the middle of that Michigan defense right behind the linebackers between the safeties terrific performance for John Daly empty again and incomplete going to Jared it'll be second down and going you know we were around the football complex you got the feeling that Mark Sanchez everybody talks about the backup quarterback the coaches included how much talent Mark Sanchez has I had the feeling coming in this game John David booty really did need to play outstanding when Mark Sanchez might be in this football game well I'll tell you one thing Sanchez will have a chance there he is number 6 to win the job regardless of what happens today t Carroll told us everything is wide open when he comes to spring practice and with his talented freshman class he said every job will be up for grabs including the quarterback no matter what happens throws incomplete twice tried to go to Jarrett brandon harrison was there on number eight and young talented wide receiver from new jersey New Brunswick New Jersey he says that about his quarterback and if he wins this game replacing mat liner with all the offense that they lost and he finishes with 11 wins and probably close to a topfive finish he might say that to try to light a fire to keep him motivated with Mark Sanchez but it would be tough to take John David booty after all that game experience from this year out of that lineup for the old 7 season so here's a 3rd and gold out for the program and they're gonna call the timeout so they'll use up the second one with 58 seconds remaining in the third quarter we look down on our scene here in Pasadena this aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear tires featuring triple tread technology well we've talked a lot about USC and we should mention again what we said at the top of the broadcast that was our opinion that whoever won this game won this game will enter next season as the preseason number one for a couple of reasons both have star players coming back next year and both have solid recruiting classes coming along so for those reasons we would tout the winner of this and let's let's take a look now here are the players returning next season take a look at the list here you see the two question marks at the bottom Wayne Jarrett now I'm Brian Shaw coach what's your feeling about these lists well first of all I don't think I've ever seen this many talented players and announced that they're coming back to me that tells me about the chemistry of both of these football teams and that's why whoever wins this game in my opinion will be the number one ranked team next season because players don't come back if the chemistry's not right on the football team well the thing about USC is say it's such a young football team I mean that was sorts of one of the few seniors involved in his team so they're going to all be back and Michigan had so many of their guys as coach talked about deciding to come back and that does affect things both these teams regardless of the outcome of this game are going to be in the top five but the winner will be the preseason number one team third down there could be a little bit different kind of pressure up in Michigan though if they lose it we're gonna talk about this in the fourth quarter third down and goal John David dirty with the backfield empty touchdown wave it off thought he had it for a second I thought Jarrett was going to grab it they wave it off so it is fourth down and they sent the field goal unit on the face coach attacking the middle of the defense where there is just huge voids in the Michigan secondary tell you what the Willis behringer made a great play right there and jarred that football David Harris coming in really got the football out but you're right card the middle of that field is there open right there how about David Harris that's not gonna play for Lambeau that is great fun that's what it'll be like when he plays Sunday football sounds like we're reviewing this yeah I think that again on the college review play there's not a challenge they're just reviewing the play you can take a look as he goes up in the air grabbed it there's a good look at it right here yeah incomplete officials very quick today on the reduce you know they appreciate that okay Dave Perry made an excellent point indisputable evidence is the key well if it's indisputable they should be able to make the decision that quick because that is indisputable evidence whatever reason it's been a challenge throughout the oh six season but today it's been outstanding so here's did Nello's field goal attend memory just missed an extra point this is a 26 yarder stitches in true 19:3 roaches leading four to forty eight seconds left in Pasadena for the Wolverines who came in here with a threegame Bowl losing streak and reminder down on Wednesday it's one of the hottest on comedies of the season everyone needs a little life support in case of emergency from the ABC Wednesday at 9:30 8:30 Central Time now I want to go back to the point we're making about Lloyd Carr in Michigan what's different about his loss that if Pete Carroll had been on the other I know we still got a quarter in place we don't count him out but remember doubt they have lost those three straight games to their archrival Troy Smith so we're closing out three straight years but backtoback losses and that is what got John Cooper in Columbus don't forget there is heavy heavy heat when you lose to your archrival and then you go into the bowl game and also lose that's gonna be media pressure and I'm saying there's gonna be any heat within the administration Bill Martin is very very loyal to Lloyd Carr loves what he's done he's accomplished so much and I'm trying to start anything but I do know that the media and the people on the websites and the bloggers they're going to come after the coach did they all get one step put away for the year after coming into this season all we heard about was that Lloyd Carr possibly could get replaced and all of a sudden he had a year it was very magical until they came up a little bit short in Columbus I thought we put the bloggers away for a year worried about the bloggers but I'll tell you this when you lose your last two football games of the year the only way to get over a tough loss is to win a game you have to wait an awful long time to play again if you're Lloyd Carr now remember now Kirk you said you thought you put him away that was 2006 I turned the couch he'll be out there on the on the 20 yard line and remind at the beginning tomorrow you can download all the action from today's game on iTunes say what Pete Carroll's probably drawn the Blitz is up on the sidelines now because Michigan's difficult point where they have to obviously throw the football trailing by 16 many roles out he comes underneath to is tied in we've washed it out about after a couple yard gain Tyler occurs hit by these rivers Keith rivers the junior from Lake Merritt floor had been very active here for the Trojans no I don't know if you're necessarily surprised that USC's defense is playing well and it didn't get Pete Carroll telling us all year this is the fastest defense that he's had what I'm surprised by is the way they've taken the light completely away from Michigan's team I mean you look at his sidelines these last couple quarters there's just a bunch of maize and blue standing around waiting for their assignment on the other side of the field there's a lot of excitement that we've seen in the second half well what happens when you make a living running the football like Michigan and you're able to take that away you take away their heart now they've survived all year with that zone running game Michigan here's second down and seven for the Wolverine Preston for a first down to the 35 yard line and rivers again number 55 and that's a famous number isn't it here at USC some great great players jr. say out more that number and a lot of folks believe the jr. sale is one of the greatest college linebackers of all time you're pretty good they then fell to couple they go first down at 10 any nine more yards and pushed out of bounds by Harris I'll tell you what they Chad Henne can throw that deep out about as good as anyone now and he rifled and thrown there in predictable playcalling mode right now because they have to throw but I think that's where Chad Henne a lot of times we've seen where he can get into his own rhythm sometimes and even a better rhythm when he gets back there gets his feet set and gets rid of the football then at times where he is struggling with a little bit of a desperation mode they were able to make some plays second down in nice lip steps away run for the first down he slides into it and takes a look from Cushing one quarter to go for Chad Henne and Michigan trailing by 16 at the Rose Bowl game presented by City returns after this message and a word of our ABC stations quarter of a USC lead here nineteen three they struck first Michigan tied at three they went to the intermission deadlocked at that but here in the second half USC has taken over Mike Hart has been held 242 yards and now basically he's a blocker for hynny and again into the hands of Tyler Acker and he is surrounded and leading defended there was Dallas arts so with Hart being held a 42 yards you can say that the Trojan defense has taken away vish against heart and hearts where that 37 games starting in the career of Chad Henne comes into play working and no huddle offense with so much time still to go short of the first down has been tough for the little man today Cedric Ellis the junior is right there and he's another of those talented Trojans coming back next year he's a junior at defensive front sophomore sophomore junior junior they are stopping Mike Clark today because they're getting penetration with the defensive line Brent and also just completely running downhill with those linebackers on third and 2 wide open vector for the first and 10 battles his way to the 23 yard line there is a penalty flag of a whole lot thrown back around the 49yard line people are going to get Dallas sart's going up high a little bit and late on Chad Henne a very well officiated game by this ACC crew no question about that game very late Brent it's a good call but the line doing a good enough job that time to fajn it to get allow Chad Henne to find the open receiver Dallas starts coming very very close to getting in there on time but it's definitely a late hit you really do see the ability though of Chad Henne in the comeback ability at this Michigan football team in zone hanging on touchdown Darington finally they get the ball into Arrington's hands and it's for a touchdown I believe they'll go 42 here the signal from the sidelines they're gonna go for two down 16 Lloyd didn't hesitate the Blitz in oneonone coverage from the outside Arrington and Terrell Tom is pretty good coverage but a seed thrown by Chad Henne to the inside to give his receiver the chance to make to catch start Arrington emotion it's hard bus the first taco it's a chess game we check to that one because of the love this is what Michigan needed to spark themselves to get back into the game Chad Henne leads him right down the field making some big throws and they get the twopoint conversion from Michael Hart back to within one score here in the fourth quarter another look this is what Michigan needed you have Chad Henne we talked about how he's been rhythm when he seems to be in a little bit of a rush desperation mode and a great throw that time to Arrington with Chad Henne and Michael Hart you knew Michigan was not going to go away that was a great run right there for the touchdown for the twopoint conversion excuse me Chad Henne six of six on that drive for 62 yards and of course two touchdown table and Reed are back deep Latifa leave us here we go there's hood pulling him down at the 26 we check in with Bonnie right you guys were right when you said that touchdown jumpstarted Chad and many in fact he was just telling me this week these prescient pressure situations are what he thrives on he says I love having that on my shoulders like I have to lead my team to victory and he reference back to week three against Notre Dame he said up until that point we didn't show that we had a passing game another day was number two we had a threegame losing streak up in South Bend and in that first half frame you might remember he hooked up with Mary oh and man for three touchdowns right now this is Chinese yeah exactly about in right now John David booty will try to keep the trains moving just right at the chain with that strike to Jarrett looks like he could have been about a half yards short because you made an interesting point earlier about SC has a lead but they're not it'll have the ability to run the ball against Michigan do they continue to check with the eightpoint lead into the fourth quarter they continue to throw against this Michigan defense where they have the advantage or they eventually try to have to work some block by trying to do something they're not comfortable with Roenick knowing Pete pills personality he is going to keep attacking and deep down he knows he really cannot run the football against Michigan and a volley in at fullback play fake booty as he was going out of bounds throws it downfield and that's incomplete Fred Davis was the intended target he goes out of bounds on that far side so now it be third down and short coming up here for the Trojans the reason I ask you that coaches I know you're a conservative guy by nature so this is going to be painful for you to watch because as good as John David booty is you're one interception away or one mistake away polettis Michigan getting the wrong warm conservative me one did it once earlier and now he comes back with the first down right straight ahead behind Brian Khalil a little bit of an undersized but a very talented senior senator from Corona California region I think you're a conservative guys any time this year we've had fourth and short I'm up here saying go for it go for it you're up here saying I'll tell you this guy right here I mean he is consistent with his philosophy he's gonna keep throwing this football you can count on that first and 10 play fake gable underneath and Eris said nowhere to go David Harris their leading tackler their senior from Grand Rapids wraps up another one it's always amazing to see how I touch down for your own offense can affect the momentum in the play of your own defense even OSC still having some success at least the energy from up here looks to be very different from this Michigan defense in the way they're attacking us see here we'll see if it pays off for them or if it ends up allowing SC to make a big play second and ten deflected incomplete and now at his third and tenth and you know it was hit that time by Sean Crabill who deflected it in India no Kirk what pleases Pete Carroll the most not about that but she could have play but but the whole scene here this afternoon but pleases him the most for Pete Carroll is as he looks across the sideline he doesn't see one bench young very good point third ten first time the Michigan crowd has come alive Glee deep to the footrace my end zone ten five score 62 yards on a third down now you're hearing the USC crowd because the Michigan crowd has been silenced John David booty on 3rd in law he comes up with a great throw mitchen SCO get penalized for excessive celebration but the touchdown will count I'm not sure about Mia we might have had a late hit I behringer a ninja let's okay let's lick this yes there's a personal foul was dropped down I just saw the point watch Jarrett he's taunting him a little bit now you know well we get to take another another look at it but this is going to be a personal foul against Michigan that's what's going to be and I think the gonna let make a decision here and he to say on the kickoff yeah we got it so Jack's got he's all over that's good officiating right there I hate it but it'd take too much time personal foul remember nineteen of the defense and you know the amazing thing about that play they have him bracketed to doubleteam you see Willis behringer right there on the lay hid but they committed to guys in bracket coverage on Duane jerk and how about Keyshawn Johnson's opinion now I think we have seen the last of our young man Daryl Jerrod in college football game for them pointed tips they told that this one over the left he's mr. Sackett London it has missed a couple of extra points one to the right and one to the left it was like you tried to the golf ball tried a guy dead thing share it to the end zone on third and 10 62 yards Pete Carroll going down the sideline the fullsize Nissan Titan the proud sponsor of the BCS and tough guys everywhere I'm here to talk about the Sprint network assisting me is Henry Altmann attorney sprint has the largest voice calling area and the largest mobile broadband network no one has a more powerful network it even protects us from meteors well that's the word on the street switch to the Sprint power network by one katana get one free sprint power up while you only get the fluency as I have a higher education honors classes Bobby back I'm gonna touch him now would be a good time to have accident forgiveness I'm still gonna touch it out of all state your choice auto insurance are you in good hands exclusive coverage of the Rose Bowl game presented by Citi brought to you by Citi it's easier to get the rewards you want the BCS presented by the Nissan Titan sprint sprint powerup and Allstate are you in good hands because the penalty kicking off from mid field this would almost a souvenir but now Jared 10 catches 176 yards this is second touchdown well its third and tenth so you know that USC wants to try to get the ball to Dewayne Jarrett but look at the two michigan defenders there's a little bit of confusion they are both responsible as coach says it's a bracket defense the safety is this is the mistake that's made is by the safety Willis behringer I think there is indecision there and thinking that Leon Hall had him covered connecting huge and led to the big touch length I've seen so many times we play in and out garbage you get clever you think you have two on one no one is sure who hasn't but he splits you right down the middle 25 to 11 back on a 14 USC's missed two extra points and now it is second down and 10 after the deflection Knutson an amazing third down and 10 play that just took Michigan out of this football game I was going to say 3rd and 10 with Michigan making the touchdown converting on the twopoint conversion coming back defense makes them plays get them to third and 10 and in us see in typical Pete Carroll fashion they go for the jugular and get the big score throwing to his tight end Tyler Becker's been one of his preferred targets here in the second Avenue was five catches he's the leading receiver for Michigan in this game Neal Brennan really is shocking that Michigan defense which is a great the events how many big plays they've given up these last two games for our state USC it's 250 plus yard touchdown run Columbus that we saw now they come right back with a big one of their own and he's got a first down at the children's 39 so the Wolverines firing right back anytime you want to split a safety in a corner and try to hit a scene you have to have a quarterback that have the ability to put the ball on a rope that's exactly what Chad heady did that time and getting the ball thrown before Taylor Mays the safety came over to knock it down 36 yards and that gives echo a 78 yard afternoon my car's picking up a couple more and one of the story lines of the game is the way that defense has stopped him game day built by Home Depot coming up at 8:30 Eastern on ESPN Reese Davis Lou Holtz mark Bay they'll have all the highlights all the latest news for you and again that's 8:30 Eastern the Pacific bluefin to the top any fires complete Manningham first down at the 20yard line when Chad Henne has time to throw he had to scroll his arm and she'll see in the country at that time the protection where's the protection been gave him time to throw he'll find it open receiver screams setup with heart nothing doing they lose five yards Ellis who has played a sensational game along with Mama Lucca one thing you talked about where is that protection bin you know where both teams start controlling the football as much as they're flowing here in the second half those defense is starting to get tired man rushing that passes open it's a little bit different tempo right now for these blitzes by USC than we'll learn the first that little bit tired in underneath and not either back at the original line of scrimmage that's Arrington who cut the scoring strike from hynny and this will bring up a third down Oscar Lua senior linebacker on one of the leaders of this SC team maybe to stop members of both sides go down fourth down trailing by 14 with 8:11 to go this time Fathead he feels pressure once he steps up into the pocket Malala actually went by him he had time to get his feet underneath him and make an accurate throw but he hurried it feeling that that pressure into it before he had his feet ready to make an accurate throw to give his receiver a chance that might have been a first and that Jared touchdown has turned this game around on Michigan could go for a field goal here if they've been down eight now down 14 with 8:11 for it on 4th eleven need to reach the 10 yard line for a first down that they turn it over then question get it he slips knees down down at the 15 5 yards short USC football again the arm strength of Chad Henne to get that football out there because he almost slipped watching that rose until it flat pointed he was lucky to get the ball off he gathered himself I got the ball thrown to the outside but still even if Preston keeps his feet he's not going to pick up the first down yeah some folks will tell you you gotta throw to the first down marker on a big fourth down like that timeout 25:11 802 left for the Wolverines there is coach hope and his defense over on the other side they've played a whale of a game John David booty in the offense we'll see if they can eat away some precious minutes here your side Smith grabs it around the 40yard line let's check it down below a body Brent Mike Hart lists the missed the last few plays on Michigan's drive Paul Schmidt Wolverines head trainer was looking at his right shoulder but we don't have a diagnosis just yet Paul moved away from heart he's just kind of sitting on the bench but as soon as I get any information we'll let you know all right Bobby we didn't appear as we looked at him where you were given our foot that was serious but certainly you never know Aaron we went down he was a bit of pain there he got jammed into the turf a little bit the bottle weight on his shoulder how about this real soon offense they won't work in the clock six yards and here he comes again hands into Berenger now you might want to say that's a little bit unsportsmanlike right there also 29 more yards for Jarrett went away and Jarrett must have messed up seen Calvin Johnson's performance today in his bowl game because he is putting on a similar clinic here in the second half going up into the air making the catch that time it's showing the head ability to high pointed I'm gonna say one thing about wide receivers they should emulate Larry Fitzgerald and not Terrell Owens and I mean it okay first down and 10 play the game ball is at the 30yard line play fake nearside if it's something that the passing show contains food they continue to attack you guys officially there's no NFL team in Los Angeles they're right here I mean look at this play former wide receiver comes in handy this time oneonone with Sean kraebel goes up into the air that is unless a nice Catholic this makes that UCLA loss even more shocking absolutely come on last three pass plays 26 29 and 23 yards first and goal under pressure touchdown Smith John David booty being picked up with a huge smile on his face and he showed a lot of courage here today Fred Davis clears out David Harris right there in the middle of the field opening it up nicely well designed play by USC and they have continued to attack the safeties and the line backers of this Michigan defense booty got savaged by the Paul Woodman Tim Jameson and tax it on this time it's really for the young window well John David booty I said he's gonna go to work around the clock he went to work instead on yardage for for 485 yards and another touchdown pass against the Michigan defense John David booty has shredded them for 391 yards and four touchdowns they have outscored this defense 29 in the second half what a difference the two sidelines and breath they are 28 passes and four runs in the second half you called it they had the pastor Apache team they've got fabulous rust into it well let's take a look at the city game summary of this the 93rd rose bowl game 37 yards allows an interception by Jackson they've had six sacks then that strike to Arrington they were within eight but Jared against the bracket coverage broke free his second touchdown of the afternoon and it is 32 11 Jarrett 11 catches 206 yards and two of Moody's four touchdown passes Brandon miner stays in the game so I'm right hard over there on the sidelines going down the far side and completely overthrew Manningham and he was double covered down there Terrell Thomas was there was tailor made the outstanding freshman safety from Seattle Washington there you are hope you're seeing one of the biggest safeties in the country it'll be interesting watching him through the years if he can keep his weight down and stay at safety or they'll have to move him up the line back daddy played the NFL was out of practice the other day which is a very very fine talented young man Player of the Year in the state of Washington last year as a high school scene second at 10 Pop's was telling me he had it the UCLA about four days he said before he came out of his funk oh you know what he could have differently and there's Manningham pushed out of bounds on the far side by Terry Harris we check in with Bonnie checked in with Paul Schmidt the Wolverines trainer he's telling me that Mike Hart shoulder is fine however he's not on the field so make your own conclusions Brett well Bonnie it is getting late and they're down 3211 mike has already said that he's coming back next year it's been a very tough afternoon I think that the defense against Mike Hart is by far the best that I have seen this year at the first man hitting him and they have gang tackled him and he just did that much daylight not a chance to make a play in the open space open field at all though just close the gaps completely with this SCD line of mine we wondered which team would overcome the severe disappointment of losing their final regular season game and I think that question has been answered we thought that Michigan might bounce back because they really had the second spot of the BCS taken away from them by a vote where as USC was beaten by their archrival UCLA on the field but the Trojans came ready to play here today especially on defense as a dropped pass by the Wolverines and we come down now to the final 550 and Kirk could Bob I think both of you agree with me that the way this game is headed the Trojans will open the season under Pete Carroll as the preseason white folks don't tell him that he'll jump all open he jumped on me with both feet when I suggested that you know he said I don't care about that focused on this game and winter conditioning and but you're right with this this impressive a win with how many guys in a returning it's tough not to imagine them up at number one not just returning I want to show you some of their draft folks but the fellas was committed verbally incomplete who are going to come let's let's check in on the USC now remember Pete Carroll if you weren't with us has said to us this class coming in is the best recruiting class I've ever had now there you have you have a linebacker from Anaheim extremely highly rated there's Wendell Tyler's son window was a great running back at UCLA and the NFL got a quarterback from Villa Park he's got a backup quarterback when Amos Sanchez and Sanchez have a chance to win the job defensive lineman offensive lineman they're coming from all over next year and Pete's going to give him a chance as he always has to start next year when the season opens they pay 15,000 this year third and ten stepping up and good God hook up with his receiver Carson Buckner they sophomore tight end if two ain't sure it ends up leaving think about Steve Smith and Chris McVoy all being senior those two being seniors the only area you're gonna have to see some inexperienced step up this the only area is wide receiver you're going to have to have some young wide receivers emerge to have the kind of team that you'd expect to have and the way they recruit I'm sure that will not be a problem for us find a few filled it at the 30yard line and that's read to the 40 USC five minutes away from winning another Rose Bowl they hold more wins here than any other school and they're about to add another Wisconsin Penn State with huge wins for the Big Ten but here Michigan on the short end against USC of the pac10 what does it mean for Ohio State you are left to wonder and you can make your own conclusions with five tend to go a championship down at Glendale next Monday and the key guy has been blamed Jarrett that was Washington the runny back I think we knew if John David booty had time to throw he was going to make some plays and he of his found Dewayne Jarrett 11 times 205 yards for to cut fans has completely dominated the Michigan secondary against boys when booty has to add time to throw into second half and again you look at Dwayne Jarrett you compare him to some of the best receivers in the country the only one that comes to mind is Calvin Johnson who finally had a chance to get the ball thrown to him today and he also had a great game Bradford he's the running back he's those over his head we check in down below and Lisa well well Brent for those who think or thought that Dwane Jarrett wasn't ready isn't ready to turn pro Keyshawn Johnson I asked when Jerry about it and he said you know for folks who believe that I do respect their opinion I respect with Keyshawn has to say but Dwayne said what makes them think that I wouldn't continue to work once I do go to the NFL he said even if I'm not physical enough and I believe that I am I would still continue to work at that level and I said Dwayne it sounds like you're leaning towards declaring yourself edible eligible for the draft and he said no no no don't put words in my mouth but if I were I would continue to work at the next level Brent yeah sounds like a heavy lien graduate what happens when you go through that process of declaring where that would come out or not it's hard to know who to trust because it seems like everybody has an agenda you know you talk about the dynamics of a ball game all these players announcing particular for Michigan are coming back think of the dynamic of those players that are backups behind those guys now that are forced to wait another year with the starter returning so so many things go into ball game preparation that's why sometimes that different team shows up the play that you had the last time you coached them in the regular season talking about who to trust they have the luxury of having Pete Carroll a coach who they really trust his opinion literally closing it down goes John David booty so Lamar Woodley coming in and that will be the second sack of this game for the Wolverines and it'll bring up a second and 18 and John David said no she's going down and keep that clocking ticket I think it'll be interesting to see where Lamar Woodley ends up in the draft branch you know he's a little bit undersized to be a true defensive end he's more of a threefour outside linebacker but he hasn't had a lot of success play in that position so Mark Sanchez we get to take a look at the unmanned remember we told you despite this great performance three another ignited when yards four touchdowns and no interceptions the young man here the freshman from Mission Viejo California will have a chance to compete and if you've had a chance to watch or see tape on him this young man has a rifle on he's mobile he's one of the better young quarterbacks in the country that is going to be one of the great duals of the spring between Sanchez and John David booty now Sanchez had a crack at the job last spring and then there was a little off the field incident and I think involving Sanchez and a woman here at USC but that that seemed to disappear and the team and keep Carlos stood solidly behind Sanchez in that situation and it is third down and 15 here is the toss play with Bradford P kill me tackle him over there on the sidelines you think that USC teams having a little more fun over on that side lines than they did the last time well the last two times last two times one year ago from today over close to it you know I was a little worried about USC being flat just practicing it there same practice facility staying in the same hotel a little bit of a mundane schedule kind of used to throwing it I think they were early though I think that's why Pete Carroll was and some of the coaches were over there trying to get the crowd into the game and I think second half the throwing that we talked about you talked about all of a sudden opened some things he's got to feel good doesn't John David booty it just goes to show you that the end of the year for USC with Oregon and then cow and then Notre Dame leading up to the UCLA game I think a lot of people assume that hey was in the barn after they got through the three games and I think that's what affected us see when they played UCLA they didn't expect much of a game from UCLA they didn't show up to play not a bounds and then it's good to be barked at about the is still walking about the 30 or so reminding out folks coming up the built Ford Tough postgame interviews at the trophy presentation to Pete Carroll and the USC Trojans John David booty and Chad Annie both in the Heisman race you'd have to think next year along with Michael Harvey well Derrick's there's some great running backs returning next year Michael hard to be up there Darren McFadden Steve Slayton along with these quarterbacks I've been the last time see those two fellow teammates 1st down and 10 we'll see how everything unfolds Preston he stays inbounds you know Preston you had to be impressed Brent when we visited what the other day told us a story about his three older brothers one graduated from Pitt one from Penn State and one from real college in Pittsburgh and he was the fourth that graduated he told us his mom cried when he walked across that stage and got his diploma that's a heck of a statement like think in it though really great feeling for mom raising those youngsters Preston played little quarterback you know and in high school be interesting to see how he does with that speed he'll certainly get a chance as a return man if nothing else and they probably used him as a slop receiver in the NFL and see what kind of production they could get so Brent 32 to 11 let's assume this is the final you think back in Ann Arbor here's the bloggers are out and we've got trouble in in Ann Arbor for Lloyd Carr asses it the way the Ohio State series is gone and the way these ball games have gone I don't things a question either you can book suck it down and ten Annie the third straight year did you lose the combination to Ohio State and then the bowl game that brings question sure Bennett it's amazing to think that the team is number two in a country 11 and Oh going into the rivalry game two games later the bloggers are back out you know what not so much the blockers but again think if they would have won this game and every time he walks into an alumni meeting every front time he gets up to speak it's talking about coach everything's positively the preseason number one instead now he has to spin everything and try to find some positives even though he's in 11 and 13 11 and 2 team as he ends the season so it's a completely different lifestyle for the head coach based on whether you win the ball or lose the ball in the offices the strike and you know you've got to make sure that the the recruits show up we've got some great verbal commitments if you wondered about Ryan Mallett the outstanding quarterback protects our Canada Texans that he he will be in school here in a few days so when Brantley decommitted from Texas to go to Florida there was talk that the horns might go after mana they probably did just checked in and you know elected brazil is very comment when somebody commits burglary at least you know who the competition is so there's Ryan Mallett and he's a big rascal and he got the wide receiver that's a great name an intruder anyway and there's which Woolfolk son they defense it back from Sugar Land Texas Jeremy pinch out Indianapolis DB Ryan Van Bergen out of Whitehall Michigan defense eventually there's some top players coming into me that's that's a very good recruiting Boyd card and the Michigan staff always seem to close strong as well so I'm sure you'll see even more name surface between now and signing their second and ten chuckling Preston 10yard nine five put the corner got the touchdown and that's why Steve Breaston will get along in the end that's 41 yards folks and that's a major speed right there that's mantoman going to instead of Matthews who cut underneath who's open he decides to wait gets the ball to Steve Breaston it was just the foot race once he made the catch was a foot race with Terrell Thomas Terrell Thomas USC's best corner good to see this young guy finish his career at Michigan with a bigtime play like that he's played a lot of football ever Michigan greatest tax on the edge the point is a penalty flag didn't have a single penalty in the first half pretty clean overall this is what six time couldn't stop it even with the excavator would have come back after the UCLA game for USC and for especially John David booty and his offensive line of USC the guy that Michigan had he better deal we're used to wearing that big old coldweather hat they better have soaked up all the sunshine they could handle last couple of days because a poor man that's like you yeah vomit I'm smoking it myself it'll come back midapril legal participation 12 players on the field against the defense that penalty is refused the extra point is successful last minute coming up these guys said it's great to see the senior get a chance to make a play I know the game is that a reach at this point but Kenny is not giving up he finds the senior Breaston once he holds on to the ball as I said he shows the speed that you guys are talking about it'll probably have some NFL scouts interested in what he can offer it to next level you out runs Terrell Thomas yeah the combination of punt return kick return third wide receiver Steve Breaston level legitimate shot that's as good as it gets right there winning the bowl game bouncing back in that UCLA game look at that smile there's a hidden or drew dude with his back right there on the left hand side is their occasion it's Rudy betterlooking coach for as far as a USC position you put it you put a pair of sunglasses on the guy he's not allowed to coach anywhere else I mean he's perfect for USC I think he knows him he's a smart about that yes and I'll tell you something else though he does pay attention to what's going on in the NFL you won't have a conversation with somebody who knows what's happening around the entire football way he's a football chunky I mean I'm telling you he is something terribly this and mr. Kraft the owner of the papen six you read his comments that they perhaps more ready for Pete Carolyn that they certainly dismissed me too early nobody was up there for two years had the Jets for a year Brian Cushing who's played very well he led that assault in the first half 32 to 18 then you see that big smile from Pete Carroll and if you're not familiar with him and up they got him with some water if you're not familiar with him and his style he likes to have fun but you won't find a coach and a coaching staff that works any harder than USC during a two out two and a half hour practice time to party down that's a good band Alex everything's going right it's that's right okay didn't fumble the jug cable back in and stays inbound those bull games remaining this is the technique that you want to use that guy right there was in on the point of decoy coach I'll hold your headphones just for a second if I could congratulations on the big win that's a good point you got a great season that long been great we have seen some big kind of ballgames now ready for next year 32 to 18 manticores coming up we're gonna have that built Ford Tough postgame trophic presentation to the Trojans John David booty wins a bowl game and there's his favorite target 11 catches for 205 yards in a pair of touchdowns for Tulane Jaron I see that confetti and I still think about that magical magical vision last year that a year later USC comes in and captures the ball there they are they're the Rose Bowl champions ABC
