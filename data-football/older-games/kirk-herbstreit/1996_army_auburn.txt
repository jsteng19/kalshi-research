============================================================

from the battlefield like Eisenhower MacArthur and Swart scoff legendary coach Brett Blake and Heisman winners mr. inside Blanchard and mr. outside Glen Davis by winning their fifth straight game over Navy Army secured their place in school history and the Independence Bowl with their first ever ten win season and today have their chance to prove themselves against a perennial powerhouse the Auburn Tigers ESPN is proud to welcome you to Shreveport Louisiana for the Poland weedeater Independence Bowl today is 7:00 and for Auburn against the 10:1 Black Knights of Army and hybrid bodyonframe fuller Jack welcome to Shreveport Louisiana when he talked about army you have to talk about a relentless ground game they average over 345 yards a game and have won two national rat rushing titles over the past four seasons and rod Gilmore you talked about the ground game of Army you have to talk about Ronnie McKay to their great wishbone quarterback but he's more effective just in the boat he's effective all over the football field yeah well he is simply the greatest quarterback option quarterback army has ever had take a look at what he's done in his career over 1,500 yards rushing for this man and when he isn't running the ball like that he can throw it and he's rooted for more than 2000 yards in his career but the thing that he does best of all is make great decisions when he's running the option he knows whether to keep the ball or whether to pitch it to someone else and that makes him a very dangerous man rod Army's lone loss this season was the Syracuse and their opponent today is Auburn very much like almost a shadow of both a bat club the Syracuse Orangemen we know Syracuse has Donovan McNabb a really quick quarterback who moves around Auburn has Damian Craig they are very similar McNabb drilled army back in November they're gonna try to do the same with Damian Craig he has quick feet and he can throw the deep ball if they don't keep him in the pocket this man will be a very very tough man for our army into fitness bowl is on its way Terry Bowden goes after his 100th career win Auburn an army in the end of Penance Bowl won't come back to Shreveport with the kick

to Shreveport Louisiana for the Independence Bowl today it's Army and Auburn and as we know army a very effective ground game 346 yards a game there is a question mark and let's go downtown stairs to former Pittsburgh Steelers running back himself Meryl Hodge well Craig thanks Joe Hugh at number 33 suffered a thirddegree MCL sprain against Navy three weeks ago and the bad news is he's not going to start the good news is he could play it's a ball that they're gonna have to deal with I think the Joe Hewitt well it looked very good I think in warmups so depend on how the game goes back to you guys all right thank you sir it is a big question mark in the he's so he's so effective nearly six yards per carry well you know the thing that he gives Army is the back with the ability to turn the 5yard run into about a 15 or 20 yarder so they will miss him if he can't play a lot in this ballgame demetrius perry a very solid backup of the fullback position he averages a about four and a half yards a game again so at the fullback sparks are loaded along with the halfback position well remember the Navy game you it was out most of that ball game Ryan McKay has stepped his game up and brought our me back from 18 points down to get the berth here in this bowl game alltime bowl appearances impressive 25 for the Auburn Tigers Auburn won the toss chose to receive robert baker and eric olson back to receive the kid Baker at the goal line nice return to the 26 a 26yard return there is the quarterback for Auburn Damian Craig good junior you look at his numbers fifty four and a half percent completion rate rod nearly twenty three hundred yards ten touchdowns and ten picks on the season where the key for Army will be keeping him in the pocket if they let him get outside he can reap havoc first plate of the Independence Bowl and from the shotgun is Damian great we can throw and it goes up top to a wide open Tyrone Goodson down the sideline and knocked out at the 25 and rod you know army was working on their option trying to contain their quarterback Damian Craig on the first play he goes deep well you know they got four receivers you see the quarterback there nobody in the backfield with them they're just gonna drop back and throw the ball this is almost man for man coverage and with Albans speed army has a real disadvantage they can't afford to let their defensive backs get locked up mantoman on Albans wide receiver 48 yard hookup from Damien Craig good side on Goodson this time Craig Thompson runs wideopen Running Room at the 15 and a nice shoestring tackle at the 13 yard line cut weeka number 44 big Kawika made the tackle you look at Auburn's offense of course Craig the fine quarterback in the backfield along with McLeod and rusty Williams the wide receivers Bailey Goodson too big 48 yard reception and the tight end yzma covery a good line of James Riley Kiger Thomas and Jim Rove first and ten from the 12 yard line again from the shotgun they swing it out to Willie Gosha Eichelberger made the tackle army defensively up front angles Estes Colin Kearns and Eichelberger at 6 3 to 25 really a linebacker the backers are King and King no relations and cot weeka gate I think Oh brown on Mullins are your defensive backs for the Black Knights so I go down seven from opening drive here in Shreveport Gregg Hammond is way early the little flip to question Bailey inside the 5 to the 3 yard line call it the 4th well the problems for our me right now that this game is starting out just life of Syracuse game did for our me a Damian Craig is doing a very good impersonation of Donovan McNabb McNabb came out and threw the ball deep data still has team down the field may scored early Craig is doing the exact same thing this is just the way all burned drew it up Auburn in the red zone 39 to 49 80% 30 touchdowns nine field goals are knocking on the door third down and short from the three yard line double tight end formation and the pics to Beasley the pull back to the 1 : Kearns was the guy who came in and made the play for Army that time yeah he's a guy who goes at about 266 pounds and watch him he's got to show up in the middle of your screen penetrate there he is showing up right now making the play nobody was able to get a hand on him and he was in the backfield burns is a guy who's quick enough to cause some problems for Auburn today been around a long time three year letterman a senior from Kenwood Texas first and goal from the 2 yard line the pitch Beasley Ilana's scrimmage at the 8yard line so a 5yard lot loss and good active pursuit yeah but it was Larry angles the guy who really made the play on you talk about the army defense Ryan look at 76 to the right of your screen there he shows up and makes that play he beats the tight in that time Jesse micawber it and got in the backfield and that disrupted the play he didn't make the tackle but he forced the play wide and that's exactly what you have to do if you're gonna make plays on the other side of the line of scrimmage angles plays at left defensive end spot six for 250 Grove City Ohio is home second down goal from the 8 yard line again in the shotgun lost his pudding as he tried to set up you don't know be right if he wanted to throw the ball or be shot some open space up the middle yeah it looked like he wanted to run the ball but you know we were talking about the field before the game started it looked like a lot of guys were slipping out there particularly the Auburn guys and fast guys have a tendency to have a problem when the field is like this you see you see the mud right there you know that's a soft soggy field and then you have this this the fast guys can't get their footing real well the big slow guys don't have a problem with the right third down goal from the 14 yard line David Craig up top three wide receivers in the end zone couldn't find couldn't find a man incomplete and that brings up a fourth down and goal from the 14 yard line but one of the criticisms of a for wide receiver offense is that you can't run the football when you get inside the 20yard line that you have to be able to do that if you take a look at Jared Holmes the great kicker dinner gala transfer from Hinds Community College Mississippi this is a 31yard field goal and a line drive kick is good from 31 so our burg takes the opening kick and drives and picks up three 10:59 to play opening quarter we'll be back after this all right guys we got a 34 minute turnaround on this let's do it it can be five below zero or coming down in buckets it doesn't matter it doesn't buy you another second out of you but time isn't everything getting the job done right is just don't really it's a rare moment when they see us at all but now the second goes by then we're not looking out for them it's one of the most comfortable cars I've ever driven people love talking about Ford Taurus it's fun to drive it really is with Taurus you sit in no matter what size you are I'm big I'm surprised by how much room there is inside everybody my family they just turn the wheel a fraction of an inch the car responds there's a lot more room it's designed so I don't have to search for anything the seats feel like they wrap around you it's a stateoftheart car Ford Taurus the bestselling car in America starting at 18 545 hey Kraig this is the a10 tank killer we saw yesterday it Barksdale Air Force Base in right there that's that machine gun you know I was playing around with and then over here you got these bombs and things that you were dropping I had a lot of fun flying that thing yesterday did you did I understand though the the American Express card will not cover that don't tell the folks that he has pain about the invoice they're gonna get as we were treated so great at Barksdale the largest b52 base in the country and I counted at least 25 or 30 of the big ones sitting around yesterday it was more than that you know as far as your eyes could see there were b52 bombers I'll burn when nine plays covered sixty yards and Jared Holmes kicked a 31yard field goal to put the Tigers on top here early in the Independence Bowl Ron Thomas five yards deep and so the Black Knights will start up at their own 20yard line let's go downstairs talk to Merrill Hyde Merrill you know crate you see the little slip and going on down here and the field is a little wet but really all enough pretty good condition something to be aware of the field goal that was just kicked was kicked to a field goal that is a little crooked and also the hash mark should be in college at the three yard line it is marked on the two yard line for extra points so something to be aware of here in the game especially if it comes down to a field goal so a crooked field goal we see that crack that that should be at the three yard line that circle we had there and then hash mark our first look at our me on the ground and they picked up five yards Demetrios Perry gets the start of the fullback and let's talk about Makeda the quarterback sixtythree percent completion rate nearly a thousand yards through the air but very dangerous run pass you name it smart guy he can impose his will on a football game as he did against Navy bringing his team back from 18 points behind to get to this bowl game second down four from the 26 yard line and now a quick timeout called by Ronnie Makeda the senior Anna Mesquite Texas will step aside 1022 to play opening quarter with a play opening quarter after the timeout army steps to the line at the 26 looking at second down and four first man up the middle the fullback Demetrius Carey and a first down for the Black Knights spikes made the tackle for army offensively the quarterback we've talked about this young man very effective Makeda the backfield williams Brissac and demetrius perry taking over for Joe Hewitt we should see Hewitt today Ron Thomas and lijinsky will get their hands on the football plenty today and up front not big but effective beard Chadwick Scott Inc and Frederick again the Kate arrives carry into the line of pick up a three maybe four to the 37 yard line defensively for Auburn upfront Dorsey Brumbaugh inland Leonardo Carson out of Mobile Alabama started a freshman the linebackers pretty darn good Reese Neal spikes and mostella a young defensive backs of ray Hueston where and Clayton where and Creighton rod freshman second down six but Gaeta the keeper first down to the 45yard line and a little bit of slip and a little bit of slop head on that place you know Craig you know you talk about the option one thing that people don't normally notice is the splits of the linemen look at all the space in between the offensive linemen what that does is it spreads out the defense and it makes it easier for the lime in the block and it makes it tougher for the defense to get a handle on the option so you'll see those wide splits all day for army burst down from the 45 yard line but they don't want to throw over the middle like a dark and incomplete Rodney Creighton on coverage and going to Lozinski who's a pretty good ball control guy at tie it in made 17 receptions on the season but that won't look like a popped off his pad yeah he's more than just a ball control kind of guy I don't know what that was the big go but there you see some of the cadets the schinsky is a guy he was good enough to play in the NFL you know he's a big good block and a good receiver for army but he pro scouts ranked him one of the top three maybe top five tight ends in the country army back to the ground game Perry the ball carrier Ricky Neal number 50 you know the interesting thing about lijinsky is that when he came out of high school he wanted to go to Northwestern he was recruited there and then northwestern had the coaching change Gary Barnett came in and said well you know we got to start all over if we're gonna recruit you but since he got discouraged army stepped in he winds up here and he is considered a top prospect as you mentioned third down and six 49 yard line but get on the option and a good read defensively by Albarn Charles Dorsey stayed at home the big sophomore left in what 292 dug his toes down and moved around pretty nice and nice contain work well you know you're worried about young guys for getting their assignments well that time Dorsey did nothing of the sex of the Sun he was right there played off the block got in the backfield made to play and Auburn was awfully concerned about the young guys for getting their assignments fair catch called bounces into the end zone and so a 52yard kick later tonight on ESPN Tim Duncan leads number two ranked Wake Forest's against Keith van Horn in the seventh ranked running Utes of Utah from the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City checking out tonight 9:30 Eastern 6:30 Pacific only on ESPN that Keith van Horn who is a real player he could have been a pretty good tight in chose to come back for his senior season arvin with the football and a threepoint lead 751 to play first quarter all game long Dumon frege's john from the shotgun formation and it's been really effective Carsten Bailey pulls down two nice throw Bailey a sophomore on a Sharpsburg Georgia but right now Craig bad combination for Army no pressure on the quarterback and soft coverage in the secondary so long as that keeps up Craig is going to have a career day first down at the 32 yard line good protection again this time Billy flows to the post but his wide receiver broke outside but that time army went to a little bit more pressure that time played their guys a little bit closer and you see Terry Bob who's thinking in terms of getting the ball down the hill he wants to take advantage of the mismatch he has out there wide receiver army simply doesn't have the speed to run with the Auburn guys as you see what Craig has done already four out of six for 16 again from the shotgun suckin down Tim from the 32 this time the dance is on the trouble oh boy wide open running women he can sprint at the 50 at the 40 still on his feet to the 41 yard line he cut back inside at the 40 and then lost a yard or two but Wow wide open wide open run a 26 yard picked up by Damien Cray we talked about the soft covers look they're up now they're playing a little man but they got guys behind him guys are going to get back and turn their back and that's going to open up the lane for Damien Craig to get down the middle when the defensive backs are playing off and playing man coverage they don't see the quarterback run therefore they can't come up and make tackles the guy like Craig will beat you Damien Craig's going eight touchdowns on the ground this season dumped it over the middle wide open Markieff Cooper Cooper a freshman a true freshman a high school allamerican for Miami he's gonna hit the old the old man age of 20 by the way uh Rada January 15th all would it be nice to be 20 again his mother must be a little bit concerned but he's out there with all those big guys don't worry about him he's quick enough second possession of the game for Auburn and there they have just been up and down the field Gregg perception the throw incomplete coming back with Tom Mullins nice job did knock it away from Tyrone Goodson yeah mom he's got away with using his right hand a little bit that time though and he grabbed with his right hand and used his left hand and knocked the ball up and that's what you're supposed to do but you can't grab too early you'll see him come across with the left hand but the right hand had Goodson's hip it got away was at that time you'll see it from this angle watch the right hand yeah he's all around him comes off with the left hand knocks it down I like it though short yardage situations third down and two they did not turn the corner and coming down along with darling Jay a senior out of Houston Texas well garland gay will hit you and he can make Nick play remember he had a big interception against Navy that preserved that victory which propelled army into this bowl game forks out in short and remember this run defense by Army rod ranks sixth nationally giving up only 89 yards a game yeah I think it's a good decision here for Terry Bowden to go for it felt very short yardage his team's been moving the ball you want to get ahead of an option team to take them out of learning double tied in the formation just about a yard a yard and then some fled easily over the top he followed the his big man Leonard Thomas at 289 Jim Road t90 for the right guard and the right tackle and that time it did a pretty good job of handling number 72 CW Estes he is a great football player not just for army period he's the guy that can get in and make plays and they handled him on that play be a matchup worth worth watching the rest of the ballgame first and 10 Tigers at the Black Knight 29 yard great good protection again over the middle wide open touchdown Tyrone Goodson Oh Craig there's nothing fancy about it we talked about this when you have mantoman coverage if your athlete is better than theirs you're going to beat him and Goodson is quick he's fast and if you have somebody on him that can't handle him trouble plenty of time for Craig nobody around him that's just too long to hope for somebody in army secondary to cover that man 17th touchdown throw the season for Craig and the seventh reception for Goodson the extra points Jared Holmes now 44 of 46 on the season so far has been all Tigers here in straight pork 5:22 play first quarter watch and weep and laugh and thrill as dim bones the one and only Brooklyn Dodgers come to glorious life again in five new home videos Roy Campanella P we reason to kick foggy and cloudy today chin nothing Tigers over army let's go downstairs check in with Meryl Hodge hey guys the operatically staff is really harping on their players listen we got speed user speed beat these guys with speed that play right there raw speed raw speed indeed and as squibber they can at the 7 yard line the outside run Thomas well he came out of a pile it takes it to the 44 yard line a 36 yard return he looked pretty good on that run to he's been nursing a bit of a bad hamstring for a while but he doesn't show any of that there you see him pick up this ball watch how he sucks everybody into the middle and then he makes his way to the outside and this is pretty good speed Auburn can really fly on their special teams but Thomas can fly a bit himself I don't let our me fool you now these guys they do some big things in the classroom but they have to be called football players first they can play on adoption akkada Road the fullback pulled it out and got it to the 49 yard line Ricky Neal made the tackle Ricky Neal how about a hundred 11 tackles on the season at Silver 10 stops a football game and he's one of the more senior players for Auburn he's a junior you know they only have two veteran players out there a junior and a senior and then they have nine collectively freshmen and sophomores out there a pickup of five second down five from the 49 yard line Perry the ball carrier close to the first down they needed to get to the 46 made that tackle Craig you know it's really important for Army right now to stay with their game plan and to make the Auburn offense cool its heels keep them on the sidelines run your wishbone run your power running game eat up some of the cloth and get your confidence going then we talked to Greg Gregory the offensive coordinator yesterday for army and well very confident guys been around the program for 15 seasons and he says hey Rodrick there is right there if we get down 10 we do not change things we just go with the exact game plan we've got we've been working on all week well he's fully expected to be able to move the ball against Auburn and would be quite shocked but say don't do it they don't put up a lot of points first down by the nose there is the head man there mr. Sutton head coach of barber guy who had his contract extended recently he'll be there for another five years the army had pushed out through the penis at Auburn his contract through the year 2000 a lot of filters were through the year up okay to the pitch the ball get on the ground still on the draft pick up Tigers grad where and it's hidden as bad as it possibly could get for our me that's the 28 fumble this year the 12 fumble that they've lost it was one of the things we talked to them about yesterday and they said you know we really don't turn the ball over we don't worry about it much buddy we've got a wet field we've got Makeda coming out to his left the ball is on the money but Thomas just drops it it's right up around his face he could see it clearly he just didn't handled it handle it very well probably took his eyes off looking up the field third fumble recovery for a where and it sets up a burn and fine field position to lead the nation in those takeaways 37 and the turnover margin Wow 2015 yeah a lot again we see any Craig's and his guts that he bought himself a lot of time on this football game so far over the middle Gosha Willie Gaucher made the reception well it's important that tom has keep his head in the ball game and everyone's got to try and pick him up you don't want one of your prime time players to get discouraged early in the ballgame you can't go into the tank move on with it play better five wide receivers the Tigers second down free again for the shotgun tiny fast falling on that wet turf was Carsten Bailey they what fail it was wide open five receivers a type of defensive strategy do you have to come back with of your army with five wideouts well I think anytime you have five wideouts you have to attack the quarterback there's nobody in the backfield to protect him you go after me but that time number 68 Victor Reilly for Auburn did a good job of picking up the Blitz off the corner 256 yards allowed per game today already in the first quarter by the end of pixie from Damien Craig hooks up with Robert Baker and traffic Tom Bowens maybe stop and Craig that was the first time that they actually put a hit on Damian Craig if Damian Craig is not knocked around he's gonna have a great day and he just got up for the first time he completed the pass but he did get knocked around again the Tigers with the five wide receivers set another pocket countryman fridge he's dangerous on the run throws incomplete down inside the 15 yard line picks for the intended receiver number 89 Estes and Kings provided some pressure on Craig you know you have a real dilemma as a defensive coordinator if you put pressure on Damian Craig he may run away from you like we saw him do earlier in the ballgame and he can almost go for a touchdown but if you don't put pressure on him he's got to sit back there and pick you apart army defensively wanted to stop the run force and force Craig to throw that time they did incomplete check it out Dan for the 21 whether the corner overthrows his intended receiver Robert Baker Donnell Augustus one of the best cover men for Army over on the far side right now army said enough is enough you'll see them come with pressure now they have determined they've got to get to their man see mantoman coverage one free safety they are going after the quarterback now they're not going to let Craig sit back there and pick them apart more pressure pretty good coverage that's the first time they were successful at making the early switch down 10 3:11 to play first quarter I'm gonna get over that far sideline flags come out it was a bump and a push the catch by Baker and colony they have been the guilty party number 17 well Mullins got there so quickly he didn't know what to do so he just kind of bumped into the receiver if he had stepped in front of the receiver he would have picked that ball off and might have gone the other way Jimbo bolts ants our referee the second time he's been flat for pass interference watch the left side of your screen try and watch the end of the play there you're going to see a little contact there you couldn't quite see it from that angle but Muller's was pushing with his right hand once again because he got there so quickly Tigers come out with her four wide receivers set in the lone battle ready for number twenty play first and Ken big bucks in her arms wide open all he's updated at the tape it was been taught week at number 44 who really put the hit on Damien Creek and table is not a big guy he goes at about two hundred pounds about five eleven played the inside linebacker who stops 40 for the middle of your screen watch the hit there's the hit and he gets a little bit of help from Robert Brown number 18 as well but that man is a fireplug he's a hard hitter and yesterday at the luncheon he was talking about just hitting the quarterback hitting the quarterback we got to hit that time Robert Brown picked up the loose football go army thumbs up with the big hit to stop stop Albarn he's 56 to play Tigers going blip launched back and of last night they say we're gonna pound it we're gonna just run white at you to the 8 yard line dimitra's parry or pull back there's the man who made the big hit again vin chaud weeka man who wanted to go to Michigan take a look at his nose there he's already tough he is already he's already bleeding he said it was gonna be that kind of ballgame for him and he's already into it but he wanted to go to Michigan visited Michigan they didn't offer him a scholarship ended up going to army five guys picked up second and five from the seventh Latina tried to make the turn you can see that left foot just nothing to grab onto that's the area that you were walking around on earlier today and you pointed out that it was really muddy over there really slippery Ryan McCain I didn't realize it until just now you know from our vantage point it doesn't look that bad there's no standing water but this this grass surface has taken a lot of moisture the last few days I'm not a rain here Saturday night kind of stayed around third down five from the seventh not much Demetrios theory the ballcarrier trying to find something off the right side behind Rick Frederick's and Jeff England's the army will not change from its game plan they will always run the option even if it's third eighth and third and five or whatever because they believe they can pick it up it all depends of what the quarterback sees and the read he makes that time he gave it to the fullback and it wasn't the right read they didn't pick up the first down Scott Lord back to punt the football for Army two yards deep Robert Baker standing at midfield takes a bounce lets it roll by this is a huge break for army huge break Tigers take over at the 31 yard line tomorrow the Big Ten meets the SCC 16th ranked Alabama battles 15th ranked Michigan at the Outback Bowl in Tampa Florida Gene Stallings coaches his last game for the Crimson Tide tomorrow 11:00 Eastern 8:00 a.m. Pacific only on ESPN pretty good ballgame Dee Hollings Lloyd Carr you know two good coaches two good teams New Year's Day pretty good huh 1997 almost yeah oh my I wanted to go first quarter tent nothing boy look at this being a Greg finally goes under Center fivestep drop over the middle complete Gosei has been his man in this opening quarter to the 37 yard line let's check in with Merrill Hodge Merrill thanks Chris Cherokee rose 6 8 250 pounds I'm 6 1 210 pounds a lot of times people think of football the bigger star a guy is the better football player well look football's not played up here football is played down here when you get down here it's about leverage I'm the smaller guy but if I get up under Cherokee I can win a lot of battles even though I'm the smaller weaker guy back to you guys hmm Merrill doesn't look too small or weak to me I think he can still play oh he's not some people around living in Pittsburgh and Chicago pits play rusty Williams nearly broke it inside the 25 to the 23 yard line you know Merrill makes some good points rod because this team Army is undersized when you take on the Tiger front and Merrill is right you see the 47 pound difference there but but what's happening right now is Auburn is staying low getting leverage really pounding on army so they are winning not just because of the pound difference but because it playing good solid football down low just like royal showed you from the I first from 1024 guard line it'll play action game and all Davis love the football and he lost his porting after 25 Danny Greg had a wide open lane rod at the Dutch Brook for the end zone yeah he might have scored on that one and he knows it he slipped out and when you honor we're gonna feel like this you can't cut off your inside foot you don't have enough area surface area you have to make sure you cut from the outside that is the first quarter David Greg take cover did not think duckers will be back find real family values in Shreveport Bossier so far speed has been killing the Black Knights Auburn has a whole lot of it especially the wide receiver position Tigers in good field position again second down 11 as we start the second quarter having a 510 then great for the shotgun to die great good factors I'm gonna try this again and tucks and runs and slides to the 22 yard line downstairs and Merrill Hodge well Craig you saw Damien right well you're looking at a pack 75 every time a quarter ends or a score this thing is going to go off I'm tell you this this is kind of thing you want to take hunting with you well you see Damien Craig he didn't know what hit him oh no that's the most pressure he's got all day pretty good the Merrill likes to hunt those birds I don't know Briggs numbers 9 of 15 152 yards and already 45 yards on the ground again from the shotgun craig feels pressure ducks trouble goodbye infants and goes the other way wide open Robert to the 11 yard line well Craig as long as Damien Creek and sit back there and pick his teeth he's gonna have the time of his life look at this you're gonna see the offensive line give him a lot of time only four men rushing for army well finally Craig says I'm tired of this I'm going to move outside see if I can see somebody you can not in the secondary cover guys for five seconds and that's about as long as army CAD back there to cover can't do it first dad chin at the 11 yard line I formation big under center Dodgers knocking on the door the pitch play rusty Williams and the Black Knights do not Bend they knock him down at the 12 yard line and the tackle by cotton weeka he's a great story 511 211 pounds he's a team captain for army he's got the strong safety sighs rod but you know what leader and again Merrill talked about leverage he's a success at the inside linebacker he's already down low yeah buddy he gets up there mixing it second out 10 from b11 big rolls out fires the other way contact made but the catch pulled down by the tide and Jessie McCrory and garland gay there's a bit of a size differential there gay at 187 recovery 255 but look what's going on up front estes number 72 is the best defensive lineman for army he gets nowhere near the quarterback he's their sack leader with six they have kept him out of the backfield and that is a chief reason why Damien Craig is having a huge first half they call him their bigtime pass rush threat and so far has been unable to find Damien break from the shotgun throw down six to the seven then throw fires touchdown touchdown Willie go shave associated a knife shop getting outside and this time you will find that army just lost some of the receivers they were planned a little bit of a zone out there now watch as he goes che goes to the outside inside covered that time by a gust at 34 he just doesn't realize how far away Gosha has gotten from him and you've got to have better presence and awareness in the secondary you can't let a guy be that wide open in the end zone when you playing his own second touchdown of the season for Gaucher and the second flown today by Damien Craig the extra point is up fanned true and Auburn well the 17 nothing lead on army will come back this report after this presentation of the Poland weedeater independent poll they've bought you buy but you gone it's about change and by McDonald have you had your break today now the lights are on here at Independence Stadium cloud cloudy all day but ahead and slow down over up 5:17 Garrett the kick Ron Thomas Rajdeep will take a knee so the Black Knights will start up at their own 20 later tonight at midnight 9 Pacific on espn2 check out NASCAR marathon all the NASCAR races from the season how about this back to back make sure your ring in the new year with NASCAR if you don't have espn2 contact your local cable operator or satellite program provider here's the scoring drive you see what they did there Gosha with a 7 yard touchdown reception Craig three out of three on that drive you know I'm happy we have espn2 back where I live now starting January 1st we had a campaign we got it you got it got it starting tomorrow yeah consider calling this cable operator right now that your army you kind of wonder about what is sudden thinking is he going to stay with his offense is he gonna open it up a little bit I believe he is going to stick with the option game maybe some power running and I think that's the right thing to do the worst thing to do would be to panic right movement suck it down five handoff to Brissac seldomused halfback he's more of a blocking back but still averages over four and a half yards of carry an adult Toro California well you're right he only carried the ball 71 times coming into the ballgame here they really don't feature him in the running game but they're trying to get something going they've got a big third down now 32 they're just gonna try and pick this up I believe they'll keep it on the ground here Craig third down the fullback enjoy you a keeper Makeda first down at two yards more Brad we're made the tackle one of the things that Greg Gregory the offensive coordinator told us yesterday is that Makeda is so big that he can fall forward for a yard is he here's Gregory right there he says he'll give Mikaela the chance to run the ball in short yardage because he's 63 and he'll fall forward and pick up a first down he just never ever gets knocked that double tight got information for army first and 10 from the 33 playaction fake ID and Kris Dunning you know we have seen the speed for Auburn on offense but they have some speed on defense to watch the pressure that is put on Makeda here he's gonna find himself rolling now look at these great big linemen coming with good speed that time it looks like it's gonna be number 93 maillard coming around with good speed they've got it throughout that team Makeda not known to throw the football that was only his 88th attempt on the season falls incomplete second down ten from the 32 and some content up front the big fellas on the move 69 as Jeremy Chapman and looks like Chapman just a little bit quick off the snap Oh army is certainly sputtering here in the first half and I think what you're going to find is that Makeda is going to grab this team by the throat just as he did against Navy take it in his own hands to try to make something happen to get back in the ball game gently pushes army back to the 27 yard line second down and 15 again to play back in the fittest Dan is in that pocket the brought up for grabs incomplete nearly picked off not once but twice yeah not a good decision that time and that's surprising Makeda usually does not throw into traffic and I think right now he's pressing a little bit remember we talked about him trying to make something happen well that's what he does here he doesn't have a guy open but nevertheless he throws the ball directly into coverage through the hands of spikes the inside linebacker he's lucky spikes didn't pick it off stops the clock with 1029 to play and a half for Auburn by 17 again a steps up and throws incomplete and climbing a ladder was lon Thomas Rodney Creighton the left corner right there on him well that's where the option offense really hurts you when you're in third and long it's very difficult to pick up the first down because you just don't practice throwing the ball that much you don't have the skills to do it that well such as we've seen by often today Jeff lured the kick takes a hop at the 41 picked up Robert Baker take the jaja take it nearest side and now I'm counting one two three and four five six yellow hankies are out the laundromat is open a whole 40yard kick a oneyard return and there's one of them there too right there on the return team illegal block in the back family be ten yards from the owner on first down there's a timeout with ten eleven to play in the first half Auburn on top of army by 17 this year 18,000 people got a new lease on life they got a new heart for a kidney or some other vital organ but over 41,000 people are still with Haven feels he's in the circle right there you're gonna see him just run down and commit the foul right now blocking the black back very very apparent nothing fancy about that nothing fancy so the Tigers will start at their own 24 yard line first and 10 the late by 17 the Tigers brought on first down well the eyes rusty William the pitch draw him down back of the 22 yard line Phillip in 21 Robyn has to be happy with what they've done defensively they have used their speed to really don't think that the option right now and now they're concerned about our me throwing the ball you see them making their adjustments reading the the routes and their coverages they lose in his fourth season 35 when my decease of 17year to play in the half great for you active Daymond Craig shows us some arm strength go far sideline and it's taken down by Robert Baker we beat Tom Bowens along the far sideline let's take you downstairs and check in with Merrill HOD hey Craig Craig and Rodney I was behind the Army bench in the defense when they came off the field hey guys I was shocked there's not a lot of enthusiasm and I looked into the guys faces they've plainly shocked and there was a few adjustments but there's not a lot of enthusiasm not what I expected when I walked back there you know they're having a bit of a flashback to the Syracuse game because that's the way that game started and they felt they could compete with his team and that wouldn't happen like it did against Syracuse for right now it's deja vu so a confident tingle on me when we talked to them yesterday pitch play tough hit Fred Beasley took it and Stephen King dished it out his second tackle over the afternoon and they have to bring the sticks out to measure this one that Stephen King well the other Stephen King and you want to see a bit of a nightmare watch Stephen King to deliver a blow right here as he comes across bang they make that into a movie or a story for some of the guys on Auburn inside linebacker we're 66 1 to 30 out of Austin Texas a twoyear Letterman first down from the 35 and again that middles getting kind of tough to run through well I don't expect opera to be able to run the football I just don't see how that's going to happen Mike Winco was the man who came up and made the tackle that time army now runs the defense at Arizona made popular a couple of years ago that desert swarm where they have five defensive linemen and they really put pressure on the linemen and the backs they really try and take away the running game mat effect army went out to Arizona and learn how to implement the defense here actually you always have one player that you can't get to you get kind of a roaming linebacker out there in a bubble off the right side again spreads easily running behind Thomasson roll to Beasley a great great high school player at robert e lee high school and a montgomery alabama rowdy scored 62 touchdowns in his high school career you know you were talking about that bubble yeah well seventy two S's was the guy who was selected back and he was the one that was hard to get to and he actually came around and helped make that play you were absolutely right about that defense being tough to block serving the guys 7:10 and County first half 17 nothing Auburn third down eight four wide receivers shot for the Tigers Raygun chop wide okay did he get a putdown oh they're gonna give it to him after 45 Wow I don't know it looked from here like he was out of bounds but you know we are long ways away Willie go say and huh I'd say we got to see this again because he did some fancy footwork to keep up to keep a toe in ya don't watch the front but watch the back foot well he oh he did drag that foot that's pretty nice the left leg he kept up high and he dragged the right one as a nice little posing 17yard passport look like a little Heisman you know yeah first and ten from the 46 I formation we'll play action by plague plenty of time go for the post pattern incomplete he was looking down filled with Tyrone Hudson covered by Augustus a flag is down in the Auburn Auburn backfield I think they're gonna flag them for holding but what about the job Damian Craig has done so far today look at that comparison he's already thrown for 205 yards completed 14 out of 22 touchdowns on the other side Ronnie Makeda has had a tough day so far has not completed a pass and really hasn't been very effective at all for AMI those numbers speak volumes as you take a look at the other side of the football field on the data on Keita no yards passing but 16 yards rushing but really what I what army needs right now is to make a play defensively to give their team and a certain lift they haven't had anything really positive happen so they need to make a play to try to get something happening here before the half the seven minutes ago Becca's doc 25 again playaction and of course is a quick flow by Jamie and Craig Tyrone Goodson's I could come back and nearly made the catch up to 47 yard line well but they got another hit on Damian Craig well you got helmet yeah you know the mud now you see the mud on him that's showing you that they're bringing more pressure and getting to him they're a little bit afraid of that because it means man coverage but now they're bringing instead of four or five guys see what happens here they get pressure on him they get another hit on him each and every time they hit them that's to their advantage take it down want to call that third down of 25 now a timeout Kraig calls timeout so Terry Bowden wants to talk about it 6:46 until halftime we'll be back when I started losing my hair at law that man I there's number 55 one of our burns fine linebackers take your spikes I called me mr. spikes he can run can't whoa he is fast five wide receivers for the Tigers third down 25 got them disinfection over the middle complete for the goat cheese guy in this first half has been Willy go Shea had another reception to his total you know I don't get this you know army is bringing four guys against nobody in the backfield they have no running backs to help protect five guys out on receive on routes you can't put pressure on the quarterback like that I understand Omni is afraid of the mantoman coverage back there but you can't let that quarterback sit back there and pick you apart and we talked to the defensive coordinators they said hey if we see it we'll bring it they don't like to blitz though they're not a blitzing defense but if they get the opportunity they said they would send a backer well they said they would send five pretty much all the time but they were sending four against five linemen and five receivers out on routes you just can't win a matchup like that now the officials have have huddled at the 37 our referee today is Jim Vogel dance well how about the job Terry Bowden is doing offensively he's calling the plays for his team today his brother has named the head coach at Tulane and so now there are three Bowden's who are head coaches in Division one college football division 1a I should say keep in mind there are only four africanamerican head coaches so they're almost as many Bowden coaches his africanamerican head coaches and there are a hundred and eleven look at the Tigers possessions they start at their twenty six nine plays to get the field goal than a touchdown they fumble then a touchdown on their fourth possession and right now is shot in their own 24 and this one is this will be the ninth play of the drive and the drive you expect from Army yeah third down call it a yard this time army showing blitz had come up in shoestring tackle Damian Craig cut weeka number 44 made the shoestring tackle but a first down for the Tigers now let's see I thought they got a good spot or not well even if they didn't get it I presume that that man will go for it on fourth down and they've been moving the ball pretty well and you're inside army territory you might as well go for it on fourth down if you haven't picked it up already where originally the officials spotted that football at the 35 now it's back around 236 so they're gonna bring the chains out I think they're gonna be short yeah I think you may be right but I think you go for it yeah they're very short short by at least a footballs length that brings up fourth down less than a yard terry bowden will make the decision coached at Salem College Sanford his 13 year record 99 45 and to some big games for Terry Bowden some pressures been on him lost their last two regular season games looking for his one 14:40 usually spin first down Auburn up to 32 once again up front Auburn doing a great job offensively their line really firing out opening up the hole making it easy for Beasley to pick up the first down and remember what Meryl talked about leverage getting underneath well how about the job that number 68 Victor Riley did he got his pads underneath and just crushed his man big hole there you know Craig you were talking about Terry about and being under some pressure that you remember he started 11 and OH at Auburn in fact 20 you know before he lost his first ballgame at a lot of of course of pet dies kids for very young team 11th play of this Drive big opening rusty Williams picks up eight maybe nine to the 23 yard line he has a young team remember when he took over the program at Auburn you see the record 11 and oh and then 911 94 he did have some guys from Pat dyes era but also Auburn was on probation he had a tough time recruiting so now he has numbers that are down not a lot of seniors but it struggled in close ballgame system that post games Envy festivals last two two games of the season flags are down before the snap prior to snap outside on the defense family make it a first down Oh the penalty automatic first down and we talked about the close games you take a look at LSU that was a fourpoint loss Florida knocked out by what 41 and then look at the last two games round of the season 5649 Georgia four overtimes in an Alabama by one yeah you win two of those three ballgames no one's complained down a first down from the 18 yard line i formation the pitch play Rusty Williamson nice tackle in the backfield big number 93 that's Mike corpora who came in and make that play and he is actually in store Larry angles number 76 corporate does not get that many snaps but he he was the right man at the right place that time an uber needed a play they are in danger of me not army needed to play they're in danger of having Auburn put another score up and you know Merrill told you that if they were hanging their heads before another score now those heads might go a lot lower under four minutes to play and a half suck it down 14 played the fivestep drop fires at dark to the far side and the catch is made nope incomplete Carsten Bailey had a really try to dig it out of the turf Carsten Baylor the sophomore from Sharpsburg Georgia they see him points himself he said you know my bad I was there I should have had it just dropped it throw it to me again he what he wants to get in on the fun because everybody else is running down the field catching touchdown passes and he hasn't had one yet Tyrone Goodson's been in on some big plays from Damien Craig during the season Carson Bailey was Damian Drake's favored wide receiver with forty five receptions 14th play of his drive five wide receivers set third down 14 are nice and a break all they sent cut week a 44 came in untouched the inside linebacker well remember we talked earlier about nobody in the backfield and how they were not putting the pressure on well now they come with the pressure there you see Danny Dornbos the defensive coordinator who's finally gone with it and again Craig is down that's another hit on him this time he's on the field not getting up and obviously nobody wants to see Damian Craig get hurt he's grabbing his neck there but certainly army understands that in order to have a chance to win the ballgame they have to put pressure on the quarterback they have to hit him well they took a chance deep inside their own territory and came after Craig with with Kawika anytime you put your quarterback in the backfield you don't have running backs to protect him you expose him to these kinds of hits to guys coming in cleanly getting shots on him that time it was Stephen King number 60 who got the big hit on him and you saw Craig went right down hold it while they it's into D me and Craig will step aside we'll keep you updated 329 to play and a half in this football game and he's been down since we've been away and now you see him for the first time roll over on his back and now begins to set up and Hut Sveta's that is relief for for Tiger fans yeah more than just Tiger fans that's the relief for everyone to appreciate competition you don't want to see anybody hurt like that and to see him walk off the field is tremendous after the shot he took takes the helmet off he took a glancing blow it was a second man through Stephen King yeah watch number 60 coming into the screen from your left you'll see him show up right now here's the blow he delivers and you see how Damian Craig's head was down and he took that blow right on the left the right side of his head and immediately grabbed his helmet in pain it continued to take a look at Diamond Creek John Cooley is plagued back up with senior on a Sarasota this will be a 49yard field goal attempt by Jared Holmes is up and through so from 49 yards Jared Holmes bills that Tiger lead to 23 15 to play and a half as they continue to look at prey a new set of academics Gangrel Independence Bowl in Shreveport Louisiana Auburn Tigers on top of army by 20 there's a guy with a pretty good leg in my book Jared Holmes just kicked one from 49 he's got a leg on him I'm a pretty good kicker rod Thomas for army at his own goal line here at home feathered feet up line drive kick Ron Thomas at the goal line Thomas at the 20 Thomas after 25 and on second effort bangs down to the 28 yard line let's go downstairs and Merrill Hyde well thanks Craig I'm with the special guest Lieutenant General Dan Crispin and general as HR superintendent of the Academy in general nuts had a great success this year what is that done for the Academy it's brought the spirits up to an absolute feet you can hear that in the background with the cadets right now but I think it's also focused the interest in the attention of America on a lot of what's going on extremely well across the board and all the service academies not just Forks good academics for military one thing about these men I know that they never give up I know they're down 20 points right now but you don't expect them to give up no service academy look who never gives up we'll be back well thanks sir let's go back to the top guys thank you very much threestar general they know how to say how about what Jean Georges Pete Marshall the chief of staff for the army said World War two I want an officer for a secret and dangerous mission I want a Western football player yeah so I get out to laughing down the sideline big gainer Jeff Brissac took the pitch from akkada but this is a twominute option yeah yeah they've got three minutes actually 229 now to get a score and when they do that they don't throw the ball they go to the wide option you know it pitched the ball counter option first down for the Black Knights at the 44 yard line Bob Sutton pacing the sideline a 6year arrived the fullback yoyou it Jimmy Brumbaugh made the tackle tomorrow be sure to tune in to ABC sports for the granddaddy of them all the Rose Bowl number two arizona state battles fourth ranked Ohio State New Year's Day 4:30 Eastern on ABC Sports I love saying granddaddy at all how good is that one gonna be you got Jake Plummer you know you got Orlando face with a bronze Springs at corner some great matchups in that ballgame second down eight Mikayla going up top got a man detective pulldown bobbing Williams the left halfback in the Black Knights with her best field position at the 22 well the thing about the option is that it will lower you to sleep in that time they picked on one of the defensive backs for Auburn number 25 Martinez Houston he got lured into sweep because he's been up tackling the option up close he forgets to pick up his man he runs way down the field Bobby Williams picks it up Auburn's and Army is in business only his fourth reception of the season a 33 yard pickup to the 21 yard line Makeda the quarterback keeper at the 5 to the 3 big drive by the Black Knights as we head down the halftime of 1:30 left on the clock when a general tells you to come back you come back look at the hole to the left side easily to run through that great blocking again by Doug Chadwick and Dave beard opening up that hole over there and mikata got right in behind it 18 yard gain first and goal from the 3 yard line you at the fullback Bobby Williams was it just a coincidence we had a threestar general telling them to come back and now they're right back ninth rushing touchdown for Bobby Williams on a 90 pound sophomore from Kingston North Carolina and Williams was the man the big play was the catch he made over martavius Houston to set up the touchdown extra point Joseph Parker a shift in this wondrous season 40 or 40 and make it 41 of 41 so the drought is over for Army Robert now their lead little down to 20 to 7 pretty impressive Drive nice pass and run mix now watch the blocking there good blocking by the tight end number 84 Ron leshenka we told about how Wyszynski is such a good blocker great effort that time and opened up the hole for Williams to get in for that score nice second effort on the play as well Rodney Creighton at 158 pounds the right corners try to take on Bobby Williams but Williams able to plow in for the first touchdown of this game here for Army 84 lijinsky is such a good locker and he weighs about 240 pounds as a tight end and that's why he's a prospect he can block like that and he can catch the ball the rod psychologically should going to halftime with 115 this that drive that drive huge you can't you can't even probably put it on the map huge absolutely huge for that team you don't see any guys hanging their heads right now let's go downstairs an update John Damian Craig Merrill hey Craig and riding to talk to the team doctor Damian Craig as a bruised neck but he will be back playing back to you guys so Auburn will get their quarterback back they get a chance at the one let's see if he comes in on this series before half I would certainly keep him out until the second half with the men in 15 is over Volken puts it away good to hop at the 18 and a nice return by Eric Heinz Tucker to the 33 yard line let's check in with Chris Fowler who's in Norland hey Chris hey guys that's why coming up on our new Dodge halftime report the final 48 hours of preparation for the Nokia Sugar roll will also check in and Pasadena for the Rose report on the eve of the granddaddy of them all and installing his last Sam will preview the Outback Bowl Crimson Tide against Michigan plus Tommy Bowden the new Tulane coach will join us God knows our burn very well all right thanks Chris what about did you balance all over the everywhere but you know they don't seem to miss Tommy too much today they're moving pretty efficiently and often they me and Greg has returned first a from boot comes out brawling he hooks up and complete with Gaucher has been the man in this first half a senior out of Fort Walton Florida only 18 catches on the season he's been the man he's he's a guy that knows how to run to I mean once he gets the ball he could do something with it but you know all those Auburn guys are like that I mean they run with the ball after the catch Willard goes Jay today with already in this first half seven catches for a hundred eight yards first and ten from the 49 they set up the screen as the heavy pressure from Army by Keith Cooper scoots out of bounds at the 47 yard line a nice onehanded kit as you see the clock is at 52 seconds a good decision by Cooper to get out of bounds he could have turned that thing up the field but he realized he wouldn't get much yardage and it was better to preserve the clock Markieff Cooper only honored and 56 pounds a true freshman and a Miami roll control Robert Bakker you talked about 17 cooper being a small guy only 156 pounds ahead time he went out and helped his quarterback with a big Brock and number 72 CW Estes and Estes is 260 pounds but the old number 17 didn't seem to have much of a problem sticking his nose in their ice school allamerican ran for almost 4,000 yards 35 touchdowns 18 hundred yards his senior year yeah third down and four shotgun demon prey look at the protection the public pops Craig's gonna tuck it on and runs out of bounds at the 36 that stops the clock with 37 seconds left and a half coming up on the new Dodge halftime report stick around Cowboys in the news and interesting developments today Chris Fowler and company of course in New Orleans and Tommy Bowden will join us at halftime on the new Dodge halftime report first and 10 from the 36 almond with a 22 7 we've got his death on a few more before halftime then his break airs at deep Robert Baker makes the catch down inside the 15 to the 12 yard line Craig is just speed right now and army really doesn't have enough of it that ball was in the air a long time our army was playing a too deep coverage the safety should be able to make this play look how long this ball is in the air he throws it very high but you can't see anyone getting over there for army to make the play just not enough speed in the second a garland gay made the tackle a 27 yard pass reception winner Greg again for a fire Istanbul but look like he signaled it was an incomplete pass over there but it looked to me like that ball was clearly Carsten Bailey made the reception but he took the hard pop the ball came out who had possession when it came out if he if he caught the ball and then it was knocked out in and out of bounds and silly it's still all burns ball and if he never had possession if he named complete Pat there's Jim Fogle pants so that spot is at the 4 yard line well yeah you can't fumble it forward and have someone else recovered it's it's the old you know Oakland Raider roof from years ago when Dave Kasper fumbled the ball forward we went recovered in the end zone to score a touchdown and now the ncdoublea is the NFL doesn't allow a player to fort to fumble forward recover it in the end zone so you go back and put it where he's humble hold on now what's going on army comes off the field they'll be armies they're saying he fumbled it out of the end zone if he fumbled it out of the end zone okay it's a touchback it does hit the pylon okay take a look watch the ball at the end after bailey gets hit and the ball comes out does it go out of bounds before it hits the pylon or not it does hit the pylon okay good ball all right yeah it's took a while to sort it out but that's correct right because initially the official was ruling that it didn't hit the pylon that it went out of bounds and he couldn't give him the ball on the 1yard line bottles play here and a half what an ending to this the first half here at the Independence Bowl run indicate it takes a knee and we count down to final seconds six five zero Bob Sutton of arming rod will go into the half time down by 13 let's take you to New Orleans Chris Fowler standing by for halftime Chris guys thank you just down the river from where you are across from the Superdome they're getting ready of course for the Nokia Sugar Bowl in 48 hours Lee Corso Kirk Herbstreit and two lanes new coach Tommy badwin will join us on the new Dodge halftime report obviously your team distraught without you there at all Tigers 27 other cadets if your tools are looking a little more rusty than trusty turn to the folks in the red bass half time here in Shreveport Louisiana Independence Bowl Auburn with a 22:7 lead over army you know in it and rod we knew that Damian Craig could throw the football I in run the football he did a great combination of the two let's take a look at some first half numbers 356 total yards for the Auburn Tigers 111 for army yeah and that's the key look at that 111 right there for army their game plan was to control the football heck they haven't even been on the field enough to control the football they got to do a better job with that in the second half and you see the passing yardage there 284 yards to Auburn that's Damian pretty army will have the football to start the third quarter the kick bounces into the end zone touch that dice will start at their own 20yard line and rod no question we talked to some army people during a halftime this is a big big possession to start this third quarter they have some momentum as they went into halftime with the touchdown to make it 22 seventh yeah big possession big drive for that man right there Ronny Makeda and you know that suddenness of thinking that he's got to have a drive to start the second half to get his team back into it they're not too far away Craig we start the third quarter army from her own 20yard lines in this direction and Bobby Williams wrapped up after a three yard game by taking yo spikes his fifth tackle of this game a pickup of three to the 25yard line Barmes data the handoff not much for Bobby Williams well you know what Ronnie mechana does as a quarterback and particularly an option quarterback he always looks to run the ball where there are five or fewer Auburn Tigers and that is the the basis of the option you count numbers and you run where you count the fewest number of defenders if draw a line down the middle of the field you find the five or a four you run it over there third down and four they start right and try to back up the middle Demetrius parry the ball carrier well you know that the army running game has not been doing much they I believe he's really miss Joe Hewitt his 839 yards really count and they haven't been able to break anything today and he's the kind of player that can do that for them he would only carry the ball one time in the first half for one yard so three up and three down army forced a punt Scott Lord Robert Baker and he has slammed down inside the 45 to the 44 yard line get tackled by Scott Eichelberger Craig now the things to see is what happens to the quarterback through the second half you know first half we know that Craig had a great first half he threw the ball very well did a much better job of moving his team then army did there you see the comparison 284 yards for Damian Craig only 33 for running Makeda looked for army to bring more pressure in the second half at least five guys the game turned around when the pressure was applied by by the Black Knights four wide receivers set from the shotgun first in ten all burned from the 45 what they mean great didn't move a muscle still got the ball long enough to crashing Bailey and Bailey to the 42 yard line you see that that was about as patient as you'll see a quarterback he didn't move a muscle just his arm just his right arm no leg movement just his right on well you know he's got the time that time there were five guys coming once again but he just took his time and you'll see there's gonna be a little bit of action coming that way you got to see him really take his time you see the cross there there comes keying up the middle they picked up the Blitz first down for that showing blitz pinking in from the outside for got weak good incomplete so there you go you throw some pressure and down on his back his Damian Craig well that time they brought it off the corner it was caught week at that time 44 coming off the left side because there was not a back in there to protect Damian Craig and when they see that they have now made it an automatic no backs you bliss any great showing how much no signs of that bruised neck that he suffered late in the second quarter again the blimp design God we get to a payment Craig but not before Willie Gosha got his hands on the football yeah you know they're bringing the pressure again the dilemma though for Army as they champs late tight coverage in the secondary so all Craig is doing is jumping the ball off before the Blitz gets there hey the guys in the army secondary are afraid to give to the receivers because they may run right past them third down and six again for wide receivers low snap Greg pumpkin fighters over the middle and complete Tyrone Goodson stretching out down inside the 20yard line that stops a clock with 12 17 to play third quarter well he had him over the middle and Goodson ran the route and he was open and he probably should have come up with that ball was a little bit high but it hit his hands and any time you get your hands on the ball as a receiver you've got to make the catch first punt today for Auburn Jerrod Holmes will handle the duties averages 42 yards a kick as long as 60 this is gonna have to be what he what you call a pooch Oh hi hi kick and it bounces two yards deep so army will have it we come back at their own 2012 oh nine to play third quarter back to Shreveport after this honey why you can kiss that promotion goodbye Jordan your account funnel on one the oughta pick Susie twice I'm doing and where that dry clean life

car rental great cars in over 50 countries around the world best of all its riches Craig bowler Jack rod Gilmore Merrill Hodge back in Freeport for the Independence Bowl Auburn with a 20 to 7 lead on army the cadets back for the second possession of this third quarter in rod we talked about how big the first possession what was three up and three down in a punt and then defensively the cadets came back till the Auburn remember what happened early in this game to start this game Tiger just marched down and made it look easy but a good defensive stance haha impressive is this young defense for Auburn and we talked about one senior and one junior out there and look for freshmen and five sophomores they've been playing at Simon football they have not blown one assignment yet a oneyard pickup brings up second down and not much about the down one pursuit 555 kpo spikes Takeo Spikes is a guy that's fast we talked about that earlier he can outrun mistakes he can outrun blockers he shows up in the middle of your screen and he just runs right past anybody who wants to block him or won't have speed like that you can go get him he is a man who glides firstteam all Southeast Conference and a former high school allamerican and a Georgia player of the year the list just goes on and on for spikes Owosso on 3rd down 10 at gate on the Optive the fact Iran will lose a couple back to the 18 yard line Leonardo Kyson chased him down number 95 the Frenchman from Mobile Alabama you know and those young guys are playing tremendous options defense and they are playing their assignments perfectly that time Ryan McKay had no place Makeda had no place to go he couldn't pitch it he couldn't turn it up the kick to Baker at the 36 Baker nearly broke it at midfield so the Tigers will have fine field

Ron Thomas check that all the go shake her go she is having a big day and he was the Tigers leading receiver last season with fifty eight catches came back this year and wasn't the top receiver wasn't even one of the starters initially Malati said it spread it around with Carson Bailey and Tyrone Goodson Robert Baker Shayne's are on their way out with a far sideline from the far sideline to the near sideline and the stretch first down Auburn at the 38 let's see if our burn heats in someone to help protect Craig as they throw the football they threw the quicker out that time now they're back in there I've formation where they tend to pound the football with a cough sweet play Fred give him the plaid rusty Williams's feedback rusty Williams five yards to the 34 yard line let's check in with Merrill hi Merrill thanks Greg you know the spirit of Independence award was awarded the first time in 1977 to General Omar n Bradley who at the time was the only living fivestar general in 1914 he was a starter for the army team as a center in 1943 was a personal representative to delight the Eisenhower after 1977 he presented the award all the way up into 81 until he passed away to which they then added his name to the trophy because he stood for everything the award was for courage strength commitment and patriotism it's kind of ironic guys that this award I think patan the glove with army but this is the first time Army has ever played in the Independence Bowl back to you guys how will said today that award will be given out veterans for America and complete fast stops o'clock with 902 remaining in the third quarter another third down big third down for Army they can't afford to let Auburn pick up another first down and get a score here this is what Sutton was talking about they need to come up on third down with plays wide receivers breed with a front side it goes look started a fuel and a collision Carsten Bailey they threw in a triple coverage that time and some big hit and going on Robert Brown led the way yeah Robert Brown almost picked his fall off he's going to be in the center of the field you'll see him as he'll show up there he has bottom of your screen to the left he reads it perfectly he just doesn't come up with the play that would have been huge for army perfect read good job would have been a great job if he'd caught it Robert Brown a junior in the San Antonio fourth down at five and a interesting call right here by Terry Bowden from the shotgun fourth and five from the 33 yard line out of trouble Damian Drake down the sideline he's going to walk in Damian Craig touchdown you know that is a guy who is just a tremendous athlete the Blitz was brought from the outside caught weak up 44 came in Craig gave him a juke and then he went down the sideline that's just a case of one athlete being better than another watch Craig here comes the pressure he just gets around it and then there's nobody there because of the pressure coming he scampers for 33 yards and a touchdown huge fourth down play Guddi fourth down call ya gotta give Terry Bowden credit for that terry bowden now he wants a timeout Oh Craig he was in an area of the field where he couldn't cut it and he figured he didn't like the bill go options they'll go ahead and go for the first down so Damian Craig takes the hat off he wants to talk to his coach 851

seven you know beginning of the game we talked about Donovan McNabb and how Craig is so similar to him well you've seen McNab make plays like this make a guy mist pressure and mantoman coverage now there's nobody there this is just a sprint and you're not gonna catch that guy from behind he is very fast well the Big Ten meets the SCC in the Outback Bowl 16th ranked Alabama battles 15 ranked Michigan at the Outback Bowl in Tampa Jeanne Stalin's coaches his last game for the Crimson Tide that's tomorrow 11:00 a.m. Eastern 8:00 Pacific gotta get up early on the on the west coast right yeah the Barrow but you know you got to be I'll take a look at the scoring drive again Craig the 33 yard run again free passes to rushes but got to be up on New Year's Day the tip to Ron Thomas and Thomas really hasn't had a lot of opportunity to get to get out of the end zone that one drops five yards deep well now army once again is feeling the pressure they have got to move the football I really believe Craig they're going to have to get something in this third quarter if they're going to have a chance in the fourth quarter to make this thing happen if they're going to get a chance to win it now the pressure lies on that young man Ronnie Nevada 851 to play third quarter twenty six seven Auburn well the one thing that Auburn has done a good job of is forcing the army to run the fullback dive on first down they're dictating that the Army is going with it but the inside guys are playing well it shows that man right there Damian Craig he had a huge first half and came back with a nice play in the second half three tight end set for army yeah really packing it in suck it out eight he was running on a stormy sea hoping her off the right side Brad where brought him down at the 34 yard line if you had a question about you woods Nia Roger he was moving left and right for the will you see why they miss him and he's the guy that can break a tackle or two and keep drive going and really start to chew up the clock keep the Auburn office off the field and lead towards an army score second carry of the day a 12 yard pickup on a first down what a time of possession hasn't worked in their favor today it has all season long but not today this time they run left side Bobby Williams yeah you really think right now army is getting a lip from you at being in the ball game the fact that he's got the bad knee he comes out there breaks off a run and is in there now to help and block I think the guys are looking around him and saying he's the inspiration really if he's not going to quit neither a week do it picked up 12 Bobby Williams comes back with a 13yard pickup first and 10 army at the 48 inside Auburn territory to the 48 yard line is Hewitt that man right there in the middle is a pretty good football player pile Scott sinner he's been playing really well watch him in the middle of the screen look at the doubleteam he gets right here good blocking when he blocked like that they can run the ball inside behind him and that's a good block on the nose moving him out of the way do it out limped off and Demetrius parry back in he gets the football and rips off six seven yards for the 43 ion excuse me a you what you talked about the emotional lift that last play he did hobble off yeah they're gonna need him at least his presence anyway and parry almost look like he brought that was gonna lose that ball he's about to come out there then you see you it on the sideline Lee Gibson number 31 checks in okay now they're down to their third string pull back knocking over a blue jersey is Bobby Williams Jimmy Brumbaugh kind of a quiet game but yet his fifth tackle number 96 for Auburn well that's a matchup you know you and I talked about we've watched today Kyle's got 55 against Jimmy Brumbaugh 96 and 96 Brumbaugh has been getting the better of it for most of the ball game the last series or so it's been a real good struggle in there a real good fight Bron Bron a secondteam allsec selection only a sophomore now the King stone Heights Florida little stumble but Demetrius very able to regather his steps there is you and on the sidelines you know he was wearing a big brace on that left leg and I think they're checking that now yet they are we saw him to practice the other day and that brace is huge but he was able to run straight ahead with it it doesn't really cut very well with that on injured that knee a couple of weeks ago against Navy also handsome hamstring problems lot of times when you he heard a knee you'll also hurt the hamstring and he's made a incredible comeback to even suit up in his football again misdirection off the left side Bobby Williams again maybe two into the thirty four and now this is really sort of an army dry they are getting three four yards they're chewing up yardage running the cloth if they can go down and get a score here even if it takes in the third quarter they'll be in pretty good shape here you see their coordinator Gregory up there he's right there in the middle Greg Gregory trying to be patient a nice play of this rod rod third down and three and they continue to attack the front Rumbaugh again the tackle on ferry yeah I think he picked it up but even if he's sharp I guarantee you army will go for it here well this is the longest sustained drive of the day for the cadets it is a fourth down and Greg Gregory is a real Jam look and he's sending guys and they're gonna go for here Sutton is totally in agreement with this he told us yesterday he'll go for it anywhere on the field right now they need to have the football they need to score they have no choice they have to go the Gibson to fullback under the 30yard line is Jeff Brissac an army will have a fresh set of downs nothing fancy about that I mean that is just man man blocking tough football do you want the first down or not red Gregory like to watch the block and your man on man 55 once again Kyle Scott good blocking and then Brissac just lowers his shoulder gets in there well he was able to read the block as well yeah not much off the right side but I wasn't back inside up the middle I wasn't sure about the spot but I thought he had picked it up and they're gonna measure this now but I thought he had clearly picked it up and he does buy a half of football so a first down at the 30 yard line Bob Sutton if army can take this thing in here Craig you will see not only the army sideline but the cadets come to life here a canids gonna go on to yeah first and 10 from the 30 of Auburn and that time the the ground jumped up and took down Demetrius Perry let's check in with Merrill hi hey Craig and Rodney joy Joe Hewitt Hewitt came over to the sidelines the doctors took his brace off checked these knee and then gave him a boxer's you're done so don't expect him to come back to break this off guys have come and cut over to could stall him but he won't be back in the game now you have the the ice it looks like packed on top of that left knee his season is over but his career is not he is only a sophomore they get out Jen from the 34 that time Makena road Demetrius Perry for a long time you are absolutely right I mean he put that ball in there and then he took it out he was waiting a long time for just watch the quarterback and the fullback look how long that football is in there he finally decides I'll let you have it Perry look back and say okay yeah I guess it's mine and I looked at the reaction Makeda he was disappointed he wanted to take it back out because the open the outside opened up for him yeah Perry took it turned drive 12 plays they chewed five and a half minutes off the clock nice gstring tackle for that 95 as winner Carson Carson did a great job he was actually being blocked you can't be blocked from time to time but you still have to make plays get off the block and make something happen Carson did that time you know Carson played I can't believe this but he played quarterback as a junior in high school sir he's put on some weight he's six to 273 but he's had a great year yeah he can play that defense of that spot big quarterback back at Shaw High School in Mobile Alabama huh he could look over the line a 240 to go third quarter we'll come back to Shreveport after this learn straight from his daddy some days his shoulder get so sore with just about falling off but he take two Tylenol but hours later the pain would come back and have to take more he'd get frustrated so our doctor suggested believe I can take just two leave all day with Tylenol that's taken update so he tried to leave keeps his pain away up to 12 hours helped more than you're gonna happen don't get paid for doing that elite allday strong all day long the producer of aliens terminator to 33% Homo Sapien party we talked about gradual extinction of the human race the relic not Friday January 10th jessic Jesse you're next I'm all yours save it for the stage Romeo Carroll always gives it to me straight like when she told me about my I told him about Head &amp; Shoulders regular shampoos just rinse flakes away so they could come back Head &amp; Shoulders helps prevent flakes from even forming you see the difference you look great Thanks but will it get me this part couldn't hurt Head &amp; Shoulders because great hair can't have flakes hey break a leg the pullin weedeater independence bold to forty to play third quarter army looking at again rod a fourth down and 323 big fourth down they need this here and they may go to their big man to their big fight in the simpson also gunning in the lineup the motion man is gryszek up top go for the home run ball contact in the red zone incomplete no flags anywhere army looking for the flags they were trying to get the Kris Dunning one of their tight ends surprising that they would try to go deep down the field I thought they would try to get the first down with lijinsky but it was really Dunning that they went after two tight ends to the right side the bunting goes down deep not fooled at all Auburn back in good coverage look at the play that Creighton number 10 makes out there and again a young player a freshman stepping up to make a good play for Auburn and Makeda has just not been able to make the big plays when his team is needed it this afternoon will adjourned the ball over on downs Auburn whether 26 to 7 lead will start up at the 23 in Prague playaction fatsteps trouble goes down the middle wide open a lot of catch by Baker 49 yards yeah there was pressure look at the blocking here you're gonna see this quarterback Craig have plenty of time even with pressure from the outside and he's gonna find the route down the middle good pocket protection look at him buy time now steps up he's got his man in the middle he's wide open there Robert Baker had the ball been right on the money he would still be running but what a great catch by Baker who had to lay out here and pick it up first of gin of the Army's 28 yard line Lindy and Craig over the middle again and complete Tyrone Goodson took a pop at the 5yard line hard hit Robert Brown said hello and that's the way you play deep safety football you can't let guys run down the middle and catch the ball on you Auburn's been doing it all day finally Brown says enough of this watch a team show up now with a big hit and makes separation guys will catch the football Craig but every now and then you got to knock it out of there and Brown knock that one away from Goodson Goodson still down you know as a wide receiver Rodney you played defensive back yourself you know you know you come across the middle the train is going to hit you once in a while yeah you know and actually Auburn has been taking advantage of the fact that the train has been late most of the day but now army comes through with a big hit sending a magic thing we've had enough of that that man sent the message there Robert Brown and Goodson looks like he's gonna be okay he's sitting up like that probably got the wind knocked out of him Tyrone Goodson 88 career receptions before the start of this game a 2nd team pick in the all Southeast Conference watch they hit again here a big shot and look at the look at how he just snapped back from that hit and then he gets another hit once again from someone else coming in it looks like it was number 16 at Queen Co so he actually got two hits on the play you gotta hit like that you hope you can hang on to the ball I don't think the body was made to to move that way let's face it the body was not meant to play football you're right oh that's good good good Sun is up a junior Brooksville Florida at Central High School he was a pretty good quarterback out there made a name for himself everybody talked about him he was really an outstanding recruit when he came out everybody flocked down the brook still to try to recruit him you know rod it's amazing when you're on college football and you you'll read players BIOS how many times had kids recruited to play one position they get a year or two later they wind up playing a totally different spot offense or G Ben Lum went up the middle rusty Williams inside the 15 to the 13 yard line you know we've talked about the great job Auburn's done up front how about Riley I mean his pass blocking has been great but he has just been blowing guys off the line of scrimmage whenever they run the ball he's a big man 321 pounds firstyear starter that he's played like a veteran today Victor Reilly a secondteam allsec selection person 10 Auburn at the 13 yard line from the eye and a pushin of the nose guard Golic turns makes the jump or was he drawn off drawn off Sunday night 8 p.m. Eastern it's national hockey night on ESPN Brendan Shanahan leaves he Detroit Redwings against Tony Imani had the Chicago Blackhawks check it out Sunday night on ESPN aren't you impressed with how Damian Craig has responded to the injury had in the first half knocked around bruised neck came back in the second half and has been just as effective in the second half 23 of 36 rod 361 yards 2 touchdowns in Independence Bowl record what it came through the year well done rusty well done rusty you know he moved like that train and Starlight Express rusty you know he just opened up chewed out there got that good thing going and made the touchdown and now Auburn is rolling like a train Williams a redshirt freshman 18 yards for his fifth touchdown of 1996 104 to play third quarter in Auburn really pulling away at 32 7 the extra point to come and rusty Williams is a guy who almost went to Notre Dame until he took his recruiting visit and found out how cold it was inside nope not gonna go they're gonna stay in the south watch what rusty Williams does once again on this touchdown run i formation counter you see good blocking once again offensive line but he makes the cuts in the middle of the field to get himself open into the end zone and James keager number 52 the offensive lineman who's the sinner did a nice job at the point of attack great block I'm sure rusty Williams went over to him and say thanks partner nice block Auburn wants to go for two and now they've had to call a timeout you know I think there might have been some confusion because they had the ball back at the 2 yard line that they had to move a backup to the 3 we talked about that earlier that there was a miss let's just say the chalk wasn't put down correctly od glides right before the ballgame there yes he's right there see they had that right there it's a 2 yard line well that's for the NFL this is college you got to put that line right there and Damian Craig he was upset because they had the ball at the 3 goes no there's there's the chalk chalk line yeah he was wrong but our guy was on the spot maril Hodge was out there inspecting everything before the game brought it to folks attention and also found out that the goal posts were a little crooked lean about a foot to the right I guess the I did tape measure with him and everything is that why he was such a great running back with the Steelers well he he ran sideways anyway so I mean he that looks normal to Merrill yeah yeah that's that's Merrill hi does his perspective but it is it does lean actually it's leaning to the left yeah he's not buying you dinner no he's not I'd say attendance today good crowd here in Shreveport 40 1367 six on hand to watch the Boland weedeater Independence Bowl twopoint try for Auburn for wide receivers Gregg had his man that's the second time Carsten Bailey was all by his lonesome on the back line of the endzone yeah well I'm the last twopoint conversion he had his man wide open in the back of the field and he just didn't get it there he's had trouble dropping that one in but that's about the only thing he hasn't done well today Damion Craig has been on top of everything else and Sutton is absolutely livid with his team they aren't getting it done defensively now we've been talking about Merrill hogs less weapons have his chance to defend himself Merrill go ahead Bell look can Rodney to a guy who doesnt run cook good tie so who took a heck of a shot I checked I mean he got a cut in the mouth but he's gonna be fine like all good football players he'll be right back in the action thank you guys I'm surprised he didn't take a shot at he didn't I set him up alright there's a look at Goodson after all that it's amazing just comes away with a cut I got on the mouth yeah he's tough guy yeah I did tough guy play that game that'll be a tough coach to coach it to what Terry Bowden has gone through at Auburn you win your first 20 ballgames and then people start talking about firing you because you only win seven another strong kick by Jared Holmes and one Thomas again forced to take an eighth the return has not been there for army today this man needs to return for them they need this man to get something going for them Army's had a great season that game against Navy was absolutely fantastic and that man Ron Makeda was the reason why and I'm sure right now you will not see any quit in this team they're gonna come fired up again running the option trying to knock off Auburn tough football against school record 10 wins for Army they get a first bowl appearance in eight years but gate on the keeper back and hit hard by Ricky Neal his six top of the afternoon and it'll mark his forward progress to the 22 well the problem for Army right now is that Auburn defensively is just too fast they are running pass blocks they're able to run down the outside of the option because army doesn't have a guy who can just go 80 yards onion winding down the third quarter second and seven Makeda in the pocket has plenty of Running Room at the 25 and brought down at the 31 yard line how about Ricki meal I'll tell you what he covered a lot of ground Ricki nailed the inside linebacker number 50 well Ricky Neal just showed you the speed that we're talking about I mean he's a guy at 227 pounds but watch how he gets out there and runs down Makeda he's in the middle of the screen you'll see him show up just after McCaleb gets out to the left side here now Makayla takes off Neal's gonna show up Neal shows up right there and closes the ground quickly and that's what's happening the army that can't outrun these guys the kid on the option and the pitch not much maybe two there's that man again guess what I can't at the end of the third quarter Albert all smiles leading army by thirty to seven announce Oviatt

cheers threestar general chestbumping I was classic we'll show it to here in just a second second down seven we'll hook up bronze Thomas thank you back here as we just came back from commercial who says that generals aren't fun check this out dan crispy threestar general I was gonna take a break the thing you missed was that at the end of that he gave a little chest bump there who said army guys on front there you go first in 10 army at the 46 quarterback keeper Makeda so he took a still at midfield at the 51 Nolan McLeod jumps off that bench and now he's trying to get back in that serious boat I think to a cook I was just talking to the TV camera that's all right I didn't know I was on that team suck it down five well misdirection and off Bobby Williams he's got spreaders feed one man to beat steps out at the 15yard line Bobby Williams a sophomore this is the way you attack speed you counter it you get people going one way William he's here and he's going to come around this way and you're going to get action going back that way well what happens with poverty they start going the wrong way that's called the counter they didn't even see him until it was too late 34 yard pickup and a first down of the 15 yard line again they're trying to get the Auburn defense deployed again they come right back with the same play other side of the field again yep you're exactly right that time Ricky Neal missed attack ain't you know he's the guy that's so fast you know was running around out there and over 50 well he ran again and that time he ran right past freezing one way to counter speed yeah block bloody under 13 and a half minutes to play great ahead Demetrius Perry and he was hit by brumbaugh and Carson yeah but you know Charles Dorsey number 91 though is the guy who made that play I mean defensive linemen who don't make tackles sometimes are up there making good plays allowing their teammates to make tackles and 91 Charles Dorsey did that the last time has been doing it all game long didn't get a lot of attention though unless he makes it back all right third down and seven inside the five of the log touchdown it was a late call but Perry pulls his way in for his seventh touchdown of the season dimitra's Perry was the man who's been replacing Phil you it and Perry was the one who carried it in there has been an able replacement not the same kind of runner only carried the ball 112 times this season to the 141 by you it but certainly nice run that play Joseph practiced with the extra point and he remains perfect on the season 42 of 42 12 44 to go here in Shreveport Auburn will the 32 14 lead over army we'll be back all right guys we got a 34 minutes turnaround on this and let's do it it can be five below zero or coming down in buckets it doesn't matter it doesn't buy you another second down to you but time isn't everything getting the job done right is it's a rare moment when they see us at all but now the second goes by that we're not looking out for them nighttimes the worst time for my heartburn if i don't block the stomach acid fast i don't sleep so which blocks the acid faster you tag them at hp200 it has more acid blockers than pepcid ac so tagamet works faster at the block acid that doesn't mean it's stronger it's just faster and it lasts for hours so i can get to sleep new tagamet HB 200 more acid blockers help block acid faster ESPN's presentation of the polling reheater independence ball is presented by poli maker of the woodsman chainsaw dollarfordollar feature her feature it's hard to beat a poem and in part by American Airlines something special in the air one of the many casinos along the Red River they're in Shreveport Auburn with a 3214 lead on army the kick robber Baker at the five take her to the 23 May to the 24 that's a robber faker doesn't back off no no and he didn't back off from that smoke even that wasn't fog he was running into but just the aftereffects of the cannon or the howitzer that went off for a while ago Damien Craig has had the game of his life tonight talking about his head coach and his backup coolie when uh they me and Craig was injured Julie was quickly off the bench and warming up but Auburn didn't have to go to him and has been Damian Craig all the way first and ten from the 23 Niger's has been effective on a quick out what a big day for a while' Gosha John Cooley who backs up Craig only throwing 38 passes on the season a senior out of Sarasota when he may get a chance to throw a couple of passes that the score continues the way the way it is be sure Terry Bowden with give him a chance to get in the ball game after Damian Craig has done pretty much what he wanted to do with the Army Black Knight oh the GCC dingy number 60 in the middle of the screen Kevin MacLeod sure saw him McLeod number 43 the pullback yeah well you know Stephen King can hit you and he's got to show up and just make a big play sometimes linebackers missed these shots when they get him but he didn't miss that one that was the 26th the first down for Auburn at ties Independence Bowl record this play some Running Room the rusty Williams Stephen King again chased him down good pursuit for big number 60 well I had two great plays in a row and the last play he came up made a big tackle and this time he shows you how he can move he's right here watch him go up that way he's just gonna beat the blocker and make the play and linebackers have to take on people but sometimes they also have to run past people Stephen King did at that time to make that tackle number three rusty Williams Stephen King broke his wrist against Navy he's won a cast in practices they fumble on the snap army says it's theirs but no official going up one official steps in and says Albarn football you know one of the things that has trebled all burned there you see the cast on King his right wrist is when he broke roof little bone in there it's not the entire with just a bone in there that he's broken and you're gonna see the fumble right here is there is a poor exchange between Craig and James Peter looks like Kiger was trying to draw somebody offside and snap that before Craig was ready they lost the ball Estes was trying to get in there and get it you know one of the interesting things that you look back at Auburn's losses to Georgia and Alabama they had trouble running the ball in the fourth quarter to finish off the ball game the official is Stef dead the delay is because they want the band to quit plane well who wants to ban to quit playing the official dad I don't I don't understand the army band there oh no you got let him play and the tribe fans here say we don't like that so they call nobody does the depth to drop to throw incomplete what a what a stretch by Robert Baker Tom Mullins over there on the far side providing coverage but you know how can you tell the band not to play that's like Gentiles big offensive lineman you can't eat yeah I mean you know those guys are dressed up you know it's New Years Eve they got all that noise over there that in shooting cannon bands gotta play if you can shoot that game you can play your horn I

to walk in dami and Craig touchdown there he is Damian Craig with bleeding auburn to a 3214 lead over army look at the numbers and it's at a huge day and ain't bad new 370 yards passing two touchdowns and he's ran for another 77 on me down 32:14 with 1025 to play and they continue to pound it out on the ground Demetrius Perry a couple of yards to the 18 you know Rob demetria's ferries in a nice job filling in of course you've mentioned they have really missed you it at the fullback spot but terry has stuck his nose in there quite a bit 72 drives on 16 carries they go back the other way and it was ready all was it red right now defensively Albarn having their way Marsellus ma Stila yeah but Jimmy Brumbaugh who's the one who really had his way we told you about the matchup that he was having with 55 Kyle Scott well he won at that time and Brumbaugh dominated on that play and disrupted it all by himself third down 17 Makeda drops the throw dumps it underneath who was tied in leche lijinsky and the football it's big tough to get the football into the tight in hand today yeah well right now Bob Rumball is having a pretty good time because Scott is out he's taking on the backup now rod rod and Meyer and he gets past him but rod and hire kind of trips him up there and he also slips on the grass Rumbaugh is just dominating right now that brings up fourth down at 12 so Scott lured back in for his fifth punt Robert Baker at the 50 Victor's got a wall flags her down and Baker is stopped at the 27 yard line but flags are back at midfield well yeah it's gonna be a illegal block of block in the back and it was so blatant who's almost as Blake is the one we saw in the first quarter 34 yard punt a 23 yard return but it will come back yeah yeah there is Marlon Taylor they caught him there telling him if you don't see the numbers in front hey kocha to tell them we know at this point in the season yah no watch to the right of your screen there he is 26 Taylor look it goes right up to the guy pushes him from behind he has never been coached to do that now sometimes just give a little bit excited you want to make a play you don't wait get on my way yeah you blocked me in the back all the time at first and 10 from the 43 831 to go playaction Prague on the runs fires into traffic and incomplete he wanted Hicks poor number 89 pretty good throw I mean aren't you impressed with how Craig is able to roll to his left and throw the ball that strongly and he's shown you that he has a lot of tools and this on team is going to be a pretty good win next season we've talked about their youth Craig and they have a quarterback now coming back next year who's gotten a lot under his belt you know you say the heat may be on Bowden but with the youth as you mentioned the returns in 1997 and the leadership Craig will provided the senior quarterback watch down for Auburn Markieff Cooper later tonight on ESPN checking out Jimmy Duncan leads 2nd ranked Wake Forest's against Keith van Horn and the 7th ranked running use of Utah from the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City Utah 9:30 Eastern 6:30 Pacific on ESPN this is a really good early season matchup yeah you're talking about Duncan and Van Horn two guys that are likely to be lottery pick in the NBA watch him now when is a little bit cheaper huh by to go see him he could active gotta get more expensive when they get to enjoy oil third down and six clock running 7:40 to go fourth quarter Damien's leg pulls up once the homerun ball floats it and it's pick picked off Tommy Mullen down the sideline Mullins at the 50 at the 40 if moulds can hang on he's got a big game Ian break Damien Craig came across with the right forearm there's a little Club at the end of it but no penalty called first interception for the senior out of Houston Texas Tom Mullins played a nice football game for Army today 67 yard return well this man isn't open right now but Craig throws it anyway and the ball hangs on him he just doesn't get it out there nice pickup by mullahs now watch the end of the play watch what Damian Craig does when he comes over to make the tackle watch the right arm see if he tries to Club him upside the head watch now here there it is Ballard the shoulder level alright that as bad as it looked at me real time on me at the 17 yard line Perry knocked down by Neal he's in double digits four tackles with 10 Ricky meal and that's right at his season average now you look at linebackers and you see spikes with a hundred 19 tackles and Ricky Neal at a 111 and your two back your two middle linebackers right that's a 230 stops between the Telos yeah hardnosed guy they can handle it though three guys games second down seventh grade ahead foot foot and gain tackling by Auburn dimitra's Perry again spikes a meal we talked about offensively what Auburn has coming back next year but their defense again will lose one player only one number 47 Marcellus Mustela everybody else out there will be back for Auburn keep in mind Craig they lost three games that were buried folks the team could have been pinning one third down it's a good point back the other way misdirection had got Bobby Williams inside the five and Army knocking on the door Ricky meal again with the tackle his 12th stop of the day well again you know we talked about speed misdirection bring it back this way you get everybody going that way and then they can't react quickly enough to make the play you see the Auburn guys running to the left and then you run the ball back to the right where they aren't good play nice a nice block by lijinsky too tight in same play Bobby Williams two touchdowns for Williams on the afternoon its tenth of the season and it's 32 25 20 to go and it gets interesting 5:50 partly 5:50 a lot of time interesting now if your army obviously you have to think about the onside kick get the point here and think about the onside kick read Joseph Parker and his streak continues 32:21 and a lot of time will an onside come our way come on back we'll find out you're not with AT&amp;T are you No so are you happy but really I was happier with AT&amp;T well we're making it simple to come back how'd

touchdowns yeah and you know they have a shot now I mean what they have to do is get the ball back try the onside kick Auburn is playing for it if they get the ball back they have a real shot here Craig Joseph Parker has it teed up and the Auburn Tigers are ready for the onside they have nine men between the 45 and 50 yard line 52 yard line and it's going to be coming up covered up at the 45 Hicks poor got it let's go downstairs and Meryl Hodge well thanks Greg up with that three NASA astronauts bill McArthur right here colonel you've been on two missions already you kind of first

station now I know that you guys have one of the rarest professions in the world maybe president like you pointed out earlier is the only other but what it's like what was the number that you were when you went into space well I would say three hundred and second human being to leave the Earth's atmosphere and go into space there have been about 350 or so people in both the Russian and US plate program and our partners who have been in the space okay Craig so that means you are probably 345 back you guys all right it took some time but he you guys he's telling me yeah you have been out of this world put his face shuttle program and all those things from NASA I think that's right you know one of the things that has happened with the success that all the academies has had this this season is that everyone has kind of looked at the country and said well you know geez it's kind of nice yeah not bad under five minutes to play here in Shreveport Louisiana bread Beasley a victim of some slick turf you know as the temperatures begin to drop pride turf gets a little little slicker yeah that's true and right now you got to use your timeouts if you're army you still have a shot you got to stop and get the ball back but look at the turf that you were talking about it was already a little bit wet little soggy and now as it gets darker little colder the Messier timeout for 34 to go

they should fourth quarter Independence Bowl 434 to play an 11point lead for Auburn Black Knights the cadets the Black Knights alana second down 11 from the eye and a whistle little stop play I'm sure they're going to hit Auburn again legal procedure tomorrow bull week continues on ESPN Alabama battles Michigan in the Outback Bowl the Big Ten takes on the SEC and Gene Stallings will say his farewell to the Crimson Tide tomorrow 11:00 a.m. Eastern 8 o'clock Pacific on ESPN I don't know about you but I think I'm in front of the television with the Outback Bowl I got the Rose Bowl after that I'm a happy camper yep hey this is uh three TVs a couple of TVs you know kisses you got it it matter if it's bad weather I'm not going outside anyway second down and 16 for for Auburn we're army really has to think in terms of trying to get the ball out for 29 to go here they really aren't a team with a twominute often so they need a turnover right now and a quick score if they're gonna have a chance your credit I had some problems up on the big scoreboard they have it fixed for 34 officially remaining here in the finish there rusty Williams on the kick for the 37 yard line and I like that call by Terry bobbins you know go ahead and run the ball keep running time off the clock because he knows that the army offense really can't score twice if he turns them all back over to them with like three three and a half minutes to go another timeout and will step aside for 25 to go we'll be back a friend of mine said I should try America online so I did leading 32 21 with 425 to go army spending their last timeout Auburn was still one remaining if they need it from the 37 yard line being in Prague the quarterback has done the difference for Auburn today from the rusty Williams to the 30yard line and that will bring up a fourth down and again even when they don't need a first down they just need to run the thought that get good blocking up front again you know Victor Reilly 68 once again doing what Kerry Bobby wants him to do clear out some room there just to keep the clock running and Reilly has had a tremendous day blocking and you saw them run behind him on that play that time Fred and Geno James the registered freshman right next to him they're number 78 at 297 pounder on a Montgomery Alabama Victor Riley was the first team allsec perform in this season I tell you this Auburn team is gonna be pretty good you don't know what's gonna happen there in the SEC you got Tennessee probably losing Peyton Manning if all reports are right who knows what he's gonna do he goes to the NFL if he leaves Tennessee is a different team and Florida who knows Danny Wuerffel is gone but they have a lot of talent down there every year it will be interesting I know terry bowden believes that his team will be much better next season and it was this year he told us yesterday this was a disappointing season for him he expected his team even though it was young to be better than seven and four well we've seen tonight what kind of performance they can put on well tomorrow make sure you tune in to ABC Sports for the Rose Bowl the granddaddy of them all you bet numbertwo ranked Arizona State against fourth ranked Ohio State New Year's Day 4:30 Eastern on ABC Sports now wouldn't that be something if you had Arizona State at 12 and oh and Florida State at 12 enough I think argument you know the thing is the argument is they still really with the Alliance you're still questions about who really will be number one of course if that's a scenario to plays yeah but yeah so what you know I mean those guys that if that works out that way both both both teams deserve to be called national champs interesting to see how the polls will finally come out 8 p.m. CNN USA Today the cookie full fourth down seven play action then in Prague over the middle and complete through behind Willie go say who has been very effective today is a wide receiver that stops o'clock with three thirty seven to go Damian Craig has had plenty of time all day and that's really what's been the difference for him you see him there again plenty of pocket protection and he has the lane right down the middle throw the football a little bit behind the receiver that time but that's been the story of the ballgame Damian Craig has that all day army would the football rod but no timeouts remaining 337 to go down 11 complete Rezac completely Jeff prison black runs rod with 320 and Counting yeah this is real tough for for Army right now and they they don't have the kind of offense that all them have little delay draw up the middle Bobby Williams maybe a yard to the 37 tackled by Brom ball or bump off with nine stops from that nose guard position make sure you stick around coming up next SportsCenter will talk about cowboy blues and update their bull highlights Kentucky Louisville we're talking college basketball Bob Lee and Charley Steiner Santa boy was fortunate on Thomas and each day's inbounds and that's not good news for Army because the clock now coming up on the two and a half minute mark yeah and they're short of a first down it's fourth down for them too I mean if they don't pick this up it really lights out for army and clock will stop if they pick up the first down by running it wasn't one a counter misdirection play very effective for army under grace Brissac the ball carrier and a first down for army as you mention stops the clock as they reset the chains with 212 to go yeah clock is going to start once again soon as the official signals at army again no timeouts left they need to scores a beta slingshot sit in the middle dinner and Makeda hooks up with rod Richardson that's because adhesion to batch fell down because he slipped had he not slipped he could have made the play twenty nine yards it was where who fell down back there and that's why they were able to complete the pass two minutes to play first and ten from the Auburn 29 yard line but Keita down he goes I don't know about that one I mean you just complete a long pass to give yourself a first down your quarterbacks feeling pretty good I don't think you run the option there I think you come back and you keep throwing it you have you're running out of time now you need two scores Mike Smith broke through to make the tackle with data touchdown Carmy Brod Richardson hold on there is no quit in the cadet a 30yard touchdown pass the rod richest in the backup man second touchdown of the season for the sophomore on a Portsmouth Virginia and the cadets will line up and go for to a minute 27 to play Bobby Williams and this all of a sudden ride is a 15point football game yeah all you need is a field goal and you were gonna try the onside kick and all of a sudden it turned around there is a shot and go back and look at the touchdown Craig and you'll see Richardson really makes nice play he's out here he's gonna run an inside route here watch the safety as he comes over he gets tricked out of the middle and a nice throw by Makeda makes it such that he's able to go ahead and get into the end zone safety is gone now Richardson over the middle catches the ball nicely runs on in for the score 30 yards sprint and now another attempts at the onside but here's the twopoint play once again the misdirection get the speedy guys going one way run it back the other way on them again Williams is the man who picked it up an army down by three points with a minute 27 to go here the cadets moved 70 yards six plays and they did it in the hurry and they did it with no timeouts yeah 210 off the clock so they got it with 337 to play and they go they go 70 yards in 6 play again two key mistakes in the secondary guy falling down on a guy moving out of position Josh Parker as it Twp we've got it they have a shot at it they had a shot at a crab both teams party football well it looked like they had a shot at it that ball was taken forever to go the Kin yard and when it finally went ten yards there were a number of players around but number 22 Matt Rogers was at the bottom of the pile he came up with it watch the left side of your screen watch once the ball crosses the 10 yard marker all of the army players are around there it bounces off an Auburn player and Rogers gets in there to pick it up it was hits for who tried to pick up the ball and it bounced off of him a minute 22 army down three no timeout Makeda pumps to the near side the give and go going deep over the middle nearly intercepted radware backed on coverage but the Keita wanted rod Richardson and that stops the clock with 1:15 to play oh yeah you know and Makeda had him out there he had his man out there he held the ball a little bit too long and he threw it towards the safety to the middle and he brought it outside they might have picked something up there a one stat that Bowden will not really like is the 22 points given up defensively and yet the offense is sputtered they have not scored in this quarter now the Army has been huge in the fourth quarter here tonight play action to go to the nearside body were important to tackle inside the 45 to the 42 yard line that will stop the clock though he's just exchanged with one a way to go you know they don't need a touchdown here they can send this thing into overtime with the field goal and they probably need to go about another 15 17 yards to have a real good shot at it now if you look at Joseph Parker his longest ticketed season 45 Bobby Williams at the 13 yard line and how did he hang on to that one and how did that man get that ball in there Brad where with a big hit 28 yard pickup could this be a miracle comeback for the cadets of army 55 seconds left to play and they have done this with no timeouts and they really have done it it was a very similar play to what they did in the first half and it was Williams again who made the catch in the first half he made a big win just now first and ten from the 14 and we have a player down let's go back to the big catch here's Williams right here he's got to come on out here and then just go up and watch the safety come over a little bit late and then the great pass by Rodney McKay to get it in there in between the two defenders you see the ball get it drop it right in there and he does a perfect job against the two deep coverage great catch Williams hanging out with Brad where it came over with the big hit player down happened to be Bobby Williams he did take this shot and the question you bring up how do you hang on after a hit like that and you talk about doing it for the team there I mean he knew and he was going to take a pop and he just took it SportsCenter is coming up Bob Lee Charley Steiner Williams down with three receptions 75 yards 55 seconds I go back to the option the option here Makeda blade up the Middle's of the shin yard line now if they have to of course or think and feel position for the field goal right and they can always spike the ball too they have a second down now the clock should be stopped because the guys are milling around yeah they're going to stop the clock now they lost about three or four seconds there when they probably should have stopped the clock okay so you've gone ahead you spiked the ball now you've got a third down here Craig you go ahead and take a shot at the end zone if you're happy with where you are on the field if they're placekicker likes where the ball is I think you go ahead and take the shot to the end zone if he doesn't like where it is I think you go ahead and you run the ball again to make sure you wind up with a deadon shot that he likes I mean you've come this far back you got to like your chances in overtime and remember crash this is the Killzone folks that's crooked and it's leaning this will be a 27yard field goal attempt good snap the kick is up a 27 yarder he missed it and no one feels like Joseph Parker you know the scenario was perfect 18 of 21 only missed three field goals the entire season and he can't find it from 27 yards well they were a little bit rushed there they went for it on third down instead of a fourth down I thought we talked about maybe the shot taking a shot in the end zone and if you didn't get it then come out and kicking they had no more timeouts left so they couldn't run the ball back to the middle of the field so they went ahead and did it but look at this man here Bob Sutton talking to his young kicker telling him and his fault for they don't win the ball they flashback all the way a class act and that fills you I can't believe I just missed that kick and joy for Auburn a disappointment on the other side nevertheless during comeback by army they were in position to tie the ballgame up and send it into overtime it just didn't happen they I want to thank everybody on the ESPN crew Brian Carter our producer John McDonough our director our spotter Kim Anderson stats all
