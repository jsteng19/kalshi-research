============================================================

one half of the bracket has been infinitely filled by the Ducks of Oregon a resounding win in the Rose Bowl over Florida State has put him in the national championship game meeting tonight up to not only our eras best coaches but maybe two of the best of all time Nick Saban won his first title at LSU three in the last five years in Tuscaloosa and Urban Meyer two wins in national title games for the Florida Gators head to head they've been there before to 2008 SEC Championship game number one Alabama number two the 2010 regularseason game number seven for next seven strippers in time this has been the Nissan we're about to get a rush everybody welcome to New Orleans Happy New Year Brad Nessler with Todd Blackledge partner we saw Ohio State earlier in the year lose their only game they come in 12 and 1 from that point on they haven't lost and it's remarkable how they've done it with their quarterback situation really remarkable consider this it starts out Braxton Millers to twotime Big Ten Player of the Year to a shoulder injury before the season even started so right out of the gate they've got to make some radical changes so in steps redshirt freshman Jenny T Barrett and all he does is run and pass his way 257 yards and three touchdowns in his only start the Big Ten championship game but a different challenge tonight against this Nick Saban led Alabama defense that's had a month to prepare Nick told us yesterday when we were here in the Sugar Bowl last year got hammered by Oklahoma they said Alabama was done when he lost to Ole Miss the regular season they said Alabama was done I don't know who they are but they were wrong and a lot of people were wrong about their quarterback as well one of the great stories of college football this year Blake Sims the senior quarterback when he was a freshman they tried to move him to running back he only had 39 past attempts coming in this year and Jake Coker transferred from Florida State and everybody assumed he'd be the guy Blake Sims never said a word he stayed at Alabama he competed he won the job the team rallied around him in all he did was set a school record for total offense in a single season and it helps you have the best receiver in college football to throw to it Amari Cooper a hundred and fifteen receptions over 1,600 yards 14 touchdowns keep an eye on number 9 tonight because Alabama moves him all over the place to find ways to get him the ball we're gonna find out who's going to get the football first as we got out of the filled in our referee blank luck and we know his head and tail I call his tail and in his there's one car oh hi was his won the toss and they deferred in the second half Alabama choice this house and let the Chile's save good luck gentlemen so we'll be the Crimson Tide on offense to start things off and before we kick it off we check in third member of our team as always put some pressure and force them into I think we're going to stop the run too so we create some positive distances you get the ball what did you see from Blake Sims your quarterback today to let you know he's ready trying to tell the players before you know we got to get rid of the eggs be aggressive he's done in his three years has won 36 games and lose only three three straight years 12 wins a remarkable job took one year off to join our business and got back into coaching after his two national championships at Florida he's got quite a team and he said you know what our challenge is are we good yeah he thinks they're gonna be a better team next year well he loves how relaxed they were he loved how his team responded to everything they asked him to do in preparing for this game but that was the big question and right away we'll see one of the things that Ohio State has been great at all season and that's winning the field position battle with their special teams one of the best in the country at where they start and where their opponents start in field position so Kyle Clinton will tee it up scarlet filling the Superdome along with the Crimson of the tide fans of Alabama Christian Jones in DeAndre White's back deep the 81st Allstate Sugar Bowl from New Orleans here we go Christian Jones three yards deep mishandles it and now he'll have it down on by white we take a look at our chickfila impact players for tonight's Derrick Henry's got to be the man because TJ Yeldon has been banged up and he's a pretty good one for a backup for Mari Cooper we've talked about him 115 catches on the other side we asked Luke fickle a defensive coordinator who are the two guys that have to have big games he told us Joey Bosa and Michael Bennett's on that defensive front the strength of this Ohio State defense is their front one Urban Meyer left Florida came to Ohio State he knew to build a championship team it starts with the defensive line that is what has been separating the SEC from other leagues for the last several years he's got that kind of defensive line right now at Ohio State Henry flanking Blake Sims they're gonna fly sweep it Dale Amari Cooper just one of the many ways they give it in his hands and a nice run to pick up of about 5 before he's run out of violence they will put Amari Cooper in a lot of different spots Lane Kiffin then the offensive coordinator this year has done a brilliant job of moving Cooper around so that teams can't isolate him and double cover him and right away the first play the game they flip it to him and let him become a running back now he trots out to the top of your screen as a wide receiver and Sims on a second down and five from the 30 gives it off to Henry only got about a yard though they'll bring up a third down Alabama number one in the sec number two in the country in third down conversions nice play by Joey Bosa good fundamental play maintained leverage shed the block and fell back in to make a tackle to bring up third down throw down and three DJ Alden is the Alabama backfield but it seems the throw to Cooper that his left hand on it but that's all the ran grant the captain of the defense was their defensive secondary he's a senior in perfect position and made a nice play on the ball read the eyes of Amari Cooper and swept his hand down in there to knock the ball out Alabama team that had scored seven touchdowns in two field goals in opening drives this season's that's ringing out there opening possession here tonight Jake a Scots to punt got a bounce into the hands jaelyn marshals growl and and Collins immediately fifty are caught and nothing on the return Cardale Jones is one of the best nicknames in college football 12gauge stop four six five to fifty and he can really throw it now when Ohio State beat Michigan State earlier in the year eight of the first nine plays called will pass plays I would not be surprised to see if Ohio State comes out throwing a lot on early downs in this ballgame as well Urban Meyer said we want to be in second down and four and second down and five not second down and ten first down here from the 15 Ezekiel Elliott and he fights for about four take a look at tonight's chickfila impact players go away and Zeke is one of them great season over 1400 yards rushing devin Smith their long ball threat he's something special and that wide receiver spot for Ohio State a shot Robinson's got a control on a scrimmage defensively you already saw it Landon Collins make an impact on the special teams he's of allamerican safety Jones junior thing working there for a second Wow we couldn't see it from that angle tremendous play on the ball I'm not a hundred percent sure I didn't catch this time maybe not that might be the best replay right there third and six now for Ohio State Jones getting some pressure and the big fella can run and he's got a first down and several more yards out across the 30 car Dow Jones is a capable runner he's not as good of a runner is Braxton Miller or JT Barrett but in a situation like this when everything's covered downfield he does have the ability to run for the first down and I'm third and six he got 12 and out quickly it's Marshall out of the backfield but he's still on his feet to the 44 yard line Ohio State using tempo tempo historically has given Alabama's defense a little bit of a problem they're trying to substitute now get some fresh defensive linemen in that was quarterback number one quarterback number two and quarterback number three gives it off Marshall trying to sweep left this time as drops by Xavier Dixon and I lost it too and his helmet comes off at the end of the play at the defensive line position Marshalls got to go out because his lid came off so at least one play on the sidelines for him right now Ohio State doing a nice job trying to attack the perimeter the inside of this Alabama defense very difficult to run against one of the best in the country only giving up 88 yards per game on the second of 13 just a straight handoff to a Zika Elliott trying to get wide right and he got the corner does 54 yards first and goal and that Jones with a stiff arm at the six yard line this was the design quarterback run I don't think we're going to see a lot of design quarterback run calls for Cardale Jones simply because of the depth problem at quarterback right now but that time they tried to line up quickly and call his number and hope that the big fella could get into the end zone but good defensive positioning by Alabama on that play longest one they've given up this year was the one that got them to this point my Ezekiel Elliott 54 yards second down and goal and goal just shave that side of the five Gold ago defense Alabama has been outstanding this year but only given up three rushing touchdowns all season Jones in the gun Marshall on the moves and we're gonna take a timeout here Ohio State doesn't want to blow an opportunity oh the Meijer takes the time out we'll take it along with them 1146 remaining Ohio State here the first quarter threatening back at the Allstate Sugar Bowl Ohio State down at the 5yard line defense you talked about a time outstanding and goal to go situation very difficult to run on 16 yards in 25 opponent rushes I think that's why Ohio State called timeout you said it they don't want to waste the play you've got to have the right play called against this Alabama defense in this part of the field eighth play of the drive coming up six have been runs only one pass they fake it to Marshall Jones pumps once sidearms it incomplete intended for Ellen Spencer and it'll be third and goal Alabama was not fooled by the playaction they had plenty of crimson jerseys around the intended receiver Spencer good discipline on the back end the Alabama defense that time one of the top 15 teams in the country scoring in the red zone going against the best in the business something's going to give right here this is where you have to be alert for Cardale Jones as a runner with that big body as well third down and goal and he's gonna have to backpedal and fire it as far as he can into the stands and they'll have to settle for a field goal attempt it came from merrily from Ryan Anderson number seven working on the right tackle Daryl Baldwin and Cardale Jones did the smart thing don't take ourselves out of a scoring situation here throw it away and let's set up the field goal derenberger 11 of 18 on the year this would be a 22 yard field goal attempt to try to put the Buckeyes on the board first and good so hyoe state scores first 1132 remaining first quarter I'd said it's a win for the Alabama defense though to hold the Buckeyes to three the 2015 Allstate Sugar Bowl is booty bite Allstate proud supporters of college football are you in good hands AT&amp;T presenting sponsor of the college football playoff National Championship game Chevrolet fun new roads and Gatorade Gatorade knows it all begins with in win from within an 80yard Drive in ten plays but a house state only got three there's JT Barrett sitting right behind Cornell Jones they TSN station a season before breaking his ankle talked to him yesterday he's got one little cart deals I guess he's sitting on it right now and got a bone stimulator also on the side of his cast and he'll be back good as new for next year but the question will be who hope to get a quarterback next year there's the other one twotime MVP the Big Ten everybody should have such a problem against huh yep Flint is kicked Christian Jones walked mishandle this one brings it from two yards deep and he goes down in a heap at the 12 yard line only a 12yard returned Cory Smith nice play on the special teams as we look back at a famous season fifth year senior like Sims waited his time named the starter over Jake Coker and the time went to four and all of the year then lost it Ole Miss and dropped to number seven in the AP poll they won the next eight games back up to number one in our college football rankings won the SEC championship game over Missouri for me to the 13th Sims 262 yards and a couple of touchdowns and that one that this is the second series and still no TJ Yeldon now Derrick Henry is a very capable back and has had a great ball preparation but the absence of yellow didn't a big factor for Alabama he was in for that one play on third down but never touched the ball and Sims fires far side complete even though there's two guys out there you hear the chants of coop for Amari Cooper a pickup of six those TJ the first down play TJ Yeldon mean when you talk about the combination of these two guys both physical backs yell net to 20 Derrick Henry at 2 for they wear you down during the course of a game when both of them are healthy now here is Derrick Henry tripped up and dropped for a loss of the guard this is what I owe state's defensive front needs to do get penetration and use their athleticism Michael Bennett is the guy who got penetration he didn't get the tackle there's another third down for the tide remember they were three get out on their first one that's what the Ohio State fans are looking for here Yeldon in there with since any pressure up the middle passes well overthrown for the intended receiver Cooper and it's another funny situation but that was just saying clearly overthrown pass by Blake Sims in another punt situation and again the field position edge that Ohio State has maintained all season long is already starting to have an effect in this should have excellent field position after this pot so Alabama failed on a third and three and then a third and five so here in fourth down as Jake hey Scott again the true freshman and a whale of a season coming for Alabama when he got all of us baby Jalen Marshall and it bounces he lost it I think in the lights and now he's going to pick it up on a hop at the 12 Marshall looking for some help over there releasing hit special teams by Ron Tanner that's the second time that helmets come off and I think I know the reason for this one well JK Scott has been a weapon for Alabama that's his Jalen Marshall really underestimated the leg of JK Scott and what looked like was going to be excellent field position turned out to be very very average field position because of the putt of JK Scott his longest punt of the year 73 yards in a highstakes darlings field position they have won a lot of battles and a lot of games because of winning the field position those heavy yards that are so important when you add it all up any Jackson was looking at the linebacker trade DePriest watch his eyes go inside he's trying to stiff arm to priest and he doesn't feel any Jackson coming from the backside and that's who pokes the ball out it was going to be a positive run another good run for Ohio State against this Alabama defense and Eddie Jackson forces the ball out ledge that's Ohio State's offenses first turnover in the last 39% that goes back to the Indiana game the week before Thanksgiving let's see if the tide can capitalize and it Sims with a run straight up the middle got about eight dragging Adolphus Washington willing nice read by Blake Sims on the keep Blake Sims ran for about 300 yards this season and that's just to keep the defense honest you have to prepare for that you have to defend it and now it's big by the left side the true freshman cam Robinson the left tackle standing block watch number 74 take Steve Miller completely out of the hole and Derrick Henry shows is at first for a big man that is pretty special Adam Griffith into the point after 7:3 Alabama all except two plays to cover 33 yards and don't let that 241 pounds that not talked about booyah this cat can motor Derek Henry 25 yards for the touchdown and the tied top the DirecTV mobile studio has been traveling around the country this season following the biggest stories and college football buses here in New Orleans streets are kind of narrow Derrick Henry not narrow about that guy we knew we had a great preparation for this bowl game when Yeldon was hurt late in the year they sat him out for the Western Carolina game they started Derrick Henry and they said he didn't respond very well as a starter but he did the following week against Auburn and the SEC championship game against Missouri and he's off to a good start tonight breathless kickoff return we talked about the combination and seems like Nick Saban at Alabama has always had two great backs at the same time and no exception here there's their numbers Henry 5.7 to carry and each with 10 touchdowns in that well 11 for Derrick Henry after that 25yard romp a couple of minutes ago I thought coming into the game Brad one of the advantages that Ohio State might have was they've been better with the turnover game they were plus 9 coming into the game Alabama 1 on turnover ratio first sent over the game goes to Ohio State capitalizing and ask Florida State how big that can be they gave up 34 today points off turnovers Eliott is that a big run but a fumble tearing it to his right hand but still got first down but you see that the philosophy for Ohio State a lot of people think that Ohio State or Big Ten teams don't have to speed that they have in the SEC Ohio State has SEC speed Ezekiel Elliott can run as fast as any back in the SEC and they're attacking the perimeter the strength of the Alabama defense is if you try to run inside Ohio State says we're going to run this outside and make these big guys run and get tired Noah Brown in as a pullback Rose thrown away by Cornell Jones as we check in with Holly well guys on that last play I watched Alabama linebackers ends up the bow really trying to chase Ezekiel Ellie but he couldn't get there keep in mind he is very banged up Kirby smart the defensive coordinator for the Crimson Tide saying hey if we can get 15 to 20 plays out of Denzel that will be fantastic but he is not 100% he's sat on that speed trying to catch native a big one they got some big linebackers and always have had second down at ten Eliot straight up the middle not much there yeah see that's where it's hard to run because of how big they are on the inside they have big defensive linemen and they have lots of them and their two inside linebackers are both over 250 pounds but you have to do that every so often just to keep them honest servant told us yesterday their tree stumps in there yeah Kirby smart defensive coordinator one of the best around at what he does third down and eight Jones hasn't connected yet in this first quarter not going to get a chance here either but he's going to run for it and he's got the first down and quite a bit more yards Cordell Jones when you bring pleasure if you don't get home you leave yourself vulnerable to this nice move he just spoke down who was unblocked and you see the running ability straight ahead Cardale Jones you might not want to hurdle somebody in the end of the 20 yard run though they don't want to have to go to a backup quarterback number four I think they need to challenge deep at some point here with Devon Smith the step in the step back in the throw on the sideline is incomplete again and set it for Jalen Marshall see right now what Alabama is trying to do is defend the run with two safeties that makes them stronger in the past coverage if Ohio State is able to run successfully and force Alabama to bring a safety up into the run defense then they'll have openings down the field to throw the football right now Ohio State has one safety an ohio state is changing the play at the line of scrimmage three wideouts including elliott the rolling back in a slot to the bottom of your screen they have yet to hook up with devin Smith their long ball man there will be a run all the way here Jones in trouble down he goes at the line of scrimmage you maybe got a half yard and they've been Colin showing why he's an allamerican he comes up to make the hit Tom Herman the offensive coordinator right there with the glasses the new head coach at Houston will join his that job when his duties here at Ohio State are done whether it's after tonight or after next week long situation now here at the 41yard are two times on third down Cardale Jones has scrambled for a first down let's see if Alabama doesn't drop more guys I'm gonna bring an extra one including Collins and the ball is and caught by devin Smith all he does is catch long passes he is as good of a deep full receiver as I've seen in college football he judges the ball there were two defenders Eddie Jackson and gibreel Washington were there and he ran by that's his poor fundamental defense particularly for the safety Washington to let somebody run by you on the back end of the defense but Devin Smith judges the deep ball and catches the deep ball as well as anybody I've seen he's got 29 career touchdown catches they averaged 37.6 yards and nine touchdowns on passes of 20 plus yards here's another one they're taking a look at this but he got his right foot in before he skipped out of bounds at the oneyard line and this has been the Achilles heel of the Alabama defense this year as good as they've been against the run they have had major problems defending the deep ball that's the 40th completion of 20 yards or more against this Alabama defense Auburn burned him bad in the Iron Bowl a couple weeks ago by just throwing the ball down the field and letting those receivers go after then that's that's what Devin Smith does as well as anybody I don't know what if any effect they would have had on that ledge but Landon Collins came on a blitz or your one safety short right there on that pass there's what Todd's talking about well Cornell Jones on third down on this drive on third and 80 ran for 12 on third and nine he hooked up with Devon Smith for 40 and so here the Buckeyes are knocking on the door first and goal at the 1 empty backfield Alabama was a man short they hustle DJ Pettway out there this might be Cordell Jones all the way out alone whoops lifts up his own fumble there will be drop though back at the bottom that's just the first things first number one scold but he just took off before he secured the snap it was not a bad snap it was just card out Jones and too big of a hurry to try to run it into the end zone and again this goal to go deep fence for Alabama comes up with a negative yardage play planting comets came in with 91 tackles to lead Alabama in that department and he's leading them in that department here in the first quarter we mentioned this earlier they've only given up three rushing touchdowns this year this is more of a passing situation probably for the Buckeyes back at the 9 yard line Jones has all day and a fire sidearm an incomplete it is complete to Van Eps the tight end and it'll be third and goal trying to regain the lead the Buckeyes trailing 7 to 3 and again Alabama changing up its defensive personnel now State's offense already waiting at the line of scrimmage which is just inside the 4 yard line Alabama going to more of a nickel defense pass rushers instead of run Stoppers Jones quick drop quick throw incomplete it was Marshall the intended receiver that was broken up by Nick curry well he had him Marshall had a little bit of separation on this out route pretty well thrown ball it was hard had some mustard on it for a short throw but a catchable pass and again you go back to the mishandled snap when they were right about the oneyard line that set him back and now they have to settle for another field goal attempt Aaron Berger had a 22 yarder earlier in the quarter this one will be from 21 and from the right hash try to make it a onepoint game Nurnberger does with 518 remaining in the first quarter but again Alabama's defense dug in when they had to and force the field goal back to the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New Orleans our aerial coverage provided by Goodyear kicked off any Drive with tires have returned superior performance Goodyear more driven to goal ago possessions for Ohio State and only two field goals to show fourth yeah they had six plays in goal to go situations and gained three yards you just don't know how many opportunities you're going to get in a game like this where you have opportunities to score touchdowns and they had to settle for field goals twice again Cardale Jones with that mishandled snap first and goal at the 1 was the main culprit and why they only got three last time Christian Jones will feel this kick at the goal line and I see the 20 maybe the 21 for him Alabama has a onepoint lead thanks to the touchdown run by Derrick Henry and as we take a look back in this play as Amari Cooper runs his man off on the perimeter great blocks on the edge by the left tackle cam Robinson the right the left guard Arika wan Joe cam Robinson number 74 66 323 pound true freshman the first true freshman to started left tackle for Alabama since former firstround pick Andre Smith did it back in 2006 and he has been an outstanding player in his first year at that position the play difference about yesterday you want to know what a future firstround NFL draft choice looks like looking in here's Derek entering on the pitch broke one tackle clearly to tackle in the white area he's going to get about 12 plus 15 Land Clark but shirt freshmen Eli Apple on the corner with the late hit little fake inside and then again the speed of this guy at 241 pounds is pretty remarkable to get to the edge of the defense first penalty of the game with the penalty on all the way out there running away from Joey Bosa and running at Steve Miller the other defensive end and running to the big left tackle true freshman can't Robinson Steve Miller had to take over that spot from another one of the guys that would have been a big time defensive lineman Noah Spence who was suspended incomplete pass here will bring up third down and two that ball might have been tipped Michael Bennett got quick pressure and got his hands up in the way of that throw I think he might have got the piece of it Bennet had a huge game in the Big Ten championship win over Wisconsin four tackles for loss a couple of sacks a couple of forced fumbles he's that time a disrupter the senior one of the captains out of Centerville Ohio this is where that defensive line needs to make a play most of the allamerican Michael Bennett has shown up already Adolphus Washington number 92 has had a great second half of the season as well time for one of those guys to make the play Alabama is gonna take a timeout so they'll talk it over on the sideline Lane Kiffin with his quarterback NFL playoff starting on ESPN Cam Newton leads the NFC South champion Panthers against Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals and I thought playoffs wildcard round come up Saturday for toy Eastern on ESPN Panthers will go into the playoffs with a losing record yet they are the NFC South champs a lot of people thought the team that plays here on Sundays would have been the winner of that division the Saints they finished second a half game back and Atlanta eliminated by the Panthers in their loss last weekend go down to Yeldon DJ's got the first down at the 35 well they called the play on the sidelines they quickly broke the auto and snapped the ball quickly and caught the Ohio State defense a little out of position and TJ Yeldon easily converts it into a first down Hill spotted at the 36 and moved the sticks there with just under four minutes remaining in the first quarter this might be playaction Amari Cooper time right here Henry Boy planted his foot and cut back inside the 30yard line seven yards more they have found what they like on that side and you always have the ability of the quarterback to read that and keep it off that same action if they overplay it to the outside and raise straight up the middle diving for what appears to be the first down diving right over Joey Bosa one of the guys that's really critical for this Alabama offensive line is their Center Ryan Kelly very valuable member makes all the protection calls all the blocking calls when he got hurt in the Ole Miss game it really affected them not only in that game that they lost but the following week against Arkansas they played without him and it was probably their worst offensive performance of the season Zim's up to the line on our back spout the Mari Cooper's in the backfield women first down Sims heavy pressure throws farside completes and it's Fowler the pullback very close to another first down see by putting Amari Cooper in the backfield you know he's going to attract a lot of attention he stayed inside and the defense focused on him and they let Justin follow alone on the outside Cooper went in motion out of the backfield and Fowler was wide open on the sidelines Alabama back in the red zone with a first down at the Buckeye 15 that's not too good TJ Yeldon back in the ball game they faked the pitch to and Simms on bootleg throws on the run touchdown Amari Cooper they just turned Durant just completely turned him around he faked inside and watch number 12 grant gets us all twisted up and that's an easy throw and catch for Blake Sims to the best wide receiver in college football 15th touchdown reception of the year for Cooper and for Blake Sims touchdown pass number 27 extra point is right down the middle seven a nine yard drive but a little over three minutes this was the capper Blake Sims has the ability to move to be a running threat and to throw on the run nice little misdirection off the bootleg and Blake Sims finds his favorite target favorite by quite a bit as a matter of fact DeAndre White's not a good one but he's only got 37 yeah and that was wondering number 118 right there on the touchdown pitch and that is amazing because you know everybody in the building over the last half of the season knows you're gonna throw the ball to Amari Cooper but Tulane kittens credit they did a great job of moving him around and finding different ways to get him the ball and to Amari Cooper's credit his smarts and his football intelligence to to know how to play in all those different positions a lot of receivers can't do that it was never a problem for a Mauri Cooper to learn different positions within Lane Kiffin spaz again furthest Samuel laying back deep for Ohio State and we'll get a shot at this one from the two yard line only about a 10yard return great coverage down there our Darrius Stewart on the special teams it on the stop celebrating its 10th year sponsoring the good hands field goal that's Allstate thanks contributions to participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kick in since 2005 all states contributed more than 3.8 million dollars in scholarship funds not good stunning new position here for Ohio State again and again Ohio State coming into this game one of the best in the country starting on their own 35yard line that's what they average but the Alabama kick coverage teams have been outstanding so far in the ballgame Marshall trying to get wide with it he's not going to get there thanks to Eddie Jackson only a 2 yard game Ohio State continuing to try to attack the perimeter of this Alabama defense that time well played by any Jackson you have to maintain leverage on the football and not let them get outside of that outside defender Eddie Jackson very fundamentally sound on that flow this does set here with Elliot behind bottle domes he fakes it to him runs out of time he's got to get rid of it back to your safety no signal yet they're saying his quarterback progress was stopped Carnell Jones got stuck there he didn't know if he should throw it away he doesn't want to make a mistake Xavier Dixon the best pass rusher just manhandled the right guard Billy price and got to the quarterback I don't know where his progress was stops he was progressing right into the end zone well he pulled him back into the end zone they started the two yard line and it's Elliott straight up the middle and I got a first down and some room to work bill lavanya's our rules expert Nick Saban's going crazy on the sidelines bill I think we've got a good call that defender then back from the field to play into the end zone excellent spot by the wing official the fact that car Dow Jones didn't want to throw the ball away almost created a bigger problem but credit the pass rush of Xavier Dixon giving there against Billy price now the quarterback making only his second start as a buck I can talk things over on the sideline with a break here because we've come to the end of the first quarter we played 1514 to 6 welcome back to the Allstate Sugar Bowl here in New Orleans just about set to start the second quarter number one Alabama with a 14 to 6 lead Brad Nessler Blackledge Holly Rowe and a bunch of those kind of folks along with us that's houndstooth to the max right there Alabama a couple of touchdowns one on the ground by Derrick Henry one on Blake Sims two Amari Cooper touchdown pass Cameron Johnston who's got a punt from near his own goal line Christian Jones has had some big punt returns and kickoff returns over his career for Alabama he's back deep he's gonna have a play on this one at around the 30yard line reversing his field not anybody over there to block for him though he gets about six on the return before he's one of the mountainbike a pretty good return by Christian Jones but I want to go back to the opening kickoff and this could have been a disastrous play for Christian Jones because he touched it this was a live ball that's why there's no official signal and if it weren't for the alertness of D Andrew White to cover this ball if Ohio State would have fallen on that the game would have started with an Ohio State touchdown and we've already seen how difficult oh hi Oh state has happened trying to get a touchdown against this Alabama defense that could have been a critical mistake to start the game for Alabama the nava tied at the 39 yard line two tight ends in there and had behind Sims Amari Cooper in motion they're gonna throw it to him and a shoestring catch at the 45 yard line that's the matchup that they won against the redshirt freshman Eli Apple the field corner / Ohio State it's going to be an outstanding player 6 198 pounds out of New Jersey but again Amari Cooper just so difficult to defend he has great speed size and strength Matt Cooper is in the slot they're gonna throw it to him again out there looking for a blocker puts his hand down and he's dropped by Darren Lee the outside linebacker nice play in the open field you see that tackling technique one of the things Ohio State has really tried to adapt it comes from Pete Carroll the Seattle Seahawks Luke Finkel talked about and that's it to perfection right there third down and three TJ Yeldon back to you there he'll get the carry he's not going to get the first down bo so was there first in Curtis Grant the middle linebacker who made the hit and it's fourth down excellent job good penetration first by Bennett he occupied the guards blocked Leon brown and then beau so was able to get across the line of scrimmage as well this defensive front is the strength of the Ohio State defense and they forced a critical fourth down play right there Jalen Marshall will wait on this punt coming up from JK Scott who already has a 73 yarder to his credit tonight right now he just like to knock one out of bounds at about the five and keep it out of the hands Jalen Marshall he is a tall drink of water I was checking him out before the game on the field he is long and lanky six for about a hundred and eighty five pounds of water interesting what just happened there because of that penalty which I think Alabama is okay with Ohio State had a safe punt had their defense on the field now that they back them up five more yards they put their punt return team on fair catch taken around to five nice kick nothing else Marshall could do about it 53 yarder with great anxiety so Iowa State trailing 14 to 6 but they've got it back in Carmel Jones and his offense waiting on the other side of this timeout Ohio State hoping to play for another national championship and for me too they went nine and one didn't attend a bowl game but we're number one 54 10 and OU beat USC in the rose 57 9 &amp; 1 beat organ to the Rose Bowl finished an enone undefeated and defeated USC in the Rose Bowl and then 2002 14 of OU and beat Miami in the Fiesta Bowl Urban Meyer doesn't have a national championship as the coachable hioh state but as to when he was in Gainesville and Florida and he just wants to get back in the big picture which is January 12th in Arlington one of these teams will be Oregon for the national championship Ezequiel Eliot's have a great game so far and he's got 9 more yards he's over 100 already well the last running back to go for over 100 against this Alabama defense was Trey Mason in the Iron Bowl at 2013 nobody this season until now in Ezekiel Elliott he's got 109 here's another carry might got one more yard out of it maybe Jalen Marshall that time running it Ohio State for the problems they've had in the goal line situations this running game has been effective mostly outside on the perimeter stretching out this Alabama defense making those big guys run and the biggest one of course was the 54 yarder by Eliot earlier in the game what that does is it sets up playaction and Ohio state loves deep crossing routes on playaction Jones straight drop here pressure coming again he retreats near his own go align throws and it was caught for about a oneyard gain by Michael Thomas he comes in as their leading receiver well you see why Alabama wanted to get 15 or 20 plays out of Denzel Duval even though he's not 100% he is an outstanding pass rusher as a stand up defensive end he's a very versatile guy and he was the guy that forced Cardale Jones to leave the pocket on that play they completed the pass but no gain on it so it's second down and 10 empty backfield for Cardale Jones five man rushing and one who got a hand on it nice pressure out of an Asian Robinson yeah hey Shaun Robinson ran right through Billy price the left guard they are big and physical up front watch 96 run right through 54 and get a hand on the football so now it's third down attack this is dangerous territory right here for Cornell Jones he has to be very smart with the football three receivers to his left this is where Alabama creates confusion gonna go back across the middle and I mean strike to Michael Thomas first down beautiful read by Cardale Jones he looked left he came back to the opposite side to a single receiver there was a corner blitz and a nice shot by Michael Thomas sitting into that soft area of the defense and giving a target to his quarterback from third and Sammy got 14 on the completion you see the arm strength and the throwing ability of Cardale Jones at 65 250 he can see over the defense and even if there's bodies around him he can step into it and make good solid throws down the field but guys first Iron Throne 29 Elliot up the middle Xavier Dixon and a Sean Robinson again closed the door after pick up of a couple bring up second down in eights and we're approaching 10 and a half minutes remaining second quarter really important drive right here for Ohio State if nothing else to flip the field we talked about how they've had a field position edge and that that was a big key to their success the average starting field position tonight in five possessions was their own 15 yard line so getting that first down and moving the ball out a little bit is huge for them right now seventh play of the drives here's the play action and a bralette intercepting picked up by Cyrus Jones coming the other way with a convoy Jones left out of bounds at the 15 an obvious miscommunication between Carnell and his intended receiver devin Smith Devin Smith never turned to look for the ball and Cyrus Jones rent at the whole way watched Evan Smith his head is down he's running down the field Cyrus at Jones's eyes are back at the quarterback and he makes a play on the ball and devin Smith didn't even know what was thrown third interception of the year by number five and a 32 yard return so Alabama will set up shop at the Buckeye 15 yard line Derek Henry as you look behind him in the backfield Sims 2 tight ends power set since flushed out of the pocket throws to the sideline and completed it down around the 11 to his tight end vulgar very nice boys by Blake Sims that time Joey Bosa coming on pressure and Blake Sims just kept drifting back a little bit to buy some time and then complete the pass to Vogler number one turned over their own territory only cost him 7 points could happen that they're going to add to it here's Alabama on second and six it's a little live out to Vogler he had to catch you twice he's going to be short of the first down 5 out of yard nice concentration by Baldwin's stay with it look like he was going to drop it juggle it and get possession but it's third down in a yard Ohio State got a stop on the last third down and short situation that's sixteen possessions they've given up 12 touchdowns they don't want to the tide get a quick one here they're up to the line at her and it's Yeldon and i don't think he got there nice play the Buckeye defense Lee and Perry the linebackers starts up front good penetration by Michael Bennett again he doesn't get credit for the tackle but his ability to take up two blockers and stay in the hole forced TJ wealth yelled and wide and brought up fourth down Alabama's eight out of the lemon of fort down conversions this year they're going for play for both teams yelled ins at tailback you'll get the call and the first down first in go Alabama see that time Ohio state did not get penetration and that a table TJ Yeldon to get a full head of steam hitting up into the line of scrimmage see no white shirts but crossed that line of scrimmage and an easy conversion for TJ Yeldon short yardage offense and defense is all about leverage the low man wins that time Alabama was the winner first and goal just outside the wallets yelled at again and he'll walk in costly turnovers by Ohio State nice job by the tightend Vogler blocking on Joey boson that play he might have got away with a little bit of a hold on the outside of the Jersey but he was able to keep both the inside and Yeldon was able to bounce outside for the touchdown Bertha's extra point is good 807 remaining in the first half a miscue by Cardale Jones second turnover by the Buckeyes in their own territory this one picked off Cyrus Jones took it 32 yards TJ Yeldon did the last yard on his own 21 to 6 don't know where you are you also let burglars know

Crescent City there'll be a few headaches in that section this morning we do wish you a Happy New Year thirdly Samuel come around to go along whoa Reuben foster there kick coverage has been outstanding so far there is a flag down it's Maurice Smith number 21 celebrating the hit by Ruben Foster I guess but this was a serious hit I kick off good disciplined coverage there's the hit by Foster there's know he stood right over top of him as he was on the ground there's the hit good clean hit and then after this there's Marie Smith standing over top of him okay good boy that's a good call yeah best starting field position for Ohio State because of the penalty they work from the 29 with 8 minutes 2 seconds remaining till halftime Eliott tough yard that's about it you know when we talk to urban Meyer the other day he said when talking about Alabama you put on film you say where's the weakness you're always looking for weakness there are not with Alabama so when that's the case you cannot help a team like that and Ohio State has helped them they've turned the ball over twice they've not converted when they've gotten the ball inside the 5yard line when they could have scored touchdown and it's hard to beat a complete team like Alabama when you help them flags are down as Elliott's going to go down at the line of scrimmage Reggie Ragland and DJ pet way out to make the hit one of the things it's impressive to me about this Alabama defense and their defensive front is the depth they have eight to ten guys that they rotate through those defensive down three or four guys and they all kind of look the same and of course next David declines a penalty because it was no gain out of place so they'll take the down instead and it's third down and long Fidel Jones needs to be on target on the snow down at 10:00 if he can get the pass away and he is on target to Marshall who spins his way across the 50 to the 45 nice job of hanging in the pocket because this is pretty good pressure and it's collapsing around them but card out does a nice job of staying in there and finding Marshall on the deep crossing round their cup of 26 so hyoe stayed back in Alabama territory they've got two timeouts remaining plenty of time to work here at the 45 woofs delegate took a step forward again he lost his balance just preparing the play to start this is the area of the field were banned Meyer and Tom Herman liked to take deep shots down the field once they get inside the 50 now that penalty backs him up to the 50 but this is still the area where they like to try to attack devin Smith their deep threat guy is down here at the bottom of the string on first and 15 empty backfield pump fake by Jones goes off his back foot but he completed it very short game actually got six out of it beg your pardon back across the original line of scrimmage to the 44 michael thomas on the sideline a leading receiver the guy they might go to here as marshal and the slot probably guarded by a safe hero linebacker Jones fires far side in the coverage in completes antenna for Cory Smith a nice play by Eddie Jackson Eddie Jackson just squatted on that route what Cardale Jones read there was single coverage on the outside oneonone you expect your guy to win that battle and Eddie Jackson read the route and was in perfect position to make a play on the ball here's a big third down for Cardale Jones then for the good on third down needs another one here deep middle by Marshall inside the 20 see when Marshall lines up in the slot he's going to draw coverage if it's man from a safety or a linebacker this is some coverage and he does a nice job of finding the void in the middle of the Alabama defense couple of 26 yard completions on this drive and I Jones going to the end zone incomplete intended for Marshall again now they have hit some plays on third down Brett but they have been averaging 3rd and 9 or more in those third down situations the percentages are not in your favor if that's what you're facing on third down but Gardel Jones on this Drive in particular is hit a couple big ones then on the red zone and have to settle for field goals they need a touchdown here just over five to play in the quarter haven't seen a screen pass maybe a chance of getting the ball to Ezekiel Elliott by drawing it to him second insanity 18 Elliot will come in motion that's where he's going with a football just his Todd call that almost ran out of bounds but stays in and he's got it down inside the 10 yard line the reason that was such a good call by Tom Herman is because Alabama's defense has done a better job defending Ezekiel outlet running the football so find a way to get him the ball where there's not so much traffic around it throw it to him they're going in a hurry and we got a 5yard on it they lined up and snapped it it'll be second down and goal this is absolutely critical that Ohio State scores a touchdown here not only because they're behind 21 to 6 but this is the third time they've been in goal to those situations and they've had to settle for field goals on to time they have to find a way to get the ball in the end zone here curtis samuel in the backfield with jones who's calling for it rolling to his left comes back to his right nice play by eddie jackson on the tight end granite I guess he threw a flag that came late I guess he was a little bit early he made contact he was making a play on the ball he got there a little early because the ball was floated the ball was so soft coming out there Alabama was out of position they were running a guy on the field late watch how this ball just kind of floated to the backside and because it's hanging in the air Eddie Jackson even though he's making a play on the ball the contact was early good call and a first down at the spot so it's right at the 5yard line curtis samuel now in for Ezekiel Elliott Danette the tight end moves into the slot marshal coming around gets the flip and that's all he's gonna get lost a yard I think nice play by Trey priest the reason that place tough is because they're running into the short side of the field it's a sweep but they're running it into the boundary and that enabled these linebackers and trade two priests to get there and make the play Landon Collins is the guy that's down on one knee allamerican safety he's their best player and looks like his right shoulder he's he's concerned about her favoring made a lot of tackles already in this first half and one of the leaders of their defense a captain Louisiana native as a matter of fact leaned back in his home state will check out him when we come back four minutes remaining first half Landon Collins is headed to the locker room for Alabama there he is we went back to plays because the previous play he looked to be favoring his right arm or shoulder trying to help out on the tackle so we went back to place and this is how it was injured Evan Spencer who's a 210 pound wide receiver and an excellent blocker a good clean block and you can see right away after the contact Landon Collins favoring that right arm or right shoulder Durack Williams will come in to take his spot but the story for Ohio State continues to be eight goal to go plays five yards only has gained any positive yards they have to find a way to get this ball in the end zone second down a goal out to six Elliott with Jones in the backfield gets the carry slipped a little bit keeps his legs moving and we got to at least the floor maybe inside the floor you know we got on a high state player down Jacoby Boren the center very valuable member of this offensive line as well this offensive line when the season started they replaced four starters and they weren't very good in the beginning of the year we had the Virginia Tech game they struggled as a unit but they have gotten better and better it's been the same five guys that have started the whole season and they have gotten better as the season is worn on but Jacoby Boren is the leader and now in a critical third and goal situation a new center coming into the ballgame chase Farris they better get some snaps with court card out Jones right now on the sideline boring in the middle of the pack they're not the biggest Center in the world got rolled up on a delete from behind they list him at six one he may not be even that tall about 280 flat files but Meyer said I would go to war with him any day how tough he is and he's trying to tough it out right now and how Pat elf line who is the starting right guard is going to be the center chased Farris number 57 is going to come in in his place at guard I believed now flying doing the smart thing right now taking some snaps on the side leading up to this critical third down play and Boren looks to be up and at it anyway he gets right into that offensive line huddle that try to fire him up as he's got to come off the field he just cannot settle for another field goal here not only does it keep you behind on the scoreboard but psychologically it'll wear you down you've got to find a way to crack the code here and get into the end zone on this Drive they've converted a third and ten and a third and nine to get a third and goal right now Marshall crosses the field Eliot leads the way touchdown Ohio State that one puts him right back in business great job on the left side Billy price and Taylor Dekker the left guard and tackle they get a doubleteam inside and then Decker moves off to the second level the new center Elf line gets a nice block and Elliot able to run it into the end zone critical touchdown for Ohio State Aaron Berger in for the point after up and good little over five minutes for the Buckeyes took them 12 plays three for three on third down on the drive including this one the Kappas 71 yard March Ezekiel Elliott makes two 2113 next deal this does get you great deals on you stuff from right now until the end of the game the national championship trophy presented by dr. pepper will be handed out on January 12 in Arlington Texas and the winner here tonight will take on organ big win by the ducks in the Rose Bowl earlier today over Florida State and so at 8:30 Eastern on the 12th we'll figure out who's the best in college football as I saw all the points that organ scored and you automatically pick Marcus Mariota he had a great ball game at that Oregon defense was pretty salty today against Jameis Winston and the Seminole Christian Jones and the Andrew White waiting on the kickoff Jones runs up on it and about the three yard line trying to get it to the middle of field and goes down to the ten great coverage again that's the second time Cory Smith made a big play on special teams tonight perfect and great coverage was expecting pass and the motion by Jalen Marshall is going to just kind of freeze these guys a little bit they don't attack the line of scrimmage and that enables Ohio State to get into their blocks and get the ball in the end zone Alabama thinking pass on that third down and Ohio State hit him with the inside run with the critical touchdown last couple of games for Ezekiel Elliott how big is he been 220 in the win over Wisconsin the Big Ten title game in 117 tonight he I think gets overlooked a little bit yeah when he came in with over 1,400 yards rushing but that's because as Landon Collins has come a backup you think about the big Tim Coleman from Indiana David Cobb in Minnesota I'm here Abdullah Ameer Abdullah and Nebraska and Jeremy Lankford had a huge game for Michigan State today so so many great back to the big ten sometimes you get lost in the shuffle a little bit Amari Cooper broke one tackle ready to come back out on the field just in his shoulder path he's moving that right arm and that right shoulder just fine right now also another update Jacoby born in the center for Ohio State they have taped up that ankle it's been an injury that's bothered him previously this season looks like he's going to try to go well he's a tough dude we'll see when they come back out on offense well right now it's Alabama's turn with a second down in for Derrick Henry with Blake Sims in the tie backfield they fake it to him throughout to the Andrew white who's dropped after maybe a yard game by Lee when great play by Darren Lee he didn't let go if he doesn't make this tackle the Andrew Wright white probably sports forward for a first down Darren Lee was blocked and force the staredown state would love a stop here and the chance to get the football back if they can prevent a third and three Blake Sims throw in the balls hit his last eight passes well here's Cooper right here they've got him kind of protected it will be a pass it will not be complete the Andrew white dropped it let it get to his body instead of catching you out in front with his hands he let it get all the way to his body and it bounced right off of his shoulder pads incomplete well throw the ball by Blake Sims the Andrew white just doesn't secure the catch it's been feast or famine floor of the tide they have three touchdown drives and now they have four three and outs when that's there's nothing in between fourth down and JK's got to punt he can let this one fly as long as he wants to again the beauty fair catch called for way back at the 22 yard line by Marshall well that is a weapon now to have a punter like that now he was an ESPN firstteam allamerican and a Rea guy finalist and I can see why Capital One Bowl mania continues tomorrow number 11 Kansas State taking on number 14 UCLA and the Vallejo Alamo Bowl and 6:45 Eastern on ESPN then Washington will battle Oklahoma State in the ticket city cactus bowl and 10:15 tomorrow that's your Friday night viewing tomorrow on ESPN right now the Allstate Sugar Bowl 21 to 30 know hi Oh state with a ball back a minute 32 and a couple of timeouts to work with lay case got four punts 59.5 yard average bad ban at the tight end in motion Jones the play fake fires completes Michael Thomas in poker tackle and he got out of the 37 yard line minute 24 plenty of time Ohio State with two timeouts you want to get that first first down when you're working a twominute offense either at the end of the half or end of the game getting that first first down is critical Michael Thomas still down after that reception my second effort went through that would be tackle of Cyrus Jones and in doing so you hope it's just cramps at this point one 24 left let's redshirted last year it came in Keyshawn Johnson's nephew as the leading restorer of receiver catch wise for Ohio State this year we mentioned Devin Smiths the big play artist of the bunch well he and Cardale Jones both spent the fall of 2011 at Fort Union Military Academy in Virginia a oneyear prep school after high school long times guys go there if they need to mature a little bit they need to get their grades right it's a very rigorous program excellent football program as well and both of them benefited from their time there so he started off cold he's warmed up does have that costly interception that ended up turning into seven points but he's had some big third down conversions on that last drive that led to his et ille Elliot's touchdown Boyle and he's all by his lonesome right now in the Ohio State backfield JT Barrett looking on Jones plenty of time let's grow short underneath complete Torrey Smith got to the 41 that's about all you know Smith made the tackle without a 110 haven't seen the deep crossing route for Ohio State something that they really like again an empty set Darnell jones loads fires down a middle complete inside the 45 to the 40 to ban at the tight end wakil stop as they reset to change pickup of 19 again Ohio State with two timeouts plenty of time here Landon Collins back in there as Holly said after coming back out of the alabama locker room 40 seconds less valuable time waste Jones steps up in the pocket now he's gonna run with it straight ahead and he's still running with it Cornell Jones inside the 15 27yard the middle that's the third time we've seen him scramble up the middle and his size and strength gets out of the tackle Ryan Anderson for the first down now he's rolling right to throw and just throws it away wisely to stop the clock with 19 seconds left I think what the bench needs to remind Gardel right now is that they have two timeouts they can't afford to lose valuable time like they did on that one possession or the one play a few plays ago manage the clock right now he's got a lot on his plate a lot in his mind right now very important that he manages the clock here in the final 19 seconds of the first half there are murders fieldgoal rains well within his field goal capabilities although that's been a kind of a shaky spot this year for Ohio State at the 13 yard line second down and 10 they may have to use the timeout right here because the play clock was down there was confusion in their formation and they had to burn a timeout right there because of confusion Cardale Jones though we talked about third down conversions on the previous Drive talked about the biggest run of the night for him it's gonna be right here well watch his strength at 6'5 250 that's a defensive end Ryan Anderson and he runs right through that tackle and rumbles for the first down you know there was a time about five minutes ago times where you looked at this and it was 21 to 6 and we kind of looked at each other and said oh yeah and you got to give a higher state credit they hung in and not only hung in they're gonna cut this thing a little bit shorter before half absolutely and the critical thing was they found the way to get the ball in the end zone it they would have had to settle for another field goal and only have nine points on the board it would have been devastating they got zone they got the good special teams coverage and now they got a chance to add to their point total you would think they'd be sure to get three but they want more it's at all possible with 19 seconds left and around and now a pass coming up Spencer to the end zone or do they ever do it with style huh well Cyrus Jones is in perfect position this is not a play that fooled Alabama but the ball is thrown in the right spot did he get a foot down Wow I think he did there's his left foot there's still some green showing before you see the chalk Wow what a catch and what unbelievable balance to stay about what a catch but what a throw by a wide receiver Evan Spencer threw that ball in the only place that his guy could make a catch because Cyrus Jones was in perfect position to make a play on the ball it had to take the perfect throw for batted catch on the other end Evans dad Tim who was a great one in Columbus when he was a Buckeye and his kid just lit up the crowd with that touchdown throw to Michael Thomas beautiful 13 yards and while they're continuing to look at it it's 21 to 19 right now with 12 seconds to go I mean Cardale Jones could not have thrown that ball any better Evan Spencer put it in the only place he could this game has swung in the other direction what a call by Tom Harmon to 19 seconds left in the half they've had trouble and goal to go situations they go for the trick play and they pay it off with the touchdown I guess there's some thought that you might want to go 42 here to try to tie it but there's a lot of football in the second half so it's an extra point by Nurnberger coming up and Ohio State won the toss and deferred so they'll get the ball to start the third quarter with momentum again Michael Thomas kind of quiet in the first quarter they fake the pitch to Marshall and then Spencer on this beauty Ohio State with 348 yards of total offense in the first half against this Alabama defense that's beautiful that is 14 unanswered points in the last two minutes and 43 seconds and it can change just that quickly and now we got a ball game let's check in with Holly Urban Meyer's long told us that Evan Spencer is the program guy that does everything right he said he does so much for that I trust him with everything coach really backing up those words trusting him in a huge goal line situation right there to throw a pass that really is everything for the senior wide receiver enough standing blocker on the perimeter doesn't get the ball thrown to him that much this year only 14 catches coming in but outstanding blocking on the perimeter and in that case can't throw it any better nope and once he let it go he knew it gikai and short Jones runs up on it about this 17 and they'll get out to the 29 maybe the 30 just six seconds remaining now I would expect Alabama to just take a knee here check out the balance of yardage here Ohio State way bigger in the total yardage category but Alabama still bigger on the scoreboard but remember 14 of those points came off turnovers right and the field position up until the last couple possessions was really in Alabama's favor they had short fields to work with because of the turnovers Ohio State started taking care of the ball they started covering kicks flipped the field and made this a close football game a onepoint football game at halftime great surge by Urban Meyer's Buckeyes in the final minutes of the second quarter 18c brings us inside the headset as we head down to Holly Road what do you have to change to account for Cardale Jones their quarterback has a runner well I'm not worried about the runner I'm worried about third down I mean they've converted every every third down except maybe one you know we had them 3/3 tens they still converted it to one and we're not executing on defense we're making a lot of mental errors and letting people go and not covering people properly so we're just going to finish do a better job in pass rush Lane so he doesn't scrambled you know it's just how were executed all right Thank You coach now 70% for Ohio State on the third down conversions as they're only down one point at halftime coming up on the Buick halftime report job and made a loo and Tim Tebow will all be along with you but first half analysis update on Oregon and a lot more halftime of a great Allstate Sugar Bowl onepoint Alabama Lee on the Super Bowl stage the Buckeyes and the tide attempted to take one step closer to ruling college football's Brad the fixture incision moved outside the water that one puts him right back in business and we welcome you back to the Orleans and the Allstate Sugar Bowl the 81st edition of this classic and it has been one inside the mercedesbenz Superdome halftime 21 to 20 Alabama by a points Ohio State had touched down drives our 71 and 77 yards in the first half they had two other drives of over 70 yards intended and field goals they had a couple turnovers partner we got we got a good one going on right now this game was teetering in the balance state at 21 to 6 they settled down they righted the ship they started making some things happen they ran 20 more plays than Alabama did in that first half and right now we have a heck of a ballgame and Nick Saban till Holly I think they converted every third down they didn't but they did go 7 out of 10 and that's more first downs giving up in a half by Alabama than anybody all year long against them more big plays in that first half then Alabama was able to generate Kurtis Samuel take Annie as we check in with Holly well Urban Meyer said it's a pretty obvious conversation don't turn the ball over he said we can talk about the red zone and doing better in the red zone all day long the bottom line is don't turn the ball over he's got his quarterback Cardale Jones really settled down later in that second quarter he said that's what we need we need to get that momentum back and just play home tsehai does with the opening possession of the third quarter mentioned big plays impact plays runs of 10 yards or more passes of 20 yards or more Ohio State had 12 impact plays in the first half Alabama only to Jacoby borne by the way the tough guy is back in at center he's not going to miss this one Jones quit play fake in a slant complete for a first down so his first pass the third quarter is good for 11 to Michael Thomas who made that sensational catch in the corner of the endzone before halftime nice job getting off tight coverage pass was a little bit behind but a nice job by Michael Thomas reaching back to make the ground first down at the 36 empty backfield for Cardale Jones the throw Thomas again from the other side this time short of a first down but a good throw and catch Cyrus Jones made the tackle throwing on early downs against Alabama is very smart because as big and physical as their defensive line is they're not great pass rushers on early run downs right out of the gate here in the second half first two plays card out Jones throwing the football those tree stumps that Urban Meyer talked about not great pass rushers they're stout against the long though and here they're not Elliot across midfield with a first down and Boren got all tangled up with train two priests of little linebacker so this is an impressive start yeah the opening minute oh hi Oh state has to be a very confident football team they closed the gap they scored right before halftime and they come out of the gate here in the third quarter with positive momentum and positive yardage this still set here with Eliot behind Jones play clock down to three blitz here's the deep cross and the deep ball and Smith heat him out of his hands Cyrus Jones was covering well Cardale Jones looks very confident he's standing strong in the pocket they run two guys off you have the deep cross Evan Spencer coming underneath not a bad chance going down the field against single coverage not able to make the connection but they also had the crossing route with Evan Spencer coming underneath that jaelyn Marshall in motion they're going to flip it to him they try this one earlier third time it's come on so he's coming out for another play he's in a better chin if that chinstrap a little tighter forget a double Paco or something that's 255 pounds coming full speed knocks the headgear clean off and that's exactly what they're working on is the gym straps to get him a little tighter he's going to feel that one though for a few plays I think third and eight Ohio State seven of ten in that first half most of them long yardage like this five out of six minutes third and eight or more Jones waited to the last minute and let it fly he's got Devon Smith touchdown you got a flag down and the Buckeyes have the lead Alabama went man coverage on that third inlaw they've been playing mostly zoned on third down earlier they go single coverage and addy Jackson fell down and Devin Smith does what he does his whole career catch long passes the touchdown that's his xxx we mentioned those touchdown grabs averaged almost 38 yards that one went 47 Nurnberger for the point after and the Buckeyes are shocking everybody right now 2721 third down and long Cardale Jones has heard them scrambling Alabama goes man coverage Eddie Jackson's okay he's okay and then he trips and devin Smith pays it off and here's an interesting note devin Smith coming into the game had caught touchdown passes in 21 games Ohio State 21 to know in those games there's the face mask at the end of the play that will be assessed on the kickoff because long jumper bike jumper excuse me he was second in the big ten in the outdoor with the high jump he said he has got this kinetics kinesthetic awareness of his body he knows how to control his body in difficult situation coordination was exceptional he watches that film in this game that is spasticity touch up seven feet and a quarter in what Alex said in finishing second of the big team actually jumps seven one as a high school senior and he has lit up the crowd here the ohio state portion of the crowd anyway as they're leading by six now 21 unanswered points in the last five minutes and 11 seconds of clock time and again now the kick will come from the 50 and just kind of put you up high taking out the 11 by Jones and he didn't even get to the toilet you know the inaugural college football playoff National Championship presented by 18c comes your way January 12th on ESPN we know who one of the teams is the Ducks of Oregon we'll find out the other half with two more quarters to go here either Alabama or Ohio State and then we hope you join us Monday January 12th 8:30 Eastern on ESPN that guy would be going for a fifth national championship went up by 14 or more and they were 15 78 and 2 but right now the short end by 6 here's an eye backfield for the first times tonight with Justin Fowler the fullback they fake it to y'all and it's it was in trouble scrambles out of trouble first down at a bunch more and the ball came out of the end but I think he's down lake Sims first down pass protection breaks down he goes right up the middle picks up a block from TJ Yeldon and a big game the house they just barely got sent defensively Alabama is ready to go and Yeldon takes it around the corner out to the 45 yard line that's this could have been a disaster Ohio State uh guys about six yards away from the line of scrimmage and Alabama was getting ready to snap it one of the changes for this Alabama offense at Lane Kiffin broad part of it was when he was the head coach at USC going against Oregon up tempo no Nick Saban wanted to do it Lane Kiffin decided to do it and it's paid dividends Simms his level Magalie never had a chance to get rid of that football this is an inspired group on both sides of the ball I'm out for the Buckeyes TJ Yeldon is gonna get tangled up with Austin Shepard to tack on the back they both ended up on Bose and nobody picked up the extra guy he should have been blocked by one of those two guys probably TJ Yeldon the last thing Alabama wanted to do to start the third quarter was give up a touchdown to the Buckeyes and then had a situation like this third down and eight Sims flustered again down again this time it's Michael Bennett well we talked about Ohio State being so cute on 3rd down in the first half one four six on third down make it one four seven now good pressure by Michael Bennett spin move on the guard Leon Brown that's this great individual effort by an interior lineman rushing the quarterback one of the captains a big fellow with a big play and forces a punt this young guys been sensational kicking the ball Ohio State hasn't had a return man back so he's kicking it to nobody it's going to take a great well that flicked the field in a hurry all the way down to the 5yard line I mean even if you're going for a punt block you have one guy back I don't know what the deal was there but they've gotten Ohio State to into their own territory with a 65 yard punt we talked about the interesting situation at quarterback for these two teams before the game started like Sims 10 out of 14 tonight 17 of 29 to 36 for Cardale Jones and only 60 for Blake Sims he does have a touchdown pass and Cardell has one touchdown pass that long would the 4702 devin Smith the last time they got the ball he did have a costly interception that turned into seven but boy he is over five he's awake now and that's his MO throwing the ball down the field that has been the Achilles heel for this Alabama defense all season the combination of the inability to have a outstanding pass rush and the inability to play consistently the deep ball in the second area Eliott straight up the middle down a little room to work at around benign a lot of game left I think this is a critical possession right here for the Alabama defense they have to try to get some momentum back on their side they got the punt I don't know if it was a mistake I'm believing it was a mistake by the Ohio State return team did not have a guy back there they pinned them deep they've got to keep him here and try to get a three now their second time that their father has put him at the 5yard line tonight so far they've moved it four yards further and now Jones will keep it himself and that big fellow at 250 pounds might have just picked up the first down it's going to be close it is the first down he's not a whole lot smaller than the guy here and right behind this energico before he's almost as big as Jacobi's definitely taller than them he'll that's a low running up through there that's a big time to get it out to a first down and out the 15yard line he doesn't have to be standing on his own goal one two take the shotgun snaps back to Elliot and Ezekiel across the 22 the 22 Landon Collins had gone to the locker room before the half didn't come out and play in one series then he left early again running to the locker room with the athletic trainer Jeff Allen he had come back with a new rep on that right shoulder he is playing now guys but he is their most physical safety for Alabama maybe their most important guy on defense how does that shoulder affect his ability to get up there and hit guys for sure devin Smith right here again the deep threat guy in the slot difficult to cover him when he's in the slot second down and three play fake quick throw away intercepts it no not quite Cyrus Jones boy he jumped that round and I thought he had another one and he might have been off to the races to the end zone but he couldn't hold it in on this one Cyrus Jones looking at the quarterback the hallway slips inside the block huge now it's third down and three shortest third down they've had tonight though and they picked up eight of their eleven straight ahead and again the quarterback the one at over wouldbe tacklers they haven't called very many designed quarterback runs because of their lack of depth quarterback but when they've called it only a few times that was a design quarterback run to pick up a huge first down of course when Braxton Miller was quarterback he was almost one of the best running backs in the Big Ten JT Barrett a shifty water and then the power of 12gauge Jones throws complete Spencer and he's not across the 40 or seven Spencer have you missed you'd have one of the huge plays in this game and hinder on pass the first pass he's thrilled in his life as a collegiate player was for a touchdown it's just interesting for me to watch Cardale Jones right now because the more this game goes on the more comfortable and confident he looks he's not afraid to hang in there is it nope he's made some throws with some company with him in the backfield this runs going to be stopped short by the first down will bring up third down and a long yard as Ezekiel Elliott getting helped up there but got it to the 42 Oh Katie now to try to run it wide here and that's not going to work either nice pursuit by Reggie Ragland to stretch it out and it's a loss of three BIOS they tried to go in the quick snap it was a little bit of a trick play using it wide receiver as a running back they tried to quick snap it and Raglan made a beautiful play fought off the block of the net the tight end and made the tackle for a loss of yardage that was a stuff that Alabama desperately needed and Ohio State's going to have to pull it away as I'm Kambiz Cameron Johnson they got the stop but because Ohio State was able to convert a couple first downs in that drive they're in pretty good position to punt this football away Christian Jones weights back around the 15 and the rugby style punt and Dover and Jones is just going to get out of the way and hope it makes it to the end zone but I don't think it did it's at the 1 foot line and it's Devon Smith that's not the only thing he does is catch long touchdown passes starter's play on special teams for these guys that's why it was so important to make a couple first house flip the field almost as good as scoring the 2015 Allstate Sugar Bowl is brought to you by AT&amp;T presenting sponsor of the college football playoff national championship game the Quicksilver card from Capital One earn unlimited 1.5% cash back every purchase every day and Honda starts something special Alabama deep in its own territory thanks to devin Smith downing that book at the oneyard line Ohio State a sixpoint lead and Bama at the one they've started some drives inside their own ten several times this year they do have three touchdowns they've got a couple of turnovers as well they've got a long ways to go to try to get the lead back here I wouldn't be surprised if they throw it on this first down play even though they're inside the one TJ Yeldon is behind Blake Sims they'll hand it to him and he's cut down after a pickup of one the early again boys made a lot of tackles it seems tonight or some big plays the redshirt freshman linebacker Alabama two possessions here to start the second half first one started on their own 19 and this one inside 2 1 Amari Cooper is that kind of quiet the last few possessions for Alabama Sims about three yards deep in his own end zone to take the snap and they're going to keep it on the ground and yelled and broke it out there for what looks like a first down he looked quick on that play too did not start the game but he looked awful quick bursting through the hole and that one about that block fudge Alston Fowler that gave him the room to get out to the 12 yard line great look at it from above follows a very important key to this offense voted one of the captains senior automobile that's Derek Henry back in the tailback spot and he'll get the toss with Fowler in front of a Derrick Henry down the sideline big one by the big fella who has a touchdown tonight and that time he picks up 21 well they outflank them they brought the tight Oh J Howard in motion he got a block they pulled the tackle cam Robinson and as you mentioned Fowler out there leading it they got on the edge they outflank The Ohio State defense and Derrick Henry with that speed 33 a drive it started about their own two foot line has him a first down at the 33 yard line that's Fowler in motion again they fake the toss at a throwback to Fowler and I'm collision there after a four yard pickup pretty nice play by Blake Sims it didn't get in a lot of yards but when you run a bootleg like that you got to get your head and eyes around right away in case there's somebody still there Ohio State played it very disciplined and he did a nice job Blake Sims of getting his eyes around and completing the pass the father that comes out as a wide receiver to the bottom of your screen they'll give it to Henry he's going to lose a yard maybe to Bennett in Washington in on the stop third downs tonight Ohio State has owned it Alabama has suffered because of it and look at the average yards to go for Alabama that's manageable distance but a very poor average so far Yeldon back in there he and Fowler switch places Sims quick throw intercepted by Steven dream what else can happen in this game what a perfect call Luke fit gold and Chris ash they anticipated on that third down play that Blake Sims would look for Amari Cooper on a slant they dropped the defensive end on his own pressure right in the way of that thrown they brought inside linebackers to rush the quarterback they dropped the defensive end and he was right in the throwing lane in front of Amari Cooper darn burgers extra point up and good 3:21 remaining third quarter I noticed a sign earlier that said the Steve Miller Band was playing to the Superdome later on this month Steve Miller Band just struck here from the defensive line of Ohio State let's take a look at tonight's good hands play brought to you by Allstate top well perfect design Ohio State is going to rush linebackers here this is Steve Miller right here he is going to drop in the zone coverage and be right in the throwing Lane in front of Omari Cooper Ohio State guest perfectly on that third down play and not only do they get the interception they do one better they get the touchdown looked like a tight end number 88 brand like a tight end once he got his mitts on it 28 unanswered Buckeye points in a game that looked like it was gonna go sour you know high OH stage direction when it was 21 to 6 and now look what it is and now the pressures on the number one team the Crimson Tide of Alabama Christian Jones from just inside the five all the special teams have been special that's three big hits by Cory Smith the wide receiver plan on special teams you know there's a physicality to this wide receiver group of Ohio State and I don't think it's any accident because Urban Meyer is an oldschool coach and as he started as an assistant coach he was a wide receiver coach at Illinois State at Colorado State at Notre Dame before he became the head coach at Bowling Green he's an oldschool physical football coach and the wide receivers on this team are very physical this is the largest deficit this year if you wonder in the previous they were down 12 to the Iron Bowl Auburn they came back to win that one now they got their work cut out for him again Sims deep Sawa nobody home Amari Cooper has shown some signs of frustration a little bit you see him coming back to the huddle trying to get on the same page with his quarterback it has been a very quiet night for the polenta cough winter so far he's had a few catches but no big plays and that has been rare for him particularly in the last half of the season six catches is all tonight he's had three games of over 200 yards receiving nowhere near that tonight second down at Sam play action Sims fires this time he's got it complete to Amari Cooper on a first down there couple 15 nice job using a stack formation they have he and D Andrew white kind of run off the line of scrimmage at the same time very tough to double cover a receiver like that in that kind of a formation at Cooper with a nice catch every day everybody has a look over to the Alabama sideline ironically you mentioned that Auburn come back it was after Blake Sims third interception in the game that things turned around sidearms us one little screen Derrick Henry 6:3 241 pounds and explosive he goes 52 yards and Alabama's back in the redzone they actually spotted him down at the 17 TJ Yeldon trying to cut back looking for a block from his quarterback and a stiff arm as he goes out at the 10 Winery spots right now by Alabama and Blake Sims it's been kind of the mark of him this year one of the reasons why his team really rallied around him so much his resiliency and this team showing some resiliency on this drive trying to get back in the ball game voted the most inspirational player on the team for Alabama he's inspiring things right now Yeldon first and goal for the tide at the five wrigley on ground the right guard with a nicely block on that play they need another touchdown in the red zone here to tighten this game back up first ago Alabama at the Ohio State five Sam's play fake lobs it for Vogler he couldn't handle a little too far out in front on his tight end at beginning over the arms of Rashad Fraser number 17 the defensive end who is rushing Fraser sixfootfour unable to get that pass down and up remember Simms is only a six foot quarterback Cooper listening intently to his quarterbacking as he trots out to the top of your screen with Christian Jones and be surprised to see a quarterback run design here Fowler the fullback he's going to lead the way for exactly what Todd call two great blogs here kalonzo the left guard Justin Fowler who we've seen doing a great job as a lead blocker and Blake Sims showing the resiliency that he has shown all season in his one year as the starting quarterback gets it in the endzone for the touchdown Adam Griffith point after good just over a minute remaining in the third quarter this thing is really getting interesting Blake Sims waited his time at Alabama to be the starting quarterback he's just cut it to 3428 fifth year senior out of gainesville georgia with a touchdown and it's 34 28 nice execution on the touchdown run couple key blocks Austin Shepherds going to get a block in the linebacker McMillan and then you're going to see the guard rasam Frasier he's not going to know what hit him because he gets doubleteamed here first it's go on Joe then it's Fowler and Blake Sims gets right in the hip pocket and takes it into the end zone impressive drive and nice resiliency shown by Blake Sims after the pick six to get Alabama right back within six 84 yard margin seven plays just took them a little over two minutes to make it a one possession football game Sammy O's not going to bring out the savings time dominated college football during his eighth season street anthem championships in five years oh nine eleven and twelve seven straight 10win seasons which is an SEC record at number one of The Associated Press poll at some point in each of the last seven years of course the new college football playoff they came into this one with the number one ranking number for Ohio State has the lead number to Oregon took care of business in the Rose Bowl today over number three Florida State so we've got about 16 minutes to figure out who joins the Ducks in Arlington quarterback run all the way for Jones it's up five I think the reason at Ohio State is doing this even though they take the risk of getting their quarterback hit I think Alabama came into the game not expecting many quarterback runs because of the depth issue they knew if JT Barrett was there that was a big part of Ohio State's offense and Ohio State is recognizing that and calling cartel's number more as a designed run second down at five from literally here comes a blitz off the corner Elliott takes it the other way and got a couple before he ran into trouble from trade a priest and Reggie Ragland the two linebackers that might be the end the three here final ten seconds Andy first edition the Allstate Sugar Bowl one quarter to go both teams are going to hold up those four fingers who will be holding up the fingers at the end of the game stick around fourth quarter they Allstate Sugar Bowl set to begin with Todd Blackledge in Holly Rowe Brad Nessler and this has been everything we hoped for and then some final quarter 34 hyoh state with a lead that nine eleven thirteen third down conversions tonight challenges five of seven throwing on third down all five completions have gone for first down Elliott joins into the backfield he'll throw again no he won't he's going to keep it he's going to go down great play by Jonathan Allen that defensive front for Alabama I think that was by design to run this was not a scramble I think this was a design run because his EQ Elliott is leaking through to get a block on the linebacker and it's just played beautifully by Jonathan Allen firstteam allsec Allen and a bigtime play there to force the punt Johnston's last puck traveled 60 yards that was with the roll this one end over end fair catch taken around the 26 yard line by Christian Jones Lake Simms has led the Crimson Tide at three comefrombehind wins this year October he points to come back and beat Auburn 55 to 44 and again that Auburn game he threw his third interception the first possession of the third quarter Auburn scored to go up by 12 and after that he settled down and led his team back similar situation here tonight Derrick Henry straight up the gut for about 70 we're at some point when you're a defensive player you got to get sick of looking at number 27 TJ Yeldon has played a lot here in the second half more than he did in the first half and has looked good when he's been in the game second and three Henry again diving and somebody's helmet came off of the middle Michael Bennett he's shaken up as well he made the tackle he was the one who got the legs knocked out of Derrick Henry and lost his helmet he'll have to come out for a play he's looking for his Duncan right now losing he might have gotten Derek Henry's need on that outlet looks like it he's had a heck of a ballgame sure has you know he has played well down the stretch in the Big Ten championship game four tackles for loss he forced two fumbles when he's healthy and when he doesn't have to play 60 or 70 snaps in a game he is really disruptive on the inside he's been a disrupter tonight and we got the first down at the 36 Sims going to throw it out Amari Cooper on the corner and Cooper's close to another first down Auburn ran this for a touchdown against them in the Iron Bowl in 2013 quarterback run but you've got that little bubble screen as an outlet instead of a pitchman they react to the run you throw it out to Amari Cooper and you get another first down Alabama fans are saying we don't want to steal anything from offer except to win but they did steal that play and it's a first down at the 47 Sims pumpfake once now he's in trouble trying to dance out of it somehow dead Blake Sims he's going to get planted by Dearing the lead but he made something out of nothing there the heck of a job to get out of trouble but not able to throw the football downfield goodbye Ohio State he's been very tonight from his linebacker position goes down as a sack the third of the night with the loss of two Bennett's back in there Sims under center blitz coming he fakes it to Henry and rifles at far side and it's incomplete well short of Amari Cooper who was covered by Eli Apple so long throw for Blake stems from the left hash throwing a deep comeback route to the right sideline he had been great on third downs leading the country this year that's not the case tonight it's the longest third down right now if you're Blake Sims don't take any unnecessary risks there's a lot of time left you're one score down you can flip the field if you have to punt don't force a bad play middle screen to Henry and he's going to be dropped by Curtis Grant the senior middle linebacker in one of the captains nice play by Green yeah with this clutter they have he's different oh he's put a couple down around the 5yard line tonight great leg for Jay case got the freshman out of Denver and there's only average in 61 yeah Nayland Marshall we'll wait back inside the ten and again it's it way into the lights here of the Superdome and almost mishandle that would have been a disaster Jalen Marshall gets his hands out there and snatches it right around the 8 yard line the 11th 17 remaining in the fourth quarter great game going on here in New Orleans Ohio State a sixpoint lead that got the ball back here in the fourth quarter Cardale Jones in his second start has 18 completions 243 yards one of the ways he's getting some big plays is against the two deep coverage finding that soft spot in the middle of those two safeties behind the linebackers usually it's been Jalen Marshall finding that spot know where the weaknesses in the defense Cardale Jones delivering the ball down the middle of the field at a hundred and fifty three of those 243 yards have been on third down third time they've had to start inside their own 10yard line because of the plumbing that JK Scott and he's hit Jones down at the for DJ Pat way got him from behind xavier dixon was coming in front of him he did not feel pat way coming from behind and for one of the rare times on a first down play an outstanding pass rush by Alabama and luckily for guard alley him out of the football that's why it was so important to not make a bat play by Blake Sims pump the ball Ohio State in some duress deep in their own territory only to about the five trade of priests in the middle of that pile come on with Raglan ragheads a little shaking up at the end of that tackle he's had a heck of a ballgame since he became a starter this year he is really taken off Jr out of Madison Alabama not mentioned the size of the linebackers going to 54 DePriest 250 and Duvall 250 for Dylan Lee another backup linebackers not 100% there you see just kind of led with the head and gets up very woozily at the end of that play Rubin Foster is another inside linebacker who will probably be in in this situation they're taking Reggie to the locker room Ezekiel Elliott who had such a big first half for Ohio State a hundred seventeen yards rushing in the first half only twenty four yards on six carries in the second half third down and a bunch Jones dannegan his own goal line into the end zone the troll go to go deep left side out they're broken up by Cyrus Jones on a pass intended for devin Smith devin Smith looking for a call pretty well played by Cyrus Jones I mean that is living on an island if you're a cornerback man coverage the wide side of the field is just you and him and you know what a deep threat he is and Cyrus Jones able to make a play on the football little hands fightin going on between both of them and now it's going to be a plumbing situation for Ohio State and their putter is standing almost on his head line as you look behind Cameron Johnston it should be great field position for Alabama regardless of how he hits this one Christian Jones flags fly and get the playoffs now he's really gonna have a cramped situation back there he is running on a real estate back there this is going to be a shorter snap than he would like to handle I don't know Alabama might try to come with the pressure up the middle or not I don't think you need to you're going to get great field position no matter what Christian Jones does on this end I think Ohio State moved again he's going to be playing quarterback under center to kick this thing pretty soon the unfortunate thing for Ohio State as they are in the Alabama end of the field the majority of the Alabama fans are right down there the Alabama band right down where they're snapping this football in this part of the field very hard to hear you can see how close Solana scrimmages to the plotter now Johnston got it out of there in a hurry high kick but short Jones has to clear out of the way it takes a bounce backward it's going to begin about the 23 yard line 21yard one sometimes that's the the part of that rugby style kicking that comes gun can get you that ball you want it to spin back if you're kicking down towards the end zone but you don't want it to spin back at midfield and unfortunate bounce per ohio state so here's the opportunity for Alabama at the Buckeye 23 yard line trailing by six and almost to the red zone already without taking a snap Oh J Howard the tight end comes out and lines up by the left side we haven't seen anyone from him tonight and have re Cooper in motion Sims rolls right fires intercepted wasted opportunity again for Alabama Alabama tried to do a little bit of a trick play people want lathe they sent Amari Cooper widely and tried to get it to OJ Howard Vaughn Bell was not fooled at all and is there to slip in and make the interception huge play for the Buckeyes you the 2015 Allstate Sugar Bowl is brought to you by Allstate proud supporters of college football are you in good hands the Lincoln Motor Company and the firstever MKC and Taco Bell bringing you the first ever student section at the college football playoff live mas Ohio State's got the ball back courtesy of on Bell's sixth interception of the year trouble Jones got out of it or a little bit of safety still a loss a for with the SEC second time Carnell Jones very close to a safety if it weren't for his size and strength he probably wouldn't have gotten this one out of the end zone but he fights forward out of the end zone to avoid the two points for Alabama Geron Reed with the pressure from the inside now he finds himself in his own end zone again to take the snap on second and 14 throws low as it's off the lighthouse intended for Evan Spencer the other thing you have to be careful are there hasn't been a holding call on Ohio State but when you're throwing from this part of the field and your quarterback is in the end zone you don't want to get a holding penalty resulting in a safety though third down and 14 there's his third down passing that we talked about but this is a big one here then a role to throw that one's caught but it's well short of the first down I don't think that one was caught II don't guess not so now States right back in the situation that were earlier had a good point miss cribbage inside the ten that's three straight three and outs for the Buckeyes office remember last one only 121 yards with a backward bounce see what Johnston does this time they hit him there's a flag ball boy and Jones is buried on the the last time they did not go after him they set up a punt return it was a short punt and they got great field position this time they came after the punter Johnston and ran into him now is it five yards or is it more there goes the headset suggest it's not personal it was a personal foul I think you still have the headsets on here's the callup coming from Latin Clark so the last cribbage would be the 45yard line with 846 remaining of the football game in Alabama trailing by six another look at the penalty and Urban Meyer's reaction 8:46 remaining in the fourth quarter still a six point game and the Allstate Sugar Bowl here in New Orleans want to bring in Bill Imani our rules expert on that last play on the run again to the putter call that infuriated Urban Meyer bill well we hit the kicker displaced honest he wasn't roughed he hits the upper leg kicker spins that Nissen goes down he kind of put a little accent with the spin but he was only displaced a little demiplie if ever you call it headsets going to get this place I don't know where that went babies out there someplace in Alabama at the 45yard line the Andrew whited motion fake the stretch play and Sims wants to throw and that he's going to run with it gets what he can and gets out of bounds right about Litchfield well after Blake Sims first interception that was returned for a touchdown he responded with resiliency and brought his team back for a touchdown to cut the lead to six he threw his second interception when they had a golden opportunity to take the lead after the poor punt let's see how he responds this time again that's been his MO all season is resiliency and that's why his teammates that rallied behind him so strongly throughout the year play clock down to five right now Alabama might have to burn a timeout there it is and they do take a timeout so they've only got two left one interception that was returned for a touchdown by Steve Miller that's the first pick six thrown by an Alabama quarterback since 2007 that's the one that's the difference in the ballgame right now don't forget NFL playoffs do it on ESPN the Panthers NFC South champions went by Cam Newton against Larry Fitzgerald and the Arizona Cardinals who are trying to piece it together with their third quarterback NFL playoffs wild card rats Saturday 420 Stern about ESPN there's the difference in the ball game offensive lineman interception return for a touchdown fellow Canton Ohio native way to Canton McKinley for the Bulldogs the football right at the midfield strike Derek Henry got first down inside the 45 think Alabama will go back to being very fundamental here traveling to Smash Mouth football some playaction off of that the last interception Blake Sims threw they were trying to go a little bit tricky and fool the Ohio State defense and it backfired on him it didn't fool Vaughn Bell and they ended up throwing the interception at the oneyard line Derrick Henry that closed them in on that 100yard mark as well Ezekiel Elliott all well over that for Ohio State here's Henry and a nice cutback got close to the 41 we talked about early in the ball game that her band Meyer said to us he loved his preparation he felt great about his team his only question was are we good enough I think that question has been answered very well they are definitely good enough to not only be in this game to win this game or to potentially play for a national championship this year straight drop by Sims on second and seven pressure coming from Bosa he runs away from him but only got to the 40yard line nice job on Amari Cooper had Eli Apple in coverage with a safety bought Bell over the top four straight runs what do you got to think that they're gonna have to put one in the air here on the season third in the FBS tonight the one for nine third down and six you bring the tightend out here to hopefully draw coverage by a corner play here Cooper up on top quarterback draw Sims loses yardage Darren Lee again Darren Lee has played a heck of a ballgame he's coming on the Blitz he reads it and he falls back in to make the tackle on the run red quarterback run immediately and made the nice play it's 4th down but the good news is if you're an Alabama fan number 15 has dropped three inside the 10 tonight including two at the 5 Alabama was a man short on their punt team Scott I kicked again bounces down inside the five again why this guy's done a little bit of everything you know he's boomed along once and he's shown the finesse kick as well 5:24 time becoming a factor this Allstate Sugar Bowl at 10:15 tomorrow night's how important is field position Ohio State's last three possessions they start at their own nine eight and five and there's a fourthquarter offense 12 yards no first times Alabama's hoping they can keep that statistic intact right here again Jones set his own goal line gives it off to Elliott and Ezekiel goes for about four is rejecting with Holly well linebacker was already position on this Alabama defense that had very little depth it's a concern of their team and so they have now lost two linebackers in this game guys Reggie Ragland just came out of the locker room in street clothes he will not return they previously lost Dillon lead shoulder injury he's in street clothes they're jamming to Reuben Foster and Sean Dean Hamilton a true freshman Jones empty backfield is gone along with it across the ten puts the power into cybers Jones but Jones got him on the ground picked up five and cartel's a little bit slow getting up after that run third down and one coming up four minutes one possession game five states missed their last for third down conversions this is a short war vote I'm not sure I wouldn't run him again I'm not so sure I wouldn't give it to 15 just got it Atlantic columns shaken up again remember playing with a bad bright shoulder or upper arm what and he's on the turf again when the last two plays as they take a look at Landon Collins Cardale Jones has gotten hit pretty hard Collins hit him on this one and then he got hit again by Nick Perry the other safety and that run by Jones is the fourth time tonight that he's rushed for a first down on a third down situation only needed one and he got a little bit more than that he's trying to get a quick breather here he and Collins he bounces up and bounces to the sideline you see if he comes back in after one play that first down for the Buckeyes that's the first first down they've had since there was eight minutes left in the third quarter it was huge because the the clock is on their side Alabama with two timeouts they're not in the area yet where they need to think about using them but that conversion bought Ohio State some valuable time right now hi Oh state using as much of the clock as they can the clock restarted after the injured player Landon Collins was taken off they can run about 20 seconds off the clock here Ezekiel Elliott No eightyfive the longest play from scrimmage allowed by Alabama this year career high night for Zico Elliot hey there go for two here and it's good to Thomas said it's a twotouchdown lead Gershon Dion Hamilton the freshman that's him right here Evans fencer we've already said he's a buffer as a blocker the wide receiver watch the block he gets on the freshman linebacker key blocking the play Ezekiel Allen gets behind that block Billy price gets a block on the safety Nick Perry and then the speed of Ezekiel Elliott does the rest Kevin Spencer has thrown a touchdown and he just threw the block that may have secured the Sugar Bowl for Ohio State the last two games for this young man 14 carries 450 yards a careerhigh of 230 right now and he had a 54 yarder earlier the game this one takes the cake 85 yards for the touchdown going into the Big Ten championship people wondered if the Buckeyes even belong in the college football playoff then they took care of the Badgers 59 to nothing and right now they're up 42 to 28 number one Alabama and now Alabama urgently needs office or maybe a big play by Christian Jones here Jones got to the edge they'll drag it down but a nice return after the 35 and he's hurt he almost got the seamy needed and then run down from behind and it's his lower right leg and you can see that right ankle already heavily taped he pops up and go ahead to the cylon a nice kick return and you see that ankle get twisted around as he's dragged down about Ezekiel Elliott the last half of the season first date games he averaged 88 yards per game he got better the offensive line got better and down the stretch he's been as good as there is in the big 10 and maybe in college football run on the football right now he got off stage sugarbowl rushing record here's a throwback and over the head of OJ Howard they tried to get him out of a tight end screen over here and that been work Steve Miller was reading that all the way Miller of course at the big play the 41 yard touchdown off the interception that gave Ohio State the cushion event Ezekiel Elliott and a twopoint conversion has made that cushion bigger Alabama never used one of their timeouts earlier they only got two and we've only got three 12 left in the fourth quarter they need some big plays Sims trying to get him on let this happen you got a twotouchdown lead you react to the double move watch the second move here the safety jumped it that was Titus POW and that's just a nono in this situation of your Ohio State nothing can get behind you keep everything in front and a big opportunity here for Alabama with 248 left in the game a 51 yard pass play down to the 14 yard line Sims again try to throw a middle screen and that one ran into some traffic adolphus Washington might have gotten a hand on it was intended for Derek Henry one good thing about that place where Alabama is the incomplete pass yet the club exactly because it wasn't going to go anywhere 80 baron who was the starter the majority of the season up until he broke his ankle and Cardale Jones who's been very good tonight Sims and he throws this one away Marc Cooper was the closest guy threw it away because he knew Joey Bosa was coming free Joey Bosa who hasn't had a lot of activity in the backfield but has played a solid ballgame that time was very close to getting his hands on the quarterback Blake Sims is only one of five on third downs tonight he's got a punch here this is two down territory though so they don't need all ten right now they missed their last seven third days of virgin they're in desperate need of a conversion here first down would come at the 4yard line since fires wide side completes and a big hit over there at the 5yard line on Chris black by Vaughn Bell let's see where they're gonna spot it wasn't about it looks like you know that's exactly what it will be if this play in a little bit quicker if your Alabama your two scores behind at 2:15 in the clock Berlin would be ballgame here they don't get this Sims was trying to call a timeout Luke's pickle was trying to call a timeout from the sidelines and they couldn't get it done the ball was snapped and Blake Sims is able to find his main guy Amari Cooper for the touchdown desperately in need of a touchdown they got it capping a 65yard quick strike in a minute 17 seconds and six plays Adam Griffith that allimportant point after is good Wow a game a minute 59 to go fourth down and two Luke fickle doesn't like what he sees he wants to get a timeout call he's trying to get a timeout called they don't get it done the ball snapped and Blake Sims has his man single covered by Eli Apple and that's a touchdown for Alabama look like Luke Bickle was looking to Urban Meyer hempen everyone gets a slave to him didn't see that coming go spot it wasn't about two it looks like you know that's exactly what it will be get this play in a little bit quicker if your Alabama your two scores behind at 2:15 in the clock rolling good bball game here if I don't get this Sims Rose creeper touchdown Ohio State was trying to call a timeout Luke's pickle was trying to call a timeout from the sidelines and they couldn't get it done the ball was snapped and Blake Sims is able to find his main guy Amari Cooper for the touchdown desperately in need of a touchdown they got it capping a 65yard quickstrike in a minute 17 seconds and six plays Adam Griffith that allimportant point after is good Wow the game a minute 59 to go fourth down and two Luke's fickle doesn't like what he sees he wants to get a timeout called he's trying to get a timeout called they don't get it done the ball snap and Blake Sims has his man single covered by Eli Apple and that's a touchdown for Alabama it looked like Luke pickle was looking to Urban Meyer as if dissension we use it here should we use it here and that it's too late and Cooper in the end zone again who's gonna fill a bracket in two minutes we're having fun finding out I'll tell you that much Oregon is their win over Florida State at the Rose Bowl earlier today so they are in the national championship presented by AT&amp;T Monday January 12 8:30 Eastern on ESPN it'll either be Alabama or Ohio State but we've still got 159 to figure that out and barn overtime who knows maybe we'll be here a while that big twopoint conversion by Ohio State after their last touchdown yeah keeping this a sevenpoint lead it was a sixpoint lead for quite a while Alabama has an attempt at an onside kick this year looks like they're going to try one here might be different if they had all three of their timeouts but I guess they're gonna take a shot at it here Griffith gets the goahead here comes took a high bounce a second bounce tipped and I think heaven Spencer caught it and he went high to catch that one that looked like the perfect onside kick mouths and Evan Spencer showed nerves of steel gauging this and timing his jump and catching it at the high point he out jumped our Darrius Stewart number 13 pulled it down and swim out to huge plays by number six in this ballgame an endaround pass from his wide receiver position to Michael Thomas and now that foot in the block on ezq only he's had a heck of a ballgame 1:57 to go Ohio State by a touchdown darnell Jones takes the snap he's actually gonna throw and he's going along knocked away and especially intended receiver and Cyrus Jones's with him strive for strive now and no time used virtually on the clock now the seven seconds it took to run the play but that's it double move Cyrus Jones stride for stride with Evan Spencer and a nice play on the ball that fast surprised me a little bit a little bit I understand you want to try to end it expecting Alabama to sellout but if you're going to do that why not do it to Devin Smith he's your deep threat guy not Spencer Ohio State's got to use the timeout and no more time let's take a look at tonight's Capital One dividend performance you can't have a performance much better than this guy has put on for us tonight this 54 yard run down the sideline including that hurdle job they didn't get a touchdown out of that but they did get points he scored in close and then proving he is one of the best backs in the pits in if not the country got a look up at the scoreboard to see if anybody's chasing nobody's gonna catch him 85 yards for the touchdown the other thing Brad about why that call was curious on first down with two timeouts now Alabama can stop the clock after second down and after third down and Ohio State can't bleed the clock this is going to be your own by Curtis Samuel there's the time out right away you see traitor freeze call it immediately there's Kirby smart defensive coordinator on the sideline and he of course and Nick Saban worked together so part of that defense then right now they need defense yeah they need one more stop here and they've got the one timeout still in their pocket because of the incomplete pass on first down so they got to play solid and fundamental they can't sell out and leave a big gap in the second level of their defense if Ohio State runs the football here get a stop get a timeout if Cardale Jones makes one more big play it might be the play that ends the football game and sends him Darlington for the national championship now State fans that are here praying that they can find a third down and nine the Alabama fans thinking the opposite and it's Jones going to run for that he's backpedaling and that's about the last thing you want to happen Nick Perry tried to strip the ball Cardale Jones got a little too cute on that one and when he reversed field it's a good thing he was protecting the football because Nick Perry was coming for the strip ledge that's about a 10 yard difference and that's going to make a big difference on what or where this pump lands yep so the line of scrimmage now is the 39 when once they had it at the 49 Alabama will have no timeouts but a decent amount of time the question is now do they go after this punt they ran into him last time yep Christian Jones is waiting back inside the 20yard line he's had moments in his Alabama career when he's come up and pulled off a big punt or kick return for a score setting up the return and he has to call fair catch so Alabama ticks over around the 16 yard line trailing by a touchdown and no time outs the Ohio State only ran 26 seconds off the clock those three plays they had so if your play Sims with no timeout the clocks always going to stop if you make it first down until they reset the chains you can use your clock kill play or throw the ball to the side lines in the LSU game when they trail there were only 50 seconds left and they started on their own 35 and Blake Sims took them to the 10 yard line for a gametying field goal they need a touchdown in this one there's the Biletnikoff winner that you said three and a half hours ago it helps the quarterback if you got somebody like him what Blake Sims cannot do here is take us out throws complete to Howard that's Ida that's his first catch but they keep him in bounds clock will continue to move who's trying to get him lined up in a hurry valuable time ticking off that clock why he didn't have to place called there at the line of scrimmage this time they go to black and he complete clock ticking under a minute third down that's irrelevant Alabama's moving way too slowly here sure are Sims slants it the Andrew White's got it that'll stop the clock to move the chains momentarily but they've only got it out to the 38 yard line now you either got to move fast here you got to kill the clock here and huddle up but whatever it is you got to do it with a sense of urgency they're losing time here now the 33 seconds Sims in trouble can't take the sack as Todd said he's going to run for it gotta get to the sideline he's got to midfield and that will stop the clock to move the chains I think she didn't walk in hurry it up I think you need to line up and Spike the football and get in a huddle call clock hasn't started yet now it has at the midfield strife 20 seconds to play Sims throws Whiteside Howard's got it he gets out of bounds just as good fifteen seconds romantic again the difference between this and the LSU game the LSU game they just needed a field goal to tie in force overtime to the horse over time here we'll have a chance to win they've got to get it all the way to the endzone Amari Cooper comes out to the bottom of your screen 15 seconds to play no timeouts for Alabama trailing by touchdown pressure coming it's going to air that long floats in the air and almost caught by the end of the white but broken up by Eli Apple and now 8 seconds is all we got left not sure why you're not throwing this in the direction of Amari Cooper if he's the best receiver in college football and I'm gonna throw the ball up and give somebody a chance I'm gonna give number nine that chance no disrespected the Andrew White but the guy who came into the game with 115 catches should get the ball targeted to him here maybe the last play sims deep hailmary not answer it intercepted Ohio State's gonna win it the dream continues for the Buckeyes the nightmare starts they two old rivals two of the best of the business and the Buckeyes were they upset in New Orleans was left with the Hail Mary it was all they had time to do I didn't think they managed the clock very well early in this possession and on the final play Tyga's Powell comes down with the football the 13th win of the season for Ohio State in dramatic fashion in wood as an instant classic Ohio State / Alabama let's check in with Holly she said the challenge of this game was are you good enough what did your team show you tonight to answer that question respect that was a sledgehammer game what were you thinking with that ball in the air I just want to make sure we give our kids a chance to win they close the middle of field because you got the best receiver in college football we just will make sure we get some hands on very job well done it's your third string quarterback I don't want to minimize Cardale Jones but how are you continuing to do this despite all the adversity quarterbacks the product goes around got some good players around here future's bright at Ohio State a night for the ages what stood out to him only rated back in the country defense I'm not sure what he ran for and a Super Bowl record for Ezekiel Elliott got the trophy presentation as well as the Ford postgame

ESPN this is the Ford postgame show welcome back to New Orleans the celebration going on on the field for the underdog ohio state buckeyes the Big Ten champions are going to play for the overall championship as they're gonna beat Oregon out the in Arlington Texas on ESPN January 12th and they'll go in I don't know if there will be an underdog against Oregon or not but man what a performance they go on tonight well and remember early in this game it was 21 to 6 Ohio State had had goal to go situations couldn't get it in the end zone had to settle for field goals game could have really gotten away from them to that point they maintained their poise the next time they were down there they got to score and from that point on they played as the more confident team I thought the rest of the ball game I'm pretty sure I know who's gonna be the most outstanding player in the football game but urban talked about it with with Holly down there we talked about all the great backs the Big Ten has had this year led by Melvin Gordon who of course was second and the Heisman voting but as he threw people long today men absolutely and he has got outstanding speed to go along with his ability to break tackles first five games 88 yards per game stretch he was a workhorse over 200 yards the last two ballgames for the Buckeyes Cardale Jones you can't say enough about the guy makes his second start it's in a pressurepacked situation in front of a packed house that basically was about two thirds Alabama fans in he handled it pretty well and you know he never looked back he never looked like it fazed him you know I don't know if it just was what you don't know doesn't hurt you in situations like this but he looked calm he looked collected even after the interception he kept his poise and he made some big throws and made big plays on third down yeah throughout the night he had 153 of that 243 throwing the football on third down and so a sensational two week two outings two starts for him first the win over Wisconsin and now leading his team to a victory to get them in position for the national championship presented by AT&amp;T Ohio State a lot of people wonder did they belong should it be TCU or Baylor Ohio State well they kind of put that to rest by what they did in the Big Ten championship game and now 12gauge and company the nickname for Cardale Jones proves once again that they I don't think Alabama is overrated but I think maybe Ohio State is underrated I'm not sure if that's the case or not but certainly tonight Urban Meyer again proven that he's one of the best around and absolutely he's got a shot now to play for a third national championship after having to at Florida I think the thing about it is they are a team that has gotten so much better as the season has gone on and that's what you have to have to to get into a playoff and make a run and win a championship we saw him against Virginia Tech they were not a good football team at that point we saw him against Penn State they had to go to two overtimes in State College to beat Penn State they still weren't quite there at that point but from that point on they were as good as anybody in college football you know there's the man of the hour not just the coach but the running back everybody's getting their new caps and tshirts Allstate Sugar Bowl champs on it and maybe an opportunity to finally get another national championship back to Columbus as we get out of John Saunders all right thanks a lot ladies and gentlemen time for our trophy presentation we're going to get some of the players up here at the podium as we congratulate first the Alabama Crimson Tide and coach Nick Saban on a tremendous season but it's time to celebrate the Allstate Sugar Bowl champs the Ohio State Buckeyes and I'm going to welcome Judge Dennis Waldron who's our Super Bowl president judge thank you coach on behalf of the Allstate Sugar Bowl committee it is my honor and pleasure to

on the way to win you know and that's the magic of college football that not only makes us love this sport but what a great country it is thank you for sharing it with us and to you personally I've had the opportunity this before I am so pleased to see you bring your talents to yet another story program so as you go forward next week remember it's national championship time congratulations go bucs I'm not sure if you want to try picking up the trope is pretty heavy indeed a few players have helped all right let me get hitting any ER guys and try and talk doctor Coach Meyer coach it was a fantastic season for you guys and we'll talk a little bit about the route here but first of all very few people thought you could can do this especially with car down your third quarterback of the year talked about the resiliency of your team especially falling down and turning the ball over early thank you on behalf the ohio state buckeyes want to thank the Sugar Bowl also thank Li show a lot of respect for opponent the Alabama Crimson Tide but most importantly I want to thank Buckeye Nation for being here tonight thank you very much it says a lot about you as a head coach it says a lot about your players that you're able to lose Broxton then able to lose JT and still able to make it here and win this game so what is it about you as an coach and the resiliency of your players they're able to do something like this this is one of the close as this is this could be the closest group of players I've ever been around and the one thing from the start of our program there's no such thing as an excuse one guy goes down someone's got to go and every time afterwards a game we grab a hand and we're just very grateful for the blessings to be able to play this great game where we play it at the Ohio State University and most importantly playing for each other that's how we did it what what impresses you most about what your team has been able to do it's the resilience when things don't go right and we started that game we didn't play very well we put our defense in bad position I want to say three times not one time did the defense say they know then we're in estoppel and so the offense defense stick and being worked in every previous season winning this game or a game like it in the BCS would mean that you're walking off with the championship but this year it's a play off you have to win one more game to have that championship so does that change anything about how you feel standing up here and how do you prepare for Oregon no I take these guys anywhere if we got you'll play ten more we'll go put in ten more that's how much respect I have my player and real quickly what's your first thoughts on the matchup with Oregon especially after seeing what they are able to do to Florida State tonight well we know the Oregon program very well we share many thoughts cofell for Coach shelf rich is a friend and I think there are two great programs and we're gonna do the best we can to represent the big ten and the great state of Ohio and the Ohio State University all right coach congratulations you made a good decision to leave ESPN I think help worked out pretty well alright time now for the most outstanding players of the game offense and defense I want to bring up Jack the board jack chairman of the allstate sharable Executive Committee first of all the most outstanding offensive player I wanted to wait for that cube to be killing Elliott who of course had an Allstate Sugar Bowl record 230 yards on just 20 carries incredible z were you surprised a bility you had over a hundred yards in the first quarter alone were you surprised at how easily you were able to run on Alabama's defense Eliza's being getting better and better every week and I really have faith in my boys and I knew the bear go out there and I paved the way for me it's clear you guys have a lot of faith in each other and again with Cardell coming in and starting just this second game of the season did you know that you had to have extra pressure on you especially because you did the same thing against Wisconsin as well oh you know this every game I want to come out and do whatever I can to get that W all right is deep congratulations we'll see you in Dallas the defensive play of the game definitely daran this defense stepped up at some incredible incredible times the outfits which in a little bit of a hole with a couple of turnovers early you guys took it on your shoulders after that each other inside the weather the storm I just keep playing fun to literally sound football so you know we know if we kept doing that we'll come out on top are you looking forward to going up against the Heisman Trophy winner and Marcus Mariota I mean it's an honor to get to play play against them but you know we'll be ready congratulations congratulations to the Ohio State Buckeyes hi job thank you celebration continues for the Buckeyes someday I think they'll call that

confetti sentence using the history books the national championship Monday January 12 on ESPN welcome back to the fort postgame show welcome to 2015 we celebrate a new year and a new hero the semifinals are complete one of the largest stages on earth is sick the college football playoff National ten Monday January 12 on ESPN so that's the matchup Brutus will be there at Arlington as Ohio State with an upset at Alabama they came in Ohio State probably being the underdog by nine or ten points and they win it by seven Brad Nessler Todd Blackledge back here in New Orleans with you we saw her again twice this year in person we saw him play a lot of other ball on film and what they did today this is the third time we've seen the Ohio State as you mentioned earlier we saw him against Virginia Tech and that wasn't good their offensive line got better their quarterback got better then they went to the third quarterback and here they are playing for the national championship I think it's an amazing story and it what's made this season so much fun absolutely and the game tonight they dominated the football game they were down early they came storming back they won in every major phase they won total yardage they won rushing they won third down they won turnovers all the games within the game Ohio State was the better team tonight and and goes into the championship game now with a lot of momentum against Oregon I thought Oregon would have some trouble without there all pac12 and one of the top defensive backs in the country being injured and not be in that ballgame didn't seem to hurt them today but the turnovers killed Florida State so let's look ahead we think we've seen these guys enough what do you think's coming up on the 12 well be a great match I think Ohio State matches up fine with Oregon I think they've got a good defensive line that can create some problems they've got speed to match Oregon Marcus Mariota you got to say they have the advantage at quarterback although Cardale Jones two starts he's played beautifully but Marcus Mariota is the best player in college football this year and he had another big game today I think the key will be how does Oregon's defense play because I thought they played very well and what I saw the game today against Florida State not only did they create turnover they did a nice job of just slowing Florida State down and and keeping them out of the end zone early in that ballgame so Oregon's defense how they match up against Ohio State a big key there's a pretty nice day for the big 10 Wisconsin came from behind that's right quarter in one Michigan State I thought that one was over they came back and beat Baylor and now here's the big ten that kind of got beat up on again this year you know how good were they good enough to beat the number one team in the country today and Ohio State the thing you got to say about him and when you talk to Urban Meyer I don't think he's just blowing smoke when he says is he said he thinks this team's a year away from being really good well they're a week away from playing for a national championship and they deserve to be there they deserve to be in the Final Four they won tonight in convincing fashion against Alabama and they've got a shot to play for it all on January 12th well I know you and Holly still have to work the ESPN radio booth for the national championship game would like to reco you and our seasons over to come to a better stop bro yeah was off straight year 4235 that's the final more from New Orleans coming up on SportsCenter for Todd Blackledge Holly Road our ESPN crew Brad Nessler stay in Ohio State going to the national championship welcome everyone to the four push games and the set is packed with Buckeyes from Ohio State on a history making day and night in all of college football there will be oh hi oh State and Oregon playing for the national championship on January the 12th in Arlington Tulsa say hello there's the offensive MVP Ezekiel Elliott there's the defense that would be Darren Lee and of course here's the head coach Urban Meyer and Ervin we'll start with you deep inside territory inside the 10yard line at the Selvam field goals tell me about the end of this game to be followed level defensive backfield position within scoring a red zone and then he kept trying to take these shots and anytime he faced a very good defense you got some issues but they take it and the most resilient group of people I've ever been around coach you own third down on both side of the ball any sense coming in you'd have such success on both sides of the ball on third down well they're actually very good on third down but that's something that we work hard hat puts the money down and anytime you face you got liked Amari Cooper on a we knew number nine left the field I heard over the headsets no an eyes off the field so we knew exactly we think he's the best receiver college football so our staff did a great job but most employees these players man they they just do they do the unthinkable and the unthinkable how about this is eco over 200 yards again two consecutive games a Big Ten championship game in this game how pleased and proud of you not only the job that you did but with your offensive line tell us what this means tell us what this means this stage on your way to Dallas with nobody we believed in each other and we believed in ourselves and ready to come out on top and you get a great team room every third year coach Meyer are you ahead of your plan because this is your third year at Ohio State honestly it's a process but for you to be in the third year the first year of the class there's the championship game is just casually issues excited it was going to be her you hope it's going to be or you're headed all those players last year any time to go through his conscience transition there's a void somewhere and I thought this is going to be the boy gear but you got sophomores like these two guys and Joey pull I'm a sophomore Foss now we sign them they're outstanding they've got better and better as you all along this is the biggest challenge as a coach because you used 3/4 max this season you're down to your third quarterback how about a long career so again a lot of time this has been this has been a lot of fun to coach so there's no there's no resistance whatsoever they just go and their practice they embrace the grind and as a result it would be rewarded for the grind that they've gone through coach in Orlando at the awards show you came one stage you had a chance to ask you was this your best coaching job you didn't want to say yes then what an accomplishment are you willing to now say that this may be your best coaching job ever thought so I'll say this I think it's one of our best recruiting jobs look at the guys next and once again there's the future is really brightening and there's a bunch of good young players coming back and I can't wait to get back in the locker they've got to level this will challenge me to a race what do you what are you thinking of you talking about the future let's talk about the immediate future give me an early thought on our again in the national championship game already installed as an underdog you or another dog here tonight that is the phase you guys you know no I did you expect Cardell to have that many carries to run the ball that much coming in was that the plan they started really great team why did you make that decision to throw the ball long not run the ball make them burn there's uh there's no note that we're playing there's no you can run all your walk by they have to take the guys at the line of scrimmage and so oh yeah that was my call but burn the two timeouts you didn't feel that was more important that you felt like you had that good enough shot Ezekiel I'm just curious about the young quarterback there and the inexperienced quarterback you're the big runner game how was he in the huddle early on and then as the game progressed talking about Kordell first did you ever find your headset tell us about that you had a good headset toss elefante that's back when I was 36 years we're good we're good and let's not go silent Capozzi one fair no thanks Christine Arlington congratulations eagle Elliot Darren Lee congratulations the Ohio State Buckeyes they're looking for seed in this first time ever college football playoff in the four seed will play in the national championship game Carnell challenges with Marty Smith describe this moment for me is unbelievable a big bag SEC it looked to me like watching the game you really settle down when Ezekiel Elliott stored that rushing touchdown what did that do for your confidence the rest of the way he told people make a big play all along with something that we really didn't think was not too much successful when you won the Big Ten championship you said the Buckeyes shocked the world what did you do tonight you know we keep stock in the world once again he was underdogs and once again he was supposed to be here so you know who did it votes on facing Oregon for the national championship great team congratulations you see our Urban Meyer the getaway van there no pizza yet this year hold on the pizza significant I think the tshirts because we saw like the kids from Oregon also after their victory learn today we're in the same tshirt said one not done you know this had a sort of national championship feel to it they'll be fired off one more time and it's another week of experience another week of confidence for cartel Jose then it is for him in his second start to win another big game like this his first start was the Big Ten championship game they won that game then to go to the playoff and win this game basically it's just historic obviously but the way that he played not really killing the football but his composure when he had to take off and run with the football under extreme pressure and the rest he found ways to move to change and I thought that was impressive in the office the quarterback conversations completely over it is done with we had it when Paxton Miller went down we didn't know what JT Barrett would do he goes down before the victim championship game Cardale Jones goes out wins that game and we had the conversation again could he step on this stage with this stage be too big for him he proved it wasn't the quarterback conversation for Ohio State is officially finished the next number is conversation will be in the spring how fun is it going to be them those three guys we come back I wouldn't want to make that decision but it is a great decision to have to make let's not put the cart before the horse let's get to the championship game first how about Tom job he's done the quarterback coach for Ohio State not one not two but three quarterbacks in developing these quarterbacks not only developing and beginning ready to play at such a high level and such with efficiency at the top of their game not making mistakes progressing you look at the growth at each one of these quarterbacks was made every time they stepped on the field the last few years it's amazing what was Jones more impressive to you guys with his legs running especially on third down especially early in the foot in that first half or withers arm passer decisionmaking it was the decisionmaking not just the passing not just the running you need a quarterback to come in and make the right decision he threw a lot of balls away tonight and a lot of times people don't understand that's the best play to make is to get rid of the ball he came into this game and he made decisions to help his team win not turning the ball over had one but still made the decision when the quarterback takes off running a lot of times all you need to do is move the chains and you've seen the big fella went up in the crowd not shy at all big games are won on third down and the Buckeyes were 10 of 18 that's how you win championships and they own third down tonight they definitely did and if you look at the defense for Alabama this is probably the worst tackling job I've seen from an Alabama defense if you looked at the yards after contact by Ohio State not only the receivers but Ezekiel Elliott I mean you look at Cardale Jones they did a poor job of tackling but hats off to Ohio State because they didn't give up I'm the first guy that came in from met them on the tackle they just ran through that tackle and continue to pick up extra yards and a lot of times people talk about the tackling of the defense but a lot of times it's that offensive guy he's not that easy to bring down as ikkyo Elliott is a monster and he showed that tonight it was through tackles it was around people showed the speed after he got through and we always look back and say where that was bad tackling but sometimes those guys are just flatout hard to tackle 230 rushing yards ridiculous most rushing yards in Sugar Bowl history of course this is only one half of the equation on a historical day in college football the other half of the story is what took place out west Ohio State will take on Oregon because of what took place in Pasadena and that's where we find of course Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit fellas guys thank you sounds like some revelry there in New Orleans just getting started pretty quiet here in Pasadena the Ducks are probably home by now Kirk a lot can happen in eight hours over two semi finals you can have a long streak snapped you can have a potential dynasty derailed at Alabama you can have new stars emerge and we had one upset in the two games at Ohio State punches their ticket in surprising fashion too many people how many teams out there if you're a fan of another team could win with a backup quarterback to get to a national championship game how many could how many of you guys know who your third string quarterback is I want you to just absorb that for a second that's what Ohio State just accomplished they beat Alabama would not with not with Braxton Miller not with JT Barrett but with Cardale Jones a third string quarterback who was very effective tonight had a great compliment there in Ezekiel Elliott but that's amazing to think of the job that Urban Meyer and Tom Herrmann did to get their team ready to play in Cardale Jones it's not as if he's a third string quarterback a walkon quarterback this kids very talented coming out of high school but still he was third on the depth chart when this season started it's just I don't know if I've ever seen anything like that for a team to get to a national championship when they're getting it done with what's the third string guy but the guy again the way he plays the decisions he made against that defense on that stage that's very rare to see Ohio State defense gives up 35 but they have been underrated they shut down one Heisman finalist Melvin Gordon they shut out another Heisman finalist Amari Cooper in this game and they contributed a pick six I mean yeah they gave up some points but again they stood out when they had six who hasn't given up some points to Blake Sims and Amari Cooper in this Alabama offense so I I'm not surprised by that at all I think the fact that they came up with two crucial turnovers you think about the pick six remember with a punt from Ohio State that was deep in their own territory that jumped back and Alabama had the ball at about the plus 25 right away they looks like they're gonna attack go downfield and try to score to try to take the lead Ohio State comes up with an interception deep in their own territory it was just this team just had a belief Urban Meyer deserve more credit than he probably realizes for the job that he did to get his team psychologically prepared to think that they can win this game against Alabama this is what Alaba this is what Urban Meyer really had when he first took the job and he walked down that hallway and said I'm the head coach at Ohio State this was the bar in his mind Alabama Nick Saban this is why he recruits the way does this white builds his program the way does to try to compete not just with Michigan and Michigan State and Penn State but for Alabama he knew it going in what an accomplishment for urban and now he's on his way back to a national championship game yeah we saving an Alabama that beat Meyer when he was with the Gators that loss that sent him into exhaustion and collapsed in his driveway and eventually led to his brief retirement so some revenge of sorts in this game yeah this is why you hire urban wire to win championships and you saw his reaction after beating Bama in the Superdome restrained he was smiling he was satisfied with the performance that night but he knows the bigger game lies ahead for him I cannot wait to see this whole hioh state team that just has a belief within themselves against Marcus Mariota and an Oregon team that right now is hitting on all cylinders let's face it Florida State came into their game today very confident that their defense could match up with Mariota but Mariota is a quiet assassin with how he leads his team the decisions that he makes the way he executes the uptempo Ohio State has 11 days to get ready you got to put Nick Saban and Alabama behind them and they've got to get ready for probably the fastest offense that executes in a way well they don't make very many mental mistakes Ohio State's gonna have their biggest challenge of the year and the national title against Oregon and Mariota had to spend a lot of fuel to get pie the Crimson Tide obviously Ducks seemed to win this game at about third gear so bucks and Ducks in 11 days in Arlington Ohio State eight know all time against Oregon but again we'll be underdogs in this game let's now hear from Nick Saban back in the podium in New Orleans reacting to his team's loss well you know we're very disappointed in the outcome of the game but you have to congratulate Ohio State who played really really good game and we probably didn't play our best game and I take responsibility for that I think everybody in the organization from the coaches you know right on down has to take responsibility for what they did or didn't do to help prepare the team to be able to play their best game which is certain was certainly our goal coming into this game I think you know specifically in the game third down was probably they heard us on third down lots of times on third and Long's and converted and we didn't do very well on third down so we didn't continue drives and they were able to continue driving and convert scores you know especially when we're ahead 21 to 6 and they scored 28 unanswered points but you know I'm very proud of this team you know this team excelled all year long kept Alabama in the forefront of college football everywhere in the country you know based on the hardwork and the improvement that they made you know throughout the season so I'm very proud of what accomplished and winning the SEC as well as winning twelve football games in a very you know tough conference we're very disappointed in the outcome today it was our goal to play our best in this game so we would have an opportunity to play in a national championship game but we obviously didn't do the things that we needed to do as well as we needed to do them to have a chance to do that but I think there's a lot of winners on this team and I don't think you necessarily have to get a trophy to be a winner and I do think that there's a lot of guys you know on this team two of them sitting right up here with me right now and many many more in that locker room that have been winners all year and did a fantastic job for our team at this time we'll take questions from the media we do have two floor mics out if you'll raise your hand get my attention it'll give us just a second to get a mic over to you questions for Alabama we'll start here front row on our right coach if you could talk about the differences that you saw when you were up 21 to 6 and what they did to grab that momentum ultimately going on 28 nothing run well well really you know we were up 21 to 6 because of two turnovers and two stops in the red area that they so we really weren't stopping them we kind of had the momentum of the game because of the turnovers that we got and converted those into scores but we were really playing and executing the way we needed to even then I didn't like the feel of the game even then so we just stopped him in the red zone and we got two turnovers and that was the difference and and in the second half I thought we played a little better and did a little better job but we did not control the football game like we usually do and it wasn't anything that they did differently they had a good plan they executed it well against us and you know we gave up far too many big plays in the game which has been a problem for us toward the end of the year and that was that was you know when you give up big plays and you don't get off the field on third down you got lots of problems other questions please raise your hand welcome back in John butcher gosh Steve Levy and some interesting notes here at Ohio State first win over Alabama and program history seven point underdogs they are two Oregon but again I'm really surprised and we talked about we thought that Ohio State would have a hard time running between the tackles and they really didn't they did not their offensive line was spectacular in this game particularly getting to the second level when you can average almost seven yards for carrying 42 attempts against an Alabama defense that was the number one defense to run defense coming into this game that's very impressive nick saban you heard it at the end there he said the exact same thing at halftime to Holly Rowe about third downs we can't get off the field on third down and with Cardale Jones just abusing them on third down especially with the run but that has to be the key to this football game absolutely there are two things that coaches talked about it and the football games when it comes to winning and losing its third downs and it's turnovers and you can't get off the field on third downs it allows the offense to gain confidence and when they get confidence you got a young quarterback in the second start and you gain confidence and you find ways to move the football then all of a sudden you come out in that second half you get points on the board you start to make plays but it starts with staying on the field moving the chains is the biggest key for an offense to get rolling and Saban who were you know it was a mastermind so he says that at halftime what he said and then they still can't adjust and figure it out the second half as well any justice by Ohio State they're not going to do the same thing they're going to continue to evolve throughout the game and I thought Tom Herman and reminded a terrific job of making sure getting to the edge with LA and then pounding between the tackles they mixed it up a lot in the run game and that was a problem because I'm third down it made it a man it manageable position for Cardale Jones and even if it was third and long he found a way to make a big play on third down and so we have our national championship game in Dallas a week from Monday Oregon and Ohio State much more coverage coming here from New Orleans the forecast has for a storm of confetti the Ohio State Buckeyes will

the firstever MKC Nick Saban at number one Alabama taking on Urban Meyer and number four Ohio State with Sugar Bowl winner advances to the college football championship game they'll beat Oregon first quarter Alabama down three nothing Derrick Henry gonna rush to the left get some great blocking for the entire offensive line look at all the crimson uniforms they're allowed on the first untouched for 25 yards yeah and you can't let the big fella get rolling the blocking off that edge early in the first half I thought with the mean trouble for Ohio State Alabama 73 lead at 7 Sixers Blake Sims rolling out finding Amari Cooper 15 yard touchdown the best wide receiver in football you can't let him get open like this because if you do he's gonna find a way get it what a great move by Amari Cooper find a way to make sure that he gets away from the defender and it's an easy pitching catch for Blake Sims that put Alabama 14 to 6 he thought the tide was rolling at this point right second quarter here the Buckeyes driving and again those thoughts of Alabama may be on their way to a bigtime victory but that again when Cardale Jones was intercepted by Cyrus Jones returned 32 yards yeah and the dbe's the corners for Alabama only had three interceptions on the feeding quick Jones and Jackson hit a big one right here and it did look like Alabama was on their way to putting us away TJ Yeldon rushing up the middle Nick Saban 78 and two at Alabama when leading by at least 14 points this game is over right wrong final 19 seconds of the first half Buckeyes trick play if the receiver Evan Spencer throwing a Michael Thomas touchdown what a fabulous catch and balanced by Michael towns but what a great play call by Urban Meyer going into the bag of tricks in this situation awesome execution by the office here here's the trickeration here's the throw right on the money you can't ask me whether it is and he just barely gets his foot in back it's a touchdown for the Buckeyes look at this just by centimeters twist that toe and he had to feel it cuz he couldn't look down and see it simply amazing opening drive of the third quarter Buckeyes strike again Jones looking deep downfield for any Jackson falls down and coverage allows Kevin Smith to score devin Smith the sport touchdown all season long came in with 30 catches for almost 800 yards he's been the big blade receiver for Ohio State all season long you saw the tweet from LeBron Oh H the bronze got some spare time now here Sims dropping back picked off by the big fella at Steve Miller who dropped back in coverage runs it back 41 yards for the touchdown the terrific job by Miller of keeping an eye on Blake Sims and reading his eyes well a poor decision by quarterback Blake Sims right here he's going to have a chance because he's going to get time to step up in the pocket but it's just an illadvised pass so Alabama gives up 28 unanswered points for the first time since September of 2007 how about that late third quarter bamas trying to make their own comeback Sims we'll keep it here and burst up the middle 5yard touchdown it's 34 28 4th quarter Buckeyes punting from their own end zone Cameron Johnston's punt it's gonna take a bad foul so when I say a bad bounce I mean a bad bounce off hop out Bama taking over at the plus 23 next play from scrimmage there's the chance right this is probably ball game Sims rolls out intercepted by Vaughn Bell can't take advantage of the great field position absolutely huge not quite sure about the play call in that situation you get the ball back you've been running the ball why take a chance and get cute I like the playful call it was a poor pass if he puts air into this passage six so Alabama waste that great field position that Ezekiel Elliott rushes to the left how about 85 to the dizzy Joey I didn't know the big fellows FS I told you speed his speed I told you last night when the big bullet gets out there's nothing they can do about it speed kills longest play Alabama's giving up all season years of a look at it this is a Joey Galloway type block look at reminds me of me going in there blocking Elliott 20 carries 230 yards how's my average Ohio State gets the twopoint conversion they go up 4228 Sims to Cooper hey and Amari Cooper sighting Alabama's down 42:35 so late still a one score game still time on the clock amazing actually how much time they had to play with towards the end eight seconds left now since firing the Hail Mary not this time Tyga's Powell picks it off to end the ballgame and Ohio State wins they advance on in the first ever college football playoff they'll play in the national championship game they'll face Oregon you don't want to know the Buckeyes beat eight and OH alltime against Oregon to this point for Ohio State it's the first official bowl win against an SEC opponent that topic might come up again the SEC they had a vacate in 2011 Sugar Bowl will against Arkansas and Urban Meyer now two and two alltime against Nick Saban Coach Meyer join us moments ago when a great team won this one of the great team wins we were a bit apart because we didn't play but we didn't play well at times we found a way to win well now take questions for Ohio State if you'll raise your hand and give us just a few seconds to get a mic to you let's start on the front row left side urban Todd Porter from the can repository just sort of described for us your feelings when you came down with the the interception at the end of the game just I mean they were driving the ball but you guys came down with it and secured to win well we just did sit you know just you start questioning why we threw that ball and that's my call to throw it down the field man that you're you know you're gonna not gain yard anyways against very good players they're playing zero coverage everyone's within two yards of line of scrimmage and it was my call and so maybe it wasn't the right call and so I just kept thinking and I screw this thing up and then I have a lot once again a lot of confidence in our defensive staff they've got so much better and our players our defense during the course of the season the fiftyninth nothing game against Wisconsin defend uh well Mara Cooper and hold him 279 yards about I think it was 79 yards and yards best receiver in college football so that that's what it all is going through my mind is get that darn ball down so we get out of this with a win and what a great win it was did a great job Amari Cooper by the way just nine catches 71 yards longest play was 15 yards for Cooper so following Ohio State's victory in the Sugar Bowl Urban Meyer has not won more than 84 percent of his games as a head coach that's the fourth best mark in FBS history and among any coach in the last 60 years they head to Oregon seven point underdogs in the title game much more to come here Sports Center at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans Tim Tebow getting miked up on the set he will join us next to talk about one of his coaches greatest wins perhaps on his resume there it is they're on their way to Dallas
