============================================================

down to Ron Franklin and Mike Gottfried for the kickoff we'll see it half burns Tigers Alabama's Crimson time from every corner of the state from infants to great grand folks from every walk of life on this day every man every woman every child the state comes together for one common reason to be divided it is over modern and come from behind the beat archrival Alabama but not be one the first quarter man this is the Auburn Alabama game it'll take four quarters and it's like you play a fullcourse I hope they play their best game they play the best game because that's what we've been practicing you lay it on the line keep your composure something see West title a conference championship game birth a big time ball bit perhaps even the Alliance but that means nothing to them for now four four and six Alabama what clearance simple mission is left to salvage this season just beat Robert the 62nd edition of the iron ball when we come back tonight from a jampacked jordanhare Stadium on the southeastern Alabama the number 13 rake Auburn Tigers play hosted crossstate rival the Alabama Crimson Tide of what is affectionately known as the Iron Bowl the 62nd time they will have met for the fans they started arriving last Sunday so that they could conquer and possess their spot for tailgating for the entire week the atmosphere when it's your bedlam and it has been since on Thursday evening when folks started arriving in earnest and what does it mean it means just as the t's said one of the things that is a constant on this night or this afternoon when they play they come to disagree hi everybody Ron Franklin welcome once again to Saturday primetime college football here on ESPN as we like to say each and every year about this football game every year on this date the state of Alabama stands still for three hours because our burn and Alabama are getting together and why well when you move to this state or if you are born in this state what happens is you have to declare so you're either a Crimson Tide fan or you're an Auburn Tiger fan Mike Godfrey joins me on the telecast as usual tonight and Mike would you look at this our burn football team Damion Craig no quarterback in the top 25 is depended on more than he is almost 80% of the offense comes from him and Ron last week in the Georgia game you're exactly right but they got the ball to Fred Beasley and ran the football took a lot of pressure off the Damian Craig now we talked to Damian Craig today and you talked about the importance of this football game he said my career will be measured by this game tonight that's how important it is to him big thing for Alabama though Fernando Bryant at one corner eight thousand at the other both the best in the SEC are so banged up they may not be able to go is that where Auburn picks first tonight I think you start by running the football but you go after Brian in DJ Johnson that they're hurt they haven't practiced you try them out early as far as Alabama's offenses concern young man by the name of Lance Tucker started only last week he's going to be the starting quarterback tonight are you surprised at that little surprise because Freddie kitchens has had success in this game but Lance Tucker brings a new weapon of running ability the option Lance Tucker is very productive he was productive last week against misses Mississippi State and this ballclub tonight has to do well in the first seven minutes round because they're like a fighter who's overmatched they have to have success early in this ballgame because they're not a comeback football team the two head coaches Mike DuBose first season you could see the numbers four and six and across the way Terry bobbin two and two against Bama 44 wins he'll netted losses his record Auburn won the toss they deferred to the second half so it will be Alabama receiving 57 degrees rain is out of the area heavy rain yesterday wind not a fact 30% chance of rain tonight for the weatherman guaranteed the Sacre dude up close to guaranteed anyway we will have a pleasant evening for this 60 second Iron Bowl classic Jarrett Holmes to kick it off her Auburn Richard and Bryan p'tee deep man this is going to go out at the back of the end zone effect that hit the upright check it on the sidelines at with Adrian Karsten Adrian thank you because this we can motivate so much in this game consider how similar this game is to the eightyfour irons all went out Anna took the field made by denofa losing records that have tonight four and six our burn was in the top twenty member 11 that night an Alabama with nothing to lose didn't they upset Auburn 1715 shock a lot of people that MS become Alabama's motivation tonight to be the first Crimson Tide football team to come to Auburn and we noise is absolutely deafening in the stadium janitor in motion at the throw back to get of accustomed see Jackson on the quick screen it'll go for six yards the tackle made as we take a look at offensively this is how they start Tucker the senior out of Fayette Alabama Curtis Alexander and Ed sysm are the two running backs the receivers well the tight end Rutledge he is an outstanding but they will try to get to him five or six times tonight Paul and boss the lighthouse the offensive line they've come upon these gentlemen Samuels friend Hogan metals and Ray to do an outstanding job Hogan has started every game of these Preston under 74 Valdosta Georgia lots of motion Curtis who stopped by Jeff Dunlap and also Ricky Neil defensively for the Tigers Dunlap Dorsey and Carson Dunlap only a freshman the linebacker is very very active Reese Neal spikes and Taylor and in the secondary Nolan kasher was starting with surprised didn't even work out on Thursday as an in Easton and we're rounding out the secondary with keep an eye because Jason playing to the pole would replace him if catcher can't go got it on the Martin look for the first down out of the 31 yard line to cross and Tucker proving why they chose him as the starter today and he's a very active quarterback Ron he can run the football he has good skills go on the ball short now they need some big plays tonight because they're not a team they haven't shown to be a team to take the ball the length of the field 80 85 yards four touchdowns team for 29 yards for Tucker in the early going to Jackson in motion over the running play ninetyone Charles Dorsey the nose tackle comes up to make the hit on him there is a a marker across the way Astor Sizemore the referee tonight confuse Auburn by motioning people and I think what happened on that play the end the officials had to confer whether they had enough people on the line of scrimmage with the movement date they had so Astra Sizemore waves it off it is second down they need to take it to the 41 yard line we've got a closer look at Charles Dorsey the junior before the water Dale Florida playing at the Mo's guard position let us out a gander tries to go lucky it's Dorsey again also number six Ryan Taylor jr. out of Dublin Georgia who plays the right sideline backing spot coming over to make the double tackle Brown here's what I'm talking about because Alabama wants to show a lot of movement to this offer in defense they moved too tight in over to the other side then they motioned a wide receiver again trying to confuse the secondary and keep the safeties out of the running game third down as we mentioned to make is the 41 whoops from the right side over to the way Tucker looks at the Blitz goes back and overthrows his receiver that was Dennis riddle who they had flexed out about 12 yards on the right the running back and it will be kicking time for the Crimson Tide Daniel Polk sophomore we'll do the putty you see his numbers just over 43 yards to kick and this is markeith Cooper he does the returns for them had a separated shoulder at the time during the season they don't use him as much at running back but still as a return guy and here's the kick by Polk kicks it away from Cooper and it's been a bounder go out of bounds inside the 35 yard line well executed on the punt and nothing on the return for the Auburn Tigers 31 yards and the kick is we take a look at the starters stadium Craig at quarterback he'll have de montreuil Carter the freshman who had such a great game last week against Georgia and the steady one senior Fred Beasley a fullback the receivers McLeod the tide in Carsten Bailey big touchdown last week against Georgia along with ty Goodson the offensive line this is a good group James probably grading as well as anybody up there Wiley at the other tackle very good and the two well Kendall Simmons and TJ Dunnigan along with curry getting the starts there in the middle the running play play action s5 has been pushed out of bounds after a gain of 14 yards and here comes a flag he hit him well out of bounds good for 17 and now hanged by for another 15 and that's going to be Andre short who will make it a 32 yard play on the first snap from scrimmage but makes this a good play is first down to run the fake Damien pranks going to do a great job of faking the ball on the sprint draw look at him look back at the running back which is the key now you've got the hands and probably your best the ball in the hands of the best running back and then there's the late hit on Damien Craig I'm Andrew short number 23 just hit him a little late they're weak alone for eight at the top of your screen as you look once again at Andre short the senior out of LaGrange Georgia line of scrimmage is the 35 of Alabama counter tray they go to the right side and I laughs in the play as de montreuil Carter hit by Steve Harris number 43 Harris a junior from Town Creek was a linebacker and they moved him to defensive in defensively for the Alabama Crimson Tide Smith Curley Panks Chris hood and he is another one that's had to work his way back he's been injured I don't know long he can go tonight Horan Carolyn Smith the linebackers and in the secondary we mentioned Bryant and Townsend both more than Nick they are injured but they're playing tonight because it's the iron gold Spencer and Sickler are the safeties if you could look right there at Fernando he's got at least three infants that he's playing with Frank flag is down too long for Carsten Bailey but you asked early about whether they were going to try these shape tops enough tshe Thompson didn't practice much this week he's got a hamstring I was watching practice Thursday practice very little thirsty they're going to try him right off the bat here in the first quarter Carsten Bailey and they're gonna get a pass interference on him Demian crank trying to throw the deep route the street route to Carsten Bailey there's the push by the che Thompson when the ball was in the air pass interference on Thompson hitting on both these corners are banged up a hamstring by the shade Townsend a concussion by Fernando Bryant that the drive started at the 33 the first run was 17 then add on a 15yard penalty now another penalty against Alabama and twothirds of this drive already is the ball sitting at the 15 has been made up of penalties against the Crimson Tide and I don't think Harvard needs any help now you can't make those mistakes I said earlier that I think in this ball game when you're playing in a rivalry football game you're four and six and you're doubting yourself a little bit you need success early in this ball game the first seven minutes critical ball burn punches this one in the lookout shell they actually push the ball back to the 22 yard line that is the starting point for the Auburn Tigers is we're about to go under 10 minutes to play in this opening quarter and now more discussions about where the ball should be placed I think it Ronson 25 second clock it was down to 6 seconds when they broke the huddle there's a timeout timeout charge legal equipment they might have again not covering the knee with the with the knee patch sometimes receivers will do that and everybody a charge until a timeout everybody's looking down at their knees we're told that it is tagged its own number 83 that did not have his trousers pull down far now below his knees so while there's a timeout we'll take it with him timeout on the field no score 10 51 to play opening quarter ESPN's presentation of college football Alabama versus Auburn is brought you by Wrangler real comfortable jeans and by discus athletic the brand that lets you compete on every field Ron Franklin Mike Gottfried and Adrian Karsten back in Auburn Alabama the 62nd meeting between these two football teams and the Auburn Tigers setting up for the first down of the ball just outside the 22 yard line the timeout charged against Auburn because Gibson's pants did not come down below his knees although Goodson argued with that and the official had already charged him with the timeout they go with the running play pitch back furnished the corner at the 20 to the 19 before Kevin Ziegler gets to anything Ron here was the last play Fernando Bryant to number 25 to corner he's gonna point out to the official about Tyrone Goodson out the official catches Tyrone Goodson look at him he just tries to get it down as quick as he can a little bit too slow and then you get the penalty now he's arguing his case so Fernando became an official for a play well probably what bits and the same is hey I got bad legs you can't tell where my knees are anyway Tommy didn't call him bones wasn't that his nickname I think so airborne down to around the 15 yard line Steve Stanley comes up to make the hit on him also Travis Carroll number 44 same type of game plan that they opened the game against Georgia last week Damion Craig on the first play running the football look at the nine first nine games what they did run the football last week took a lot of pressure off Damian Craig with 159 yards rushing nine minutes and 37 seconds left to play opening quarter Alabama had the football picked up one first down then had to kick it away down to the 33 Simmons in the back here there's a Blanca Beasley hooked side at the tan button for the shoulder pad will have the first down otherwise he would have scored grond this all started after the Mississippi State game Fred Beasley I'm talking to Rodney Allison the offensive coordinator Fred Beasley was standing in the door when they were having their offensive meaning and he had a sad look on his face and they asked him what was wrong and he said I carried the ball four times for six yards he said I can help us win if we can run the football commit foot and they decided when the open date to go back to the running game Fred Beasley has become a big part of that run game there you see the numbers on the season inside the 20 23 touchdowns and a field goal Carter hit in the backfield and I mean he is assaulted by Kenny Smith wow what a hit but Kenny Smith was not blocked or came off a block late and leveled to 511 174 pound freshman his team off the block Kenny Smith 290pound freshman a lot of freshmen planned for Alabama well as many as six in their lineup at one time defensively de montreuil Carter giving up a hundred and twenty pounds on that exchange and I'm sure he's feeling like I hope we don't have that scenario again following the loss playaction Prague under pressure and here's where he hurts you still scrambling still scrambling trying to get away from Carroll throws it away and no flag are going to say incomplete pass Stanley in Carroll boat coming after Damion Craig and that's where he just gives you a fish he couldn't get turned or on the difference in this play is he couldn't get his body turn fakes the ball to the right side now they get good pressure from the backside now you see can't get turn now I can't get his body turn to get anything under it Travis Carroll 44 forces him out very hard as you know running in the opposite direction to get your shoulders turned to throw the ball well and he was very smart he'd just threw it right over the head a Clifton Robinson Nix four checks into the lineup for bird number 89 its third down they need to score or they have to go for the field goal they cannot pick up a first down with us they penalty and Goodson incomplete at the corner of the endzone and that was to Shea Townsend who had the cover on it little smash route on the corner on the side Hicks floor stays in the flat Tyrone Goodson working against the shape Thompson's going to run a corner out the shade Thompson who didn't practice much look at he bakes up to speed gets his left arm up there deflects the football they just read his eyes real nicely didn't make the move into the ball got there so it's a 27 yard attempt for that right hash mark is Auburn tries to go on top Holmes is ready good pass and his kick is good so let's take a timeout seven minutes clock is still running for some reason and now they stop it timeout on the field 754 left in his opening quarter it is a bird and Alabama not a breather nothing our burn goes on top following that the field goal of 27 yards by Holmes and now he will kick it off either Bryant or Richard Ron this is big every time he kicks the ball in the end zone in Alabama past the start at the 20 yard line the last drive as you mentioned 31 yards on penalties 26 rushing good job actually a kind of a moral victory for the Crimson and he has done it again Hey since this one one nine ten yards deep and Fernando black can do nothing about that woman Jared Holmes his worthless weight in gold by doing that ticking in the end zone and makin Alabama go distance Freddie kitchens last year one of the combatants who land Alabama to victory you see his numbers 51% 596 career against the oven cortex downstream now look for him Ron if they get behind by a number point six you see Freddie kitchen suppose it goes about better downfield on the left side over to the right and it should drop way Curtis Alexander Dunlop that blocked off the play but then it's going to be Reese coming over to make the tackle Clinton they sophomore on a bright up the road in Birmingham Dunlap was in position to make the tackle and he got picked off and Reese was right behind even to make the stop so it's going to be very short yardage Alabama though I think he'll continue to see them tick away at the running game because when you look at the running backs that they can hit you with and riddle Sean Alexander and Curtis Alexander any break1 on anyway plus the fact that Mike was figuring to keep the ball away conniving fetish Alexander tries to turn the corner short yardage again and as Antoine NOLA number 13 came up in that quarterback spot to make the hip now it's third down and they have to take it to the 30 to keep this drive going again a lot of movement by Alabama to try to confuse and to try to get somebody to make the mistakes in runs support but so far Auburn has adapted defensively to what they've been shown by Alabama's movement this Arian said when we visited with him he said let's be real honest we need a big play we need to maybe even get a cheap one to get out in front of the ball Alexandr flag is down he is just destroyed that the line of scrimmage by Charles Dorsey now this is against a bird it's going to give the Crimson Tide their second first down of this ballgame Mike DuBose knows his ballclub and visiting with him on Thursday watching practice at Alabama no they can't make mistakes in this football game here at Auburn tonight they're down and now nine that could pick this one for the shotgun formation as you listen to the guys 50 no strikes sucker throws it and almost intercepted by Ricky Neal good the heavens ball hitting right the chest Ricky Neil has had to as a great University showing blitz then drops out in zone coverage he just looked into the hook so balls thrown right chewing he just jumps a little bit takes his eye off the football liberal arts major out of Daytona first kick was 31 yards no he did kick it out of bounds to keep the return away from Artie goober I'll say a safety valve may have almost got to that thing Cooper lets it bounce now going to pick it up and he pays the price he gets his head knocked right out of bounds so does the time outlets taken for the 549 left opening quarter Auburn three Alabama Guffey we're back in our burn Alabama jordanhare stadium filled to capacity as you might imagine three to nothing the Auburn has gone on front with a 27yard field goal in a couple of situations that Bama has kind of dodged it so far that interception that could have been dropped by Neal and then the Tigers having to vote for the field goal rather than the touchdown for the first and goal that came off a defensive play graven by Ken Smith and Towanda hunter will come up and make the tackle on him trying to pull the ball away at the 46 yard line it's good for nine Ron we talked about the shape Thompson being hurt now all of a sudden they bring in Antwon Hunter in the corner and you see the cushion that he's given Tyrone goods and so I would expect that Damian Craig and the offensive staff are going to try out Antwone hunter a whole bunch here in this first half well the notes on him is junior college transfer they say he is a good cover guy still learning as far as run support yeah he played in junior college Georgia military and then signed to Clemson Clemson wouldn't take his B's in the Clemson papers called Alabama and they decide to taking him as Lisa's hit play is dead as it was picked up Travis Carroll is a man who made the hit I think it'll be interesting running and watching how often tries to attack him you always want to know when Alabama has two great corners and Fernando brandish a Thompson everybody knows that they've been playing very well but everybody knows how hurt and now all of a sudden you get Antoine hunter in there he hasn't played much this year a junior college guy and you just go try them out see what he can do you can see the total five for the Tigers one for the Crimson Tide Smith jumped offside to freedom so he's going to take it downtown and Preston Bailey his double coverage and what you do if your Alabama you try to help antoine hunter with the safety overthetop Calvin Ziegler in Alabama offside so you get a free play Kenny Smith jumped jordanhare Stadium in Auburn Alabama Ron Franklin Mike Gottfried and Adrian Karsten coming to you gonna repeat first down here it will be first and five it's for penalties I actually thought it was five but that's they say four penalties against Mike DuBose football team early and on the last Drive certainly it helped tremendously at that time kenny smith on the right side just got a little too anxious and jumped offside we can do a lot of things on first and five see the Blitz coming in the middle that was Kara that picked him up Frank in trouble and he is gonna be sacked and it's 43 Steve Harris and we talked about him they've made a defensive in out of him but he was a high school linebacker that's how they recruited him so he has speed and good pressure again by Alabama on the 1st and 5 figurin that Auburn might try something this throwing the football Steve Harris just with good pressure not picked up by the Auburn line in a good sack Pat on the hit by his teammates for Harris that's a loss of 11 so it's going to be a second down and a very long way the Auburn Tigers in fact about 1516 yards to pick it up as the offensive line converses on the sidelines where they get a little bit of a breather friend and medals in company I don't think they got that one off they didn't five more yards gonna be marked off against the Tigers now one of the things in this ball game that they really try to guard against second is somebody else picking up signals so they've got at least one dummy if not two dummy signals going on and Terry talked about this at practice on Thursday that he wanted to make sure that although you got through different guys doing it that it doesn't slow down the process and you don't mean those dummies giving the signals you mean they're dummy signals but as you look at Auburn they know each other so well they watch all their tapes they watch their games perfect no another the guy seems a lot of dismissed water back draw by praying five seven eight and he is out of bounds about a yard shy of the first down Marcus Spencer I'm sorry that's the first stage he is just short of you remember they had the 11yard loss in Ron you know it's 316 to go here in the first quarter this has been dominated by offered but they don't they only have three points so you got to feel good if they're Mike DuBose at this point because your ballclub for penalties for 41 yards you missed him threw the ball right to Neal the line back you dropped it so they're hanging in there and then they need to play well here early in the ball game look at Alabama jamming up the line of scrimmage they have got nine folks in the box man feathers on the outside 12 yard out total miscommunication on that one and it will be punting time in the Auburn Tigers at great field position that they really just missed a super opportunity here and they blocked it very well Carsten Bailey just runs the wrong route according to Damien Craig's throw sixtytwo the longest punt of the year for homes and they're coming after eight and he gets it away under pressure but it is a dandy eyes fire pits at the five and picks a big Alabama hop into the endzone 52 yards on the kick but don't forget comets football later tonight on ESPN 22nd ranked Colorado State trying to wrap up the WAC Pacific Division against San Diego State and it comes your way just after 10:30 Eastern as soon as we finish up here at Auburn what's the matter sucker continues to go the way at further back for the guns inside he was tried in Rutland and he caught it and dropped the ball as he hit the ground I'm gonna say it to completion for for his tailor made the hip and that was one of the things that Alabama talked about they really want to get Rutledge involved in this office at least five or six times done yeah Bruce Arians talk to us today he said I would hope that he didn't have 40 pitches by now that's not the case as you said they would like to get him five he's had 15 reception this year and Mike's not going to get 68 they just took it away from him they say actually he did not have possession and the Bama side of the field as you might imagine in the very harsh disagreement Mike DuBose thinking that we got to get a break some time in this ball game and now timeout has been called by Tucker to the timeout charge against the Crimson Tide was taken with a 251 left opening quarter Auburn 3 to nothing so we're back here at Auburn in 2 minutes and 51 seconds showing on the clock that we have left to play in this opening quarter Mike made the point just a moment ago it's a second of long since they took the throw away that Alabama has not put in the ball game very much but totally down by three points in a rivalry like this the longer you left the underdog team stick around you hit it for trouble there's no doubt and I felt like the first seven minutes Alabama had to stay in there and do some good things and so far they're in this is a replay of the past of Rutledge you know I don't know how long they want him to have it for but it did come out it's got a better look than we have yeah he really does because with the big body it was hard to see if he was juggling the ball or twirling it or whatever and I have a feeling that's what the official was calling it was right on it so anyway incomplete pass second down in ten yards to go total yards for Alabama so far 22 is Freddie kitchens looks on the senior out of a talent waiting for his firm little and most on top of the screen when they reverse out Tucker the worse the situation it's almost intercepted I think you should have tried to throw that away Jason break closest man to it illadvised to make that throw and again I'll burn had another chance to maybe intercept Lance Tucker but when you run this type of play run when you come off the corners the quarterback Lance Tucker he fakes he comes up he's looking for his tight in short first he's not there then you run the football you want to cross your body here's the tight end he's covered here's Calvin Hall he's covered and then you almost throw the intercepts from big mistake 2 of 6 for Tucker for 9 yards he has missed his last four and the shotgun to see the twist upfront that the defensive line and that ball well off the bark it could have been picked off ater for our bird the closest man to it they left the putt again and you wonder how many times that you can put your defense in bad field position and Alabama has not been able to move the ball on offense and they're going to get the ball again with relatively good field position playing with fire with Damian Craig he's just going to giving that ball back any time around the 40 45 yard line with the big man begging for this pitch by puffin 18 operate and it's his best kick morality back at the 38 to the 45 now the 46 well Tuesday night the National Hockey League on espn2 from New York City remember three years ago was Mark Messier with head coach Mike Keenan leading the Rangers to the coveted Stanley Cup will now they return to the garden for the first time together since joining the commits of Vancouver emotions will be run a night Tuesday night deuce so again Bama three and out and they continued to give Auburn good field position but the Tigers really have not taken advantage of swings out the pass and he's got him Williams at the side I'm inside the 30s down to the 24 I'm in a blitz and it's good for 30 Dameon Craig hits rusty Williams on the flare pass and Damian Craig said that's the biggest game of my life I'll be measured by this game hits rusty Williams a bad angle by Travis Carroll the freshman linebacker Deshea towns had finally in on the hit with Andre short inaudible with the first down after 24 top three to nothing west on the team to play first quarter which is it back he's gonna be stopped right in his tracks by Chris hood at the line of scrimmage hood another one who has been injured and it has been out and they said they were just use him as long as they could and he's continuing to go made an outstanding play there he's 90% the coaches said Nene he said they expect him to play half of the snaps and Chris hood said even though 90% I still think I can catch Demian Craig in a footrace so I don't know about that like I said a blitz on that completed pass a moment ago but actually the linebackers faked it and came off of it but yeah almost like the half step in was enough to be a half step behind but William is in motion gets his mass complete to Bailey I think Beasley I should say parted and he got whacked by Stan Lee and Carol was a good catch by Fred Beasley stayed right with it talk about the importance of the game Damian Craig said he'll be measured by this Fred Beasley said I can't make this game up I'm a senior it's my last shot at him the Damian Craig again thrown off balance Ron hits Fred Beasley to get him at least in third and short block running 35 I've now 34 conversions the Knights of the tiger vanish obliterated out at the middle untouched ball is knocked away and then two shades hounds have knocked it away from him Townsend us was mentioned playing with an injured hamstring these shape Townsend's playing well and Fernando Brian on the other side and curly home in the secondary coach said they like to play man coverage when I called zone they do not like it they want to be man coverage and UCP shaped Townsend knocked the ball away from Carsten Bailey again a good stop by the Alabama defense 37 yards of this field goal of ten ball right in the middle of the PTO the distance and he's got it Jarett homes 27 yards and now 37 yards and with 16 seconds left in the opening quarter Auburn now on top six to nothing the most valuable player in the first quarter Jared Holmes because he's kicked him in the hole and he's made two two field goals he punted him into the 20 yard line so Jared Holmes is neat and been a big factor in this football game check down to the sidelines with Adrian Karsten Adrian thought I've been keeping my eye on de chelly of Townsend's you and coach have been talking about him a sigh relief by the Auburn coaching staff because yes he had the hamstring injury he did not practice much this week but right up and about 5 minutes prior to kickoff they were doing a contrast whirlpool with him on that the back of his leg the contrast hot and cold water actually loosened that up now he's done a very very good job in coverage here on a couple of different series there has been some rotation but he's going to keep going here and because the coverage has been so good they're really confident now that he's going to play the rest of this game and I talked to the Alabama training staff the other day and they said that they did not know how he would go in this ball game but they did say it's his last goaround and he's going to make every effort to play in this football game well it you know it's interesting you look at the Bryant on the other side it usually greeted Brian product separated children had a broken bone in his hand so I think it says a lot about how important the iron bowl is in the state of Alabama therefore this game now line drive this one's not going to be out of the back of the game's own picked 20 30 and now 35 and a nice return this going to be the best field position that Alabama would have started with the sysm the fullback picked it up and took it right up the middle we talked about Jared Holmes and he may be tired but now Alabama has a first shot here in this ball game with good field position look at this started at their own 23 times in a row because of Holmes six plays 16 yards on the opening drive Adam Freeman out on the last key drive Tucker continues to go at quarterback ladies open voters Gander turns the corner at 4 and that is the end of the opening quarter so we'll time out of the field and as they change ins it is Auburn 6 and the Alabama Crimson Tide nothing in this the 62nd Iron Bowl now the Crimson Tide bench there are some smiles over there although they're bounded by six points total yards in the first quarter Alabama 27 or 7373 79 right side is what's down hard Ricky Niall wanted them in their number 15 also down at the bottom of the study we got a lot of good linebacker touch martini excuse me safety and when you get so Safety's up there so tight again martavius uses watched him against Georgia me tackle after tackle on that Georgia game on the running game of Jim Donnan and he's doing the same thing tonight to Alabama they've made he's up push down inside paid and that is what you talk about they've lost weapons on offense they've got three outstanding tailbacks who can break it in one plug well Kurtis Alexander's a team's leading rusher six touchdowns this year and you see the little move in the hole on the missed tackle then breaks out the good block by Chad Goss Rob pate finally knocks him out of bounds but you're right that's the strength of this football team the tight end and the running back Mike a great read cut to the outside and that's where daylight was longest play of the day 23 yards by Alabama blockers in front put us out of gender to the other side in offenses well let's don't get greedy that's good for tooth as Antoine Milton puts the stop on him let's go to Carl ravage Carl argon plenty of scoring in Clemson South Carolina game he was 14 13 South Carolina at the half you see it 26:14 and plankton add to it touchdown 20 straight in a hurry run turn around about the score and give up the easy pick and that's a bowl game that they're playing for they're six to nothing in our score about the gun under 13 minutes left in the opening half heavy pressure and he just throws this one away section 314 pleased and now what comes up flag in a Tucker is chasing the referee to say we'll wait a minute there was somebody out there and I think this is a good call now they unless they called off here and he just he'd that ball bounce I've intentional grounding on the offense five yard building well sit down the tough part about the law sit down Nantz Tucker avoiding the sack that just was a little bit too obvious on this one he's throwing this one the Adrian Jeff Dunlap number 76 pressure in England all coaches tell quarterback so put it up there in the in the press box least you'd like to have a guy round there oh he he almost did that's one of the largest always I've ever seen showed the spanking his wife okay that were the one the discus in the last NCAA eggs asking his receiver to come back he does but he caught it out of bounds Quincy Jackson a little slow to react coming back to help out his quarterback and on that penalty took them out of field goal range and they've had some problems with their kicking game down they're going to force them to punt the football so Alabama had good field position and that penalty hurt him a loss it down big let's see now how good Daniel cope is at pooch kicking and putting the Auburn Tigers back in the hole you have to think Freddy kitchens is going to get an opportunity here for long now Lance played well but you figure link played well but you figure link Freddy kitchens has more experience in this ballgame very high this is a great piece to take the calls for the fair catch and makes it inside the 15 in fact they're gonna spot that down at the 12 so timeout on the field will take it with a 1304 until halftime it's Auburn at 6th another the SPM presentation of college football Alabama versus Auburn is brought to you by the Pontiac Sunfire finally a real set of wheels you can really afford and buy Sonic America's drivein where we invite you to drive in for a change now Freddie kitchens warming up on the sidelines and I would assume it on their next possession it would be the senior I'm telling who they'd be coming in yeah you're looking for a spark and I figure he's going to be in the ball game had good experience in this game the last few years worst starting field position for offering tonight see the battle battle can capitalize on that he is a blocker in front and he's going to take it to the 15 mechanics myth who has been involved greatly in this ball game in the early going comes over to make the tackle that Kenny he's only a freshman big fella from Meridian Mississippi come on I thought Fred Beasley was funny the other day when we talked to me said he shows up Auburn over Alabama because he was afraid the big city over there in Tuscaloosa and he said that he didn't see any cows over there now I know he's going to be a pro prospect but I don't know where he goes to play where he could find cows let's Green Bay evening for an expert opinion on that glitch she's on her gifts by gets his go away and for but not turn around if he did that is a super outstanding play by Craig Ron Alabama defensively has Demian Craig confused and they've got the play calling of Auburn confused they're coming after Demian Craig from a lot of different spots Trevor Smith number 48 coming on the Blitz they're not picked up he ran right by the offensive guard TJ Mears for the che towns had almost made a big booboo on this wing never he always stayed deep as a deep as yeah and he didn't do that he was coming up to Pete they're down rocking tonight the 21 great pass miss that one is Carsten Baylor does the closest man to it at the defense of Alabama now they are not playing like a four seven for sex football team they are playing lights out against Damien Craig they have the receivers Tyrone Goodson Carsten Bailey Hicks poor they are blanketing those wide receivers nothing open that's the first time tonight that Auburn has been three now when we also mentioned their worst field position so I've had more conservative with it both Hall I've been Richard on the one all the way back to the 30 35 to the courting Alabama's gonna have pretty decent field position as Haven fields makes the stop after a 49 yard kick and it's going to be Freddy kitchens coming into the ballgame you remember if you were with us last year in Birmingham it was kitchens who engineered the final bribe they were dynamite 17 points early going and then they just went cold but they scored in that final drive a bribe of just over 70 yards Lance Tucker on the sideline you see his numbers talk those missed his last 17 it is kitchen to engineer that will ask you glass of motion side Alexander will take you for a couple and then the stop is made but we're talking about last year let's should take a look remember this kitchens throwing the swing pass to Denis riddle in the closing moments and he kept the 74yard dry the watching cut back into the middle and the linebacker spikes it will be just over and if he hadn't done that all year and he takes it in and ironically this year neither Freddie or Dennis riddle are starting in this ballgame none Dennis good back the more he runs to football the better he gets freaking up you seem at the top of your screen of that safety position Quentin Reece is right there just to mess up everything also Dorsey and Dunlap what Freddie kitchens gives you that maybe Lance Tucker does and Lance Tucker Garret Kentucky blasted in the last ball game versus Mississippi State but Freddie kitchen Stroh's the ball a little bit better down the field now he's been in the big ballgame he led to drive as you talked about it last year so it's it going to be interesting how Freddie kitchens plays in this game tonight kitchens needs to take it to the 49 the motion pressure the as Taylor is right there to make the hit on Jackson who had come across in motion and we have a player shaken up I believe that's Hogan isn't at the center the freshman who has started every ball game for them he was injured last week and I think Brody played some in his stead but we'll get a report as the youngster out of Valdosta is hopping off the field Ron this is a ballclub that's had their share of injuries all year and Michael Vaughn they lost him the wide receiver in the year and I think that's affected their ballclub and Michael Myers being the suspended really affected their playoff team that was huge this is the fifth punt of the ball game and they roughed the kicker now that's it's running and he are looking as a fair catch is made at the 15 because Talia Murray ran into it big mistake by telling Embry because you never leave your feet when you're going after a punter Mike I looked away did you call personal foul or running into I did not see it fourth and six you leave your feet you're always have that possibility of running in the kicker you never leave your feet the personal foul first down roughing the kicker only thing a lot of 15yard first specialty is head back to the sidelines and the offense comes back on last two first downs Alabama's run the football I think it's a time where you got to open it up right here you got a great field position 40yard line going in you have experienced quarterback see if they look pretty kitchens opened it up a little bit more here whoops Brody number 51 comes in at center replacing Hogan and he limped out just a moment ago that is pointing the protection and take to draw passage illgotten complete that's all radware host of football what they hit a good show by Freddie kitchens head Calvin Hall on the post pattern need to catch Antoine Nolan with the hip here's the strip by Nolan number 13 and as you said Brad we're with the recovery in Auburn with the big defensive play well that's one that the Alabama faithful will talk about as you see the grimace on the far sideline by number 83 Calvin Hall the sophomore out of Gallatin Tennessee but that's got to be confidence for Freddie kitchen through it very well Carter nice job by hood just clean it out and then the press constable wind up getting back to the line of scrimmage and maybe picking up one which is a lot unto itself when Paul bushy head around him Fernando Brian hood Travis Carroll defensible know we're talking to the offered coaches the other day they were talking about every game gets a name you know the drive whatever and today and tonight somebody's going to make a big play in this ball game and as we talk to Damien Craig is his memories he remembered lawyers Gilman on the reverse and said he's from mobile and people just remember plays and players in this ball game so it's a chance to be big in a big ball game the left side a nice job if she tripped up by curly Erica senior out of Birmingham number 99 one of my most vivid memories I named was a game right here at Auburn the LSU game the fire gave Annette that the old gymnasia turned up about a hundred years feet across the street to look like the southeast corner of the stadium was going up and fired they cleared down to this Alabama defense they have played their hearts officers down offering 13 attempts of rushing for total of 32 yards take it out to the 28th and he didn't get it away and the ball had been robbed booth now the defensive back gave up on its Ziggler since the play was dead but Hicks poor did hell no they didn't stop getting the quarterback Clint Wagner came in and tackled Damian Craig whistle blows but of course when you're going fullspeed you can't hear Luke Wagner with a hip but the kitchens got his first opportunity and in fact Adam go Linden inside the 20 yard line and in a big whoops is the ball is fumbled there rolling his wife and on the one pick for by simple effort by Chris hood first of all number 34 to chase Damian Craig in a great play by Kelvin Ziegler number 20 now here's the pressure by Chris hood he just jumped off the ball looks like he's fresh from the time that he has had the rest he forces Damian Craig outside throwing on the run which he saw his so good at he lobs the ball up and kelvins Ziggler with the interception Alabama with good field position again around 747 left Hicks for did not react quite quickly enough or he could have had that defensive back on his hip but he didn't get ahead and sit where did the perfect job making the inner self pitching drills hit wide open over the middle has it completely knows incomplete his Quincy Jackson had to go low and drop the football and wow he looks like the first guy out to the workout that place been open now twice form Quincy Jackson just Holt has to hold on on the place so wide open Freddie kitchens with a low throw but Quincy Jackson has to make that tenth getting their chances as Mike DuBose talking the Lance Tucker on the sideline they got some things open and probably is one of the things that Tucker does a lot better 15 yards out farther he puts air under the ball Freddie felt it very hard and Lopes the Jethro buddy has a gun movement by Alabama belief and the dead gold at the illegal movement on the offense proud of this fam with Freddy kitchens entering the football game now I'm sure bill Oliver one of the thoughts he has now is to show different defenses but also to come after Freddy kitchens because he's not much of a running threat so you get a quarterback back there now it's more of a drop back quarterback he come after him a little bit more than you would Lance Tucker need to take it to the oven 41 to pick up the first six to nothing minutes to play first first of all as it complete his rejection and he is going to have the first down of his lose the foot base is on as the ball is time to be taken away by spikes it would be a first to Tim Allen Freddie kitchens has ignited this offensive football team by placing him in the ball game didn't start this football game now come in has hit some key passes hits Quincy Jackson number seven with just an out route now some missed tackles but the biggest mistake of all was where might be gambled on the play Campbell on the interception Alabama in business to the boundary nothing nice job by Jeff done left the redshirt freshman old so Dorsett you could see him out there number 91 Bruce herons talked about Freddie kitchens and he had a great attitude all week and when I was over there watching practice Thursday Lance Tucker got 90% of the plays in practice Freddie kitchens your backup quarterback has to do a lot mentally just figuring if he was in there who would I throw to and he did a great job in practice because he left very prepared this ball game three of forth for kitchen 66 yards he signals a little to go in motion throwback and he overthrows the ball as he had Gauss coming back toward the line of scrimmage Marcus Washington may have tipped that football not say another thing as you look at this ball game how its developing Alabama again with a lot of different formations I think a swollen down to Auburn a little bit of some of the things they want to do Marcus Washington 82 as you said and he just a little flip it up football her down they need the they trail 69 as him over the middle touchdown a crowded Hall so Calvin Hall makes up for a miscue a moment ago when he fumbled the football well a nice designed play they brought Quincy Jackson motion he was dragging across the middle he took out the linebackers this is pit for the extra point attempt as they have changed kickers again this week and it is very high number to Washington served the purpose time out of the field Alabama with the lead seven to six Alabama going top seven to six and for the third straight year now Burger King is recognized outstanding studentathletes through the $1,000,000 Burger King college football scholarship program tonight's Burger King student to the game are from Alabama junior defensive back Warren Foust a public relations major with a three six five grade point average and from Auburn defensive end Shannon 7 a senior majoring in radio TV and film with a three point two five GPA we need to explain to you that Cunningham who started the year was a kicker not here tonight they didn't bring him dispute she picked last week didn't bring him either you saw Diaz pick the extra point a moment ago and kicking off right now whether this is the ask and Chris Kemp is now the extra point and short field goal kicker so Mike DuBose is looking for any answer with a picking game is a lot for them picked up at the 25 that is to the cloud one of the tight ends and evil the tackle just short of the 30 all falls on Demian Craig now Ron he needs to get something gone but take a look at this touchdown by Alabama good design play the motion man what you're going to see is both wide receivers cross here's the crossing routes now right here which opens up the middle of the field for Calvin Hall in the touchdown as we mentioned an error by Calvin a fumble inside the 15 just a while ago but he makes amends for that as he comes back and catches a touchdown pass and the underdog Alabama Crimson Tide the forge on top at the 613 mark and his first day it were who had the interception a moment ago and let's check in with Adrian Carson Ron it was easy for me to see in pregame the justification is something the coaches told us earlier in conference this week that less is better really less as more as far as the defense is concerned they've simplified things because you got to remember they brought 20 athletes along in this trip who came to Alabama not on scholarship for the first place keeping things simple so they don't have to do too much up front that's actually helping in the first half defensive go good point second down about four and a half she were about to hit the five and a half minute mark looked into a shove his tip with the line of scrimmage and almost picked off Travis Smith got his hands on it and you can see Damion Griffith seen it because he knows he did not throw that pass whoa the other thing that's happened in this ballgame because of the way Alabama's plan on defense they have got all them out of the running mode they know now they've got Auburn throwing the football so they can design their defense a little bit differently your curler goes to the sideline also pull it it goes to the sideline so the middle is hitched or got a complete they had missed on five third down conversions and they just got another one Tony Dixon makes the tackle and that is big I think Mike as far as momentum in this first half because Alabama had kind of wrestled it away from they have momentum on their side what the difference in this ballgame the first half has been the play of the secondary of Alabama you talk about Bryant and Townsend they bring in and then they arrest him a series Ziegler has played great for Alabama in the secondary the secondary has just blanketed the receivers take it for about four go he talked about the running game for Auburn and everybody's talked about it all year they started out against us Virginia with 77 yards and you look at the the two losses that they had the Florida here in the Mississippi State here and how they dropped under 50 yards rushing him when they were that their best Louisiana Tech and Georgia 159 yards that's when they have and they take the pressure off the Demian Craig well their average tonight well actually 14 attempts 36 yards which is an average of under three Jay Townsend oneonone coverage there makes the stop I'm amazed how well they're playing in the secondary for being hurt and and missing so much action and missing so much practice at they say Thompson in pretty good shape here again against Carsten Bailey just a quick hitch seemed plan his foot Touche Thompson come up and make that tackle short of the first down marker they're gonna bring the change in just to check it out to see just how short he is if in fact the issue of by about what two links on that chain can't be any happier than Mike DuBose has to feel right now because his ballclub foreign sexy not a lot to play for Adrienne Carson said their planned to be the first team that win here at Auburn and that's their motivation in this game this is a formation coming up Mike that Auburn likes to use in short yardage you see a number 73 Kendall Simmons will line up in the backfield he actually is a reserve guard and he use him as a fullback time where he is right behind baby and Freddie one fake it to him talk with the passive it is an assembly where you talk about a great play Claud you talked about great defense this is designed well by offering to try to get six points quick and a great fake by Damian Craig and I think you go for this now that's what's the whole idea behind this here is Kendall Simmons to fall back and that's 300 and some pounds going overboard 321 but Alabama look how they play this in the secondary they're in great shape by the desk Fernando Bryan almost with an interception well they go for it quarterback sneak with Jamie Craig and he got this easily so in actually a good play call I don't want to play with it's excellent that these teams know each other so well oh and they read their t's Fernando Brian in their big fullback comes off lastly cuz you were laughing about Kendall Simmons they ran a play against George and he hit Damien Craig in the back David Craig probably that was the hardest hit he had all the whole game I tell you what he jumped pretty doggone well though Mike when he did when they ran the fake and he went over the top of the pile they promptly told him in practice he somebody attached on the other side nobody thought of this but he said don't come down like that Bailey was the intended receiver Townsend was there with it they're picking on those corners are trying to but there isn't they're not getting much on yeah they're losing that battle tonight so far in this ball game Carsten Bailey number five against the shade Townsend footrace Touche Thompson in perfect shape looking for the football reading the eyes of Carsten Bailey nothing home the day another youngster out of Mississippi not a baseball early home and said that they want the best receiver always hit Fernando brand him argued is Jay Townsend they want always the opponent's best receiver see Damian Craig six of 16 and a fake hip to Beasley mashes thrown incomplete off the mark is Robinson the intended receiver and Sickler was all over him now let's check the marker ineligible receiver downfield you know we talked about this round early in the ballgame they had great field position Auburn and and didn't take advantage of it then Alabama had the four penalties and almost an interception and they hung around and hung around and the Auburn just hasn't been able to put him away here and he'll do receiver that feel on the offense fiveyard penalty repeat second down so Laster Sizemore explains the situation it's getting cooler here at offered in fact a little bit foggy as the front I think has produced cooler air and those young men I know it's because of the orange paint can't feel the cool that is now invading this city because it's the Iron Bowl and show a lot of formation sometimes you line up wrong and we'll go back to that last play after this one alabama shows blitz and see if they coming out yet they're coming in the middle steps up drills his wall and it is Tipton got to be intersected by Alabama Marcus Spencer down the near sideline flavor lens out of bounds and I'll tell you clips in Robinson night should have caught it in bunt for a touchdown and he got a tip off his shoulder pad he didn't catch it with his hand Alabama just playing well in the secondary early home and the secondary coach has to be happy about this disguising yeah clips in Robinson he let it get into his body instead of catching anarchist Spencer with the interception Jamie Creek really had some room to run that football the old tip drill showed the line of scrimmage is now at the 44 in the half yard line with 316 left to play until halftime albert is confused on offense and the home hood saying hey defense give us a stop here proud on their feet bounder all right fifteen to gameplay action has a complete right of the middle of Rutledge and the tight end is going to take it to the 39 for a fiveyard gain and now they say in completely yeah okay Alabama's come back to the line of scrimmage they were going to snap it at the 39 and the officials say no please put it back here at the 44 today Mike DuBose has shown his feelings that's too tiny look like slow making those calls Rutledge twice was close to catching the football into the first three drives in the last four as far as field position for Alabama Freddy kitchens has benefited the lance pekus starting in the 20 the Freddy's have been a field position Spike's in the Blitz right at the middle kitchens Chrysler run out of it and he wisely goes down at the 41 as martavius Houston is there but that's why you blitz Freddie kitchen because even if he runs the football he's not gonna damage you he's not gonna gas you like a Damian Craig or maybe a Lance Tucker with Gashi picks up three or four yards but then you go after him again see that secondary resting on the sidelines and they're smiled and they're having fun because this first half is almost over in Alabama he was not supposed to be able to play with all them this year because of that secondary has forged into a lead by one kitchens pass gotta go drop by Jackson and almost intercepted as Jason brave almost picked off the caramel and we've had guys drop footballs all over that should have caught him Freddie kitchens couldn't have been any better in this second quarter he's throwing the ball right on the money receivers just are not holding on to the football Quincy Jackson number seven pretty good defensive play by Jason brave but a good stop by Auburn's defense they've got two fourteen and two timeouts left to try to make something happen to kick it away to Marty Cooper it has the return on found inside the five and it takes in Alabama bomb it had been touch dead at the three years 37 yards in the kick let's take a break 203 until halftime and our score Alabama seven and Auburn six well seven to six our score Alabama on top and of course we mentioned off the top of the telecast that the announcement was made about 55 minutes before this game kicked off that Arkansas had beat the Mississippi State that means our burn control their own destiny to win the West and this crowd won't nuts but so far in the first half as part of breaks it out five spin and now 15 he lost the football short the Alabama flavor signaled that Auburn had recovered it I think he wanted to point the other way hey so happy just point it and let's check in with Carl rabbit alright ass Alabama recovers and has a chance to increase their lead you write about that run certainly LSU student home duty for the Crimson Tide and they Alabama to do LLC a favor the same way Florida did Michigan a favor today by beating the elder Bowden number one Michigan going to the Rose Bowl for the first time in a long time they will have the Louisville picture they've poured some Ann Arbor and Gainesville and what has been a very busy day and not yet over run back to you okay well the Trevor Smith is the man who made the recovery and Terry Bowden knows the three turnovers in just his offense kind of disappearing in the second quarter as back there to jeopardy right now Curtis Alexander takes it to the right side and that is a great open field tackle by Jason brave take a look at that fumble again well de montreuil Carter's had some problems this year holding on to the football good hit again by Calvin Ziegler I can't even begin to tell you how well he's playing in this ball game just a good stick on Carter caused a fumble and then Alabama's great field position and one of the raps on Carter had been laid on holding on to the pit ball and the count this is flipflopped as far as field position 76 to middle 40s bitch he breaks the tackle they didn't get him and he throws this one away out of the back of the enjoy and to repeat what I started to say a while ago before we tossed it to Carl and that is the fact that our burden can control their own destiny but right now they are down by one and the Crimson Tide is on the doorstep again Ron a concern you have to have if you're Bruce Arians and Mike DuBose right now is you know you have had problem with your kickers and you've got new kickers here tonight so this third down they have to make something happen right here on 3rd or 7th they do not want to get this field goal situation they'll take it if they have to but they'd like to make something happen here is the plan in motion you see the cruncher the pass it is taught by Dawson what I hit by Rob hey whoa ho now here comes the decision that Mike's talking about let's see if they send the field goal unit on I don't think they will Mike I think they will I believe you take the field goal here even though you've had problems whether that's fourth and four is a long way to go they may take some time to think about it but now they're gonna go for field goal thank you sir right move on you want to get points you've had problems with your kicking game but you got a hope that you can give it in here Tucker is the holder on the extra point a moment ago Tim was very high and short low pass he gets a better kick this time and he's good Chris Kim with the field goal 32 yards and Alabama with 19 seconds showing on the clock on top five for you expect your best in a ball game like this so you expect your kickers to go out and make something happen there's a snap the good hold nice job by Tucker to get that ball up timeout on the field let's take it with them fourpoint Crimson Tide leave well as you look at this capacity house here in Auburn Alabama the folks to the right particularly which is uh the home folks here at the Auburn at this Stadium I mean they are in shock because they not only were huge underdogs with the injuries to the Alabama players and what have you a lot of the balls went on one knee so that they could have 15 seconds left well tomorrow morning that's NFL countdown at 11:30 Eastern sit in with the distinguished Faculty of Bristol University of the best NFL pregame show in the business

wonderment as to what is going on on this Saturday evening it is halftime with our score Alabama 10 O'Byrne 6 now with the Buick Century halftime report let's join Carl rebek hi Ron Franklin thank you very much a fourpoint game there as we mentioned the Bowden's just a minute ago good day for taught me his Tulane team won but Terry right now down to Alabama and Auburn controlling its own destiny Florida State Bobby Bowden's team they control their own destiny we will check on the halftime report how those Seminoles fared against the Gators at the swamp also coming up but the Wolverines get back to the Rose Bowl and in your face rivalry day Woodson in Boston and the entire cast of the Noles and Gators much to do over the next 15 minutes come back there's halftime report is presented by Buick Century discover a little luxury in this century wakefield go by the maligned Alabama cooking game and it is 10 6 they have a 4 point lead at the half Alabama and Auburn welcome everyone to the century by Buick halftime report Florida State and Florida 324 days ago the Gators knock off the Seminoles supposed to be redemption for Bobby Bowden's team they come in number one they come in unbeaten but they come into the swamp danger City Freddie Taylor at a huge game 61 yard touchdown his third of the game Gators up 25 20 so much for a defensive battle though these two teams averaged about 50 someodd points between them when they meet Travis minor 18 yard touchdown twopoint conversion no good an FSU onepoint push Doug Johnson jacquez green earlier today Chris Bower talking about guys coming from down on the depth charts and rising Doug Johnson did just that his 63 yard pass later set up a pretty Taylor's for 30 to 29 sixtyeight seconds left to go in the game Florida State deep in their own territory Buzzbee picked off by Dwayne Thomas frustration for the Noel's final score 32:29 in favor of the Gators so Florida has won the last two critical meetings between these two teams no national championship for the Seminoles mostly 219 yards Doug Johnson Noah Brandeis all combined to get the job done for Steve Spurrier's team who said afterwards boy we like to beat those knows Ohio State and Michigan also trying to stay unbeaten at the big house the Wolverines Charley Woodson did everything this afternoon including a 78 yard punt return for a touchdown 13 nothing Michigan at the break 2nd half the market Wolverine Stanley Jackson had troubles all day this poor pass picked off by Andre weathers 43 yards later pagers fourthquarter 2007 Brian Griese I'm gonna pop it Gary Gary poncy jerryrigged since Gary covers inside the to Pepe Pearson touchdown at 20 to 14 50 seconds left Ohio State killed name up the ground and exciplex than going straight word and Michigan knocks off John Cooper's Buckeyes again Charles would sit in the Wolverines are breaking out the roses they go back to the Rose Bowl and they are unbeaten with a very very good chance of figuring in the national championship picture they control their own destiny 11 in O season SEC Tennessee and Kentucky the heir apparent and the air Peyton Manning Marcus Nash one hand and grabs down the sideline 59 yards and it's 14 3 balls couch how about deal Sanford watch the moves to elude the balls in his tackles Kentucky players banging into each other speed to bird 87 yards for the touchdown longest pass play from scrimmage for TD this season for Kentucky seventeenth wisdom Manning Nash 66 yards in a game a big blanket saw the receivers chunk to a big chunk of yards after the catch is Nash perfect pass 31 yard 523 yards five touchdowns on a 25 for 35 day Jamal Lewis for touchdowns 128 yards the first two freshmen to rush for 1,000 yards so the high school story may be a wash as far as Manning and Woodson go but certainly the national title picture goes Michigan advantage however we are gonna go back to Gainesville right now Florida State and Florida partying may continue in Michigan it is in full swing right now in Gainesville Mike Adamle is there for more on what happened today Mike well Carl right now the scene on University Avenue it looks like a 1 a in Fort Lauderdale during spring break this is one celebration that won't end anytime soon Steve Spurrier said after this game that it was wasn't quite as sweet as a sugar bowl victory but very very close especially when you consider how it was accomplished shuttling into critter backs defying convention shattering Doug Johnson and Noah Brandeis at the place and afterwards are mark Schwartz talked to the victors and the vanquished that's the first time I've ever done that and they got in there quickly and we sort of have an idea what we were going to do and what it gives you a chance to coach the quarterback in between everyone you know something happened when she looked over here maybe give this guy up so at one time we would think that playing for you to tell you the truth he wanted to be a game where you know someone take control someone have all the the highlights everything you wanted to do whatever it took to win and that's what it took and I'm happy if I didn't play it off we don't want I still be this happy we could not contain that dead gum green and number 21 long enough I thought your cortex Steve did a great job using his quarterbacks the way they should be used we're looking at a perfect season going to play for it all against Nebraska and I mean to lose this game really hurts me because I'm a senior I never forget play the Gators again and they've caused me three national championships now so long 95 last year this year so I mean I can never go back and play them again most impressive things about the Gators today their offensive line no sacks against a team with other nation in that department the party continues here in games I'll give you a full report when I see you back in Bristol variety you get here with the voice that party's gonna

folks fails the fans once again Nebraska two wins away from the Orange Bowl to meet Tennessee if the volunteers can get two more victories but will not have a battle of the fans really would like to see an unbeaten nebraska team i guess an unbeaten Michigan team Wolverines guys figure to be a comfortable number one on the AP poll the margin was big Nebraska a little bit closer in the coaches poll they might pick up some of those 29 firstplace votes to the Florida State had let me give you a scenario with Nebraska could get a piece of the national title they still got two big ballgames they've got Colorado and Texas A&amp;M if they beat those teams very beat them good then they got Tennessee maybe who's ranked number three in the Orange Bowl I don't see how anybody could keep a 13 and old Nebraska team I've at least a piece of the National John at least to share it it's unfortunate you go back a couple weeks ago they win a football game even though it's close and it penalized them as Chris mentioned it's unfair that system the way it is still set up but I'll tell you this you got to give credit to the Michigan Wolverines week in and week out they have played teams they really haven't been threatened with the exception of the Iowa game and the Ohio State game both teams that were ranked at the time so we can look at his system but you got to step back and really give Michigan a lot of credit it's hard to argue if Michigan's number one but Nebraska would be penalized for that close win against Missouri perhaps the role of reversal of in 1994 when Penn State was number one until a close win and Nebraska went on to win the national championship and Penn State was the nine as an undefeated team really compelling story in the Rose Bowl the opponent for Michigan is Washington State because back in August they beat UCLA on a coal line stand and the tiebreaker goes to wazoo because of a fourth down play when Toledo couldn't go to skip picks he left the came because he was dizzy and Jermaine Lewis is tough so I I think fans would probably rather see Michigan and UCLA instead they'll get why and leafy company against the great defense yeah but Washington's got a great football team and they deserve to be there but Michigan's another situation Michigan has lost the last two ballgames they've been in I recommend Lloyd Carr ticket trip to Tallahassee spent a couple days with Bobby Bowden the reason bottoms 14 and 1 in bowl games yo half my knowledge is know where to find it violins got some knowledge now Washington state's gonna attack Michigan have five receivers with over 20 catches Michigan would have to use ball control to keep the ball away from Ryan Leaf but you have to obviously like Michigan's chances in that game plenty more Rose ball talk in the next month a caller a bitch has more in the Buick Century halfth on the board after this it's Bama on top of the Tigers at the break here and some other scores Penn State makes a big statement they Rock responds in 35 10 eNOS a buck 38 kstate over Iowa State they also say hey Alliant take a picture of that Virginia Tech loses to Pittsburgh Tech may have blown the Big East title Syracuse a win next week it's theirs West Virginia loses to Notre Dame the Irish backtoback weeks of taking care of top 25 teams first time since 92 they've done that second half Ron Franklin because he cut up well we're back with our halftime score the Crimson Tide 10 and the Auburn Tigers 6 and Mike Gottfried we talked about on the early part of the telecast in this ball game Auburn had many opportunities and they they missed them and right now it's really costing them in this football game they Ronde had great field position early in the ball game and then just couldn't get anything done with it and then inner Freddie kitchens and then all of a sudden everything changed senior quarterback coming off the bench and you see the good pass here to Quincy Jackson and he's down the sideline for good yardage Freddie a lot of the passes here he doesn't take the sack scrambles for 34 yards doesn't make the stakes touchdown pass over the middle and they've just like the new ballclub they're energized with Freddie kitchens coming in the ball game you know when watching Alabama come out at halftime as you look at the first half numbers Auburn only 54 rushing and 63 passing but when Alabama came out to begin this second half now their feet were not touching the ground because all of a sudden we talked about when you let it under guard and they in the ballgame the longer they really start to write here to start this half off at the ball at the 35 yard line so they open it up with the first great so to speak of the second hand and let's check in with Adrian Karsten adrian ron terry bowden tells me he's going to live by the twotoone ratio offense of the second half that is to say two passes to everyone run as you said 54 yards on the ground in the first half is not going to get it done they've got to pick and choose their moments when they run from the hand that ball off to Beasley remember 160 yards on the ground last week was nothing to write home about that is enough to compliment the passing game against Georgia and lead to a big winner okay we'll see how that ratio goes apron will keep up with it very closely appeal Auburn they deferred to the secondhand potentially are open here on offensive the third quarter curly also Carol coming in to combine on the tackle around the first half we talked about the difference between Freddie kitchen she was 5 out of 10 for 82 yards and one touchdown on the other side Damien Craig 6 is 17 63 yards the two big interceptions 1st quarter Alabama only 27 yards 1 20 in the second quarter into the boundary that's a nice job in the open field by Travis Smith to trip him up Goodspeed by Trevor Smith number 48 two junior linebacker they have answered every punch that offered his role on offense to this point tackles in at first half for Auburn Dorsey with five martavius Houston with four three of those solo and Takeo Spikes only two tackles in the first day have not called his name a lot in this ballgame he dominated in the Georgia game third down they need to take it out to the 45 Alabama showing blitz let's see if they come actually they stay at home gotta pitch for FATCA made the teens right there possibly put an asterisk by that play because I don't think they wanted Alabama to get the ball right back with the momentum they have well you think of the senior quarterback has to lead a Damian Craig led his high school team to two state championships he said I'll be measured by this Alabama game tonight hits picks poor on a short post Warren Foust back there and Kevin sick Calvin Ziegler number 20 the safeties yards in the pass play it's born out sweet patch and he is going to go down under the rush of Eric Curley Kelvin Ziggler number 20 was going to come on a blitz there you talked about Alabama has shown a lot of fronts a lot of different looks here's Ziggler number 20 showing blitz and they're blitzing a linebacker the topside Damian Craig couldn't get out of the place or thus the bad play Eric Curley with the tackle they've been confused Auburn on offense they look like armored now it's a little bit better idea of what's happening in the ball game but what Alabama is trying to do to them so they're coming back to the outside Lexie's on their flags all over the place the Leia games didn't get to play off in time you know we talked about at the top of the telecast the percentage of plays that quarterback Damien Craig who's involved in currently for the season 78% of the plays he's involved with in it is higher than any quarterback for the top 25 team in the first half Mike they had 34 snaps he was involved in 23 of them well I can tell you as you look at quarterbacks in the top 25 just your point to everything tell you this it's gonna be 95 here in this third and fourth quarter but because it's on his shoulders to win this football game that is three delays in this ball game against Auburn three times they've suffered fiveyard penalty and call it good sand right in the chest and he dropped it there very fortunate Fernando Brian didn't intercept it because Fernando Bryant was gone for the interception tripped just as the ball came to him played it great again this secondary for Alabama I've talked about it all all evening a raving about how they're playing in the secondary you'll see Fernando Bryant once the interception he trips and falls or he picks that ball off and you're right Tyrone Goodson dropped it so it's third down and if they want to keep this one going you got to take it to the Alabama 41 you just joined us Crimson here comes the pressure play gonna be sacked at the 25 by Travis Smith the second time that Alabama has gotten to him tonight you talked about a field position swing that ball that started to 48yard line and now they're all the way back to about their 27 28 yard line again pressure they're coming after Damien Prague Trevor Smith Kelvin Ziggler they're not allowing him to set up and read defenses Alabama appearing to be coming after him the pressure on at home is good acting job had no flag returned from the third Richard and he's going to be stopped at the 36 now the hometown folks are booing because they think there should be a roughing but I think you will see that Holmes didn't really get bumped into and if he did it was not that hard time out on the field at 11:10 left in the third quarter Alabama by four ESPN's presentation of college football Alabama versus Auburn is brought to you by pressed old antifreeze protect your car in the press tones of 1972 the famous punt Alabama cut game bill lewdness two blocked punts led to two David Langer touchdown returns as the Tigers came back from a 16 to 3 deficit to upset the Crimson Tide our score 10 6 enough it's they stop more opening drive of the second half big offensive whoa further salvaging the gig opening five fifteen fourteen yards antoine nolan will put the stop on him i remember right now these coaches of coached against Bill Oliver before the spring and woody mccorvey mentioned to me the other day that movement they think movement can help them and there's a lot of movement trying to confuse the Auburn defense they moved too tight in once he's settled they motioned the outside the flanker back and it just looks like it's confused and Auburn on defense first and ten as they moved the ball across midfield pitcher swings it up butts Quincy Jackson nothing inside takes it back outside and Dunlap along with Taylor and spikes in the area to trip him up we had talked about field position in the first half and we talked about it up here the first three series is for Alabama they were pinned deep in the 20 yard line Lance Tucker's times right there then all of a sudden Freddy kitchens in it's a ball game and now you see the field position how much better it gets in a short field for Alabama and they get to touch down the field goal again rutledge to tighten flips from the left side over to the right defensively traffic he played nice job as he tripped up by Lonardo Carson Leonardo a sophomore automobile 1672 was a high school quarterback if you can believe it was a quarterback in high school and we speak very highly of him and mobility you againt talking to the players that live in alabama they know the importance to this football game in the Auburn players were telling us that they needed to tell the outofstate players how important it was for some of the new players third to the 37 of arborlon 30% third down conversions tonight kitchens quickly gets his pass away the aquatic did he get the first down that's going to be awfully awfully close I don't think he has first Jackson came back for it gray was there with him he got a good spot oh now I think he made it with the spot interesting in the early going we were laughing about in the first quarter that Mike DuBose had to be saying hey give us a break in the ball game or let's get one and now the brakes seem to be going their way that was a break right there I think the good good spot there for Alabama Mike DuBose knows it and his Freddy kitchens again Ron just seems to play well in this all burn Alabama game Jackson five catches 59 yards East Mississippi jr. covered did not get the point away so instead of first and 10 at the 37 that's going to be first in 15 back at the 42 one of the problems Ron is the quarterback for Alabama makes the blocking calls they designate who's the linebacker and who's a D lineman most quarterbacks are pointing at secondary guys who may come on a blitz but all of a sudden Freddy's is pointing to linebackers and defensive linemen so centers usually make the calls the blocking schemes for Alabama the quarterback makes the call interesting you can see 74 Hogan is back in the ball game but I asked you that question since he's a freshman do you think that's the reason they didn't ask him they have something to do to it but I think it's the system the Bruce Arians believes and he wants his quarterback making those calls those could 15 about to go to to play third quarter pedis Alexander but showing a bit before martavius Houston and Takeo Spikes combining of the stop and it looks has always got the five yards back now keep one thing in mind last year this young man right here against LSU was a freshman set a new alltime single game rushing record for Alabama which is incredible with all the great running backs they've had and Mike he came in in the Michigan game in our bowl game down in Tampa and blew that one wide open with a gamewinning touchdown and that's the benefit of having three tailbacks he's fresh now in this ballgame and that was a concern of Bill Oliver because he only plays about 14 players on defense that late in the game but maybe one of these tailbacks would get hot because they're fresh this play is blown up on him no place to go and he just throws it away they have to have a lineman down sugar yeah Hogan the sinner without now they're missing this call they had more line they're a little late but uh and you got to make that call there's three linemen from Alabama downfield see Freddie made a mistake he should have ran that ball well what happened they were gonna throw the what the quick middle that was a quick screen but when it's not there you're lying in there downfield you can't throw the football so he should have run it Hogan looking around like well I was doing what the how the play was drawing up Sean Alexander they flank him out they're gonna try to hit him with a quick screen now he's not open so Freddie kitchen sees he's not open but all the linemen are down field so he can't throw the football well that was a good coaching job right there you can see Reese right back on him martavius Houston is all over him no way that play was an hour so it'll be second down and the vault is pushed back to the 41 difference in Freddie kitchens tonight worn the ball down the few wrong are you pointing out protection again to his offensive lineman Carson is the ball is shipped anywhere and is going to be popped by Jack and he hit a nut for a loss by spikes on a smart move by Quincy Jackson though because he saw that ball up in the air and he made a great quick move to try to get that ball caught deflected at the line of scrimmage by Charles Dorsey number 91 now Quincy Jackson really comes back hard to make that catch it is third down at AB Alabama wants to keep this one going they have to take it just the inside the ovens for the gate comes inside leaves it 10 and 6 Steam's of the right Dennis later 35 at the 30 he has the first down and almost a touchdown because he got tripped up by Brad where how is that for a huge pickup I'm 20 yard 20 kitchens helps make this play with a good acting job oh because he really brought the brick fake sets up like he's going to throw him how he drops back hits Dennis riddle on the quick screen and not now he picks up some very good blocking by Michael Ray 62 and then hurdles for the first down Bowens with a big block downfield easy we're barely got a hand on him to trip him up this comes terrific nothing inside bounces it outside noodle will catch him from behind and he will be at around the 20yard line so a gain of about three the offering pins don't want to see little and credit kitchens together do what they're doing because they were the heroes of the ball game last year and now Freddie kitchens with a strong hot hand and Dennis riddle into the ballgame in a strong runner the more he carries the ball the tougher he gets because he just becomes very strong and durable during a football game Mike how is this for for an interesting little turn of events kasher couldn't start at left corner tonight because of an ankle injury now Antoine Nolan for Auburn is injured he's gonna have to come out for at least to play because the trainer's are out there so they are going with backup corners the two injured corners for Alabama are playing their hurt but their plugins and they're playing lightsout yep so it's been a it's a tough tough task for corners this week and kasher comes into the ballgame so we need to watch him closely he's going to line up on the right side he could hardly run in fact he did not work out he watched practice from the sidelines on Thursday he's lined up against Gus bottom of the screen has that movement again see it causes all burn all kind of moved in after they cover the running play little opening to the left side and he goes down at the 14 let's check in with Adrian Karsten Adrian guys I can tell you right now that Alabama knows as well as we do now the Cassiar is only about 50% even if they don't throw right at him they're gonna run right at him he has a great deal of difficulty backpedaling running forward laterally the staff over here tells me as I say he's about 50% but he has to play because of the injured and Owen al I know that he went straight to the training room at the advice of his defensive coordinator Bill Oliver on Thursday and I think the youngster was going to try to run on his own on Friday just to see if he had mobility or enough to play anyway Ron you know when you watch this ballgame unquote we talked about early is too early for this game to to be decided both quarterbacks it's been like opposites in this ball game Freddie kitchens is playing with so much confidence in poise and on the other side Damian Craig has everything on his back and looks like he's playing tight and afraid to make the mistake in this ball game it's got one quarterback plan he's wheeling a threewheel in it the other quarterback everything one his shoulders you can see that furrowed brow just just now invaded on the side on this is the 11th play of the blog pits go to elevate it sometime to turn the corner 5:31 touchdown crimson tire we got a good block from its ISM number 33 first Kemp to attempt the extra point for Alabama that's tougher who is holding that's a good pass and the kick is good so there is a time out of the field and are you ready for this one Alabama 1706 we'll be right back 17 two sticks our score and there are some shock folks in this state right now and Mike I have to say as I look at this bench right here the Auburn bench we were talking during the timeout it just kind of dead and across the field on the Alabama side people are jumping and slapping each other on the back and they are better change are always going to get beat here tonight playable on there say there's another team been having fun Marco takes it out to the 27 for a moment there looked as though he might have fumbled but that's not the case so there's a timeout that's taken with a 409 to play in the third quarter Alabama by 11 the shocking voice cigar burn Alabama four minutes nine seconds left to play third quarter Auburn huge favorite in this football game and right now even with an opportunity to win the West and head to Atlanta because Mississippi State got knocked off today their arch rivals from Tuscaloosa are dominating this game ever since Betty kitchens came in in the second quarter here's a glitch Craig gets his passing at the 45 that may be the play that gets him going it's good for courting war you try to work too tight in down the middle of the football field good fake to Rusty Williams pressure on Damien Craig finds his tight in 43 Kevin McLeod big change of field position against antoine hunter I'll burn all year Ron Bennett quick strike offensive football team CJ benefit out of the football deepest penetration they've had she's back from the first quarter I believe as this pass is caught save the touchdown Fernando Brian Marston Bailey they cleared out the Tyrone Goodson mrs. Bechet Townsend they can attack all through trying to answer here 22 yards in the play you know Mike he didn't throw that ball well Bailey had to cut out for didn't have a lot on it first and goal the ball at the nine and a half yard line with his Mike said Auburn trying to answer he goes to Rome's upside at the five at the tree that is why he's down to the T that's Ziggler who caught up to him finally let's check in with you Ron what's making the difference here as much as anything else is Damien Craig's enthusiasm his onthefield enthusiasm the fire in his eyes that I described earlier today his teammates can see it and that keeps them off you mentioned that take you out the spikes wasn't his name wasn't mentioned tonight because he didn't see the enthusiasm he affects so many other people offensively and defensively on the Auburn Tigers as he comes out of the game now to confer with coach Bowden he has such a big effect on all the other guys on his team he's finally kicking in there well that was mentioned in our meeting with him yesterday and the fact that his teammates looked to him for that kind of guidance as Singler is down and was injured on the cross Calvin Sigmund he is as good in this plate as well tonight as any player what amazes me has gotten so cool tonight and the way they are treating him it's like it's cramped and it seems impossible on the night this cool to have them but it sure looks that way if you look at spikes on the sidelines and he's trying some people left over there both these teams know that you have to live with it for 365 days the winner celebrates their leisure gets ready for next year Kendall silliness the offensive guard 73 is lined up in the backfield sillens emotional and easily to the womb another Alabama player down but Fred Beasley is so good here at the goal line thing because he can go over the top he has such an exceptional person than when he hits the line of scrimmage goes over the top you've seen right here on the belly night does try to go over the top here started a little bit too late to go over the top you see actually the hip ttape here's his guard and knocked him into the end zone that's good he was injured and Chris we have documented tonight they were not sure he was going to be able to play and if he did how long he would be able to go and he's on his all fours at the 5yard line as the training staff confers with him 2:33 to play third quarter alabama by eleven and auburn with their deepest penetration actually of the night they had a 27yard field goal in the 37 yard field goal back in the first day Chris hood has had to take over since Michael Meyers suspension Michael Meyers was as good a defensive lineman anybody in the country Chris hood used to benefit from the double teams on Michael Meyers but this year people been double teaming Chris hood back to the lightest cover to see if they follow Simmons again here fool 17:12 a call to point play trying to get it within three on the left half though to move it over so they get some wide side in the field switch to work some type of pig play or some type of floods out by plays 72 yards in the driveby Auburn and the big play was the 41yard past later the tide and the cloud watch peasley on this boat flips off the corner the pass yep Bailey in the study I'll tell you what quarterbacks have had a ton of dropp tonight it particularly offer whoa wide open on attended and he drop it Fred Beasley talked about the nose he has when he gets down close from the goal line being able to spring up and over the extra point Carsten Bailey number five is coming in motion he goes to the flat wideopen ball thrown on time this didn't bring it in didn't concentrate on it second look took his eyes off of it let's count those two points look too soon by plays 72 yards two minutes and two seconds and as we mentioned the pass to the cloud was the big play Beasley with the touchdown and so a burn now down by five points as they fail of the twopoint conversion Jared Holmes to kick it off now I am a dream the Carsten I agree with him Damien Craig now that series played like Freddie kitchens has played since he's come into the ballgame Richard to the nearside to the far side five yards deep and his teammate says milk let's take it out of the plumbing and coming up after this one will send you out to San Diego for a battle in the WAC quarterback moses moreno leaves the 22nd ranked Colorado State Rams against the San Diego State Aztecs standings and the WAC well things are very very tight the Colorado State and airports you see of one tool in the mountain division its de Mexico good to be heading to the WAC and this one is over this one is a long way from over we have 10 minutes and 9 seconds and listen to the file the students are up and Laurie tensions to Jackson right over the middle that will fly up the crowd as he hits him at the 42 what Freddie kitchen just said with that passes sit down there's not there's too much noise in here I'm going to silence you if reading kitchens is happy great night he couldn't point any better he's played tonight Quincy Jackson on a post route Freddie kitchens with good protection now remember the offensive line of Alabama is keeping people off of him all night he's been able to sit back and dissect this secondary of Auburn Shawn hooks it up the middle and he's pushed to the ten yard gain on the play Rob fade on the tackle along with Dunlap and let's check it again with Adrian head coach Mike DuBose run singled out party kitchens in the locker room at halftime he told the rest of his team yeah we remember 1984 and all the similarities but this is the kind of leadership we expect at Alabama a senior who was basically benched for his last two games continued to work hard came in watched film worked overtime and now he's leading this game and leaving the team he always looking for role players on twenty eight plays 213 yards and 17 points since he's entered this football game 10 of those points 10 that they have tonight a cutoff Bob internal five votes it out the house fifteen yards which gives him like like 25 yards on two carries and this is the point that we were making that with these running backs but particularly him he's your super home run hitter and they're running out of the I formation two backs in the backfield to get a good block from sysm to pull back and they have just turned loose a running game but I there's more to this football game I think that the Alabama coaches offense Lee know Bill Oliver they were together with him they know what he's doing they're trying to outflank him they're trying to give him problems with movement three carries for Shawn for 33 yards at a touchdown with an average of 11 yards per fly as they go again mate Smith will step up to make the tackle and it was Dennis riddle who got the call that time Ronnie is Adrian was talking about Mike DuBose making a at a point about Freddie kitchens at halftime is a football coach when you bench somebody they can go one of two ways they can mope it and sit around and salt and or they can come in and be ready to go and I think you're seeing what Freddie kitchens did all week even though he didn't get to practice snaps he mentally was in the practice and in the ready to play in the game and Lance Tucker's right over there because nothing both of them won nothing more than the victory here tonight that's the end of the third quarter so let's take a timeout with our scores we hit the final 15 Alabama 17 and Auburn 12 fifteen minutes of football left here at jordanhare Stadium Alabama with the football second and seven at the oven 33 yard line that's with emotions that go to the running play with Sean Alexander Ops is way down inside the 30 to the 29 that's martavius Huston who will finally stop him but as good as all three of these backs are Riddle and Curtis Alexander I think Sean gives you a tad more size but a bigger quicker burst like we've seen in the LSU and Knight was unstoppable that night but I think all three have a spot in this offensive right now they're going with Sean pollination system the fullback images he found the crease and he has the first down at the 25yard line Rhonda defensive statistics when you look at Auburn they're their tackle leaders Ricky Mele one of the linebackers has 6 but Takeo Spikes three tackles tonight so Alabama has been able to scheme and work against the best linebacker Takeo Spikes and not made him a factor in his ball game tonight to this point contam as they moved his fix they've had movement again nostril motion defense goes back to him right over the middle cuts it back into the middle is gonna be tackled at the 21 that is Neola Dawson motion brought it across hitting me reversed it then he's not he's a possession type receiver former quarterback former walkon but the movement is still given Auburn's problems when the tight end moves watch all the Auburn defensive players move and then all of a sudden you get movement out of Chad Goss so you're trying to confuse them with movement every play you could not get by his own blocker and kneel and we're stuffed the play Brad where's the safety the free safety he is so tight on that play they know they have to stop the run the more times you see the tight end move the more time you see the flanker motion sets up the run to the weak side and Brad where just was moving up on that plate and there was no place to run the football cell the situation bearing down and six he could go in had better take it to the Auburn 16 yard line they lead it 17 to 12 as we have quality' half minutes left in this 60 second iron that's Jackson emotions it comes to glitch up the Minish that's the pressure and he drops the football padded hitting right in the chest and as we said it was spiked who was coming tell Mel right up the middle and Ron now the kicking game becomes very important again you're on the Alabama sideline you just do you know the problems you've had this year Calvin halls right in his hands in the two receivers chef Tamarra you can milk both them so this is a 38 light attempt that's tougher Holden will pass from Center the pink is long enough Alabama could have made it an 8point ballgame but the kicking game puts it in jeopardy for the moment timeout on the field 12:12 left in our ballgame we'll be right back ESPN's presentation of college football Alabama versus Auburn is brought to you by Chrysler engineered to be great cars Ron Franklin Mike batchford and Adrian Karsten coming to you from Auburn Alabama over on the sidelines some mind games Chris Kemp all of his teammates coming over saying hey don't worry about it you missed a field goal attempt that's happened before it'll happen again and they know it may come down to a kicker tie him then come you're exactly where you don't want him to go in the tank Damian preggers the first out of the 20 breaks it open katako should have been tackled after four it's going to be at eight yard gain Tony Dixon will make the stop and let's check in with Carl rabbit Carl time just to remind her the reason oven is playing for its own destiny Mississippi State struggles today player finds Anthony Lucas Mississippi State dumped by 10 to Arkansas it's okay you know a strange turn of events on this last drive by Alabama a past that hit Hall almost right in the face and he dropped it and also spikes hit the quarterback and knocked him down that's the first time in the entire ballgame as we've gotten a movement in flags again so Kentucky in the ball game and Alabama has done a nice job of protecting their quarterback rolling them getting them in a protected situation we really have and this was a Kenny Smith jumping off sides here for Alabama first down I'm going to go back to Danny port has a big win for Danny Ford today and a lot of talk to Danny for it's not going to be back at Arkansas I believe he will be back that last drive here's the pass and hit Hall right in the face couldn't catch it and the field goal attempt I mean it just booked them as he last minute didn't miss by much no that missed sure didn't it looks like a drive it might have been hit on that Rada Trent Jones trail of golf that Wednesday here that thing had a had a nice look butter but at the bitches pass the daily product and a flag is down that's gonna be passin appearances well done Brian caught it for 16 yards Ron you're seeing the better display of quarterbacking by Damian Craig here he has gotten hot he has the feel for the game now an affair on the defense penalty here few penalties for furious because they picked out 16 yards so Auburn it with the first down and they're going to put the ball just short of midfield and here's what you don't want to do you don't want to let Damian Craig outside especially to the right side throwing a great catch by Carsten Bailey Auburn in an eye formation rusty later he'll fight his way for a couple of yards Carol is the man who makes the tackle we called his name a lot tonight freshman linebackers played real well at the defensive coaches were talking about him the other day Ellis Johnson that he's had a problem the problem he has is he he has to set the defense he has to get two calls he has to sent he has to make adjustments and he's a freshman and it's been very difficult for him Alabama's 17 all burn 12r burn of two touchdown Famer than this ballgame Vincent I live in the second half of all three previous games played here at Auburn as he rolls it past missed by Bailey and there was a flag down and this may be roughing on Kenny Smith he did take a shot at Damien Craig and that's going to be the call Ron I believe now this was really late a late gift the ball was gone and penalties now starting to hurt Alabama got a personal foul late hips roughing their quarterback filming from the line of scrimmage 15 yards was the Playa Stevie Craig rose to the left trying to get the ball to Carson Daly welcome Kenny actually the defensive back team up and made I think it was Tony Dixon number 84 Tony Dixon you're right I apologized to to Kenny I thought it was Hammond we guided but it was Dixon miss called his name 1004 to play five point lead by Alabama and although on the move again they to run pressure up the middle by Smith they've gotta throw it hasn't complete rusty Williams at the 15 Mike the boys have just yelling at the officials he wanted holding Alabama got penetration and Mike DuBose is not happy with that not being called see if we pick it up here Damian Craig number 99 it's the Marcus curry tackling Eric Curley number 99 but got away with first and ten Auburn Tigers 18 yards in the pass play as the clock runs about the hip nine and a half minutes to play in this woman those things could drive by offer since the Williams he's gonna throw it back to Claire garroted throws the ball very fortunate this with number 34 in coverage but he was falling down or he'd have been in pretty good shape too to try to intercept the football D me Craig really made a great effort to try to catch it get you out to Rusty Williams going to the left side demon Craig coming out but Chris hood stayed at home but he falls down just at the last second and a game of inches tonight rusty Williams a sophomore of the Moncks Corner South Carolina southpaw attempting the pass it'll be second and 10 sets up the screen he just peed this one away that's a smart veteran play right there threw it at the feet of Beasley because Wagner was coming after him real quick again Clinton Wagner is six foot six and he got his hands up on the pass rush he read screen right away and didn't want to give a clear throw to Damien Craig but at this twopoint play the dis field goal by Alabama and Auburn is going to take a timeout Arvin calls timeout 917 left at our ball game alabama continuing to lead by five we'll be right back 17 to 12 our score there have been upsets before in this one in the Iron Bowl Alabama and 90 Alabama in 85 and an 80 for the game at a dream talk about off the top of the telecast we're almost an identical situation of Auburn being ranked Alabama only had four victories and they got the upset win third down line to make before in the head pressure up the middle until prison hold on at the goal line two hits for Sickler on the public high Sigler's been there all night got hurt a little while goes come back on the field good pressure by Alabama on Damian Craig there's the pressure Damian Craig ducks underneath and there's the good close right Tara by Calvin Ziegler gonna be a 31yard field goal of tips but Jarrett Holmes the way and he's got it tonight 27 yards 37 yards in now and 31 yards so let's go away for a moment our new score Alabama 17 all burn 15 with 906 to play 17:15 the identical score that was final in the 84 games you look at Freddie kitchens didn't start the game tonight but he has been the difference maker for Alabama but here's the difference maker for the Auburn Tigers Damian Craig and the informants of this game his Damian just trying to walk it off in the unload some of the pressure right get off got underneath this one going to be very short taken at the 10yard line Richard and he fights out to the 30 women's college basketball come up tomorrow afternoon State Farm tipoff classic from champagne on the deuce at 12:30 North Carolina in their Player of the Year Tracy Reed will take on the Florida Lady Gators then the second game back here on ESPN all Dominion will meet Illinois at 3:00 Eastern that's the State Farm and tipoff classic tomorrow afternoon Takeo Spikes you look into his eyes as he dips into the guise of Cuddy kitchen sighs to turn the corner going to be knocked down for about a half yard loss of its Ricky Neal and Jeff Dunlap on the stop and let's go back to Adrian Karsten Adrian with the kind of night that Sean Alexander is having saved that one play run and what the kind of records he holds at Alabama coming into this game or why hasn't he carried the ball in over a month couple of reasons had a sprain court hasn't practiced for two weeks but also to say that he was in the doghouse with coach DuBose would be an understatement because he would not identify just exactly what the problem was but he said he will not play in this game based on ability alone but you might have to think that he's the Dean himself mom he's he's partly still attention on the sideline there's no question about that Akos again fiction is being hit Moses the down the heels of Freddie kitchen they say Alabama got back from the football I beg your pardon Auburn players converged on the football and Rutledge may have taken it away from both or somebody did at the bottom of the pile that looks as though kitchens got in there to make the recovery Charle or she just tried to strip for any kitchens once he decided to run with the football fakes the throw nothing's open besides the run number 91 Charles Dorsey just knocked them all in his hands look at pretty kitchens the effort he never gave up a lot of Poland Wow third down they need to move it to the 40yard line to keep this drive going tries to cut it back fights his way extended the football and let's see where they're gonna marketing down spikes and Martavious husted on the tackle if he extended that ball I think he made the first down now depending on the spot they're not going to give it to him where town Alabama's got to ask for a measurement here stretch the ball up past the line to ball come out that they're not going to give it to them they're going to punt the football late coming on the field I'm not sure that all burn believed that the Crimson Tide is going to punt the football this is the sixth punt first one of the second half this is his best of the knife maybe the best the see and comes out of bounds after one of the half yard line are you kiddin me 59 yards on the booth so at 6:18 left in the ballgame Auburn had takes it over after nearly recovering a fumble just a moment ago in Alabama territory and now the connector scrimmage with their backs lined up in their own endzone all right we had to drive last year in Alabama took the ball down the field ready kickers hit Dennis riddle and the touchdown now the Nemean break it's that same opportunity with 618 to go on the clock they sit in tough spot for a augment round because they haven't been running the ball very well tonight so you almost have to rely on Damian Craig to get it out of here by throwing the football well the freshman de montreuil Carter who was the hero last week fumbled back in the first half and we were just talking about he may not carry to get into screen fry handspring cracks the next time he's on the field or the molding he may get some old practice now he'll be back he'll get another shot because he got too much ability the senior pullback will take it out to the 5yard line tanks makes the tackle on him now the clock about to go under six minutes Nikki important thing here Auburn has two timeouts alabama still has a full complement of three timeouts but this is a big play right here well the two things had come to mind as far as huge plays in this in his football game how spikes missed recovering the fumble down here and Freddie kitchens took it away from him and then that 59 yards pumps just a moment ago by Daniel cope right now is the play of the football game that night talks about 30 kitchens and waited help him though because he Haber was great to pull that ball away and third down that'll move the change good for 50 spectra senior quarterback to do it and Damian Craig hits a big play to explore and the drive has now started Alabama with no pressure good blocking by the author offensive line it's pretty wide open over the middle four catches for 48 yards for four 12:27 196 and two interceptions tonight one of those the shores should have been caught Williams gets it outside finally bumped out of bounds by Sigler and that'll stop the clock just under five minutes to play in this movie you know you gotta if you're offering you thinking feel go with four or 57 to go on the clock on to bench the Alabama offensive line getting a break at a breather talking it over hoping that they get to come back on the field with still a lead second and five cuts it back into the middle and is going to wind up with about three yards Tony Dixon makes the tackle could pursuit a good cut back by rusty Williams on that play sets up another third down play with Damian Craig must deliver a Mike if we look ahead to a situation where Offerman gets it in field goal range what's the longest for Jared Holmes 45 this year against Arkansas his career long was 50 in 1996 against Alabama Birmingham and he's got a strong leg we've seen it tonight laughs the past pageant complete whoops and made the catch pushed out of bounds out of the 37 yard line so now the tide has covered a total of 36 yards because he started it officially at the old one although it was the one in the head and it continues again just like last year Freddie kitchens took his team down the field Damian Craig has that same opportunity tonight Tyrone Goodson 83 on an out route they cleared out on the outside Hicks for there's the catch the shade Townsend waiting for the tackle Carlton personal 87 also in on the tackle have to hurry gets away gonna go law in question Bailey 23 Brian this is Ron wid confidence he of ballclub when you poured six comes into play a little bit here they've had so many losses this year and so many tough plays here Fernando Brian just gets ran by by Carsten Bailey and then he puts his hands on him you know Mike if Bailey catches that ball for the touchdown the 15yard penalty is not bad though when the youngster self banged up he couldn't caught him so to give him the benefit of the doubt is that you can't blame him no and he got beat at the line of scrimmage once he got faked out at the line of scrimmage and then he was behind Carsten Bailey couldn't catch up paid to move to pass interference this is a seasonhigh in penalties against Alabama tonight 111 penalty yards and now a timeout is been taken by Alabama 402 left of the ball game Crimson Tide by a couple let's take a timeout just a couple of minutes away from kickoff at San Diego State as we take you from Pope and Alabama to Moses and Colorado State's Colorado State Board its own destinies they try to win the WAC 1715 our score and as we look up at the scoreboard both teams with two timeouts left four minutes two seconds left in this one and it seemed like just one year ago we were talking about a comefrombehind situation by the Crimson Tide tonight Auburn trying to do depending heavy pressure from behind Travis Karl it's a wonder that he held on to the football every times he's been saying Travis Carol keep from the backside after Damian Craig started to move the naming freak hasn't ran the ball much tonight to first play he's been looking for the pass he has good scrambling ability eight tackles for number 44 Travis Carroll tonight the freshman out of Jacksonville Florida Quran from into shade Townsend is out of the ballgame now so Antoine hunter is in second down to 13 over the middle riding the pins it doesn't any drop in thoughts and he not only did he drop it he took a heck of a hit from intone hunter number 39 after he dropped the football it's been a lot of dropped passes both sides tonight number 39 Anton hunter boutain and n+ the linebacker and both of them looks very very close to be in lace Marcus Spencer 41 another freshman great days ahead for Alabama with all these freshmen plan on defense third down they need to take the football to the twenty or thirty seven and a half yard line box shows 3:12 left to play pressed his arm pass is the hands available now we're on decision time for a fairy Bob do you punt the football no 306 you still got your two timeouts tough he's got a tough decision right here well they're calling for the odd team I don't think this is a bad move at all I really don't make good but they're gonna have to stop Alabama we got to pin them down they need a field goal to win they start two timeouts I don't I don't think this is a bad move at all fourths down as we said they need to take it just inside the 38 yard line so it's about 13 and a half yard and the home to see if he can get a good pooch kick away Jamie's fire that abound at the 20 and it's just gonna die right there inside the 20yard line now with 255 to play it is in competent upon that bill out of her defense to make a stop in at least three one next Saturday night we'll have another state rivalry game for you at 5:30 Eastern Time the Virginia Tech Hokies looking to bounce back against the Virginia Cavaliers then Notre Dame needs to win to stay above 500 and remain bowl eligible as they travel to the islands to take on Hawaii Ron Joe Gibbs used to talk about when he was at the Washington Redskins that you have to practice playing and running the football against 10 and 11 in because that's what's gonna happen star knowledge he is gonna move the stack for about three almost four yards as spikes and Wiese combined of the stuff now that clock is going to seem like it's on fastforward if you're an Auburn Tiger fan after this play they'll use a timeout I need to hold Alabama right here Alabama needs a first down to put this away all their needs to stop chickens play clock get all the way down the tree down the to put you John Allen could he turn the corner yes before status is hanging across the 30 out to the 34 and credit ed system number 33 to pull back with paving the way for the first down ronette system tonight has had a great night blocking for Alabama when they go to the I formation they have been dangerous running the football that's their best set to run the football the pitch number 33 ed system gets the lead block Sean Alexander shows you he's got fresh legs the first down now this time he is hit by work Marcus Washington and knocked down and they will use the timeout to stop the clock with 1:35 left so let's go away for a moment Alabama with a twopoint margin and 95 seconds to burn now what does the Iron Bowl mean not as two trainers just walked up in front of quarterback Damian Craig but he has his back to the field he he cannot bear to watch because only 95 seconds left and as he mentioned the loss he's a senior he doesn't get another show by a couple straight up the middle Alexander the push him back he's gonna use their last timeout here we're gonna let it run use it after the third down play around when you decide the decision for Terry Bowden was a tough one he had fourth and ten so it comes down to do you want to go for it more than ten or do you want to try to pin him in the hole but when you do punt the football your defense must hold them in those three place and they have not been able to do that now if they hold him here they'll use that timeout still get a chance to get the football back yep that's the reason I said well they made to change that they better need to stop at a minimum of three or they were in hurt and they are in fiftyone seconds and down to fifty kitchen reverses without close the ball to Susan lise comes up with the football and it's going to come down to Jared Holmes decided to throw the screen on third down and it is part 8 of this Houston through the Knakal knocked it loose Albarn still has to get a little closer for Jared Holmes runningboy Williams takes it up the middle inside the 32 about the 29 and a half now we mentioned to Jericho longest this season is 45 yards his longest career is the timeout has been taken by Auburn their final timeout 31 seconds left of the ballgame we'll be right back time is back in Prague it plays the ball as it complete at the 22 and 1/2 s tips for now they are well within field goal range for Jared Holmes would you know that Terry Bowden would like to take at least one strike at the end zone he possibly the problem Ron is 26 seconds to go and you have no timeouts left now frat teams have practiced always running the kicker out he interesting this call somebody got to get off here comes Hicks poor out of the game and they're confused yeah they had too many people in the ball game now McCloud comes out the tide in shotgun formation plenty of time clips up the middle pass has fallen too far for Bailey and that stops it with 22 ticks they brought Mike DuBose is on the sidelines he's going after the official because there was so many players in the huddle that they could have been called for a late substitution on that thing and of course Mike what you got to consider right here which are Burt has to be careful of you'd almost look for a running play because if they have a pass play and get called for holding then all of a sudden Jared Holmes could be backed up out of field goal range well they're they're real confused again because Jared homestart up but the problem knows if you run the football round you've got it you've got a killer play clock down to four down to three down to two and they just ground the football to stop the clock and Holmes is going to come on Jarrett Holmes will come on and attempt the field goal from where the line of scrimmage is this is going to be around 39 40 yards Ron the best field goal blocker for Alabama's dicier Townsend's now he'll come off the corner Alabama is going to use a timeout now to try to I sold Jared hold at number 2 becomes the most important defensive player for Alabama coming off the corner the other folks that are most important when you look at these special teams is a Brent Turner who is the long snapper Jeremy zil's who is the holder and of course for Jared Holmes he has been good three times tonight 303 27 37 and 31 yards and you talked about the swing of emotions in this ballgame and I mean that this ballgame Damian Craig was sitting on the bench looked in the other way and it didn't look good for them then the turnover year Auburn with 21 seconds to go gets a chance to win it when Jared Holmes field goal attempt metal was interesting on Thursday that an Auburn fan told us when we arrived in town they said you know the worst thing that could happen to us is to lose to Alabama than the guys should know actually what would be worse is to lose to Alabama in Auburn he said no then the worst thing would be to lose to Alabama and Auburn in their four and six so right now it's on the line they have an opportunity and it looks as though they're going to try to ice him again they're gonna spend their last timeout time Gutzon on the sidelines but this does want Ronnie's we're out the water boys and girls they've been out in the field now three times and with that water and let's check in with Adrian Karsten down on the sidelines Adrian creek piranha does taya kept a very close eye on the youngest two homes in pregame warmup his longest 40 yards now there is a little bit of a breeze blowing in his face should not affect the kick but as I say nothing beyond 40 yards of he made in pregame warmup they doing on the one that he kicked it was 37 then he was very strong on that one but the weather has changed just a little bit as this game is going on and he does have just a little bit of a breeze then the coaches offer talked about the yesterday they said every game that's a game off it's going to be a game in this field goal kick right here so here's the ball game 21 seconds left Paul is to attempt the field goal from the left hash mark the distance is one more look Jared Holmes two timeouts for Mike how much pressure and you nail the right on the middle drama this movie for Sean ed system there he played a great football game tonight and when you look at this back at this ball game you can't look at one play you look it up miss opportunities in Alabama and I'll play with it system anytime there's the kickoff it's on the ground it will be fielded at the 21 yard line and it's season bounces off the tackler still alive here comes a flag and now the second flag and citizen looking like a man possessed got hit twice extremely hard and took it to the 45 they may get him for a facemask but the problem it took a lot of time and the other problem is Alabama does not have a distance kicking game as I said I'll play with those incisions all the time because they give you effort 59 penalty 15yard penalty the booth boy that's going to move this thing this happened at the 45 yard line because of a good second and third effort and this is going to take it all the way to the to the Auburn 40 Ron this is what a winner this kid is ed Sisson he will not be brought down there's six guys have a chance at him plus the facemask well tonight's visa players of the game are from Alabama Freddie kitchens and from Auburn Jared Holmes and as part of their continuing effort to further the development of the amateur athletics visa proud to donate $1,000 on behalf of these two athletes to their school's general scholarship fund sysm is up and is going off the field under his own power and the brain trust for Alabama looking up at six seconds in the ball game you got three choices one kick a field goal we know they're not gonna do that to you throw the ball deep down the field and hope you get some kind of pass interference or get it in the end zone three throw a quick out try to set up the field goal one of the things on Thursday when Arbor and worked on late desperation Hail Mary passes was all the defensive coach is saying whatever you do don't tip the ball don't try to intercept it knock it to the ground they're gonna try the field goal his first career field goal attempt I can't think of a tougher place a tougher time 57 that yard attempt for the Alabama win AJ the the Doyle is down does he had the distance now it is him he hangs on short and the Auburn Tigers had come from behind to win again the final score Auburn 18 and Alabama 17 for Mike godfrid
