============================================================

at Beaver Stadium losing two consecutive football games they've never lost three straight home games here under coach Joe Paterno we asked the coach yesterday his feelings he said you know this team is impressed he's impressed with his ball clubs effort he said the one thing though on the defensive side of the ball there's been some confusion he wants to see that corrected today look for Indiana to come up with some gimmicks of their own to exploit this confusion at Penn State defense to have some success this afternoon there's the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers Bill Mallory in his 12th year at Indiana 26th visit head coach the Hoosiers oh and four in Big Ten Conference play and we'll horn to start our afternoon banking at the six yard line they return out to the 27 by Stephen Pitts number 40 and stay defensively Wally Richardson the quarterback his first year as a starter and Mike Archie one of three tailbacks you'll see this afternoon from the man to talk about of course the most prolific pass receiver and Penn State history watch out for Freddie Scott in the wide receiver and flanker position and then the offensive line Jeff Harding's is the anchor of a very strong offensive line highly touted at the beginning of this season they start from the 28 yard line playaction to begin the game lots of time a protection incomplete the intended receiver on the play was Freddie Scott defensively for the Indiana Hoosiers Lewis pinic and John Hammerstein the defensive tackle and defensive end respectively watched for Nathan Davis to try to get back to the quarterback the linebacking crew Jabbar Robinson the true freshman out of Fort Wayne Baisley and surface have plenty of playing experience in the Big Ten Conference and Eric Allen Joey Elam's Eric Warnecke and Eric's medley the backfield defensively for the Indiana Hoosiers Smedley a good pass coverage man so incomplete second and 10 for the Nittany Lions the gift to Archie Archie goes up the middle games just a couple cards of the dairy only the things we saw in the first play of the game Mike isn't talking with Frank gay nor the offense coordinator at Penn State he felt like this Safety's through Indiana support at the run extremely aggressive first play of the game playaction tried to go deep both corners Joey edelen's and Eric Allen good job of covering the Penn State wide receivers third and eight it's in a long count looks to pass the football going over the middle complete to Freddie Scott first down the Penn State Freddie Scott has been kind of the overlooked receiver in the Penn State offense so much of the emphasis has been on Bobby Engram but Freddie Scott along with Ingram give us probably as good a tandem as there is in college football a nice job here Wally Richardson stepping up in the pocket and finding Freddie Scott on the deep curl route football spotted at the 42 yard line Archie is the tailback number two Richardson to get great protection for Wally Richardson first completion of the afternoon another Penn State first down wonderful route by Bobby Engram Mike on the first play action pass of the game they went deep off of the playaction pass again on first down Engram showing the deep pressure but then breaking off the deep out route Richardson a great job of time and getting the ball to him bran Gant through the offensive coordinator talked about protecting Wally Richardson better today and they had so far look at all the time he has the kid dumps it off to the man out of the backfield and a gain of about 6 or 7 yards on the play John Whitman was met by the freshman Jabbar Robinson good patience on the part of Wally Richardson he was looking deep downfield receivers were well covered he went to actually the third receiver patience and good decisionmaking on Richardson's part Indiana's defense comes in second in the big 10 13th in the nation hey I have to bend the side of the football that has avoided the injury but second and four after the gain of six football inside Indiana territory Scott goes in motion Archie the ball carrier gets a good block cuts back first pit stage surface the junior made the tackle but not until the gain of eight for the first down Penn State utilizing shifting the tight end and the motion of the wide receiver that give them an unbalanced set then they take their basic off tackle power play good job at the line of scrimmage getting movement of the Indiana front on defense Mike Archie one of three tailbacks who will play this afternoon Archie the most consistent runner get the football potentially on the seventh play of this Drive play action again Richardson pop looking for Freddie Scott in zone the intended receiver Freddie Scott was joking number five certainly no question about the the interference and we're gonna see Freddy Scott gone deep three times already in this first drive we've gone deep on the play action pass number five King was actually in position but made no attempt to play the ball and was soon as he made contact without playing the ball we had the interference calm Joe King a sophomore draped on Freddy Scott who had just one reception last week and as Coach alluded to benefit of frustrating year for Freddy Scott most the attention goes towards Bobby Engram Penn State now at the 18 yard line of the Indiana Hoosiers opening drive of the football game Richardson gives it to the up back and a good haul opened on the left side that surface made to stop a gain of six yards for John Whitman and the good block thrown by number 68 to senior Andre Johnson the left tackle really an effective job of getting the ball to a big back Penn State likes to do this in the red zone inside the 20 they've got the big fullback Whitman 240 pounds giving the ball matching up against those linebackers 21 times out of 30 two occasions touchdown scored when Penn State is down inside the 20 they work at second and four in the ballcarrier close to a fence state first down that surfaced the junior made the stop going to see on the replay the Robinson number 55 one of the few true freshmen for Indiana playing missed the stop at the line of scrimmage but that's cause Mike by the big Balkan fullback Whitman again right at the 240 pound mark Whitman a yard shy of the first down the football spotted at the nine mill the senior got the first down yardage as he was met by Victor a Lotte the sophomore from Indiana coach you just marching the football right into the gut of this Indiana defense as we talked with Frank gainer again yesterday he made the point kept emphasizing how they had to use playaction to slow down the Indiana linebackers as well as the quick fill of those two safeties eres Fran dancer guy who's been around this coaching staff Joe Paterno's for quite some time first and goal from the seven this the freshman puts a touchdown of seven yards Penn State on the floor really impressed with the patience and how very methodical the Penn State offense wasn't that opening drive and the key no mistakes no penalties they had no negative plays that take them out of the sequence take them out of the rhythm that they want to establish and I like the mix of the run and pass which is so traditional that Penn State offense Fred Conway looking for his 69th consecutive p8a as you see closing in on a Penn State Nittany Lion record impressive 72 yard drive capped off by the freshmen scampering seven yards into the end zone Nittany Lions on the pour subaru outback beauties got Julian get a break econ explore that's my Subaru Outback Wow who else first sportutility way everywhere recently the Broncos and 49ers showcase their talents in Tokyo zone West karaoke young man blame it on the bossa nova where the players brought no ability to carry it to you but did bring their Visa Card was it the Moga zone West can accept just about anything American Express took just about four and a half minutes of the Penn State Nittany Lions get on the board an impressive opening drive here on Homecoming number 76 and Brett Conway ready to put the ball in play so the Nittany Lions will see Indiana go on offense for the first time till we feel us Dorian Wilkerson back deep to receive sixtynine straight P eighties for that young man Bret Conway just a junior on a Lilburn Georgia and Indiana to start their offensive day taken at the three yard line by Wilkerson Wilkerson works it back out to the 25 of return of 22 yards on the play offensively it is Adam Greenlee who gets the starting quarterback we said earlier expect to see Chris ditto Shawn Glover the number three tailback is the only healthy one Alex Smith of course out of the lineup a jammu stoner the talented wide receiver has seen his year be pretty quiet Eric Matthews is healthy again thankfully for Indiana and the offensive line playing just for the second time this year as a healthy unit they do though have a new tight end on first down they go quickly and the ball carrier is Glover and he gets up ahead to about the 31 yard line meant by Aaron Collins defensively Terry killings and Todd Atkins the two guys on the outside as good as any tandem in the Big Ten Conference they will get to the quarterback today Aaron Collins Gerald Filardi and Jim Nelson the linebacking set it as you can see coaches we try to work lineups Indiana and curry offensive set one of the things that coachbuilt Malory shared with us last night Mike was the fact that his offense was going to go with no huddle we'll see it coming right out of the chute what this does in the defense is it forces the defense to make their call without a huddle it's going to be interesting to see how the Penn State defense is able to handle this third and 2 on this first possession somebody move down the line it was on the left side of the Indiana line too big Chris Lewinsky maybe you see the big man 80 great Jenkins it tied in today one of the things that bill Maori is hoping to avoid his mistakes the tight end that over on the left side jump putting them in a third along it rather than the 30 short situation third and seven now from the shotgun Greenlee dumps it over the middle has his receiver and he gets the first down Jim Nelson made to stop for Penn State John Glover got a gain of ten for Indiana stay in the hurry up one of the important things for Indiana Mike is to come out and answer the quick score by Penn State that was a big first down because they overcame a third down a long situation Indiana's offense has been struggling this year no question they give it to Glover again he's got a ball makes a move and gets up to about the whole yard zon the play cliff is the hero for Penn State the hero defensively that's his position he's not the hero yet hates to stop the hero is the name that Jerry Sandusky gave to his strong safety years ago when he came to this Penn State team really a nice open field tackle there by Clint holes second and three and get it to Glover again Kluber hit short of the first down yardage by Jim Nelson before the junior Mike as we look at Indiana in the hurry up or no home office one of the important things here it is it it's it's not a hurry up and curves of week that the tempo they control the tempo the offense controls the tempo all they're doing is they're lining up in their formation at the line of scrimmage they get the place signaled from the sideline they use their backup quarterbacks that do the signalling so it's it's nothing that limits their office they're able to run their whole offense use all their formations use all their place just a bit short of the first down needed yardage so it'll be third in less than a yard for Bill Mallory in the Indiana Hoosiers and that guy's just looking for something good to happen Nathan the conference on 3rd down conversions at 38% at the end I already did a good job on the 3rd and 7th they did misses one of the first big plays in football game this is so important for Indiana to be able to get the first thing sustained tape tearing holes and Miller the defensive backfield on a Penn State Nittany Lions the junior on a Solon Ohio three interceptions on the year this should be a third and inches running situation Steve lead big heavy guy movement on the Penn State Line and Greenlee keeps the football or see if the Penn State guys were drawn off it appeared that the Penn State defensive lineman was in the neutral zone and while he was there the Indiana Center snapped the ball that'll work just as effectively one of the things that coaches teach their offensive center is if he sees a defensive player jump into the neutral zone snap the ball and get the free five yards nice job by Jase I've at the Indiana center of getting that done so the football moved up to the 48 yard line of Penn State opening drive for Indiana after the impressive start for the Nittany Lions first and ten greatly and nor to go good coverage downfield by Penn State so greatly made it right back to the line of scrimmage at best that was really as you mentioned a coverage scramble all of the Indiana receivers were covered Penn State was playing a base core under zones three deep but they did a nice job getting coverage forcing Greenlee into the scramble from the shotgun now second and ten greatly protection time season two senior from Newcastle we're gonna see the receiver on the top of the screen was open and he was open deep there was nobody behind the Penn State corner up there Martin Tate was beaten but the quarterback just could not find him tremendous job there by Todd Atkins one of the things he did has never stopped this feat loss of 8/3 an 18 into the flat complete Eric Matthews but well short of the first down went holes was right there on Eric Matthews and it will be a punting situation for the Indiana Hoosiers only thing that's important early in the ballgame Mike as we see Indiana in there no huddle offense is to try to have some success that would be a big emotional lift for this Indiana team Allen sakowski to kick the pun away for the Indiana Hoosiers Bobby Engram back deep to receive Indiana coaches told us they're going to try to keep the ball away from Bobby Engram and that includes a punt like we just saw seven nothing penn state 1st quarter he hadn't moved the ball have been offensively on their first drive but they trail seven nothing and Bill we saw the hurry up something you're very familiar with Florida State the couple years ago when I was coaching at Georgia Tech went to the hurry up offense with Charlie warden they actually did it in the game against Georgia Tech of course the rest is history as far as what it did to Charlie Ward Heisman Trophy national championship at Florida State but it is something that's become very popular in the game of college football because it allows you as an offensive team to run your entire offense it allows you to control the tempo at the line of scrimmage the way you want to run it but the big pressure is on the defensive football team it does not allow them the huddle it really limits the calls that they're able to make defensively and it puts pressure on that defense to execute first in 10 Penn State goes on the offense for the second time this afternoon they start at the 24 yard line Richardson Falls now is up top for Bobby Ingram incomplete overthrew his intended receiver Eric's Smedley was on the coverage for Indiana what Penn State has done as they've made a strong statement you are not going to support the run aggressively with your linebackers you're not going to support the run aggressively out of your secondary we are going to make you pay for that if you do with the playaction pass and stayed offense tied for first in the conference averaging over 35 points per game they work at second and 10 from their own 20 for Fredi stock goes in motion to the far side of the football field and off to Mike Archie up the middle mat surface was right there Archie will get two or three on the carry part of me Bryant mill number 22 the ball carrier at surface number 47 not a big physical linebacker at 62 220 runs well extremely active Jill Novak the defensive coordinator says he is one of the people that you're constantly gonna find around the football in the course of the game third and seven Richardson checking off at the line of scrimmage drops back pressure on a fly by Indiana dumps it off into the flat first down Penn State Beasley but not until 12 yards and a first down for the new alliance Wally Richardson shows his athletic ability when the pressure gets to him and there was a breakdown in pressure at the line of scrimmage and we see big number 98 Mason today Davis in his face but Richardson with the ability to keep the play alive long enough for number 22 Brian Milne to work open in the flat billing the senior out of Waterford Pennsylvania 63 253 pounder now first and ten ball on the 40 Richardson again play scampering inside the sir default down at the 24 Aaron Warnock he had to do a great job to catch up to the big guy a 37yard game for Brian Mill Mike Brian Mill is one of the real inspirational stories in this stadium today as a high school junior Milly's was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease he did not play any form of athletics for four years he's back not only playing football but in 1993 was the ncdoublea discus champion with a throw of just slightly over 200 feet tremendous story and Penn State the whole time stood behind their scholarship offer to Mill has been the workhorse on this offensive series for the Nittany Lions timeout on the field all by the Indiana Hoosiers we'll take the break with bill Mallory in his staff Penn State moving the football effectively once again they lead in our game seven nothing first quarter see on the last play a 37 yard catch to the fullback number 22 Milne off of their playaction their counter pass you're going to see Mill in the flat they fake the the counter play Richardson doing a good job tremendous onehand catch now Mike Archie the ballcarrier coach for Penn State met by the end of the defensive beam of six yards of the carry Wally Richardson impressive thus far five four seven 78 yards but is so impressive about Wally Richardson and this is athletic ability and his decisionmaking to this point in the football game but being off the field for Indiana Victor a Lotte the big man just a sophomore and bill Mallory's defensive scheme and over the past couple of weeks he's gotten more work out of Brooklyn New York six for two hundred and ninety five pounder there you get a good look at the focused Wally Richardson trying to fill some big shoes that goes without saying even in this latter part of the football season Richardson hands the football up while Gary was Big John Wittman he pulled into the line and he's going to be short of the first down they Richardson coach and it's really an interesting story the kid wants to be a lawyer he's come in and try to replace Kerry Collins and replaced such a new word to say in collegiate football yet as you talk with the Penn State coaches they're so impressed with the way she has handled that the pressure of that challenge as you mentioned he wants to be a lawyer he's taken a full set of courses and coach Paterno mentioned that that so much of this time off the field has to be sent spent in preparation for his classes rather than studying for Saturday afternoon to the stadium third and two from the 15 is Curtis penis defensively by the Indiana Hoosiers number 45 James Baisley Jamie Baisley has been growing each week at that linebacker position here we're going to see him number 45 with a good tackle and then a real strong cleanup whipped by number 18 Erik medley keeping Whitman from the first down short of the first down for the first time Penn State was three for three on third down a 34 yard field goal attempt for Brett Conway snap behold his good Conway's kick is up and it is no good Penn State unable to convert on what looked like another impressive drive and that's got to give Indiana a little bit of feeling of confidence no question like a big lift for the Indiana defense because the the big pass completion of my own set Penn State up once again in the red zone for them to make a stop that gives their defensive lift gets their offense right back on the field now what's important is for that Indiana offense to step forward and be productive coach espn2 is your home for college football again later today kickoff set for 3:00 o'clock Elizabeth City State College travels to Hampton Virginia to face Hampton University it is a central Intercollegiate Athletic Association battle it immediately follows our game at 3 o'clock Elizabeth City and Hampton right here on the deuce Indiana to go on the offense for the second time let's see if they stick with the nohuddle and they work it to the big man the ball carrier was Shawn Glover and Glover has been the guy who has got the most Glover coming off a very good performance earlier this year in for the injured Alex Smith against Iowa ran the ball 48 times for 199 yards he was held in check last week by Michigan he's the number three tailback for a reason but he's still a talented young man he certainly is an in the Iowa game when he ran 48 times he showed that he can be a workhorse there they go again Glover stopped after a gain about two yards on the play by Jim Nelson of the Nittany Lions number 45 the jewelry Indiana has a good rhythm with the nohuddle what's important now is that they got a block people at the line of scrimmage and be productive well relax the speed of an Alex Smith but they are not afraid to get to the football third and four three from the shotgun Greenlee at quarterback toss it over the middle to the big man and the coast incomplete in and out of the hands of Steve Lee and Erin College really laid a helmet to the chest of Steve Lee the Indiana for banner this is a catchable ball and when you've got third down situations you've got an opportunity to make a play right there Steve Lee has got to find a way to catch that ball and hang on to it when you catch the ball going over the middle you know there's gonna be contact sakowski to kick again his first punt aimed towards the left side went out of bounds just 25 yards down the field now push it to the other side taken by the short back at the 38 yard line Mike Archie the tailback just about a 10yard return first out of bounds just short of it field line that's a taos key not a big booming under but today he definitely has a different agenda and that is to try to keep it away from the very dangerous special teams guys at Penn State and there was really some question as to whether Allen said Kowski was going to be able to punt the day's game in last week's game he pulled a muscle in his hip it's good to see him out there because he has had a very successful season averaging 43 yards a punt coming into this game if they'll take away the distance today and let him try to move the football and put it in a placement situation if you will Penn State to go on the offense from the 46 yard line of the Indiana Hoosiers don't forget we've got a little bit of wind down in this football field today pressure on Richardson just throws it up watch out it'd be picked off over running the football defensively for Indiana number 31 Joey eels he tried to cut back but could not get his footing Wally Richardson doesn't nice job of getting rid of the ball before the pressure we see number 47 the linebacker mat surface coming on the Blitz as we talk with Joe Novak the defensive coordinator last night Mike he mentioned one of the things they were going to do is they were going to come with the Blitz early against Richardson to see if he could handle the pressure and what they wanted to do was come with four people from one side of the offensive formation second and ten Richardson shows play action now dumps it off into the flat slipping in front of number 47 mat surface the receiver number 40 Stephen Pitts the senior good call by Franny ganar the offensive coordinator first down Indiana comes with the Blitz they get pressure Penn State comes right back off of the playaction throwing the screen to their tailback Stephen Pitts one of the effective ways to try to control the pass rest of the defenses with the screen the other way is utilizing the draw play which Penn State will do as the game goes on loss of two brings up a third and 12 Richardson time dumps it over the intended receiver John Whitman the fullback in the flat as it will bring up the Penn State's hunting situation there you see the starting quarterback at the beginning of the year Chris Tinto stretching out and Greenlee with the hat on so we might see did on this next series for the Hoosiers what was interesting on that last play Mike is that Wally Richardson really didn't set his feet the way he wants to to throw the ball that's why the ball sailed on him because he didn't have the proper structure of the platform of his feet to get the good strong throw Conn are part of me Darrell Kenyatta punt for the first time this afternoon Oh driving punt taken at the 25yard line return to about the 34 yard line by Indiana's number 18 Eric's Smedley we do see Christine Oh first time this afternoon Eric did Oh the starting quarterback when we started the season for Indiana had missed the last two games Iowa and Michigan with a knee injury course he had the big game against Penn State one year ago and he will also run the nohuddle and start from the shotgun ditto over the middle complete reception made on the play by a John Lewis toner and a flag a late flag comes down on the football field starter faced to a first down a gain of 11 yards he probably got the yardage of play holds like what we've seen is a tremendous shift in field position you might remember Indiana took the last possession at their 20 they took this possession at the 35 yard line immediately get a completion plus the penalty they're already on the Penn State 40 now they work it again in the hurry up out to the flat complete again so coming out of the box Chris ditto has completed his first two passes Eric Matthews made the reception marked tape stopped him after a gain of seven Mike's so important for the Indiana offense but more important for that young man right there Chris did Oh to come out positive he's got tremendous ability to throw the football and he showed on his first two completions a lot of confidence in getting the ball thrown to his receivers Indiana on the move final minute of the first quarter here in Penn State Sean Glover the ball carrier he gets the Indiana first down this offense of Indiana been so injured all season long it is nice to see them potentially get some kind of rhythm going because it's hard coach when you don't have the personnel that you're used to in the football exactly Mike this is really the closest Indiana has come on their offensive line of scrimmage to having their first unit working together and we're seeing some movement against that Penn State defense from the gun 28 yard line State over the middle and he has got a lot of butchers used to help for the Penn State touchdown break block on the play by Clint Falls 76 yards on the return we're gonna get another look at it Chris ditto the interception is caused by the ball being thrown behind a JAMA stoner great job by columns of picking it up we mentioned the block by number 13 Clinton holes that really opened the door there's the block downfield by number 13 great block in 76 yards later Collins makes it 13 to nothing Conway to tie the school record for P ATS 70 consecutive P ATS for Fred Conway last play of the first quarter a big one for the Nittany Lions it is 14 nothing Penn State end of the first third interception of the year thrown by Chris ditto a costly one return to now officially 80 yards by Aaron College for the second Penn State score in the big story is Indiana now Falls to minus 13 in the turnover margin their 23rd turnover of the year Conway a good deep kick through the end zone it will come out too we'll start there offensively Chris did on the quarterback trying to regroup but this is the play coach then the replay we're gonna see his ditto makes the throw that he's gonna be behind the receiver he's got an open receiver and the ball was just thrown behind the net and as we talked to Bill Maori it is concerning about Chris that I'm not being real confident with this throws and when you're not confident you hold up just a little bit cause from the 20yard line and the football off to Shawn Glover he pushes with a strong arm now clubbers got room a gain of about 16 yards forced out of Bounce at the 36 yard line one of the important things that coaches have to do at this point in the game is settle your team down we saw when Chris Neto came off after the interception that Adam Greenlee as teammate was there the coaches were there you've got to settle your team down this football games got a lot of time left and they hit them moving the ball might like seven carry on the day for Glover this time from the shotgun ditto time intercepted use another Penn State interception Miller number 34 and that again just the poorly thrown football once again Mike the receiver is open as he was on the first interception this ball is overthrown sailing high once again that usually the basic reason for the ball being thrown high is the the footwork of the quarterback and there we saw at the end of the replay the offensive lineman actually had backed up into Chris Beddoes face causing that ball to go high look at the turnover margin I mentioned it earlier tend to take aways now 24 giveaways in 1995 near the bottom in division 1a and you will not win football games making mistakes like that fourth interception thrown on the season by Chris ditto who has not played in two and a half weeks 14 the nothing Penn State great field position 34 yard line of Indiana Richardson with all kinds of time looks towards Freddie Scott was he in bounce doll incomplete second attempt Brad Johnson with the coverage for the Hoosiers and Indiana has given up a bundle of points after the turnovers of course the last one returned for the touchdown that's a 7 pointer right there but Bill Mallory mentioned it now opponents converted 24 take away sin 273 points this season he said hey it's simple guys take away those 73 points and we are not doing 5 on 4 in the comp absolutely and that's true of any team in the country that struggles with big plays Mike heat you look at those half a dozen plays or so and see how it could just completely turn the season second intent now for Wally Richardson at the de Lyonne offense little delay to Mike Archie Archie has some quick blockers in a gain of nine from Mike Archie the ball carrier Mike I really like the play call on a Frank gana first play following the turnover they went for the touchdown that's a good call because oftentimes following a turnover defensive teams come on the field their heads are down their morale is not good and a lot of times they're not quite organized he comes right back after the drop back pass second down low Nino she's gonna get a pass rush loses the draw Lutz was third and one and give to the big man first down attention to his left hand and I'm throwing hand mic one of the things that jumps out about the Penn State offense is the balance that they achieved coming into this game they were the second rushing team in the Big Ten 231 yards a game they were number three in passing 233 yards two yards between two rushing in their passing down I formation for the Miffy Lions just outside the 20yard line son starting to come out here on Homecoming Saturday afternoon was injured mostly the stress fracture suffered in the preseason he's a senior Jabari Robinson do tree made the stop for Indiana in visiting yesterday with Joe Paterno the thing that this made him feel so good about Stephen coach has been his attitude as he got healthy and got back into the tailback race you had Mike Archie there he had Curtis Ennis there and Stephen was patient waiting for his opportunity and took advantage of it last week against Iowa now the pitch we spoke of inside the 10yard line another Penn State first down Steven Pitts the senior from Atlantic Highlands New Jersey gave us six yards on the carry as I mentioned coach stress factor right in the beginning of the preseason and he came out in a battle one two with my card she played the special teams never said anything about it finally broke through last week and Joe Paterno simply said couldn't happen to a nicer kid who has done such a great job of being a team and he really has taken his role as a special teams player and the other thing that was interesting is we asked coach Paterno why did he play him against Iowa he said I just felt after watching he practice that he had a hot hand it's the hot hand again to the outside pitch towards the end zone touchdown lion great leaf black by John Whitman Steven Pitts finds the endzone eight yard touchdown run Penn State leads 20 to nothing you gotta be impressed with the way Steven Fitz number 40 attacks through the line of scrimmage attacks the goal line he gets his shoulders turned down field we're gonna see a great block on number 45 by the fullback number 38 John wouldn't be clear the way for Pitts into the end zone or points coming off Indiana turnovers this is for the school record Brent Highway his 71st consecutive p80 that is now a Penn State Nittany Lion record congratulations to the young man Brett cot way the junior from lil born Georgia take a look at the touchdown run by Steven Pitts scampers over the left side Lions are in the control on on the touchdown run we see a great job by two wide receivers number 10 Bobby Engram number 31 Freddie Scott paving the way for Steven Pitts into the end zone it's enjoyable to watch outstanding receivers do more than simply catch the ball Wilkerson Andy limbs back deep to receive for Indiana taken at the 3 yard line I'm Joey eelain's number 31 he returns back to the 24 let's check down to the substrate one thing that's very obvious about this cry for Indiana they have gotta get some points on the board right now look at the add to the team they're not quite complaining with one another but they are getting a little bit discouraged down 21 21 to nothing on the road is not a good thing this team needs to get some points on this drive and the positive coming into today Kirk was the defensive play of the Indiana Hoosiers but being put in bad positions again as it's been all season long by their offense when you when you give up two touchdowns as a result of interception returns your defense hasn't been on the field to participate in any of the points scoring protection I'm Chris ditto goes the other way completes the pass up to the 27 yard line Steve lead try to scamper around Terry killings gets just a gait of a couple yards and remember the first Penn State turnover the first interception was returned so it wasn't even one that goes against the defense really the defense responsible for the first score that was the impressive drive that opened the football games actly and that's the thing that as Kirk mentioned coming into the ball game Indiana was doing a good job handling adversity but that you have to have some success after Wow and they do there Johnson makes a stop to Penn State but not until the conclusion to Eric Matthews for 13 yards of the first down we see a look of the Indiana quarterbacks on the sidelines signaling the plays in and this's the communication that the Indiana coaches used to get the plays from the sidelines to their quarterback once vitto gets the plays you can see on the field then he relays it to the rest of the offensive team from the forty first down hands of Todd and kids big hit by Brendan Noble taught engines kids the football and Penn State has come up with three turnovers already in the first half Penn State doing a real good job of getting pressure up the field got contact with ghetto just as he started to release the football we're going to see the pressure coming from number 92 Terry killings the ball pops up into the air and we've got our third turnover early in this football game they rule it a fumble not an interception watch again killings the man we talked about and his partner on the outside Todd Atkins come up big for the Nittany Lions go back with great field position football spotted on the 31 yard line playaction Richardson looking towards the sideline tended receiver let's check in at the studio with titty babe all right guys there's something entirely different we got a close game Michigan State Wisconsin was tossing up 7nothing Michigan State going for the time they get it Scott green inside big big pile scores they kicked the extra point it's a 7 7 game now back to ours Thank You Kenny now some of you may recall Penn State their two losses on the year one of those was here at Beaver Stadium to the Wisconsin Badgers their other of course to the Ohio State Buckeyes Penn State five and two they fumble the exchange flags all over the football field as Kirk mentioned at the beginning of the day those two losses coming at home consecutively never under Joe Paterno as Penn State lost three three straight here in State College there's so many superlatives still second down kick off the weekend right with ESPN's college football Thursday at 8 o'clock p.m. join Brad Nessler gary Danielson as they travel to Charlottesville Virginia where the 20th ranked Virginia Cavaliers look to stop Danny canal in the top ranked Florida State Seminoles it's Thursday 8 o'clock Eastern five o'clock Pacific on ESPN and there is the man who has been here for 46 years the last 30 as the head coach Joe Paterno the pitch back ball carrier Stephen Pitts met in the backfield nicely by Lewis Pinnock number 95 at the Indiana defensive unit Mike when we talk about Joe Paterno so many superlatives can be mentioned the fact that they haven't ever lost three consecutive games here in Beaver Stadium is an amazing accomplishment but when you look at his record he's won 274 games as the head coach seventy nine point two percent winning percentage just awesome loss of two on the last place so after the penalty it's now third and 17 Wally Richardson Richardson gets the protection again now he had a center kind of back off on him and he almost the interception Freddie's got the intended receiver but it went in and out of the hands of the junior Matt surfaced number 47 Indiana defense has certainly responded to the challenge of the turnover they come out and stop them and what they've got to do now is they've got to look for bright spots Mike and this is one here they've handed the ball over deep in their territory to Penn State their defense goes out and stops them and as Kurt mentioned now the offense has to generate something Darrell Kenyatta punt it away a little bit out of the range of Brett Conway so came here to try to pinch in the Indiana Hoosiers get signal for but that'll be a touchback in Indiana we'll come back to 20yard line 38yard punt for Tonya Penn State converting Indiana turnovers they leave 21 to nothing Chris did Oh to try to get it going again since he came in the football game three possessions ago interception four touchdown interception fumble this time the defense stands pad and it's 21 to nothing 1004 for six but the two picks the meaningful number on his statistical line thus far ifsta Glover he works around the right side clever gets a block and he's up in the air in Indiana first down that by Kim Herron the free safety number three it's so important Mike that Chris did Oh get his head up and be a leader in the huddle he's got a football team right now that needs a spark and as the quarterback that's your job you've got to be the leader you've got to be the guy that steps forward and provides the spark for your football team and Indiana has moved the ball Indiana uses the huddle that time Glover eight carries 52 yards on the afternoon is the lone setback for Mallory's team second intentions stutterstep Glover trying to find them all about to get very close to the first down yardage Gilardi the middle linebacker makes the stop for Penn State they do motion first down Indiana one of the important things for the Indiana coach's offense coordinator George Balu is it you go back to your game plan you came into this ball game feeling there were certain things you can do there were three or four runs that Indiana like they like the playaction pass and then they like Chris did Oh dropping back throwing the football go back to the things that you believed in suits again Sean Glover remember Glover a couple of weeks ago against Iowa 48 Terry's so he's a workhorse hit by Filardi a gain of six yards on the play as a workhorse Mike George Beaulieu who's the coordinator is also their offensive one coach and as we talked to him he said the impressive thing about Sean Glover is that he can run very tough between the tackles and this is something that he has done effectively early against this Penn State defense the offense has had to be revamped and revamped again this year for the Indiana Hoosiers of course as we mentioned at the top of the show Alex Smith still suffering from the broken ribs against Northwestern not in the lineup Michael bats the number two tailback out for the year with a blown out ditto with time and he completes the pass to Eric Matthews no they're gonna wave it incomplete trapping the football and Terry killings had good pressure on the quarterback I mentioned the offensive injuries Alex Smith still out of the line of these coach are the key offensive injuries Michael bats blows out the knee could be career threatening that was a practice injury Chris did Oh returns today after missing two and a half games Eric Matthews missed three games and out indefinitely Darren Ward and somebody we haven't talked about mana lopoliths the allstar kicker for the Hoosiers so many of their key skill players the guys that put points on the board and the other thing that does not show up when that graphic is that their offensive line has been patched together since early in their preseason practice from the shotgun third and three ditto over the middle first down yards goes to Sean Glover was made by number 47 Gerald Filardi my crispy dough looks comfortable in the shotgun what the shotgun does is the advantage to the quarterback it it puts him at the depth that he would normally have to drop back from the center that gives him a better look downfield at not only his receivers but of the coverage of the Penn State defense and dito has appeared very comfortable in that position early in the game clock running just over eight minutes remaining in the first half ditto works playaction ditto pressure on throws the football away and it hits the ground incomplete Aaron Collins came from his line back in position and got right in the face of Chris ditto one of the things that Mike Sandusky Jerry Sandusky the defensive coordinator for Penn State likes to do as he likes to bring one extra linebacker in pressure that time we saw Aaron Collins come from his linebacker position along for he then simply voids that zone in their coverage something that Jerry really likes the use as far as being able to get extra pressure on the quarterback brings up the second and ten from the 46yard line of indiana clever leftside clever with room works through the block we're going to have a face mask penalty and a flag on the play click balls and air and Colin's got there but working around the outside effectively Shawn Glover about the 49 yard line of Penn State so an indication of holding against the Hoosiers so it's going to come back only on the operatives 10 yards from the flag still second down the way they came after the ballcarrier Shan lover you thought bill Mallory might get a break of facemask call instead it has been that kind of year for bill Mallory a year in which he came in pretty much upbeat but Mallory is a competitor and his guys have responded you'll never see Bill Mallory hang his head and disgust and in a longterm situation he'll always be positive and his kids he told us all the coaching staff said through this period of adversity Bill Murray is one of the tough hardnosed coaches in the game he's out of the Miami of Ohio cradle of coaches influenced by people like Woody Hayes he's tough he's gonna give up Chris ditto will not get through the arms of Terry killings he got right into the line down lay kill interns the sack got right J sign flag on the play diddle potentially sacked little wait to call frustration for JSON on the replay we see number 92 Terry killings showing his athletic ability started with the outside rush and then he came on the inside move and simply hurtled the offensive tackle on his way to get to the quarterback that just adds insult to injury they marched the football back inside the Indiana 20yard line one of the things is so important for any athlete in a competitive situation when things are not going your way is to maintain your poise show frustration openly as the Indiana penalty showed right there third and 37 after the big loss the sand and the yardage tacked on if the a personal foul dumped and intercepted again they know just do it up for grabs and coming away with the football the up man Brad ski Olli third interception of the afternoon thrown by Chris ditto on a third and 37 like really not a good decision and so much of quarterbacking is decisionmaking if you don't have your receiver open throw the ball away or take the sack see here the pressure starts to come right there and he doesn't have a receiver open take the sack everyone might understand what is it defensive linemen like Brad ski Olli doing wearing number five he was a high school quarterback Mike got his first career interception Steven Pitts the ball carrier for Penn State stopped basically at the line of scrimmage three interceptions thrown by Chris did all four turnovers on the day by the Indiana Hoosiers we still have six minutes and fifty plus seconds to play in the first half Penn State looking to find the endzone once again and make it 28 to nothing one of the interesting things happen in college defensive selection is to get better athletes on the field we met we see number five Gretzky Olie as a high school quarterback and that is something that is so prevalent get more speed on the defensive field the 20 gifts to Mike Archie no playaction Richardson goes gross upon the Ingram and complete married Alan good coverage on the play for Indiana Ingram was open the ball just slightly overthrown but also Eric Allen was there really contesting for the football nice coverage by Alan Richardson as missed his last five pass attempts it's 21 to nothing and the big man Bobby Ingram has just one reception on the day it's good news for Penn State bad news for Indiana third and tenth Mangrum lined up on the far side and look true they give the football to copy Ingram on the reverse gets a block works his way up to the 11 yard line short ball of the first down yardage you want to get that guy involved in your office well Louis pinnock makes the stuff for Indiana you have receivers like Ingram Freddie Scott you mentioned the key get the ball in their hands and let those kind of people make plays in less than 1 they are going to go for it pardon me on 4th and watch Joe Paterno makes the decision to try to move the football ahead gain the first down yardage and try to get into the end zone fourth and one hits the ball carrier spins first down Penn State the second effort and the spin gets the first down yardage really a good running situation for Stephen Fitz and in 195 pounds he really has great body lean you see this beam you see the extra effort because initial contact came before he had picked up the first now former prep allamerican at just two carries in two years entering that Iowa game we mentioned earlier in which he came away with 284 allpurpose yards first and goal just inside the 10 yard line Mike Archie for Penn State and get the football to Archie's number two and he gets back to the initial management surface had good pressure on that run attempt by the Penn State Nittany Lions for Indiana Mason Davis number 98 was in the backfield real quick and actually forced Archie off of his intended running path with the football we've seen all three already this afternoon Mike Archie number two Steven pitch number 40 and Curtis eNOS number 39 the Penn State Nittany Lions here's number two Mike Archie one of the two seniors Freddie Scott goes into motion both wide receivers now on the left side they give it to the fullback John Whitman he pulls his way to the 7 a gain of 3 yards on the play Aaron Warneke makes the stop for Indiana Mike John Whitman is Penn State's leading scorer at this point in the season from his fullback position he doesn't get many opportunities out in the open field but when they get into the red zone he's the guy they go to he has scored nine touchdowns on the ground a 10th touchdown with a pass reception Whitman had a careerhigh three rushing touchdowns last week against Iowa he comes out of the game and Brian mill number 22 checks in to the fullback spot Mike Archie the tailback third and goal from the seven yard line for Penn State Richardson wolves right looking looking dumps it off Jensen to the big tight end and he stopped in the free yard line G all summer knocked out of bounds at the three by the Indiana defense and the fans want Joe putter go again but this will not happen they'll bring on Bret Conway for the field goal now Micah sweet seat Brett Conway come on the field you mentioned that he's from low burn Georgia we're gonna take a look here at the replay the naked bootleg by Wally Richardson he does a nice job of being patient waiting for his tight in all summer to come open 20 yard field goal attempt by Brett Conway missed from 34 earlier today Conway two of two on the air between ten and twenty nine yards and he makes his third three inside 30 innovation sparks 24 to nothing Penn State they capitalized on another high you turn 24 to nothing Penn State three minutes and 34 seconds remaining in the second quarter here on a homecoming Saturday afternoon a beautiful Beaver Stadium ninetyfour thousand plus and it other than for the Indiana faithful it's turned out to be a beautiful day for football here in State College Pennsylvania and certainly at this point everything is going in Penn State's favor there's two interesting contrast when this happens on the Penn State sideline your points have come relatively easy but can you really want to make sure that your football team doesn't move focus because they haven't had to work particularly hard over here on this Indiana sideline we've got to get the heads up coaches have got to find a way to get a spark and we've got three minutes and 34 seconds before the half hopefully as an Indiana coach you want to generate something before halftime bouncing kick in and through the end zone 20yard line greenly has his helmet back on but let's see who comes out for quarterback and it is Adam Green Lee back to quarterback the Indiana Hoosiers don't forget ESPN is your home for college football again next Saturday at 12:30 Illinois and Iowa the line at a Big Ten showdown then cfb primetime 7 o'clock Texas Tech takes on Texas in an interstate matchup catch all the action on the college game day and scoreboard shows college football next Saturday so Adam Greenlee back in the football game he was 3 for 4 for 20 yards played the first two series I believe I recall and then Chris diddle just having a rough afternoon with three and greenly first planful Terry Chili's least alocs on the play three killings getting into the backfield Mike it appeared that the mistake on the play was on Adam Green Lee's part the offensive line appeared to be blocking and we see on the replay they were blocking the wide zone that play to the left the tailback went that way and Greenlee just lost his focus his concentration on what play had been called model loss of four yards second and 14 second in 14 now lady Shawn Glover Glover with absolutely nowhere to go met by a couple of New Jersey's Anthony Cleary the freshman number 49 in amongst attackers Mike we saw the brief confrontation over on the sidelines something very uncharacteristic of a Penn State Cylon but coach Paterno upset it has fine defensive and Terry killings but you know in visiting with him he told us the role the head coach is to establish two things one is discipline and environment for discipline and an environment for a commitment to winning did credit killings with the sack his third of the day he's back in the football game and throwing under quick pressure was Adam Green Lee and man oh man that the defensive unit offense they come that time perhaps what Coach Paterno said to Terry killings on the sideline it clouded that whole defense because tremendous pressure that time on quarterback number six Adam Green Lee Ambrose Fletcher one of the guys with the pressure on that play now it'll be a punting situation from deep inside Indiana Territory cept aus key the kick with two minutes and 12 seconds to lots of time for Penn State to try to put another one in the end zone and a horrible kick does take a favorable Indiana bounce and it will roll out of Bounce at the 45 yard line of Penn State 36 yard punt obviously no return sakowski way below his average today that's for sure don't forget the GMAC halftime report coming up next Suzy Kolber in our studios she'll have our part of me Kenny main in the studios we'll have all the action from today's college football and much more on the GMAC halftime report they'll Mallory's team in search of their first victory in the big ten they have lost four straight all of those in the conference last year they struggled at the end of the season losing four of their last five games but they did win the important one to the Indiana faithful and that is against Purdue the old oaken bucket in the bragging rights exactly but right now coach Mallory's faults are a long way from anything he can did the spark his football team he told us they had a great week of preparation the summer they had 44 their top forty five guys all in tamp everything seemed to be you know all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place for a big season then all of a sudden the injury bug the worst that Mallory has ever seen in his career nonetheless they're in a big hole here at Penn State trailing 24 to nothing turnovers the story and John Whitman gets the pass really a nice job by middle linebacker number 45 Jamie Beasley seeing the screen they were in in a blitz main coverage that was his man nice job was making the play the football squirts free on a second in the lemon play for Taylor number 99 the sophomore got the pressure timeout called by one minute and 28 seconds left in the first half in a third one earlier we will take the break with 1:28 remaining in the half back to Penn State Mike Goldberg Bill Lewis 24 nothing Nittany Lions there on the fence third and long situation Richardson with time throws towards Bobby Engram goes into play Penn State will have to punt the football with 123 on the clock Big Ten standings look like this as the Northwestern Wildcats of course enjoying a great season Ohio State at three and oh seven and OH overall but the story here is you take a look at the numbers down through the conference Northwestern trailing in Illinois right now mid point of the second quarter 14 to 3 next week Penn State is at Northwestern and then the Nittany Lions host Michigan and then finish their season at Michigan State so big matchup next week in the big 10 Northwestern and Penn State and then Penn State a big one the next week home so Penn State season really rides on the next couple of weeks and the big matchups in the Big Ten Conference play take it at the 22 yard line all right Derrick's medleys medleys returned back to about 35 a return of 13 yards after a 39yard kick 13 left oh you're thinking the same thing I am you gotta try to generate some collectible minute my phone column is always to be aggressive you're only gonna have so many offensive snaps in the game and you can't afford to waste any I don't believe you're you're reckless in your play Colin I certainly don't think you're careless but I think you always need to be aggressive in that situation look at those numbers and this is a good starting spot for the Indiana Hoosiers today I'm green Lee again at quarterback over the middle behind his intended receiver Eric Matthews and Brandon noble got a hand on the football now if Noble comes away with that one that's a highlight reel play for sure exactly because he's one of their interior defensive linemen an interesting situation he dropped off in the coverage one of the things that defenses will do to try to take away the shallow crossing Ratan as we saw on the replay what the quarterback has to do is he has to allow that receiver to clear that defender and then he'd have a window to throw it second intent green Lee from the shotgun throw is incomplete but it goes incomplete now with the good coverage on the play by click holes the hero gasps was intended for Shawn Glover we're gonna see on the replay number 13 twit holes the hero strong saftey sitting on that shirt inside route and a very aggressive break to the football one of the things that you want your past offenders to do is when the ball is in the air to break on that football and go through the receiver to get it that's what knows it third in ten four wideouts through the Indiana Hoosiers Greenlee works the Honda the pressure now dumps it off just below the line of scrimmage it's gonna be close to the first down yardage rich Kearney made the reception for the losers a gain of 11 and a first down for Indiana 57 seconds remaining in the half as they have moved the chains what is interesting here Mike is that they're not going from there no huddle offense because this is when typically teams will do it when they're inside that twominute party four wideouts again Glover the lone setback from the shotgun Adam Green Lee in and relief of Trista Doe now Greenlee completes it the pass reception made by a John Stone Gerald filari the linebacker had the pressure a gain of five yards on the play clock continues to run of 42 seconds left inside Penn State Territory now Greenland weights pumps and throws it through the hands of Dorian Wilkerson number eight coaches talk about making clay as the importance of making plays and it's what you stress on the practice field to practice at a fullspeed tempo might practice making play so we get in that situation the game you've practiced it over and over again we've seen several times in this first half where the Indiana receivers have had catchable balls they simply have not held on to the football don't forget the GMAC halftime report forthcoming with Kenny main dumped off into the flat Shawn Glover Glover tried to avoid the wouldbe tackler cannot do so open field tackle made on the play mark tape number 33 it'll be a fourth and floor from the 48 Malory with the final seconds ticking away we'll go for it clock moving with now ten seconds remaining in the first half we scampering nearside Greenlee keeps it himself he is close to the first down be the last play of the first half nonetheless Aaron Collins makes the stop truly the story in the first 30 minutes Penn State scored 17 points of Indiana's for turns we are at the half very hard kick off and it will be Adam Greenlee at quarterback now if you joined us late coach let's set the story Indiana has played two quarterbacks denno has been out the last two weeks due to a knee injury Greenlee started the game but denno came in on the third series denno has thrown three interceptions Greenlee back in the football game now for valor exactly and and what I think we might see is they might start the second half as if it was the start of the ball game put Greenlee back on the field and then go with Kristine Oh as you did at the start of the ball game the ball well as Kirk alluded to it goes incomplete on the first pass attempt flint holes on the coverage of the big tight end Ben fuss Meyer the soft green he really makes a good throw to that tie it in down the middle and it's been one of her the things that the Penn State defense has struggled with we get an aggressive play by the strong safety their hero number 13 Clint holes that's his second pass break up of the day Springs Church Pennsylvania shoulder surgery in the offseason early they're not a hundred percent now he is and so is this man Shawn Glover the one healthy tailback from Mallory's team goes around the outside meant by mark Tate after a gain of seven like Kirk Herbstreit made a point when we went to him before the start of the half that Indiana is averaging nine yards per rush against this Penn State team and these are the things that they've got a really stresses this second half gets underway now is the second half gets underway weather has deteriorated a bit here in the State College Pennsylvania a little bit of rain and the jackets have come out to the faithful but what a beautiful sight it is Beaver Stadium 94,000 plus on Homecoming afternoon third and three for Indiana greenly under pressure only number five and it's helpful marked eight on the play Penn State on a third down situation came with the Blitz we see their linebackers coming into the picture number 44 Jim Nelson good job by the secondary in mantoman situation causing Greenlee not to have anyone to throw to and another punting situation for Allen stukowski this time he gets away a booming punt that bounces inside the 20 yard line picked up by Bobby Engram at the 12 angle scampers back still on his feet out to the 32 yard line 64 yard punt 20yard return as scott stevens made the special teams play what a kick hearing and watch the job Bobby Engram turns and then a dead sprint simply can't catch up for the football one of the things that happens when you kick a ball 64 yards is you truly do out kick your coverage it doesn't give them an opportunity to get down it doesn't give them the opportunity to fill the lanes Ingram took advantage of that with the return by at receiving day for Bobby Engram the most prolific passer in Penn State history they give the football to number two Mike Archie Archie works around in for the first down chase from behind by Eric Smedley a gain of 12 yards on the play Penn State really playing well for second at this echo they certainly are those are staggering numbers an 80 point differential in their second half scoring their first half stats which we don't show the outscored their opponents by only four points so this is going to be critical for the Indiana defense to respond to the challenge that Penn State has put on their opponents in the second either they've had three fourthquarter comebacks this year they won't need one today at least we don't think so at this point John Whitman pulls his way up ahead past the 50 yard line good second effort by John Whitman for the gain of six one of the things early in the second half it appears that Joe Paterno and Frank gain or their offensive coordinator and a halftime sit to that big line of scrimmage we're coming back to you we're going to try to go back and reestablish a couple basic things on the ground and that's what they've done in this first possession is Kirk alluded to maternal not truly pleased with the offensive efforts I like I think he'd like to see a drive very much like the way they opened up football game coach that we talked about where they just thought if Lee gave the defense a chance to stop them and then just rammed it down their throat left side Archy inside the 25yard line forced out of Oz by Aaron Warren at the 28yard playing for my cart see the tail man this is the first time in the game that we have seen the counter gap play watch number 50 Jeff Harding's on the pole and doing a great job of creating the hole run by arches Archy the big gainer now seven carries 67 yards on the play football spotted at the 22 yard line of Indiana first and 10 Stephen Pitts to the 15yard line a gain of seven we need to recognize the man you spoke of a moment ago coach Jeff Harding's number 50 on All American one year ago his 27th straight start earlier this week he was the recipient of the National Football Foundation scholar athlete award that is about as prestigious and academic honors a football player can get absolutely a scholar athlete can't receive anything higher than the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame Scholar Athlete Jeff Hardy's in for a treat they have a banquet in New York City honoring those groups in early december gary by the big man again John Harding's with a 3.28 grade point average and he is in the description of his coaches the prototypical collegiate student athlete performs well works hard in the weight room and finds the energy and time to continue to get great grades this kid will be a success in whatever he chooses to do in the future absolutely he's a marketing major and he's going to have an opportunity to market himself I think play and escape at a higher level but you know friend gainer told us yesterday Mike that he is the role model for all of the young players in the Penn State program first and ten just outside the ten yard line of Indiana opening series for Penn State here in the second half Richardson under pressure good performance by Matt surfaces he broke through Richardson was looking for the cricket Jason Taylor was there to help and Matt surface a guy who's played well today for Indiana jono back there coordinator has told us that Matt service is the big play guy they brought him on the inside blitz Richardson was looking for Bobby Engram on the quick slant I think he had he just was not able to get rid of the football he noticed the cast on the left hand surface playing with a broken thumb that he suffered last week he came out of that ball game when he broke the thumb for just a short period of time and Joe Novak said he's one of the real tough hardnosed players on the field he's out playing a heck of a game today loss of six second and 16 from the 17 towards the end zone incomplete keep all summer the tight in the intended receiver coverage on the play by Erin Warnecke we're gonna sleep pressure coming from the backside from number 98 Nathan Davis who already has five sacks and he really was the guy that forced Richardson to slow that ball just a little bit before he wanted to because his tight in big number 87 all summer was working open in this in the end zone Warneke the leading tackler coming in just a sophomore from Farrell in Indiana brings up a third and 16 situation for the Nittany Lions again from the 17 yard line rolling left Richardson lucky and his own town Bobby Engram this is gonna be enjoyable to watch Bobby Engram up top watching turned his defender round he gives him a good hard move into the post came back to the corner what makes that so effective is the great timing on the part of the quarterback Wiley Richardson he made his great Richardson had the ball throw Monzon touchdown Penn State to recordholders coach 28 career touchdown reception for Bobby Engram of course Brett Conway with three now for P 80s today 72 consecutive P ATS also a school record Bobby Engram the most prolific receiver in Penn State history makes the score 31 to nothing ESPN's whose college football is brought to you by DIRECTV introducing personalized TV welcome you back to State College Pennsylvania the 76 homecoming for the Nittany Lions and they have 131 of their last 34 they're in control leading 31 to nothing over the Indiana Hoosiers from the end zone taken by number three Eric Matthews and put special teams coverage on the play by the Nittany Lions Bobby Engram 28 career touchdown receptions just broke the school record a couple of weeks ago coach and the man that whose record he broke is wide receiver coach Kenny Jackson his own Co so I'm sure they have a lot of fun with that we see coach Jackson on the sideline there with the navy windbreaker and just a neat story to have a great receiver come back to his alma mater join the coaching staff and then have his his prize people break his record the reception's leader against Wisconsin earlier this year number two in the Big Ten ball carrier Shawn Glover for Indiana met by Mark T to Penn State getting back to coach Kenny Jackson Kenny was part of Penn State's first national championship team in 1982 and then when all inhibit an eight year career in the National Football League with both the Philadelphia Eagles and the Houston Oilers so he's got a Bobby Ingram has got a great teacher and someone that he can look to say hey this guy knows what it's all about at this level and at the level in the NFL gain of four by Glover second and six for Indiana way action pressure on Graeme Lee elutes the rush takes a late hit throws the football away Brandon no Bo got a hit on Adam Greenlee but he released the ball just before noble was able to get to him we're going to see the pressure by the Penn State defense number five ski Olli really forces Greenlee out of the area that he wants to throw the ball 93 Brandon Noble with the foot speed the clothes on him but one thing Adam Greenlee did is made a good decision and throwing the ball way to avoid the the turnover that it's just plagued on in the first half of this game third down greenly would pick up black Mike Glover throws it in and through the hands of his intended receiver we've got a late flag on the plate Jim Nelson defensively for Penn State defended Dorian Wilkerson very well may have done it a bit too well though under the events we'll see on the replay I'm a good call on the part of the officials and the the rule in the game of college football when the ball is in the air you cannot make contact with the receiver before the ball gets to the catching point of the receiver very clearly Nelson had contact before that point thirtysix Cory Carlson being attended to by the training staff of a ninja lions inside linebackers a lot of special teams action so the first down after the pass interference Greenlee going to the far side looking towards receiver which Tierney it goes incomplete Brian Miller on the coverage the outstanding defensive back in the country is reward at the Jim Thorpe Award each year in college football Brian Miller who's just five foot nine 183 pounds has been a twoyear starter just the junior as a finalist for that award we've seen him he made one of the earlier interceptions today and that was a tremendous job on that last play of the coverage number one in the Big Ten one year ago again this season in pass breakups second in ten down up the middle it's a decently block to the 31yard line tere Killins credited for the tackle lover now 15 carries 82 yards on the day like one of the things that we have seen in college football in the part of defensive staffs is to try to get as much foot speed on the field as you possibly can to do that we're seeing smaller defensive backs and as we talked to Jerry Sandusky we talked about is he concerned that Brian Miller's just 590 says no because he's got the foot speed of the cover receivers any games last year away found on the play try to just dump it off to the man we spoke of earlier and that's number 33 Shawn Glover it appears that Adam Greenlee loses his footing as he went back his left foot just slipped went out from under II it's important that he doesn't just throw that ball on up in the air and give the Penn State defenders an opportunity to get their hands on tickets block by Terry killings he's got the football at the 9 yard line working towards the endzone did he get in yes touchdown Penn State if it can go wrong this year for Indiana it will and today it has opportunistic Penn State team and we talked about foot speed the defensive line of scrimmage at Penn State when you look at them physically they are not big overpowering people but they all run well Terry kilims a linebacker before he came to Penn State and we're going to see that he avoids the block of number 27 and then has the foot speed to close on the punter the awareness to come over take time to bend down pick the ball up and advance it in for the touchdown the p80 by Conway is up and good the last time Penn State blocked the punt for touchdown was last year Brian Miller did it against Iowa and now it's Terry Chile's a couple of sacks and now 638 to nothing our score thirty eight points on the scoreboard for the Penn State Nittany Lions 14 of them just two touchdowns on but we'll call normal offensive production the rest points off the turnovers and interception return for a TV and now a blocked punt for touchdown by Terry killings and again Conway kicks off Dorian Wilkerson will stay right in the end zone and we will send it to Kenny made on Kansas here it's Matt Miller and a quarterback lobs it out to the corner Mitch running he is running he's catching he's scoring that went for two and then made it and Kansas State leading this thing now twenty four to seven back to you guys Thank You Kenny there you see number 92 Terry killings busy day for the young man five tackles three sacks a block punt for touchdown and he forced a fumble those are good numbers they certainly are from the 20 yard line Indiana offensively again back to quarterback as Chris did oh he hands off to Shawn Glover Glover goes around the right side for Game five by Gerald Palardy the middle linebackers a helmet it's the turf Tim herring was it to help out Mike earlier in the ballgame we had a shot of Coach Paterno on the sidelines with Terry tailings he was obviously pleased with something and what is real good to see is the cage was able to take that a very aggressive criticism of his head coach respond to it and come back with those numbers that you pointed out just minute ago certainly has been the Indiana miscues that have turned into a pretty casual day for Joe Paterno and company ditto to pass over the middle complete that's the biggest completion of the day by Chris ditto the Penn State defense has struggled covering the tight end during the season earlier in the season Rutgers had a big day get the ball to their tight end and then last week in their game against Iowa the Mohawk guys went to their tight end on several occasions 17yard gain the reception made by Kirti could three on the depth chart of the tight end position you see the defensive coordinator jerry sandusky of the Nittany Lions from the 42 Glover on the left side Glover working to the outside avoids a wouldbe tackler hits the midfield flag on the fly at Dean of a taught Atkins made the stop for Penn State let's watch the wide receiver on a wide receiver blocks back in toward the football he must keep the block above the waist real good call by the field judge and a big penalty this the second time in the game second time in the game Mike that Indiana has had positive yardage on the corner only to have a wide receiver penalized earlier in the game a holding penalty nullified a nine yard gain and then we see the illegal block here see similar scores from around the nation first and 22 for the Indiana Hoosiers ball moves all the way back to nearly their 30yard line 6:45 remaining in the third quarter ditto with treasurer Terry killings who else six sack of the day by Penn State this time my Penn State gifts this the sack off of the Blitz we're gonna see the fourman pressure coming from the weak side number 33 Shawn Glover the tailback was not quick enough to be able to come back and block that fourth rusher coming off the edge and hence number 92 Terry killings again he runs so well and has such closing speed to the quarterback now at second and 31 fourth sack of the day for killings the defense was alive last week against Iowa they had eight sacks against the Hawkeye's second and 31 dito time over the middle Glover lover back to the 31 yard line a gain of 12 on the play demon Troy tied him up the decision by Chris did oh he was looking for the deep crossing realm in behind the linebackers the linebackers because of the ballon distance got the deep drop he went back in front of them good decision on his part Glover came in with 19 receptions on the years you can see dental not afraid to dump it off to his tailback he joined a slate Alex Smith out of the lineup Michael bats is 2 for the year that's why you see that man number 33 Shawn Glover third and 20 stepping up just got it away complete for the first down long completion made on the play by damien matthews number two 22 yard game and an indiana first down I'm gonna see the great job on the replay here of the wide receiver working to get open coming down into the secondary under tremendous pressure ditto does a good job of stepping up and finding the receiver in the scene indepence tape territory football on the 46 yard line to the up back in a good gain on the play by Steve Lee it's it to about the 46 yards on the first down Terry Aaron Collins made the stop for the Penn State defensive unit Mike so impressed with this speed of the front for for Penn State they run like linebackers and that's what you try to do you try to take line back the count of players and put take those big strong safety tonic defensive backs and put them at linebacker to get more speed on the field eighth play of the drive started at the Indiana 20yard line Glover hits the gain of four yards needed and another Indiana first down let's check down in the sidelines with Kirk Herbstreit Kirk what you got well Mike a coach Rose I'll tell you what is very important although this game is an erase 38 to nothing in favor of Penn State very important for quarterback Chris ditto I had a chance to talk to him this morning he's lacking a little bit of confidence I know he's had a sprained knee but even if he was healthy you might have seen a quarterback swished Adam Greenlee this is important for the remainder of this quarter in the fourth quarter for Chris ditto to gain some confidence the remainder this season where's Kirkwood know about that because he always had the confidence during his days at Ohio State never any turmoil of his career right ditto over the middle and it goes complete Kirk of course he talked to us about that yesterday that Chris did know he could just Kirk his another quarterback could see in Indy nose way he was throwing he wasn't zipping the ball and you guys talked about it one of the things that's important in Kirk has such a feel because he played at Ohio State and he played just a couple years ago you can't play quarterback without being a very self confident person not to the point of being cocky but you have to have confidence that you can get that ball in between linebackers in front of defensive backs if you don't have it you hold off your tentative with your throws second and six now here's ditto with time pumps and now the pressure will get to him as he was hauled down by Todd Atkins number 58 with helped by Pratt Scioli number five most of the pressure throughout the season from the Penn State defense has come from their outside rushers number 58 Todd Atkins we see here one of the great attributes of a pass rusher is that you never stop you have to be relentless and pressuring the quarterback you can't get to him around the corner as we saw Atkins came back and worked back to the inside for that set dito is four for four on the drive now on third and four they hand the football to Sean Glover he pulls his way up for another first down Kandee main back in the studio all right update here on response in the Michigan State Wisconsin starting to pull away Darrell Bevell from one yard lobs it out there Toni Simmons touchdown and mission was Thompson's pulled away now 31 to 7 over Michigan State Mike back to you so Barry Alvarez is Badgers in control and so are the Penn State Nittany Lions but Indiana putting together an impressive Drive Glover has now rushed for 100 yards on the day first and ten from the 23 yard line Glover again and this time he's wrapped up by marked a good defensive play by tape number 33 the junior from Erie Pennsylvania marked marked eight is a cornerback and on that particular play Jerry Sandusky had his corner on a corner fire stunt bring him on a blitz marked eight does a nice job of seeing the ball away from him and taking the proper angle to make the place on the backside State sprained a knee against Ohio State last year and missed basically the remainder of the season he's starting to reassert himself defensively in a full season to play this year Indiana impressive drive 13th play ditto from the gun looks over the middle and he goes complete again this time to Eric Matthews ditto looks like the quarterback as advertised in the media guide at the beginning of the season very poised very stereotypical in his dropback style on this Drive does a nice job here anything achievable in the shotgun position does a good job of finding that throwing Lane between linebackers defined number three Eric Matthews coming on the crossing route a gain of 10 and another India and a first down they have the football at the Penn State's 12 i formation set up two wide receivers flank to the right side they give it to the up back that's Steve Lee he fumbles the football still we'll see if they yep they whistled it down the football was still free it would have been belonging to Penn State but I whistle came early and I think in the end it's gonna finally catch a break and if that whistle doesn't come early that's a touchdown because the hero back clean holes had that ball scooped and he was headed for the end zone we'll see on the replay just where the ball that's a fumble oh yeah that is a fumble and a real poor call on the part of the efficient the ball is clearly on the ground what happens to officials and we can really beat them up as they sometimes lose sight of just when the ball came out second and seven from the nine and Glover slips it's interesting to note that on this season opponents in the red zone against the Penn State Nittany Lions are perfect now you wouldn't think a team like Penn State impressive defensive history over the years would have not been able to stop their opponent inside the red zone this year if they have none into the corner they'll try to stop Indiana when we return for the fourth the Nittany Lions in control on the deuce Penn State has never lost three straight at home and they held Indiana scoreless in the third quarter again in the third quarter has been the Achilles heel for this football team it certainly has you take the combination of their turnovers and then you look going into their game last week against Michigan they had scored just one touchdown in the fourth quarter while their opponents were scoring 59 points maybe they can hit white on the first play of the fourth third and eight there you see the numbers Penn State defense in the red zone I mentioned earlier from the tendon guard line of the Lions movement at the line flag on the play ditto Jerald Filardi came away with the football but the flag was thrown well before the pass was tossed by Chris ditto he's been picked already three times today but there was definite movement on the line coach definite movement on the line of scrimmage the Indiana Center against snapping the ball appeared that Brad ski Olli was in the neutral zone let's look on the replay and I think what we're going to see is a situation where Christian oh just does not have a throwing Lane there's there's windows where receivers come open behind linebackers hey Chris did oh just held on to the ball his receiver was working into an open window that's what separates the levels of quarterback is your ability to see and have a the Olli was indeed the recipient in the flanks of Penn State gives Indiana break it is now third and free from the five lover second effort he is going to be very close to the first down its forward progress was close to the market coach it's going to depend on the spot Falls and herring combined to make the tackle if the marker on the far sideline is accurate it appears that he's going to be about a half a yard short coming to measure whoever does a nice job of making people miss he actually avoided that plate being a negative play there was penetration in the backfield good body control just got the first down this offensive bill Malory's has had no production this year averaging just fifteen point four points a game Indiana has scored over 20 points with only two games this season they're looking for their first points of this afternoon and we are in the fourth quarter the fifteen points game Mike is 11th in the Big Ten last in that category first and goal for Indiana Glover stopped at the one Terri Killins the senior along with Gerald Filardi on the stop Penn State on the defense really controlling the line of scrimmage one thing you notice is that there was no movement at the line of scrimmage Bilal and Gerald Filardi freedom to scrape from his linebacker position to make the good hit on Sean Glover from the oneyard line Glover again touchdown Indiana Shawn Glover goes over the top cook lead blocked by the fullback Steve Lee and the Hoosiers finally find the endzone Mike I want to go back to the comment that Kurt made from the sidelines at the start of this Drive it was important for the confidence of quarterback Chris ditto equally as important is the confident level of the Indiana fence and they did it against the first team defense of Penn State on the replay they have managed to get enough movement and they got that big fullback Steve Lee up on the linebacker Filardi that time allowing Glover to go over the top for the score well horn in for the injured bill Monell appleís gets the point after the touchdown by Sean Glover just the 13th of the Year by the Hoosiers Canon 15 ditto working pressure from the backside footballs on the turf Penn State has it another turnover Chris Snyder the football was recovered by Brad Johnson at number 17 like if you're gonna pressure the quarterback in college football the pressure has to come from the perimeter that's where it starts we all day we saw that kids we saw killings and again from that same position this is Todd Akin's backup number 91 Chris Snyder is able to get that pressure off the edge and then he has the ability to run and close to the quarterback when he scrambled away eighth sack of the game by Penn State that equals their total of a year of a week ago against Iowa five Indiana turnovers McCreery hands the football off enos hint in the backfield by Indiana's number 99 Jason Taylor that was the man who caused the fumble Chris Schneider the defensive end number 91 good homecoming for that young man certainly a happy time he's got to feel good because as we looked and studied the Penn State defense one of the things we all commented we talked to Jerry Sandusky they've not played many people they've basically been on the Levin man unit so when you get a chance to get those backup people in it's important to your team important to those young people very trying to go up top receiver reception mates going to be a touchdown Penn State jojje are vicious a 55 yard touchdown reception from the backup quarterback Mike McCreary these are the situations like that are talked about as you stop trying to put points on the board by throwing the ball my personal feeling is you got your backup quarterback in the game you've got to give him the chance to throw the football because if he has to come into a critical situation he's going to have that experience we saw on that replay the tremendous job that Jerry Vicious does with the ball in the air of leaving his feet going up in the air out jumping the defensive back for the ball and for the touchdown another turnover that turns into Penn State points the place kicker Mike barn &amp; gert makes the p80 another Indiana miscue leads to what is turned into a big Penn State lead JD clever to say that's just the great part of the college that people can go and have fun there's all kind of ways to have fun like there's no question about it and the youngster having fun running the football working around the outside again that is Chris M Burley number 23 on the carry a gain of 13 yards on the play now Indiana's worst season in quite some time was four and seven when they were that way in 1985 they'll fall to two and six on the air remaining games against Michigan State at home at Ohio State and the oaken bucket game played this year in Bloomington against Purdue with the football now the left side of the field and Penn State moves ahead the ballcarrier the miscues truly the story if you joined us late Indiana turn the football over five times they turned it over a lot in the first half coach and that is what put the Penn State Nittany Lions in control of this there's the whole story in that bottom line 31 Penn State points as a result of the turnovers it's nearly impossible to win a football game don't care how good you are you can't overcome those kind of numbers and state working with just over three minutes remaining in the football game Bob carrier for eternal Steve now remember we told you earlier that Indiana one of the nation's worst in turnover margin they came into today a minus 12 with the five turnovers Penn State not committing any they will fall to minus 17 on the year last year Indiana was plus eight we asked bill Mallory about that last night Mike Gill woman have they tried to do anything about it he says you know we're the same coaching staff coaching the same ways some years you avoid the turnovers other years you have it this year the floodgates of open never leave the ball carrier for Penn State again approaching two minutes remaining Mike Balu made the stop number 48 for Indiana Mike to put that statistic in perspective there are 108 division 1 teams in college football coming into the game Indiana was 115 the turnover margin they might find themselves after this at the bottom of that stat the bottom of that group third quarterback in the game for the Nittany Lions number four dog astrouski fourth and two they pitched the football to Curtiss eNOS and he has stopped behind the line of scrimmage to play made by Aaron Williams number 87 Indiana takes over on downs the clock stopped with 151 remaining if you joined us late Aaron Collins an 80 yard return of an interception for touchdown made it 14 to nothing after Curtis eNOS capped off an impressive Drive in the first quarter hits a taint yarder after an Indiana turnover and then a twenty four nothing lead at the half after a field goal by Brett Conway who broke the fence state record by the way four consecutive pa T's he needed two on the day he had more than that seventy plus consecutive P ATS Chris ditto intercepted three times the lone bright spot has been that man who made the reception for Indiana offensively and that is Shawn globe qionghua ver is as we mentioned is over 150 yards rushing he's caught the ball coming out of the backfield and he has competed with this Penn State football team and that's what's so impressive under a minute 30 remaining now tittle throws it into the flat and it's caught by Aaron by Eric Matthews don't forget this is just game one of two on ESPN to Elizabeth City State College against Hampton University that is forthcoming immediately following our telecast from the gun again football spotted on the 48 they go to Matthews if he gets out of bounds at the 42 it has to be so frustrating to the Indiana coaches when they look at the last two plays you see Chris ditto stand on the pocket a lot of confidence he makes two good throws throwing the ball on outside brows to the sidelines the other banks can't make those throws he can but he kit just doesn't have the consistency of doing a play after play series after series the gun and seconded for to a very busy Eric Matthews it's nice to see Matthews back in the lineup it obviously this is much too little too late and how about Joe Paterno he will get victory number 275 this afternoon in his illustrious 30year coaching career as the head coach here at Penn State one of the real Giants of the coaching profession you look at him he's fourth on the alltime list of career victories and there's three pretty impressive names in front of him and those three guys as you see behind in the amount of teams it took them to acquire career victory number 275 one of the the things that is so impressive when you have an opportunity to visit with Coach Paterno is through the 46 years at Penn State 30s in head coach the man doesn't lose his enthusiasm he has the same enthusiasm that he's had through his whole career here and it's just it almost seems like it's ageless and timeless football coaches undoubtedly Dino throws to the flat Matthews makes the reception you and I found out a great story when we knew part of it but 14 million dollars going into a new library and part of that's going to be greatly due to the efforts of Joe Paterno Joe Paterno has been very active a part of that group as a matter of fact when we met with him yesterday he had just come from a meeting with the library committee and they have raised 14 million and I believe that when the the new wing is completed in two years they're gonna name it after that man right there and thusly they should from the gun did oh I'd say just fourteen Frey just marked it down with the football sports free out of the arms of Matthews I think Indiana's going to retain possession though he came in yesterday very busy but very very accommodating to our needs an injoke Paterno when he sits and talks he talks in that quiet voice and you just want to listen to what he says and it doesn't matter because not all he talks about is football and that's the refreshing thing about this man well what what he has done for not only Penn State was for college football is he has stood for academic integrity when you when you look at his goals when you look at what they accomplished the number one thing which they never sign up Big Ten championships national championships as they are going to give their young people an opportunity the seconddate Dorian Wilkerson a 13yard reception to the 5yard line it's undoubtedly not the number one unit defensively of Penn State just another Saturday afternoon for Joe Paterno because he will be the first one to mention that doesn't matter if it's number 275 what's important as we got the job done we take it a week closer we're still have our sights set on the Citrus Bowl and get that two spot in the Big Ten Conference absolutely and seeing them today you get the feeling that this Penn State football team is improving each week they finally I think it's settled down defensive that Nick what Jerry Sandusky do at the urging of Coach Paterno let's make it simple when you're struggling on defense and they were struggling a little bit and coach Paterno you shared that with us we've got to cut down what we're trying to do in defense let's not have our guys confused let's not have you thinking defenses recognition reaction let's turn him loose I think Jerry Sandusky did that today as a result was a very solid effort on the part of the Penn State defense Indiana has the first engulf of the five forthcoming to think for curb Street for his contributions of course on the big tent tour he's been with us all season long what he talked about what quarterbacks Chris did will be something we look for today and on this drive even though it's in the final minutes of the game against the second unit weeks to come ditto from the five throws it touchdown Indiana so Chris ditto uses Eric Matthews with frequency in Indiana gets their second touchdown of the afternoon Mike what's going to be important about the offensive production and about Chris vidoes performance is that when they go back in will competitive situation two weeks from now they go with Alex Smith back in the backfield they have found that Shawn Glover can be productive at the tailback they'll go in with two productive tail backs and a quarterback coming out of this game with some real positive things that hang his hat on will horn with the point after for Indiana it's 45 to 1440 pardon me now 37 seconds remaining in the game after the p80 Chris did Oh impressive Drive Elizabeth City State College Hampton University Jerry punch mike Mayock standing violet coming up next this is the third touchdown pass this season thrown by an Indiana quarterback ditto finishes the day 19 of 26 178 yards one touchdown three interceptions the other two tosses went to stoner they have really struggled to make this happen what we're going to see is to get the ball in the end zone by anyway especially with their pass offense one of the other things Mike that I think that comes out of this fourth quarter performance of Chris dedos I think you find out the true character of people when they go through at first situations Chris ditto couldn't have had a tougher start to a ball game but he had the makeup to come back in the fourth quarter and I think those are the things that stand out in situations like this and I think these are the things that build Mauer and his staff will go back and build on for the rest of their Big Ten season thanks to that drive Matthews 11 receptions 104 yards and that touchdown so he'll end up with decent numbers at least when he opened a newspaper in the morning he came in with just 10 catches on the season so he stayed quite an afternoon for himself on sidekick Freddie Scott couldn't handle it took a big hit we'll see who came away with a football Indiana has the football so they stay on the offense with 30 seconds 37 seconds remaining and that'll give ditto a chance to add to the numbers espn2 has all the college football action at 12 noon Baylor next Saturday looked to tackle the Miami Hurricanes that game to be played in the Orange Bowl seven o'clock Eddie George leads Ohio State into Minnesota put a period on the day next Saturday with sports night won't you ditto from the shotgun lots of time throws it up Matthew sprung free for a moment but he was underthrown let's get Mike when the balls in the air you've got to play the football you can't have contact it with a receiver and you cannot play the receiver you saw the hands clearly on Matthews before the ball got there today a microcosm of Indiana season what could go wrong did especially in the first half when Penn State came out impressively on their first drive but then took advantage of Indiana miscues to put this game away early trying to score another touchdown dito takes the low snap working in the shotgun going towards Victorian wilkerson another touchdown for the Hoosiers 36 yard touchdown reception by Dorian Wilkerson and Joe Paterno doesn't care what unit is in the football game he's gone how does a guy get that wide open exactly he wants to know what the coverage was Jerry Sandusky tell me what the coverage was anytime you have a receiver that wide open there is a bust on the defensive side of the football I almost made it through the day without Foss finding my boss my boss comes looking for me What did he say there was a time earlier this year we're fraternal came looking for Jerry he was kind of tucked behind a player and peep was naturally gonna go coach I I'm right here he grabbed him that safe in the walk actually said he knew that Coach Paterno didn't see this going pass right by and he reached out in the grass as we see but those two have been together for such a long time and they've got such a great respect for each other Indiana last year had two late touchdowns against Penn State well recall made the game a bit closer than this one obviously some of our you that cost Penn State the national championship I don't know if we want to get back into that discussion but that's that it certainly has sprung so much of the conversation about the polls and about the amount of scoring and how it affects that the pollsters it all goes back to that week up until that time Penn State was number one they lost that ranking because of the close score and they finished the season 12 and I would never have an opportunity to regain it was Chris ditto in relief as he was today but not quite the same situation as one year ago this side the onsite tick handle nicely by Freddie Scott he'll sit down and now Penn State will have a chance after the flags go up flying to run the clock out and walk away with another homecoming victory Paterno didn't like the late hit because the route the ball carrier was Freddie Scott number 31 that's what people refer to as their Anne's team when you're receiving the onsite take to get the people on your team with the best ability to catch the ball and you're gonna see clearly that Freddie Scott is on the ground and now here comes the late hit right here and I don't blame that guy for being upset I don't care who the player is let alone you got one of your starting wide receivers taking that late hit one of the other things Mike we talked to this post Paterno about the importance of of really trying to settle the national championship picture his team was the victim last year being 12 and oh I'm not sharing in that national title ten of the discussion centered around how college football has missed the opportunity of having a true national champion like we have in the Final Four in basketball Indiana the miscues cost them today Penn State ups their record to six and two on the year three and two in the Big Ten they await the Northwestern Wildcats up in Evanston next week and congratulations to Joe Paterno career win number 275 and it certainly appears that they are smiling and bill certainly has an understanding probably Joe's explained in that situation to him that there are two guys they've known each other for a long time and that's a real show sportsmanship on their part that's the story here in state Challenge Penn State gets the win 45 21 for Bill Lewis and Kirk Herbstreit Mike Goldberg saying so long we now go to our next game Jerry punch and mike Mayock take it away guys maybe see sports college football presents the big ten match
