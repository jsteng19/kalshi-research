============================================================

welcome to Morgantown where it's senior Danny poore prolific quarterback Pat white the school has honored him with a white out crowd and the weather conditions have cooperated as well and to the all right night in West Virginia welcome to espn2 college football primetime presented by Kay Jewelers tonight for the Big East Conference the South Florida Bulls take on the West Virginia Mountaineers from Chile Morgantown West Virginia and right now let's take a look at the Big E standings Cincinnati sitting on top with a six in one record followed by Pittsburgh and Rutgers and five in two in West Virginia at four and two hi everybody Ron Frank a lot with that Cunningham and a happy holiday season to you this will get you in the Christmas spirit with this kind of weather I'll tell you what else will get you in a great spirit and that is the fact that tonight Pat white among 17 other seniors playing their final game he may be the greatest of all the Mountaineers that's ever worn the uniform it's been an amazing week around Morgantown as they've honored this young man as they should a good young man he gets his degree next week and who can forget some of the great wins that he is engineered here remember go back to that 2006 Sugar Bowl against Georgia shocked the college football world and showed that the spread offense was here to stay and then of course last year when this place was in disarray when Rich Rodriguez was leaving for Michigan he went out into the desert and put a big win together against Oklahoma fiesta bowl the greatest wins in the history of this great program not only had white and we get to see him for the last time tonight Grothe the starting quarterback for South Florida folks both of these guys can hit the 10,000 total office mark tonight which is incredible and it's never happened in this conference so we've got two guys who may do it in the same night now the bad news for Patrick white we mentioned he's a senior this is his last regular season game is Matt Grothe just a junior so even though Pat white will end his career as the Big East leader in total offense have a feeling that growth he's going to catch and pass that next year well as we mentioned it's a very special night senior night they are being introduced right now and the fact let's join Travis Jones and we're going to hear the ovation given the last four or five

time quarterback rushing leader number five hat right and now let's bring out about there we'll get you ready for the opening kickoff when we return to Morgantown and that is in just 60 seconds welcome back to Jimmy D week on the ESPN and the battle to wipe out cancer it was Jim Valvano who memorably told us to never give up though what they're for tonight and it's going to be a cold run the temperature will continue to drop it is 28 degrees right now it feels like 21 and for the forecast more snow let's go to the sidelines and be joined by the third member of our broadcast team and he's got more on the weather conditions tonight Jack arute how is it down there Ron it's cold but it's also snowing and format Grothe it's the first time that he will be playing in the snow in fact all week he was excited about the fact that he might get the chance to play in the snow he said the snow isn't going to bother me as long as there isn't wind and that's the good news there is hard to believe but he is an Alabama kid right has never played in the snow either I asked him I said well what about the cold he's ejected cold doesn't bother me the first thing I do when my defense goes out I find a warm spot on the bench I'm going to go try and find one not myself okay check the two head coaches in this ballgame tonight Bill Stewart's seven and four record and his first season as the head coach at West Virginia and the man across the way is the only head coach that the Bulls program has has ever had and of course we are talking about Jim lemons and I think it's his intensity that will keep him warm tonight I don't know I would suspect you don't even have very many layers on there that I had heart races during again well we about two hours two and a half hours ago we were sitting here in the booth and we looked and I turn to you I said isn't that letteth walk it across the field didn't have a hat on didn't have a coat on and he was walking the full 100 yards headed back to his locker room so you're exactly right his emotions run high regardless of what's going on and he had an interesting thing to say about the cold he said he hoped it was going to snow he said because the young men will like that they will enjoy it and their kids coming through I'm sure he had to dust off his hair but hey you know just a casual jump through the snow is Lancaster will take the kickoff and bring it out across the 42 close to the 45 yard line cat white 32 yards on the return and West Virginia will have excellent starting field position and this is a defense that Pat white and West Virginia has really struggled against in the last two years 32 total points in two straight losses to South Florida Pat White banged up a couple of years ago had an ankle sprain still played but not well last year was knocked out of the game with a thigh bruise so not just looking up to put some numbers at but he liked to get through this game healthy well Chuck Sanders is in the backfield at tailback along with the quarterback Pat white and I have a feeling that that is for formation purposes only in fact he'll get that to the right they'll have about six or seven yards as GUI Knights in from that left defensive end spot and jock Sanders a young man when we met with Jeff Mullen the firstyear offensive coordinator that came up here from Wake Forest when the changeover happened said if he had one critique of himself it was that I didn't get the ball enough to jock Sanders now with Patrick white and all the Noel Devine that's difficult but they will try to get it to him or on second down when the lefthander gets a night the standards and Sanders is going to have the first down as he fix it inside the 50 going to be a gain of five and Keyon Wilson it makes the tackle we will call to his name a lot tonight number 42 along with two super outstanding defensive ends George Selby number 95 and Jarrett buoy number nine oh very very good playing mr. young Wilson is a junior college transfer his first year the coaches Wally Burnham that the export nurse said he's really picked it up in the last few weeks so West Virginia on their initial Drive of the night moves the chains on their first drive and white quick pass out of the far sideline I just simply to our net that stood for eight yards and Jerome and Murphy is there to make the stop here are the impact players for South Florida well you mentioned George Selby was a unanimous allamerican last year he's been battling an ankle injury that's going to be slow on this slick field I would suspect McKenzie the strong side outside linebacker leap the team in tackles by over 35 tackles and Carlton Williams although a strong safety will play a lot down in that nickel linebacker spot because of the president's spread offense Bernie Sanders in the backfield again Jolla is the man who was in motion number 21 give it to sander the goto breathing room that's enough for the first down in the vicinity of the 36 Keyon Wilson there to make the tackle again let's go down to the sidelines to check in once again with Jack arute Jack Ron take a closer look at Pat white hands he is wearing gloves I asked him before the game he said I practiced with them I've also run some plays during games with him he's gotta remember I'm a big Pittsburgh Steelers fan he doesn't Ben Roethlisberger clocks at the point it is pumps at once looks back to the other side he's gonna row and heels totally dangerous from his posture and he's close to the first down at your own Murphy will stop him after a gain of 10 and this is a new wrinkle to this offense with Jeff Mullen came in the thing that he studied was the two losses last year to South Florida and to Pittsburgh and he noticed that they played all men coverage and tried to lock the outside receivers down with their good corners and so they put a little more drop back pack a package in there for Patrick white he's picked it up very well he's picked up the whole package quickly and there he goes even when he's covered in dangers and get out and even though the snowcovered field well that pass is going to be a little high and incomplete Jonah was the intended receiver redshirt senior out of Greensboro North Carolina and they went to a more thrown style passing attack when coach Mullen got here and that light has picked it up very well and it's because of what South Florida has done to them the last couple years defensively this is a third down and short and found that we're going to talk about is that white takes it forward Rogers takes you forward actually now some of the players having to be separated besides where the play ended and it looks as though from where the yellow line is that's going to be enough for the first down point I was going to make it and we'll get you to talk more about this Noel Devine 170 mark Rogers running back 185 Jacque Sanders 185 they're not very big at that position they don't run a lot of tight ends into their ball games oh my god the prior fray is under review now obviously I would assume check the spot yeah yeah and the other thing is no fullback so in short yardage situations it's kind of tough on West Virginia that white I was right the first time he did hold on to the football and here's the shot that will see it you know of course losing Owen Schmidt from last year talking about the fullback that takes a big pump out of there I think he's right on that line I think he did get the first down yeah from that angle remember has to be indisputable video evidence but you cannot discount losing a guy like Steve Slaton who's gone on for the next level and is playing sensationally well on Sundays now but you lose oh and Schmidt and that and that option attack is something they kind of had to change a little bit or the official review continuing and here comes the verdict sorry Hill the play stands is called on the field for sound mill Stewart says yes I'd like I'd like the result there you could see Pat white he was being scooted along the ground because of the ice yeah after he was stopped but the forward progress had been enough and he's got his cleats on Pat white will go with a couple of different shoes on this surface but because it is slick he's right a little bit of a longer creaking you and Jack and I had lunch with him yesterday he talked primarily about wearing straight tennis shoes but I guess with the ice and snow little different situation with Sanders Nights his way through for a gain of five tackled by McKinsey right now he is sixteen yards away from that ten thousand a number you see the rushing and passing excuse me up and he is the NCAA's alltime leading quarterback rusher he passed up Brad Smith earlier this year from the shotgun second down and five where that's good for the first down to jock Sanders and in case you will walked into the room late and just turned on our football game this is the first time the South Florida has played a game a and snow and B with the temperature below freezing well it's a program that started at this level the FBS level Football Bowl Subdivision only in 2000 so not much history and they're only in existence for three years prior to that Jim lemon as you mentioned a topless show has been the only coach they've ever had so not a ton of history but in the Big East they're going to play a few more of these down the road I think exactly right straight ahead there's the first down with Sanders JA has it mckenzie again on the stop and you know this may not be aesthetically wonderful but with the the footing as it is and quite frankly the footing on this surface is very good for the conditions but I think if you can continue to do that this may be the kind of ballgame is going to have to be by both teams because South Florida likes to run the ball as well it and a little shocking that we've not seen Noel Devon run for over a thousand yards no indication that he was hurt before the game some haven't seen on the throwback that they do his part by urban and touchdown West Virginia that was pretty work than what and it is the only way to put it yep urban is over to the right and then he starts coming back across a good job but this is an excellent throw by Pat white the safety excuse me the corner jerome murphy was late getting over there there was trailing coverage by the linebacker mckenzie that that was a good throw by white extra point attempt balled us down and McAfee has it and as we go to break one more look urban his second catch of the year in fact I think is up his career for that matter seven or nothing West Virginia tonight cos p.m. two college football is presented in high definition live and in color how about ten thousand on the nose for total offense after that drive getting it into the end zone and exactly 100 touchdowns as well accounted for and that's something they're most much a career to end right on that number and for urban his second touchdown catch and only his second catch of his career so pretty good start for him tonight as well reason for the smiles on the pitch I now to get a look at the polls on office very high kick it's a spinner taken at the 13 close and president's deputy Scott just as he crosses the 30 yard line good for 19 on return match growth it from Lakeland Florida and he has had an ankle problem and he tried to cover it up a little bit on the phone conversation the other day and then he actually said they had to do some work on it and last weekend halftime yeah the last week against Connecticut a game that they had lost three in a row they really needed put a little medicine in there to numb it up and he took over a little bit more so much better when he can run if they can get some linemen so let's see how on mobile he was on that bad ankle great ahead with night forward and not much doing as an entire defensive front kneeled Chris kneeled a wretched sophomore is the man who leads the way number 90 and it's good for about three you can see the snow continues to fall and that actually is the forecast for the rest of the evening now we are fortunate in the fact they're not talking about heavy snow but just continues like this probably won't be overly bad the pudding so far has been tremendous one year South Florida comes out after sitting on a bench because a little snip right now yeah last few yards it's going to be third down and they need to take it down to the 39 now the starters on defense for West Virginia's you'll see the scroll and there's me old Chris Neil the Richard sophomore they aligned in a green three pods three down linemen typically three linebackers and then five depleted backs of course one of those safeties the boundary safety will come down around the line of scrimmage there will become more of a threefour but now you see the four growth a good protection as a onehanded catch AJ love and I promise you the quarterback is in love with this mr. love after a catch like that and a lot of a young man just a sophomore that the coaches we're talking about just running across here out wait for it to clear what a nice grab Wow but you know jag was talking about those gloves and that that white is wearing you know the outlaw stick of many years ago but I'm here to tell you that those new gloves that the guys wear you go to shake their hand and you're not going to be able to get your hand away from them it's just like with less crazy cooking curriculum Swatt apply and pick it out of the air they still be alive I'm telling you that the consistency on that glove is exactly like flypaper exactly what it feels like that was Mike Ford on the carry and he's going to wind up being a Ford and Ford a young man who came into camp a little bit out of shape he's a bigger guy almost 230 pounds and he battled an ankle injury so it was out fall of last year which set him back and also set his team back because he's a big strong runner anyone's very hard that's the handoff bounces it outside how does the first down at an ankle high tackle is going to stop him right there it'll be a gain of five and Brandon Hogan was the man who rolled underneath him to stop the run well you don't often see a 5 foot 7 200pound fullback but for South Florida watch right there that's Benjamin Williams now it's not much of a block but he is the toughest guy on the team every coach when you talk to the South Florida folks talk about Benjamin Williams they and the job he does bench presses 4:30 at 5:00 get the buzz that a 200pound squats 660 pounds over three times body it's a first down Jamar Taylor at the ball game and he gets to carry he'll have it for a gain of about seven yards Jack arute what do you have for us well you're talking about Deron Williams and his prolific miss in the in the weight room you know this all started when he was cut from the baseball team in high school he was looking for a spring sport at his high school they had competitive weightlifting and he became an I quote a freak you quoted it he says he's used it now in strength and conditioning and he's still a freak in the weight room we'll be with the playaction the pocket throws it complete and that's a nice job by Ben Williams a young man were just talking about to hold on to the football the pass was a little bit high but it's enough for the first and a nice job by Williams he's blocking on the edge this is kind of a sprint out for Grothe and as Grothe gets over that side watch Williams as he works on the outside linebacker and then he goes to get into his route and that was a little bit of a blown coverage there by Sidney Glover Glover decided to go up to try to hit Brophy and instead stood a stage with Williams with a nice job Williams Japan and much akin to what we saw from West Virginia and it may be that kind of night where again I'm not looking for style points or for anything aesthetically beautiful they just want to get it into the endzone three yards and a cloud of snow that's right but I think that kind of game that Jim Leavitt would like to play even though his defense is played very well in the last couple of ball games against West Virginia remember they lost two quarterbacks to the NFL one in the first round so the more he has won he was finally happy from levels joking we'll keep it it the first down as he goes down hard it's give him a gain of seven and again Brandon Hogan comes from that quarterback spot to make the hip and good news for South Florida growth he looks healthy that that looked to me like a guy he's not worried about his ankle watch him as he goes to cut and move yeah that doesn't look like a guy whose ankles really bothering him so the coaches they said he was a hundred percent but of course you always wonder are they being honest if not going to really tell you if the guy is not a hundred percent but he looks okay that tenth play of the drive coming up here and they give it to Ford and Ford is going to have about a half yard or no gain I guess we're going to call it the second down at ten JT Thomas linebacker out of Fort Lauderdale redshirt sophomore protects his dad played here there there are a there are more players on West Virginia from the state of Florida than any other state on this team including West Virginia and a lot of these guys are pretty upset the last couple of years they've lost to South Florida because a lot of these guys know each other Kelly and Ford in the backfield along with Matt broken explored still fighting and I know he's a tough runner and he on a second effort picks up about three more to gain of nine it'll be third down and one Ian Smith stopping and this is the type of run that they know they can get out of fourth dimension he was hurt last year he battled an ankle this year big powerful guy they've had high hopes for him they've got a lot of running back that they said they were going to get in and out but if poor keeps running like this I would suspect that 26 will get the bulk of the work tonight so they go to three running backs actually a wishbone set rather than a power I set and they go for the first down it given with Ben Williams and Williams will be inside the 10 it's a gain of eight it'll be first and goal for the Bulls of South Florida Clinton Andrews makes the stop watch the push at the point of attack and you've got everybody going in the same direction and the last guy to get it is Williams this is really good push a bunch of guys from West Virginia falling down and that's nice patient by Williams he waited and waited waited for last little bit cut back to picked up enough seagull honest critics just inside the 10 and this time they knife it to the right side with Mike Ford good blocking is West Virginia saying that the ball came loose the official does not agree and they're talking it over the officials are talking it over and remember the rule change this year you can review it even if the play is signal dead they're going to get the ball to left Virginia let us look at a replay and see exactly what happened we'll go to break looking at the play as for the same he was down that's what he's saying to his head coach seven month in West Virginia this would be a huge thing if this play stands as the ball was wrestled out fans ESPN's college football primetime is presented by Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay and invert by the auto parts experts at autozone get in the zone autozone yes so welcome back in the ruling on the field was confirmed and it was Glover who caused the phony made the tackle caused the fumble and made the recovery that's three pretty big stats right there in all the one fell swoop a tough break for South Florida had a wonderful drive to answer West Virginia's person and turn it over Doug Sanders under drop right tackle for about three by the way that is South Florida's ninth lost fumble of the season Glover excellent job never gave up on it he had it right from the start sometimes you just find that ball right in your hands when you're going to make the tackle and Glover just continue to work it until it came out nice job you know interesting the last two years that West Virginia has played South Florida they have been scoreless the Mountaineers had in the first quarter this one right here is not going to go very far and it's McKenzie who is there to mess up the works and it's going to be third down and long at white exactly 100 career total yards and 100 total touchdowns responsible for that's going to change probably on this play but that's a pretty neat stat line yeah it is now they got to take it out to the 15yard line to hold on to the football here comes pressure and he's going to go down to the set and there's George selfie one of those two tight are the defensive ends that I talked about he was an allamerican last year and he gets doubled so much but he is a load sometimes even double teaming him can't get the job done and here's you know what a great get off Wow Wow did he get off that ball I'm not so sure he didn't know the snap count you know Selby he's a crafty guy he may have listened in because it looked me like when we got shot down at McAfee standing with his heel almost at the base of that end zone Edwards the deep man's gotten away I thought it was blocked in fact the defender must have run past it as Edwards loses the ball and now is going to be tackled at the 32 yard line how in the world that he missed the football well they said the referee signaled that it was tipped because if anything it would have been a running into the kicker a roughing the kicker so first down but they say the ball was tipped what a great pump though even though it was 10th 57 he did he open ran it 57 yards in the booth so we are back and in the split screen you see the punter for West Virginia and Jabbar Taylor on the right and he's the man that over ran watch how far up the leg he hit him he's passed the football yeah he didn't go to the point where they kick it and I don't see where that balls tipped so this should have been a roughing unbelievable kick by McAfee he's a 69 yards is what they're giving credit for now because of where the ball was fumbled yeah until possession was maintained I didn't see the ball move it came out as a spiral I don't think it's not sure this should have been a roughing and that's exactly what McAfee is asking for the ball is not touched and Bill Stewart he should be upset this should be a first down for West Virginia out around the 20yard line and continued no the defender did not touch the wall therefore we have roughly your cake person or fall lunatic 433 on the deeper 15yard penalty first down that is the absolute right call and that that is why do you have touching of a kick is a reviewable play and I think they got that call absolutely right I applaud them for getting it right I know that Jim Levites losing his mind right now but to me this is the absolute right call Jim better be careful there he's a you know what he's a little too demonstrative and of course with the the personal file does the automatic first down Oh spike oh boy good turn that microphone office don't have anybody in the Cotter water that baby dig might be in right now but that that is the right call that's the referee dead it is yeah and again who's explained in coach the rule says we can review whether the kick was touched on if it's not we have to call it and he's absolutely right I think this is the right decision and you're right coach Levin's got to watch it they've already got 15 you know they just had the fumble where they were going in to score West Virginia now gets the ball back he doesn't to give them another 50 again it's Jacques Sanders lining up in the backfield along with Pat white West Virginia leads it 7 nothing you can see we have 80 seconds left to play in the opening quarter and white they were well skilled and this one if the ball is thrown complete Java and Java will take it for a first down all the way to the 38 and now though that's a snowball nevermind I thought it was a flag coming now Nate Allen is there defensively 18 yards and this is something that you just haven't seen really in the long career of Pat white the ability to throw that ball somebody in his face back across his body and it's been a lot of hard work give a lot of credit to Jeff Mullen the new offensive coordinator for developing this part of Pat White's game on the 37 yard line and they set up the middle screen and a nice job defensively by South Florida and let's check in back in the studio wind enix windy thank you very much it's time now for SportsCenter right now if you're looking for a shootout in this big 12 championship game not so far though it is early Jimmy Stevens that the burner there from 20 yards out the only score so far Oklahoma on top by three Florida though has defeated Alabama 31 20 they are SEC champions and likely to play for a national title okay Wendy we're just checking on the field all of a sudden we had a first quarter that were just flying by and now we've had several stoppages in play and the traders now are looking at jock Sanders the sophomore out of st. Petersburg and a very explosive runner with great speed and obviously he has been shaken go back and look at the replay and see what we can find out he's been in there the entire first quarter goes to block and and catches the screen hard to tell there was a lot of guys a lot of bodies being twisted and big bodies as well oh yeah that right ankle right underneath the body is Terrell McClain Sanders six carries for 24 yards so far in our ballgame and Mark Rogers will check in to the lineup so it'll be a second down and eight as we have now only 32 seconds left in the opening quarter see blitz coming off the corner and white gets it out on the flat and I mean the pastures just dropped by codon 41 join host rhysdavies Kirk Herbstreit Lou Holtz Lee Corso and Mark Meng as they review all 34 bowl games the matchups the winners and the losers the bowl selection special mattias begin tomorrow night 8 o'clock Eastern Time I'm really surprised we have not seen a welt Devine in the game he's rushed for over a thousand yards this year unless there's some kind of suspension we didn't know about we had lunch with him yesterday no mention of any injury whatsoever so not quite sure why he's not playing at white over the middle and he threw that one just a little too hot a little hide giallo is the intended receiver and that'll stop the clock with nine ticks showing until the beginning of the second quarter and Jim love it has to be very happy with what his defense is done they had a turnover they got what was supposed to be a three and out but of course and they got the roughing the kicker and now they get their second three and out in a row effective Marcus Edwards is the deep man number 11 and a member on the last one he had a little bit of a problem fielding the punt and in this count of weather understandably so here's the boot just a line drive Edwards makes it on the run it's my room gets by two and now not going to get outside on the right as you really got smothered it's going to be 41 on the punt and 4 on the return so let's take a timeout that is the end of the first quarter with our score West Virginia 7 and South Florida nothing and we are back greetings from Morgantown West Virginia Oh Christmas parade going on and I wasn't joking up top develop des really does if you're the Christmas spirit became to the stadium it was snowing pretty heavy actually at the time it's just about stopped right now when that will be for the remainder of the evening or not but that also means of course that the temperature is dropping but the footing has been good and we have not seen a bunch of slips roping throws the ball and it is incomplete and let's check in again with Jack arute Jack Brown you're right about the footing so far but I'd like Jack Sanders it was the cold turf that created this potential ankle sprain they have taped it added some support he is trying to run through it right now when they went through all the four curtain precautionary you know pulling and tugging enix show much pain so he should be up let me give you the update on the old divine as well nothing wrong with them as far as we can tell he's been huddled over here by heater wait okay well he was it the producers within that demanding the ball game has not played a nice job by Grothe getting to pass away two plus B and Ben Busby a junior automobile number 82 a tight end at six thirty to forty two they had adlibs Gloor and came up with a big one that's exactly what Matt Grothe does very much like Pat white and this ability to get away from people and make plays nice job of square you to show off that is a nice flavor in tight in Busby it's a lot of athleticism we're still sliding yeah now mix up in the backfield if you see growth a spin around and either the quarterback about Dinah sack or tur back I haven't been in a running back ran the wrong direction and we did not have a play action on the play it's a loss of one well Grothe comes out and goes to his right and just never got to the running back the play is obviously going to the left and growth he just has to finish and turn all the way around and sometimes because South Florida plays so many different running backs sometimes it's hard on your quarterback because guys run plays a little bit different you're right also different you talk about different sizes Ben Williams only five seven handle it's going to be a lot lower to him on insulin building playaction and your heavy pressure and throws it complete at the 40yard line a Trojan that will be a gain of core and help them out considerably because it's now third down and heavy pressure by Sydney Louisville and a great job by growth buying some extra time because his receiver Vogon hadn't quite cleared yet so that was a nice job by growth me to buy that time and make this a manageable third down take Glover is the one who forced it and now they've got a situation third down they need to take it to the 49yard on the line to make for the first down gopher great protection this time over the middle has a man and hit seam at the 39 good for 20 yards in it's Jessie Hester one of the two guys that they talked about it receiver that they have to get the football to because big results happen when they get it to Hester and has been a young man that's really burst onto the scene this year he was very steady last year but they didn't expect him to have the type of year that he's having to you I'm sorry no go ahead his 21st consecutive game that he has had a catch but a new school record by the way very consistent had a good teacher his dad eleven years in the NFL missionary on the ground may be good for a half yard is a Jamar Taylor tackled by Chris kneeled and kneeled is the guy who has really come on in this three three defense he played you allimportant if you're going to play what's called an odd front that's when you put a nose guard right over the center even is when you have two tackles over the guards odd is when you put a guy right over the center if that guy over the center a threeman front cannot control the center in the backside guard your linebackers are done because they can get through and blocking this guy does a nice job meal to have a really solid ball game against Oklahoma and the full game last year out in Tempe guilty all the time in the world in Phase two the ride open pokken and bogan will set it up first and goal inside the 10 yard line it's a gain of 30 I think on the one this route takes a long time to develop bogan lined up Molly it's just a chase route he's chasing behind Carlton Mitchell and then just as soon as Mitchell clears off bogan does a good job of slowing down and it pushed the zone so they had a place to settle down the Vista Tex was Williams gets bit and spun around 15 about a yard and a half it is goal to go it would be second down lizard that was your sophomore out of a Thesz de Maryland making the tackle number 31 heels you're in there because it looked like Anthony Leonard the usual start middle linebacker is not going to be able to go they already lost read Williams the two shoulder injuries earlier in the season so they're moving through some guys that line back away Williams and fooled this time are the setbacks it's at the fourth approach to the game zone and will be too far Marcus Edwards the intended receiver that was one of those deals with work vendor and the receivers feet got caught up and that's what stopped Edwards from being able to run it's a pretty good throw by growth he kept the ball inbounds the cocoanut young man who was playing wide receiver at the beginning of pants four runs nice job you see Edwards with no short sleeves on Bal Jaya many of the West Virgina kids have got longsleeve shirts underneath their jerseys a whole bunch of the South Florida kids are going to muscle him the first time delivering the world right out a change at halftime keeper Grothe touchdown South Florida well they and you can see the West Virginia players talking to each other the right side of the defense just completely collapsed it's it's the zone read that just about every team in the country all the way up to the NFL level is now running and the backside defensive end just got lost all the way down inside and Grothe walking will the drive ten plays 75 yards 355 off the clock Kanani knocks home the extra point and we are tied at 7 if you take one more look at the touchdown run by Grothe tide of seven South Florida 7 and West Virginia 7 and let's take a look at tonight's autozone playbook all right the guys you want to look for on this play is the defensive end scooter Barrett here he is lined up right here now watch as the running back goes this way he's going to chase but watch growth to go right by him now the interesting thing is Barry chases what he thinks is the ball to watch right when he realizes that the ball is not in our knee backs hands that's the old dagnabbit you know he slaps his hands together in thought man I just absolutely blew it he knew agents knew it right away when he got to the ball carrier and said wait a minute that was his own read I should have stayed right where I was at the offensive end I was chasing the wrong guy he ran right by me no we had a chance to visit with scooter yesterday Joe's right young man and they saw ghosts as they say in coaching parlance this big stinky returned into 27o select exit back inside picks up another six or seven yard wind Enix let's check back with you the studio run thank you very much and we will check in on the big 12 championship game and a Taco Bell studio update Oklahoma already up three courtesy a field goal Chris Brown punches it in from four yards out and the Sooners lead Mizzou by a score of ten nothing Florida already defeating Alabama 31 to 24 their first SD title since 2006 okay Wendy well for the first time tonight Noel Devine has checked into the lineup the sophomore out of Fort Myers and it will be a keeper by white as he thinks he merited Noel by the way the numbers on white tonight six of nine throwing 47 yards and he has scored a touchdown and his completions are to four different wide receivers up this is obviously a totally different offense than what was run by Rich Rodriguez and his staff before they took off from Maryland Gil Stewart went and got Jeff Mullen out of his Wake Forest excuse me Michigan you took off the wait for that moment to make for Santa for that folks there for seven years why pressure from behind didn't feel it's going to be set and that is number 90 Jarrett Bowie now a point on Bowie he is very very good by his own rights but because Selby gets so much attention a lot of times he winds up getting single attention and maybe a little bit easier time it helps it and the key is when you have a guy like George Selvi who's going to draw some help then the other guy has to step up because if he can't do it yet now you're dead now you're just not going to get any pressure whatsoever unless you've lit so give Bowie credit currently stepping up and doing it when you can middle screen is no alibi puts your head down you could hear the crowd coming into life because when he gets the football at his size with that speed at 58 170 he he can really do wonders in space great job last week by Pitt 1.4 yards per carry they held him to in Pittsburgh and South Florida for the last two years have absolutely had West Virginia's number offensively at least and shut them down there's Devine gone to the sidelines now with a fourth down situation and they punted away with McAfee a little bit about the rugby punch maybe gets the forward roll it's one paving block and it will be the end of the way array the 23 yard line 43 yards in the kick and 13 on the return will take a timeout West Virginia 7 and South Florida 7th ESPN college football primetime rookie Bud Black &amp; Decker powerful solutions in and around the home well they continue to slide outside of Mountaineer Stadium guys I want to let you know they're going to slide a little thing in terms of snap count and cadence and color called that Grothe met with his linemen they practiced it I can't tell you the color change but obviously at they've tend to think that maybe there's a little trickeration or expired going out on the defensive side of things yeah you have an active color that alerts your your all kinds of mates that you may be changing with play they mustn't change that color and I know there is Jamar Taylor hit in the backfield just as he got the handoff and it's a loss of six hello JT Thomas the redshirt sophomore out of Fort Lauderdale this was just an absolute runthrough at the heck of a job by calmness didn't get to finish it but there's a little Barry making them learn familiar mistake yeah he was home this time let it go scooter set it down in about 16 I had seven doctor hit the Midway mark up the second quarter snow has stopped here Morgantown at least for the moment Grothe throws it in the planks at the receiver Cedric Hill and to turn and come back a step to make the catch up with that he lost his footing and actually the first time we've seen tonight somebody lose their footing yeah and I wouldn't go back a second though about Jack talking about the color but what happens is cadence usually has a coloring so you'll hear like green 57 green 57 and then you go into the cadence well there is a color that's a hot color so that you know if it's red and I give you a number that's what changes the play well you know what the people to know when you're going to change it so obviously not growth we was concerned must be giving me their hot color so they change the back row it has came a new joke hit with an ankle high tackle and that will be enough for the first down so Brophy set sail and it's a gain of 19 yards Brandon Hogan finally put a stopper on well not growth he is just playing lights out right now this is a design run and this is something that the coaches from South Florida said Greg Gregory the offensive coordinator and zoom Leavitt said he is a better player when not just scrambles he's very good at screaming but when we call run plays for our quarterback he plays better and growth he is is really locked in right now then Williams the man in the backfield living looking still looking for the plate defection goes in over to the left and I mean almost a KO it on the linkster it's going to be a gain of 12 though bogan is the man who made it the catch and the linkster came over and really put the wood doing growth he can be very accurate both in the pocket and on the run that's the one thing the coaches talk about his abilities with his feet set up so many things they do in the throwing game but that that is the word they use all the time he's accurate on the run when he throws and we've seen that so far is evening West Virginia coming with pressure up the middle he has to just unload this one at a very smart move no sense in taking the hit and he could see that there was way too much duress to mess around that situation Fox top six 29 and you know in that slide that South Florida went on they started out five and oh and then they went on a tough tough run they're lost three games in a row for a while their growth he started forcing the ball and the coaches felt like it was him trying to do a little too much because of the struggles of the team well you could see Matt Grothe says we want a timeout so we'll take it with them tied at 7 just under six and a half minutes until halftime we'll be right back so we are back tied at7 629 showing on the clock and it's other temperature continues to drop and for those of you who are Jack arute fans in the booth we're in and I are standing at 76 degrees and on the field it's 23 now let's hear it for Jack for Kai is going to go for a bodyguard with Williams and let's check in again with Jack arute Jack I know you guys are sweating but what I want to do is update you on the condition of the field is that filter and this is in chocolate chip ice cream it's starting to harden up what happens is the snow gets inside and replaces a lot of the black groundup rubber and that's what starts to make it hard the pudding is starting to go away guys okay good hustle there get your knees out of the snow there jack third that line to make is the 43 of West Virginia and ropey once another timeout that's the second one he's taken because he didn't like the formation they were in and in a game that was 552 left in the second quarter a game that looks like it's very very tight you don't to be wasting timeouts you may need them at the end to try a field goal key into the half well get your weekly dose of NFL news and

you've got the longer blades of the synthetic grass well now you basically have precipitation water on those blades so you're going to start to see some guys slip as they make up book third down and still the line to make the 43 the far sideline that man coverage and age in love the intended receiver well overthrown so South Florida will have to give it up next er was the man with the coverage and West Virginia is going to leave their safe defense in all their people to linemen and linebackers in Australia instead of their normal punt return because this is the area on the road you have to consider South Florida would think about a fake here Alvarado was demand waiting for the snack back at the 38yard line tied at 7 547 left until halftime very very hot not really super coverage pick and then it hits and takes a really good South Florida bounce and is going to go dead at the 10yard line a Monday night the two teams perched at the top of the NFC South with identical nine and three records Tampa Bay and Carolina on Monday Night Football on ESPN at 8:30 Eastern Time Everage begins at 7 o'clock with Monday night countdown delivered by UPS Ron Franklin at Cunningham Jack arute coming to you from Morgantown West Virginia Pat white the quarterback for this football team playing his final game in a mountaineer uniform here at home I'll divide and Noel with the first of speed is going to have clothes to read 11 yards on the carry they're going to say officially it is 12 you know I wonder if no well maybe you know they said it was not as especially did not play at all in the first quarter and of course Jacques sander started at running back it looks like they've now moved him almost permanently to the running back position but this man so explosive you wonder if he wasn't maybe in the doghouse a little bit into the game they've gotten him out at wide receiver right now and Pat white is the only person in the backfield and trying to run Pat white to the right side and boy South Florida was right there to snip it out witty Nick's let's check in with you again thank you very much as we continue to update the big 12 championship out in Kansas City Oklahoma was on top 10 nothing finally we do has an answer courtesy of chase Daniel to Jeremy Maclin 27 yards later the Tigers are on the board as it stands right now in the second quarter it is 10 to 7 and of course we're already topping alabama 31 to 20 okay when the our situation were tied at seven playing will go from maybe a yard and that's it it's going to be third down and very long for West Virginia Craig Marshall defensively and now this is where the development of Pat white as a quarterback that's going on throughout the season has to show up because this is a situation where you're not going to catch South Florida off guard they're going to drop back into coverage I would doubt they'll bring pressure here so now white will most likely have to stand in the pocket which is all new for him here in senior year for wide receivers to his left white sets up first has it completed at the 30 and I don't know if the second effort I think he got knocked out of bounds I'm thinking about our net it's a gain of seven that's not going to be enough for the first down if you're Bill Stewart do you take a chance of this deep in your own territory I I don't think you should because just the momentum of the game and let's take a look our net cut off is round a little too early he's got to get that closer to the sticks he tried to stick it out late the crowd booed because I thought it was a bad spot but I think that was a good spot Jerome Murphy was not allowing him and him to take it any further but your point the two majors right on in the fact that he cut the route of just a little too soon and a good throw by white though that's exactly what you need and that's something that that white has not been able to do up until their season not really asked to do if he proves this room all the way back to the 11 as every prize the far sideline and he just runs out about 55 yards on the kick 11 on the return and there is a flag down and I think they may be getting a late hit on Sammy Marone there's a little bit of backandforth John over there but I think it might have been on their own there is no penalty for my head what happened right in front of the part of the South Florida bench and Jim Leavitt is not making friends with the officials tonight but I don't think that they're going to be going out for dinner before well he's trying to get his fair share not overly anything steps it's part of his task as a head coach new line of scrimmage they will take it over at their own 24 yard line 3:15 left until halftime bored and Kelly in the backfield they keep it on the ground and just not much doing with Mike Ford tackled after a gain of two and here's where those timeouts press Peterborough students having a nice day and left Randall in middle area you know well I mean he is at he's a good and consistent football player he knew that he messed up on a lightly but he may have gotten a little chewy but expended in janelda giving me even more in setting up just a sophomore he's got a long night for him yeah he does he started the last year as a person it's this one all philippa collector issues surrounding the receiver Mitchell from here pick up five yards but it's third down and they have to take a match of the 34 yard line award give it back to the Mountaineers with 228 showing on the clock and this is where West Virginia that their clock is going to start here as soon as they set the ball ready for play and I don't think they should do it here but if they can get a stop here and it's worked out I think they should use one of their three timeouts before the punt and for South Florida remember they've waited those two timeouts so if they get the first down they're gonna have to get into a nice hurry up here the rest of this from South Florida five six seven thirty thousand conversion roses completed that is just enough for the first down gain of six by Edwards and they'll move the sticks what's an example of not cutting the ruffle to go you ran it perfectly no but you know exact gave the report about Matt Grothe and how excited he was to play in cold and snow well that's showing up because this ball is a bullet he throws it down in a way so that he knows the defender cannot get there and that was an excellent job of cradling the ball by Martina ran through an opening on the left side and then all of a sudden it closed up immediately and that was Alan French Oh element making to tackle kind of surprised in South Florida they're not in a Berea with one timeout I don't see why they would be taking this much time than calling running plays it seems to be very counterproductive Mindy Williams alone set back this time those cabal nuts from USA he caught it they going to say he had possession at the 45 yard line that's a gain of 15 by Marcus Edwards and they better hurry and get this play off because I think this one might be review this was very close well Marcus Edwards two plays in a row he's the inside receiver running the out cut let's take a nice close look no he did get a foot down oh he did and have seen her all of it yeah nice catches in a row by Edwards he had control of it well then it's fine to review it because it was that close but yeah but even the play before on the low throw by Brophy the ball looked like it was about to hit the ground and Edwards did a good job of pulling it back in and that time showing strong hands up right when he caught it not allowing it to move around he had total control well as they review it the ball if if it stands as the call with it will be first down at the 44 yard line we have 69 seconds left on the clock and we might need to start looking at the distances that the field goal kicker sound about first on so it's going to stand yeah Mike on banana his career long 49 49 yard 13 of 19 this year and there's the foot and the part that is great is that Edwards does not that ball does not move despite the best efforts of Allen to try to knock that out but that's two good catches in a row Edwards now you've got to figure South Florida with basically a timeout with the review I would suspect now they will get into that hurry up wanting to save that one timeout in case after bring banana banana is not good beyond 40 i shouldn't say not good but he's only three of eight in his career look to his left hunted once now going to run growth him at the 40 we'll get out bound and stop the clock with 102 for logan was their growth he is just he's in the zone they had a wide receiver screen set up to the left he also had a throw that he was looking for deep to the left all of them were covered he brought it down and instantly found the sidelines knowing he only has one timeout growth explained at a very high level right so the ball is just inside the 40yard line great a hit with the running play that's a gain of about 10 yards in the play by Ben Williams tackled by Slavonic now they're getting very close to the really good fuel coal things of bonanni yeah I would think you'd want to get something down inside the 20 and then cbk take a couple throws into the end zone and then bring out Minami 45 seconds left until halftime real thing steps up and throws it completed at the 17 yard line Mitchell then forced out of bounds at the 15 so it's a gain of 16 on the play they've got exactly the setup you were talking about it clock will stop because of where we are in the ballgame we're tied at 7 in South Florida trying to go in with a lead at halftime now with that timeout you can still try stuff you can still try a draw you can still throw something short of the stig's short of the endzone but you just have to be aware of that if you're going to hurry up don't eat too much more of this clock because I think you can get four maybe five more shots before you have to try Grothe just pull the timeout and we'll take the rhythm that's got to be the final timeout for South Florida tied at 7 we'll be right back so welcome back to Morgantown here's the situation 39 seconds showing on the clock it is a first down for South Florida as they set up shop at the 15 yard line of the Mountaineers Grothe of the shotgun formation empty backfield over the middle ball is intercepted by West Virginia and that's Glover so that's the first bad throw of the night really for Brophy he just threw it behind the receiver 33 seconds on the clock and then obviously he wasn't sure you know he could just throw it away it still had plenty of time yeah this is just he's got plenty of time the offensive lines been playing great netball is just thrown behind the receiver and that is the second turnover for Glover with second turnover the red zone also oh good point yeah lover forced the fumble down around the six yard line yes in the first quarter and not lover because of the poor throw he had to throw that over the linebackers and the ball floated on him a little bit and Glover having himself a very big night really fast he is at a very big night at white going to keep the football and is going to have eight yards on the play Keyon Wilson defensively and now West Virginia with their full complement gets their timeout I don't think they want to do anything risky here it's a cold night the ball could slip somebody you know I think that's a good call to get white you've got your timeout that you break one and you get out into your midfield then maybe you'd open it up a little bit but I don't know that you want to be reared back to throwing it too much right now I had a lot of concerned I looked at the field and the linemen were trying to reset and world alignment cat was still on the ground on it if that light always got stepped on by one of his life who was stepping over his quarterback and then they realized it was a timeout fall it's a comparison on the 9th between Grothe and in white 12 of 1732 yards one interception he's got 36 rushing yards this Grothe and for white 1811 61 yards one touchdown and seven rushing yards what it's it's a cliche but what coaches always talk about turnovers yeah I mean that's the first thing out of their mouth any time South Florida in their red zone with two of them in the ball game of the ball is overthrown antenna for Java positively and now I think in third and short for West Virginia maybe some type of draw or screen to Noel Devine get the first in my life you can't get into a hurry and look at this the secondary South Florida they're moving up a little bit but they were in the playing center field there just a moment ago two of six on third down conversions tonight and here's deveined and the well tries to turn the corner and he does he's got to be careful because he conceded score in a heartbeat now 15 ticks left on the fly that's good for 15 yards excellent job by Devine he goes to bounce this outside and this is just sheer speed because this is defended the defensive end is right there excuse me the outside linebacker Tyrone McKenzie is there to make the play but he just flatout runs Amanda does a good job to get out of bounds to stop the clock so from the 42 whitelooking goes on top collision at the 35 yard line and a flag comes down it's going to be past an appearance hold against South Florida Bichette is the man who was part of the collision and even if Southfork Jim Levites trying to claim that this ball is uncatchable but I think what the call should be is a personal foul because Starks was a defenseless player and I think that what Levitt is trying to claim that the ball was uncatchable but to me this is more a personal foul type call than a pass interference pass interference number seven on the defect 15yard penalty first down well if you're going to call that the ball does have to be catchable so didn't love it I think maybe has a little bit of an argument oh no no that's yeah well the first thing that you mentioned yeah is again we talked about it defenseless player this year supposedly you know they're going to do a better job of taking care that's a defenseless player where the second man comes in and hits you in the head but also Nate Allen put his hands on starts and balls in the air as well so that that could run complete at the 28 yard line to our net that's good for 15 and still 5 seconds left on the clock now decision time I think or West Virginia I think you got to kick it because it a play can take between four and eight seconds so why risk it I think you put out your senior kicker West Virginia takes their time out to talk about it but I don't I don't think your risk another play from scrimmage I think you take this field goal well when we talked to the head coach yesterday we asked him about Pat McAfee in the by the way he said he had more fights with Pat since he's been here than his wife we compacted the opinionated young man there is no hidden really need if he didn't mean fight it disagreement yeah but we asked him you know how much confidence do you have in him and he said I've got confidence in patent McAfee from anywhere between I mean even 55 to 57 yards McAfee is out there working this turf remember the report that Jack gave us that a lot of the snow has worked its way down to the turf Mac you ran out there right away to clear off a spot 45 yards is what this is going to be it a 45 yard attempt from the far hash mark I pass good job of the holder it's got a ton of distance and it's got a ton of accuracy McAfee who by the way told us yesterday at lunch he has never as long as he's been a kicker had the opportunity to kick a game winner because the clock is going out and as a senior he's West Virginia's alltime leading scorer and that doesn't quite count as the end of a game but pretty good end of a half go down to the sidelines and Jack arute and you can see the smile on the coach's face your ticker ticker did it but I'm going to ask you was there a reason why no divine wasn't heating the first floor no no it was no reason since we won the jock Stan was in there no I was fine he's going to a big half will he'll be fine how about that passing math me huh yeah but how about your offense it was good it was effective in the first quarter and then it kind of crumbled uh but we bog down Zack to give us a certain coverage over just one ready for him we want we're right on target just going to keep making plays man and keep drives like that Reed bitches go okay Jack thanks so much our score at halftime West Virginia 10 and South Florida 7 now let's send it to windy Knicks in the studio welcome back to espn2 college football primetime presented by Kay Jewelers we're at half time here in Morgantown West Virginia with our score the Mountaineers on top by a count of 10 to 7 and that what we talked about early on in the telecast actually came true and that is semi conservative because of the weather conditions the fuel conditions and everything a lot of running not a lot of scoring yeah it's been it's been a back and forth game we'll take a look at the Timberland game track of the first half and it started out where it looked like they were going to go back and forth quite a bit 10,000 yards career total offense for Pat white in his last game in Morgantown but then there was two fumbles in the red zone both have been caused by sidney glover of west virginia forced fumble and recovered then the interception and then a wonderful drive at the end of the half so the Maccabee can kick the long field goal another senior in his last night so a couple of turnovers for South Florida in the red zone but it's been a big night so far for the seniors here in West Virginia down as you could see in the back of that blue jacket that the Bill Stewart is wearing the snow is beginning to come down again look at the total numbers South Florida 228 to 135 before the two turnovers to just jump out at you there yeah and only three points off of those turnovers it was after that Glover interception that Pat White did a nice job with the three timeouts took them down to the max field goal but that first turnover it looked like South Florida answering West Virginia's first drive was just going to walk right into the end zone that fumble was on about the six yard line here comes the head and then the South Florida giving the ball to start the second half since they won the toss and deferred Jack arute let's check with heal the sidelines well those turnovers for a sophomore and I asked him love it he said Jack what I told the players is forget about the turnovers forget about that last Drive he was very pleased with the performance of his team top to bottom he don't look all we got to do is maintain our focus and maintain our attitude in this second half I want to give you a little side bit tidbit on Pat McAfee when we had lunch with him and I was telling about our dinner chef ski the great kicker for Florida and how he rubbed his foot with a bet banana you had me bring a banana tonight he rubbed it and said I may need it gets it work done now you're taking credit to the kik as ever I just been terrific well let's do more Taylor and Jamar says well they didn't review their defense exactly this way in the first half he's tackled for a loss Liz you're the first man to get there to the 31 March L or a young man that's finally healthy has been battling an ankle injury and talking to Greg Gregory the offensive coordinator earlier in the week they said we're going to see what this young man's made up they could see the numbers there on how's South Florida has been out scoring their opponent in the third quarter in West Virginia that's been their pick quarter as well so good adjustments on the part of the coaching staff at halftime it is intercepted that a flag comes down at the 40yard line Leinster got the football well this is just another bad throw by Matt Grothe so this is two bad throws in a row you go back to the one they may get West Virginia for pass interference on this but that was just a bad throw the third number 80 on the offline I don't use to climb first time well you can't blame Patrick Richardson for trying to knock the West Virginia defenders out of the way because this ball not only double covered and like sir got a little push in there too but he was playing the ball so both both the receiver and the defender getting a little bit of a push before I just I'm not sure why trophy would let that thing fly with a safety and a cornerback in coverage at the big mistake well we'll find out here shortly just exactly how big the mistake because the Mountaineers have the ball at their own 49yard line leading by three points and let's see if they stay conservative or throw it a little bit nothing going to keep it on the ground and this is no loan to mind the last Drive before the half and really nice job no oil divider didn't play in the first quarter good job keeping its balance but his hands out then getting out of bounds and this is a part of the game that pathlight in his senior year has really developed is in the pocket passing and then Pat McAfee the senior not the true we saw him come out at halftime McAfee he was nailing him from 60 but here comes pressure back at 30 and then being taken out of bounds major role movie 19 yards Bowie was the man applying to pressure and he flushed him out of the pocket and its plays like this that has put Patrick white it's a great company he's the alltime leading rusher and college football from the quarterback position and when he takes off he just got that that smooth gliding he's not I think you underestimate his speed because it looks so effortless well he took off last week against him it did the same thing scored from over 50 throws the ball and then actually just to that well they looked as though I into the ground all ain't covering I think you've got to start talking about Pat white and what's going to happen with him at the next level in the NFL and the four guys that he is above Brad Smith Antwaan Randle L and Josh Cribbs are all playing wide receiver type positions in the NFL and I think the Pat is developed into a good passer but I feel like at the next level it's kind of he's going to be one of those utility guys I believe you know the running plays will take it down inside the 25 Jack arute you know Rob during our lunch yesterday I got it to talk to Pat a little bit about his aspirations in the NFL he said even though I was born in Alabama I've always been a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and I said well do you want to be a quarterback and he said no he said I just want to play on Sunday so it's a little bit different than some of the other utility quarterbacks that have held out like a high school Trophy winner from Nebraska a few years ago he'll go and play wherever and I'll Jack you have to wonder with his abilities exams are the pressure and they get the ball almost intercepted he was trying to get off at the very last minute to jock Sanders and John Wilson was right there to complete my thought you have to think he's plenty good enough to be a backup quarterback in other words a number 3 in the National but the legs still play wide receiver lutely yeah and that would be a great thing for Pat's with white to be able to do is be that third guy and play another position as welcome few other positions well let's see if Pat McAfee can hit one from 42 yards bar hash mark and he's got plenty of distance and again down the middle so now made a 45 and a 42 of the new score West Virginia 13 to 7 by God Oh oh yeah so welcome back to Morgantown West Virginia right now it may be snowing as hard as it has snowed this entire evening earlier this evening there have much wind now it's really swirling around some numbers on Grothe interesting in interceptions his first seven games of the season he threw three picks in the last five games he has thrown 11 interceptions broken and those inscription take it out to the 31yard line that's good for 28 yards on that return and you've got to think that when Grothe got over the sidelines got on the phone to Greg Gregory upstairs the offensive coordinator just settle down you know this is this is a problem that growth Diaz had he's he's one of those guys is a highly competitive guy but he'll take risks and he just the one down on the end zone was just a throw that he had to make it was a tough throw but it was just a bad throw the last one was a poor decision he just should not have thrown that ball so but very luckily three turnovers for South Florida and the defense is only allowed six points off of those turnovers so keeping him in this game the three 3 5 at West Virginia the ball vehicle was bought by love it was caught by the defender there may be a pickup of Colquitt mandrews works right there on him as soon as he grabbed the football it's interesting this 335 defense that West Virginia run started the second year that Rich Rodriguez was here and Jeff Castile the holdover defensive coordinator went and studied this defense with Dean hood who was the defensive coordinator at Wake Forest he'd also studied it from Charlie Strong while he was with South Carolina local people let's forward and forward as close to the first down just across the 40yard line Robert Sanz is there defensively I guess the basic as far as you know why you would do it is you would take away one large lion mother who does not run as fast and you put another fast man on the field so you get more speed on the field yeah and you look at your recruiting it's very difficult to find a bunch of 290 pounders who can really play these are the five to thirty to forty guy bounces it outside Ford and Ford spins his way inside the 50 of Robert sands has to make a stop after a gain of 13 yards that is a really good second effort on the part of Ford watch him and how hard he runs total missed outside contained Brandon Hogan the quarterback came inside and so did Quentin Andrews both the safety and the corner gave up contained to that side and that's why Borden was able to bounce it to the outside see the Bloods coming up the middle and this time it has stuff to run or virtually no gain there was a Chris me old well you we just showed that graphic a minute ago about West Virginia and South portable very good second half teams for this defense for West Virginia and replayed eight starters off a very good group from last year and they go in and halftime they draw up make the adjustments and this defense has shut out their opponents in the second half in six ball games this year so it's been very stout in the second half the West Virginia for the lone setback Grothe will keep it then go fee purposes later down inside the 40yard line join host trees Davis Kirk Herbstreit Lou Holtz Lee Corso and mark big as they review all 34 bowl games the matchups the winners the losers the bowl selection special on ESPN tomorrow night 8 o'clock Ron Franklin Cunningham and Jack arute coming to you from Morgantown West Virginia final game for 118 seniors on this mountain football team of course Pat white probably the most popular Mountaineer to a fitter player here playing his final game tonight and if you're wondering why they are wearing the white uniforms tonight and they are at home they had to ask for permission at the very beginning of the season they had to contact the conference to ask them you can't do it after the season is underway and that they were given permission South Florida said it was cold with them that they would wear it the dark jerseys and under four to one you get to see South Florida kick it away will surprise South Lord is not thinking about going for it here if we take this into the end zone you only gain about 21 yards of field position in storage for Alvarado with the kick very high just like the last one he gets it to parole dead inside the 10yard line that's good for 30 yards but where it wound up is what counts so let's take a timeout 843 left third quarter West Virginia 13 to 7 had white this final month ESPN college football won't you buy Timberland third kickers collection you can see the snow falling a little bit harder here and also that the spike cleaner on the sidelines I have to say this this Fields has held up remarkably well at the temperature in the low 20s and the snow continuing to fall and get me a new coating in certain parts of the field where they have not scrimmaged his head don't eat speckled Smith Devine and tackle by Sylvia for a gain of five well the Big East let's take a look at the standings this year come on well Cincinnati I to me one of the great stories of the year we were at winning that game against Oklahoma when Dustin gruta broke his ankle and Tony Pike then broke his arm they used four different quarterbacks throughout the season and I I think that you have to put Brian Kelly not just coach of the year in the conference I think he has to be up a possible coach of the year very I agree 100% he really did a great job and of course when he was in football other than Division one a grand balanced a run backtoback national championships at one period they were 41 and 2 and he's had success everywhere he has been virtually yeah and this because of what the preseason poll looked like this game was set up this night thinking it would be for the Big East championship and of course Cincinnati put that to rest last week and the go play most likely Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl it's a game that the you mr. rout and myself will do for ESPN Radio on January the 1st its Bowie who comes in to make the tackle you know and a man it looked like maybe with this pocket that got this but a man who was retiring after this year Biggie's Commissioner Mike train BC one of the best men in the business I have a tremendous amount of respect for him I've got a chance to chat with him today on phone and what he had to go through what this conference had to go through when Boston College in Miami and Virginia Tech left and bringing in teams like Cincinnati and South Florida for a while there a lot of people were saying should the Big East keep their BCS as it automatic qualifier you're thinking is happy yeah but you know it was interested in talking to Mike this morning about that some of the things he's done units here he's talking about this conference and the wind that West Virginia had in that Sugar Bowl in 2006 over Georgia he said it was the biggest win in the history of this conference in any sport because everybody was down on them and badmouthing his conference in football and that legitimized this for this conference and you see it's really gotten better over the last four years well you're right your praise of Commissioner trendy Zia meant him for a long time have to know him first to basketball like yes but he's a very very honorable guy high character fella and his double magnificent job is the Commissioner of this conference yeah it's been a very good year for the Big East Cincinnati of course was the surprise out of that but what Rutgers did I mean they just looked awful at the beginning of the season they run off six in a row to get boiled does it contain trying to break the pact about the 40 and it's a gain of 22 yards on the play go ahead Gio Gonzalez and he's a senior and he's out of Tampa flu so you think this game is not a little more special to him they're out and Tito's a young man who had that huge catch that 79 yard touchdown last year in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl but it's hard to put into words what a senior day is like it's so emotional you try to suck in all of the moments but it's nice for a young man to get a nice catch at least one in his last game the minute incomplete now a flag comes in now this is interesting the official courses it did not proclaim the man away from it big murphy working against our net yeah and I think what Murphy came up saying was that this ball was uncatchable but Murphy preferred number three on the decline 15yard penalty for salary well Murphy was beat on the play and so what in college football with it just being a yardage penalty not a spot penalty you might as well take the man down but when you stand up and say it's uncatchable would you tackle the man well you've never different never no no I think that was the right call if it been thrown a little farther but yes a tackle should go if the ball is close wife under heavy pressure and he's just going to run out of bounds was there a flag because where there was a tackle but what are the odds of live with it yeah yeah I think they got the right guard figner Blitzer came inside 73 on the offense 10yard penalty first out Keyon Wilson came on the Blitz and figner had no choice here's figner right here you can see the Blitz come inside that's their first penalty of the night and that that's a mistake offensive line that's a technique mistake finger dropped his head and as soon as you drop your head against a player who's quicker than you if that guy gets an edge the body will go where the head is if you put your head down you're going to start to fall and that's why you had the hole second down did a bit of an opening right here in the pine will be stopped as he takes it inside the 45 it's going to be a data for Nate Allen there defensively we look over the clock now at 5:45 left in the third quarter West Virginia 13 to 7 they would love dearly to pick up a touchdown but another field goal wouldn't hurt their feelings either to make it a two score game get protection this time is down white maintains his footing enough I thought he picked up the first down but I don't think the spot is going to give him that Mackenzie was the guy who was forcing our Easter sorry often I don't use the fourth out and excuse me Ron but because he declined the penalty fourth and eight it's safe to say that West Virginia is going to pump this away but I would be now you're excusing force and 11 yeah you're going to pump this do we feel about fourth and seven yeah I'd be concerned if I Rafael Florida West Bend you may take this I don't think they're insane now let's keep an eye on this situation because McAfee on the very first punt of the night as Edwards is back deep almost had it blocked and infected the defensive player ran too far past the football the stick knows going to hit on the tool and go into the Enzo to get credit for 43yard boot timeout 451 left third quarter 13 to 7 Mountaineers and to donate to the V foundation for cancer research 1800 for Jimmy V or log on to www.mptv.org/outdoorwisconsin South Florida from their own 20yard line he is not only going to have the first down he's going to have for more gain of 14 on the play Jack arute let's check with you you know guys it was interesting to watch macaroni while this defense was out on the field he wasn't upset he in fact he was joking around in a big smile on his face you really get the impression that this kid is very calm tonight despite the fact that is you alluded to that maybe sometimes he starts to think about putting too much on his shoulders not this time didn't talked upstairs at all during that last series so Glover Jack thanks very much for the report we were looking down trying to make sure we had the number correct but this is a Sydney Glover who has had an outstanding ballgame tonight for the Mountaineers who is down on the field and being attended to by the medical staff and Witney next let's check with you back at the studio Ron thank you very much we'll get caught up Stannis big 12 championship game in which Oklahoma has pulled away a couple of touchdowns here for the Sooners first Moses would do a 12 yard run Chris Brown will punch one in from six two hours out and Oklahoma clearly in control 38 7 second half just barely underway this game going on over on ABC on ESPN Arizona leading arrow is going to say 2110 about four and a half to go in the third quarter thanks Wendy back here in Morgantown 13 to 7 our score then the Glover took a government to the the stomacher just below again so he is down for the count and looks as though he's going to be ok as they got to help him off the field I don't know how quickly he's going to be able to come back into action though Rowen as we roll into tomorrow when the BCS will announce its final you've got to assume that with a convincing win Oklahoma will go to at least number two if not number one of course Florida beat Alabama today so both of those teams with one loss there was a chance if Florida did not play well or one in a way that wasn't convincing or seemed like they got lucky that Texas would have been able to sneak in because Florida needed help in the human polls because Texas has lead in the computer polls is so great community this week but I think that that wins by Gorda today in a very tightly contested good ballgame is going to be enough to put them into the national championship game against Oklahoma well in case you missed it Virginia Tech winning the ACC defeating Boston College and doing it convincingly 32:12 East Carolina that was a thriller and the Conference USA defeats Tulsa 27:24 and the other one the big 12 title game it's going on right now and it's all Oklahoma and virtually nothing Missouri 38 to 7 and last night what a great great performance by Buffalo against Ball State it's amazing what Turner Gill has been able to do with that Buffalo program in short order if his name will start to come up for bigger and better jobs now boy I tell you what I talked about echoing praise a minute ago I mean this now Turner Gill last night I've never been any happier for anybody in my life one of the things that Turner has done you know he has not been reluctant at all he has come up he went back to to a lesser situation as far as coaching to pay his dues a lot of his fellow coaches need to look at what he's done and where it's going to give it that pass thrown complete at the 40 investor killed the minute he catches the football gain of six well you know there's all that talk with Mike Leach who was a candidate for the Washington job his name's been brought up at Auburn how perfect the fit with Turner Gill who obviously has the background in Nebraska fit at a place like Texas Tech perhaps coming back into the big 12 suggest one little stranger things have happened I just know he got a lot of mileage last night and for good reason this play is going to be enough I don't think he gave anything in luge or is the man who led the way so very big play here as we come down the homestretch in the third quarter for South Florida they have not been able to get anything going in the SEC of the head well as tough a night as Brophy has had to come with a couple of throws I would want to run him here maybe a quarterback draw something like that let him try to make some people miss and pick up this first down here comes pressure ball is delivered hands it complete fit for the first down at the 47 Jessie Hester and you know it's interesting on that play right there a couple of defensive players were screaming to ten they say they're about to snap the ball and they were still kind of walking around and looking in other directions but even back toward the sidewalk now in tough loss to lose Sidney Glover that strong safety position starting to rotate some guys in there but that's a guy he's not only having a monster game tonight but he's been playing so well and they said that light went on in that Auburn game so there may be some confusion with Glover out of the line first down for their own 47 Grothe wants to throw and go on top and has a man that he just overthrew him but about three yards jack arute let's check with you we're out for himself a John Glover's condition they checked his right knee that seems to be the concern they went through all the exercises and they couldn't see anything they've now put them on the bike to see if they can loosen it up just a little bit that's one of the downside guys when you play in very cold weather it sometimes will mask and disguise a minor that could be a major injury so that is letter trading staff paid a lot of attention but wouldn't surprise me if he passes this bicycle test if he might find his way back back out there okay Jack Grothe by the way 15 of 22 149 yards and the two interceptions growth of the time get away this time tackle box I think there's they're going to get a hold in the middle of this offensive line me up when growth he went to take off he hesitated for half a second holding 78 on the offense 10yard penalty second down it's a marked dial the left tackle that they get for the hole but as Brophy goes to take off it actually dials working on the right side yeah that's a wraparound block on number 97 Julian Miller I would say that that was a fold for sure as soon as those hands go outside the frame you know don't let you get away with a lot when your hands are inside as soon as they get outside that frame you're holding on their info second down they got to take it all the way down to the 43 of West Virginia go three near sideline and the ball incomplete thrown too too tall Monday night the two teams perched at the top of the NFC South with identical nine and three records Tampa Bay at Carolina Monday Night Football on ESPN at 8:30 Easter's Cup against 7 o'clock with Monday night countdown delivered by UPS now so far South Florida is 80% on third down conversions 8 of 10 I got a long way to go on this one no all the way across midfield girthy gets it out of the backfield and the ball is thrown incomplete has been Williams it turned backwards was backing up trying to catch him if he got whacked by Holmes you know a lot has been talked about in these parts about West Virginia's offense just not as explosive as it was last year of course when you lose some of the people that they lost including Steve Slaton you're going to have a little fall off but what the defense has done a heck of a job for West Virginia not a lot of people knew the names coming in because they replace so many starters but they've really stood up for the challenge this year Albarado waits for the snap and boots this one very high again not real long but a good coverage kick and the fair catch is made this is 24 by Inkster and will hold it right here reminder Tuesday night 7 o'clock on ESPN the Jimmy Dean men's basketball classic number 24 davidson and takes on West Virginia you'll see a couple of the nation's best threepoint shooters Davidson Stephen Curry against West Virginia's amateur on the Jimmy V men's classic Game one Davidson West Virginia Texas takes on Villanova in game number two curry with 44 points in his last outing Sacco Huggins at the hotel this afternoon after they one of her Cleveland States by 10 points and here comes a late flag down we may have a takedown by one of the offensive linemen and I asked him morning 7990 offense 10yard penalty first down that's three holds in like the last five plays anyway just to complete the thought on Coach Huggins and what he had to say I said how do you like this team and he said I like it but we can't shoot he said I have them that messed up if they can't shoot and that's what we've got to get out of we got we're in a rut so but anyway they won they won a close one on the road at the Ole Miss the other night with the penalty first down going to take it out to the 34 yard line and it will take it for a gain to the 22 yard line at 7 on the carry titer Roberts defensively jock Sanders with a pretty good block on the play to help his teammate get him almost back to where the spot of they had been sitting before the offensive holding Col Jacques Sanders a guy who had that ankle sprain earlier in the game was playing mostly running back yeah in the first quarter now back to his more natural position at the slot wide receiver and white dumps it out of the backfield and here's Devine again and Morel is tackled by Murphy this is nice management by that white and offensive coordinator Jeff Mullen you get that big penalty on first down the backs you up and you get a couple of little plays and when you have a guy like Devine he's such an explosive talent find a couple of different ways to get him the ball and now you put yourself in position 3rd and 7 where you don't necessarily have to throw it this could be the last play of the third quarter as they are taking their time it's a third down they need to take it out to the 34 yard line to pick up the first down here comes Devine turns the corner twice he's got with the second effort out over the 40yard line gain of 14 and the clock will run down here and we'll head to the final 15 with the West Virginia Mountaineers not only leading but extending this current drive as you watch this effort and good blocking on the edge there to spring Devine it was interesting he can run so close to the ground and he's only 580 really kind of hides a little bit does he he does and he's not a very big guy but sometimes hard to tackle because you don't have a lot of surface to the ground so that's the end of three quarters and as we head to the final 15 minutes West Virginia 13 to 7 sweep winning and losing second so we are back in a postcard from Morgantown West Virginia Christmas parade is everybody is getting in the spirit of what we got is kind of weather with the snow coming down and it's a very chilly temperature is easy earth to get really into the the spirit of the holidays which are upon us and a whiteout tonight in honor of Pat white one of the greatest players to ever put on a mountaineer uniform flames lasting home stable playaction here he steps up going to go long the ball is dropped not usually a situation for Tito Gonzalez in being the seniors I had mentioned just a moment ago he would love more than anything to go out with nicholae a touchdown from his fellow senior now mr. white and that ball was put on the money and Gonzalez just didn't quite run through it he went to start falling down to catch it which he didn't have to do necessarily let's look right through his fingers endless running play good second effort that is not going to go for much Italy third down and long the interesting thing about Pat white and of course but those of you who know Sam Huff the great linebacker plays so many years with Washington Redskins is all along with this school and his number is retired and there are a lot of people who think that Pat's numbers should be retired as well it doesn't mean it's not going to be used anymore but they put it in a retired situation and they think that he has given this program every bit that that Sam did is hard bringing recognition and good things positive thing asset the far sideline it's a little bit long it would be fish that aren't the other one but before the ballgame I'm going to show you this that this has been the snow pit really cover you see a lot of footsteps around people taking pictures around that but they took a snow plow and made that the number five out on the field to pay tribute to him and then they made it a dollar sign yeah running right through the middle of it which is hopefully what Pat White will be doing next year for playing football yeah getting some of those dollar signs of Daphne Alabama is going to be roughing the kicker the ball goes back inside the 10yard line AdWords will be made before the 10yard line let's see I don't think just giving that's personal buffer roughing number two on the defense 15yard penalty first down Renton Washington it is the man who who came in to hit McAfee let me ask you something Mac is excited that he's getting run unto he's it I mean he loves contacted yeah the head coach said he loves to get down the field and to make to make tackles well and this is this is another huge penalty and West Virginia lines up so funky on there plus protection it really don't put anybody over the right side which i think is a pretty dangerous thing to do because it does kind of give a free run at your full at your partner I'm not so sure what Bill Stewart is upset with a player I think you might be upset with Marone because I think grownman fit Turner out of balance but McAfee where's that lighter version excuse me I'm sorry we do have to check with the redhead I think you're exactly right we may have had a second penalty or are they going to they're going to review it I'm sorry and complete you thought it or they seen if it's tipped yeah they're going to check again if this exact same thing that happened last time where they initially said the ball was tipped so there can be no roughing or running into the kicker on this one if you go super slow you know it doesn't look like it and you I didn't hear it you know you can usually hear that hell burn down the place dance is called on the field and what they were reviewing was if that ball was tipped then there couldn't be the penalty which is exactly what they reviewed before and threw the flag the last time once they realized it hadn't been touched McAfee is a special guy I think talking about NFL futures I think that that McAfee idea to maybe player maybe kicker maybe blue boat now I think he thinks that the positioning of the hash marks improving is going to help him as far as take it away some of the forces we're angry the offense fiveyard penalty first down this game has just totally come to a halt Pat white throws his hands up like what in the world is going on they broke the huddle with 12 men so they get a penalty now after getting the ball back in great field position they get a give them back out there and white was I think upset with what came from upstairs he's looking at the press box like come on guys he's looking up for coach Mullin not happy with what happened be careful now things get little chippy is as white is fall down out of bounds by McKinsey clock stops 1359 I think what we need to do right now is just let this clock continue to move and the too many stoppages here at the last few minutes well from the crowd's reaction watching on the big screen they obviously wanted to lay head oh boy that white gets the pass away dappled well over chrome and write those down hard as a 45 well that white is not happy and if we go back and look at this other play yeah I don't know how you don't call it he gets dragged down by McKenzie way out of bounds and that white who's a very calm demeanor guy went right up there less over anything yeah but he had every right to that that should have been a 15yard penalty on that out of bounds for so it's third down they need to take it all the way to the South Florida 32 yard line has it competed at the 22 to jock standard good for 26yard standard a talented Jacque Sanders who's been bouncing back and forth from slot receivers to running back runs a post route and Pat white saw him right away knew that that's where he wanted to go and throws a nice pass in the middle that was just a nice move on Bichette but Pat white because of the penalty on the punt getting the chance to maybe put a little icing on this score for his last in so the ball is really still loose they paid for it and it looks as though I think South Florida yes South Florida has made a recovery that's Jorge Silva well white never handled the snap and I think he made a large error by trying to pick it up and make a play with the ball well I'm sorry that ball just squirted came right you know that can happen in the bunker with his foot when he kicked it away from himself yeah then and what he needed to do was just go slide and try to don't try to pick it up just fall on the mistake he made was trying to pick it up but that ball came out funny Erik joke the center slipped right out of his hand so Matt Brophy hands the ball off and a running play just straight inside it's going to go for short yardage with more South Florida and night our 2007 that led the NC doublea in turnovers forced with 42 and so far this year they have forced 17 and remember South Florida has beaten West Virginia two years in a row and in those two losses combined ten turnovers for West Virginia so that has been the problem for West Virginia playing South Florida and now because of that turnover fell forward of looking for a chance to take the lead towards the ballcarrier takes it to the 42 Slavonic on the defensive play one thing we have not seen much of from South Florida our stretch type outside plays everything is bit into the middle on a third short you can try a run play here wondering if maybe trying to get to the outside might be the right way to go timeout has been called by South Florida 11:58 left in our ballgame 13 to 7 West Virginia rule 1 4 9 G says that the rules now for him any attempt to record either by video or audio means the signals given by an opposing player coach or other team personnel now understand one thing Jim let us not say he is joking what's he done man if the young man has a camera and now the official goes over that's what he pointed it yeah and the young man is wearing West Virginia gear I'm having a good time with it but trust me Jim loved it did not want somebody in West Virginia gear filming their footnotes third that lying to make the 46 to see the players asking for more noise equal to the middle gotta man up there the over three by five yards good heavens I mean will T had exactly what they were looking for and he just flat overthrew it boy you know as well as growth he played at times in that first half nice little stutter there by love runs right by the corner music HP that's six yeah yeah that's absolutely sick you know what he did was he drove that ball he threw it flat and and that's hard for a receiver to adjust to you've got to put just a little bit more air and allow love to run under but growth he's going to have nightmares about Alvarado this one is that such a huge West Virginia balance and is going to come back to rest at the 33 so we'll hold it right here with the 1143 left of their ballgame but get your weekly dose of NFL news and analysis on ESPN Sunday first at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Chris Berman plays host to Sunday NFL countdown then it's set the puck Eastern Chris Berman and John Saunders delivered the day's highlights and scores here in sports it Saturday Tech holding number 57 on the return team 10yard penalty first down well I didn't even see that penalty flag anyone finish this I'm still doing Gone with the Wind sunday NFL countdown presented by IBM and SportsCenter presented by Bud Light on ESPN Sunday well and now that white who the last two times he's played against South Florida in losses and battled injuries in 2006 II played with a severely sprained ankle it was very limited last year's knocked out with a thigh bruise now in his last ball game probably getting tired and not being able to put the more points on the board get uncomfortable Noel Devine looking for a spot to run and just not much there Jack arute what do you got boards on you and I and they'd know that there's all these players just rally around Pat White when he got pushed out of there and out of bounds and they got a little chippy first thing he did when he came over to the sidelines he went to every single player on the offense and said look we've got to use our heads don't worry about it just stay focused and use your head I think that's pretty heavy on his part thinking hey they may try to protect me and I don't need it yeah and then as you said Jack but the kind of young man he's been stable to the 30yard line if you gave him sick Wow that ball that's one defender reached in did come loose but very lucky that he could grab it and it ends young the good he sure did but that was a very headsup thing for that white to tell his teammates because it's always the guy who hits back or pushes back who gets called and he didn't want any of his teammates getting it it's tough enough going right now against the South Florida defense and Western in the often struggling we don't need a 15yard penalty third down and it's short we need to take it out for the 33 yard line half the first time Noel Devine will have six yards young on the tackle but those kind of extra efforts are coming up big right now because officer clock is about to go under ten minutes left in our contest you can see the snow coming down now harder than it has just about the entire evening and combined over 13 excuse me over 1200 yards now on the season he shortened play shorter because he bends over that ball and he's at that fort he's gone scramble board at the 38yard line for the bottom that pile been on the field few of those there's some polling and graben going on you are kicking doing whatever you can to try beautiful West Virginia football boy it looked as though the Bulls had recovered this thing looks to me like it may have been yeah it was George salving coming over he didn't he didn't necessarily get a hit on the ball divine darts rotted I believe he wound up with it it has a price situation so second down and he's going to wind up with three yards gained on the play and it's hard to flush it and a ball carrier for not handling the ball with these kind of conditions of this kind low temperature the pressure now he's loose but the near sideline wait we'll take it for the first down at the 47 yard line how about that well you got a figure in pat white last game you're going to have to see at least one of these plays watch Shelby he's just going to keep its vintage it's going to come right inside completely unblocked and white just sees him at the very last second side steps have been picks up the first down it's almost like you almost had to have one of these plays in Pat White's last game well the Georgia upset with himself that he is such a good player and a day when you got a small guy as quick as that white is sometimes it's just almost impossible when their offense to bring them down as divine catches that one speaking of guys in space that are tough to bring down it's a gain of nine yards again a minute ago I said we're about to go under 10 we're about to go under 8 minutes and this drive just continues chip chip chip in away and it's the quarterback white which will scramble that kept it going on that third down and then that time he had three routes he was looking at downfield nothing nothing nothing good protection we take the check down and you pick up eight yards eight and a half oh it not capricious darn close to it the bond is beginning to fetal you don't have to be a big running back to kind of get lathered like the larger running backs do you start to get that reading the feeling is start heating up and right now it appears as though that Noelle is getting that feeling and the defensive coaches for South Florida talked about this they said he is so elusive and when he gets you in space he's very very hard to tackle and he does a thing where he kind of hops behind a lineman and then he and then he bounces to the other side and and you watch when he comes to the line of scrimmage he's kind of huddled over the ball so he gets lost in yep give it to him again broke the tackle and he'll take it down to the 30yard line Jack arute let's check with you guys is one reason why Noel Devine does that study in Barry Sanders he said only things that he saw was the way Barry as slight as he was would hide until the last minute behind his linemen and then dart out so ever since he was a youngster he tried to emulate his hero Hey Jackie's 15 carries tonight for 19 one yard and remember he didn't play in the first quarter yes now for sure well and he does something else Barry Sanders did that jump cut and a lot of guys work on that now where they'll get to one side and instead of taking steps to move their body they actually jump over and they cover that ground faster I've seen him do that five or six times it's a great effect tonight clock is now under 7 continuing to run Pat white in fact he's milking that clock for every second they can get off of it snap the ball with about 12 seconds on the clock now wait for the key block to get us made outside and the quarterback almost helped me pick up a first down well how many times have you seen a play like this where the quarterback has to get involved and they don't really know what to do but watch number 5 comes all the way it comes back and gets a cut block on Tyrone McKenzie I mean that's most guys would just kind of get in the way he threw his head in there and got a cut block on the outside linebacker that's the reason your teammates love you they do things like that third down and I mean probably just a quarter to nice defensive charge and penetration by McKinsey and the play blows up and that is a very large loss minus 6 on the play and with that minus 6 you've now got a much longer field goal it was Selvi who came in and made divine try to bounce to the outside and now you're in a very long field goal situation because that lost yardage well McAfee is on the field and this looks as though it's going to be like a 48 yard attempt from the near hash mark this time heading into the wind does he have the distance no ride left no good take a timeout 536 left 13 to 7 West Virgina holding on ESPN college football primetime is presented by Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay and in part by the 2009 Cadillac CTS so welcome back to Morgantown Ron Franklin the Cunningham Jack arute coming to you from a snowy Saturday evening in Morgantown by the way South Florida's not started to drive be gone their own 36 yard line this evening and right now they scrimmage from the roam 31 when they play to the right side that's going to be a gain of about eight by mic board now the defense has been sold where they made a lot of really good changes at hand time South Florida until that last play only had 56 total yards in the second half so West Virginia's defense has done the job but what chipped out a watch right now you only got a sixpoint lead you bust one assignment he was half the case a while to go with the overthrown pass it would have caught for a touchdown can't let it happen right now get real the ball carrier slips down the Williams lost his pudding and I think that's the first time tonight we've seen where the weather had an impact on the pudding because that was a pretty standard cut by Williams and he lost his footing coming back but because of that slip now you're in your third down in to situation you know we haven't seen from Grothe tonight the wide receiver screen you get triple receivers over here to the left maybe a little wide receiver screen to try to pick this up or just trying to spread them out let Grothe take it for the first down groping throws incomplete that I mean to heat through it if the only spot he could have to get a completion it's good for six yards to bogan and it's a number of the first down and that's a big offensive lineman and not much depth on this offensive line for South Florida so we can't lose him they only had six guys that they like to play with but boy that where that was thrown right there because Allen was reached out trying to get that we'll see you yeah they're there to call a timeout because even though Ryan Schmidt is trying to fake like he's not hurt I think the referee thinks that he is is going to have to have him go off fiftyfive right not many guys that can come in maybe Zack Herrmann they only have really one or two backups and they're not being charged for the time out now if they were that would leave them with only one but they still have two timeouts remaining clock starts to run again at 355 and Counting Jeremiah Warren and two ball game there that offensive one growth it deep down the middle and the ball is tipped incomplete sans working against AJ love well that ball seemed to hang up there forever did ya I'm just not quite sure why not Grothe needs to be throwing this ball and they were all deep routes I think just the deep ball that's just such a long throwing motion if ball came out funny and really hung up in the air and the receiver love made a good play on it but boy growth he's just throwing a couple balls downfield very poor he puts A Beka will fill except for their fast off his teammates back then as it rolled down his back growth it lots of times pressure and he throws incomplete had two receivers right there of the area yeah and this was confusion by the receivers not knowing who kerothi was throwing to and I think that the underneath receiver Johnson bogan yeah watch as broke he breaks out he can have a receiver here and another receiver coming back after the play he's going to break out and he throw it to the longer receiver but it did it was bogan who didn't know that and tipped it so that the receiver behind him couldn't make the catch they throw on third down they get the first out of the 40 yard line to AJ love and it's a gain of 15 block stops momentarily three minutes 27 seconds left in the ballgame Mountaineers lead it but only by six and think about that white standing on the West Virginia sidelines a couple of Miss opportunities they didn't call that personal foul when he was hit out of bounds but then that third and one that was the key play that six yard loss and there's Pat white whose last name having to watch Matt growth we bring this ballclub downhill growth e35 inside the 30 inside the 25 legs to will finally make the tackle but it's a gain of 15 yards in its first down South Florida with plenty of time two minutes 59 seconds and the clock running and if I were South Florida right now I know you don't want to get out of the rhythm but if I were South Florida I would eat as much of this clock as humanly possible and for West Virginia you've got to think about some of these timeouts at some point well South Florida just gets called with an illegal substitution first out so it's going to make it first down and 15 and that will stop the clock which helps out West Virginia Grothe now for 2000 yards rushing in his career you see the passing numbers and total 9910 he's chasing that white to see who will be the alltime leader in that statistic in big E's history of course Brophy with another season of eligibility here comes Taylor near sideline gets a block picks it to the sidelines and he's going to have a gain of about eight on the play and here is where let's see the play clock we're at 32 right now if I work cell Florida I would let this thing get down to 15 or 10 they are not in hurry up they don't need to be but West Virginia sitting on those three timeouts you don't want to think it's inevitable they're going to score but if they do you need some time if Glover's still not back in the ball game after that injury he's been huge for them tonight pressure going to be set on a second down and six sacked by JT Thomas a loss of six on the play and now South Florida wants to use one of their two timeouts to talk it over they got a third down and they need to take it all the way to the 15yard line you know we use that term red zone all the time you know what that means for an offense beware of the Blitz we will take a timeout West Virginia hanging on 140 left at our ball game so pad white sitting on the sidelines waiting very patiently and for his defensive friends the situation is a third down and about 14 yards for South Florida to pick up the first down and a movement if the line of scrimmage is the wide receiver came off the ball before it was snapped Wow all start 89 offense fiveyard penalty first down well you are in for you're definitely going to go for it on fourth down so you back it up five little receiver up top you back it up five now you've got to think about a play where you feel like you're going to get between eight and ten maybe 12 yards so then you have a manageable fourth down 1:40 left in the ballgame growth it great protection again looking looking now the livers going to make all at the 15yard line first in ten South Florida a gain of 18 yards to Marcus Edwards well Marcus Edwards is just having a whale of a ballgame tonight this is an excellent job remember those two catches he had in a row top receiver Edwards watch how he stays alive he's just getting backed by the sticks and that's just awful awful coverage the cornerback dropped entirely too far off of that when it was that far for a first down that the cornerback did not find where the first down marker it was first down at the 15 actually about the 14 and a half yard when the clock is all the way down the 101 running play get in neck down boy lost Jamar Taylor by IV for div drops him for a loss and the down now really doesn't matter because the clock is continuing to run it it's in 50 seconds and what West Virginia is going to do they pending this on their feet fence if they're not going to use these timeouts to save any time for their office they're relying on their defense to win the games within right here 38 seconds 37 Grothe throws for the endzone overthrew his receiver Hester was the man that he wanted and Hester got turned around in the past was a bit too tall clock stops 33 seconds and now you're in a third down situation with 33 seconds you're in the ballpark of five to six plays so if you pick up the first you can still go up and kill it and you have that one timeout and if you want to try to keep that in your pocket although four down territory you can't use it shorter to stick to that will take it to the five to pick up the first down wealthy right over the middle incomplete love was the intended receiver and it's now going to be a fourth down situation that was just a bad looking pass right from the start Grothe was looking for the slam I just the receiver didn't see it they didn't know it and here here we come because you've got 30 seconds left offense has gone to the far sideline defense has come to the near sideline we got 30 seconds left in the ballgame it is fourth down and they got to take it to the five and let's take a look at key plays in this ballgame that I did well it's been a couple of turnovers down in the red zone for South Florida the fumble by Ford and that was Glover who's been out since he took a shot to his knee and had the interception in the fourth quarter the defense for South Florida has stood up to the challenge six yards Lawson you got to think they don't lose that six large McAfee probably makes that in it's a two score game so South Florida has hung in this game because their defense the offense has really done no favors here you are fourth down you got to pick up the first I think some type of fade might work back white down on the sideline you see him in the Box on the bottom leg final game here in Morgantown for him fourth down and you got to take it to the fiveyard line and a timeout has just been called by West Virginia they still have one left Wow right now let's take a look at the nine sharp image HD image of the ball game these seniors being introduced here tonight annotations all time quarterback rushing leader number five Pat white now that just before the ballgame tonight as the seniors were being introduced and the ones that we went to lunch with yesterday talked about what a mob scene was going to be in Holi motion right now emotions are running high because it's fourth down and Mountaineers need to stop South Florida right here leading by six 13 to 7 openko for the endzone and it is incomplete and overthrown Taurus Johnson the intrepid receivers and Johnson wanted pass interference and I'm not so sure he shouldn't have gotten it I believe it was Liang ster coming off his assignment Johnson was the inside receiver and watch at the very end of the play like ster comes to try to make a play and as Johnson works back to it runs into him I'm not so sure I think Johnson could have made a play in Johnson with his arms up I'm not so sure that he shouldn't have got the goal and it would have been first and goal from the 2 yard line instead that white gets to come out for the last time take a knee so he'll get the snack take a d21 seconds counting down they do not have to run another play the Mountaineers are going to win this ballgame 13 to 7 as the snow really starts to fall again white this evening the 14 of 2341 yards in a touchdown passing and rushing 15 for a total of 40 well it was a special week here in
