============================================================

welcome to the dr. pepper championship drive game of the week big ten November weather as it should be welcome to ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers and the second part of our big 10 DS 2 showdown doubleheader rain falling temperatures dropping here in Columbus as the undefeated Buckeyes July with the 9 and 1 Spartans of Michigan State both teams control their destiny for this division and they believe for the cops football player Ohio's ain't in good position but Michigan State if they went out should be no lower than 5th and potentially in that top 4 bracket so the stage is set Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit will talk about the many plot lines but Kirk the headline has to be bad news for Michigan State it appears that Connor Cook their quarterback who has 32 wins in his career will not be able to play a role in this game the Ohio slammed down last baguettes Maryland didn't return for the second half didn't throw much this week in obvious pain a huge disappointment for him the Kirk base what we saw him warm up just doesn't look like he can deliver the ball with velocity this is pretty much what he looked like in warmups the entire time you could tell he just could not put any velocity on the ball and I think it's been bothering him all week and so would be shocked if he ends up playing so you're turning to a couple backups that don't have a lot of game experience Tyler O'Connor is too true back up to junior out of Ohio has played some he threw 11 passes last week against Maryland and then Damian Terry is a little bit of an xfactor to me more of a dual threat guy a guy who could run some zone Reed I think he plays a big role today if in fact Cooke is out because as an athletic guy that can run zone read it's a good way to try to slow down an athletic Ohio State defense a massive challenge for both those quarterbacks in their first start in this hostile environment all the emotion of senior day and a putt guy defense is playing lightsout football Buckeye offense still looking to click with JD Barrett and the running game they've been strong but can we see some extra dimensions today well I think that's the big thing for Ohio State you're right they've been a bit onedimensional relying so much on Zeke alie and starting today and they realize this JT Barrett not just running but his ability to by running creates some oneonone opportunities on the perimeter I look for Ohio State to get the ball on the edge Jalen Marshall Braxton Miller Michael Thomas as quickly as they can because that pass rust from Michigan State is the real deal so JT Barrett we looking to throw and run today against the Spartans and you get a feeling that Roxton Miller who switched back to his old number 5 on Senior Day would love to have a big performance and say farewell to this crowd nothing Urban Meyer might be in a sentimental mood so keep an eye on that got a feel for that yesterday you're right last game here at the shoe and after everything he's done for Urban Meyer and throw high o stay they may have a wrinkle or two for number 5 Buckeyes undefeated many say they've underachieved this is their first ranked opponent the national anthem now from Ohio Stadium saw the tearful face of Ezekiel Elliott lots of emotion high stakes the Spartans and the Buckeyes coming up from Columbus near an Ohio Stadium the rain arrived sooner than the forecasters expected at temperature 48 it will drop he could have some snow that's the blue when the radar approaching Columbus so the weather could become a wintry mix by the second half of this game a serious challenge for both offenses and especially for Michigan State with an inexperienced quarterback again we think Connor cook will be unable to go today Chris thanks so much Mark Dantonio told me moments ago that there was one determining factor as to whether Connor cook would go or not and that word was velocity how much is dip what do you have on the ball during warmups remember Connor cook did not throw a ball all week long so this was the first time he truly tested that shoulder then Dantonio said we'll go into the locker room I'll talk to him and make a final decision but during warmups guys Connor cook took one out of that every six reps and really deferred to his backups and don't forget Connor cook and this entire team have been fueled all week by being the underdogs they've been thriving in on that but if Connor cook can do go that underdogs dad has just gotten a whole lot bigger for sure Heather cook is not a captain much has been made of that but he is out with the Spartans for the coin toss with the captains of this team massive disappointment for a guy I grew up the Cleveland area has never played a game in his home state sit on the sidelines as a redshirt when they beat Ohio State this is a team that has pointed to this game the one lost in Nebraska really brought that chip back brought that edge back that this program is known for they say absolutely it's a football team that has accomplished so much and in the last two years they knocked off the high OH State went on to beat Stanford the Rose Bowl last year great year and ended up with a big win over Baylor they kind of thrive on that underdog role they embrace it but it's gonna be interesting and you take Connor Cook if he in fact ends up not playing you take a guy who's 32 and 4 as a starting quarterback and you turn to a couple young men they just did not played a lot of football tyler o'connor a junior who played a little bit of some mopup duty last week and got into the second half and damian terry really hasn't played a lot of football at all big thing that I would do if I'm Dave Warner trying to get into this football game with a couple young guys has just get them to settle in and try to find what they like what are you comfortable with in this environment try to get them to just get their feet on the ground and go out and execute against one of the more athletic and experienced defenses in the country see Joey Bosa there's been having a tremendous season one of the juniors that is in all likelihood playing their final game in Ohio Stadium as well as the seniors though a talented group of juniors it'll be draft eligible you see JT Barrett Michigan State perhaps wanting to go on defense first he's in the young quarterback won the toss and deferred so Ohio State will get the football to begin only the 44th meeting but guys like commandingly they have split the last four yes both teams have a more pop wanted rivalry with Michigan but really it's this game in recent years whether championships have been won and lost they've been denying each other's dreams and that's the case again today big underdogs without their quarterback there later to kick off here in the horseshoe Kevin Cronin booted away Curtis Samuel is deep and so we'll see JT Barrett who was absolutely on fire in East Lansing last year at a 300yard passing game three touchdowns Kirk he also ran 486 and two touchdowns it's what he really seemed to arrive as a playmaker coming out party as a quarterback really for Ohio State as a team when they would update Lansing and won that football game in the way that they did but you're right he ran and he threw maybe had one of his best games of his career will be interested to see how Michigan State tries to defend him this year compared to playing so much mantoman coverage a year ago option look Baron a keeper hit hard and knocked down that was Lawrence Thomas the defensive end this is a very strong Michigan State defensive front clearly the strength of this defense along with the line back here exactly right if Michigan State's going to come on the road especially losing potentially you know your starting quarterback the defensive line has got to be physical they've got to win the battle at the line of scrimmage second and 11 knock down short up to 30 it'll be a third down and about six for Ohio State when you have a dominant defensive line kind of like we saw really last week with Oklahoma it can free you up to not have to take as many risk and play mantoman and isolate a inexperienced secondary that sometimes has been vulnerable this year so defensive line pressure on these first two plays and good coverage there on that play didn't allow Barrett to do anything with the ball recent years third and long against the Spartans has been in trouble but this has been a trouble spot for this defense allowing conversions and we'll be stopped short so Chris frying him up from his linebacker position of the Buckeyes go three and out it's funny Chris Fry who's from Upper Arlington Ohio which chris is about a 9iron from right here I mean he grew up back close growing up and probably loving the Buckeyes he makes a great play right here coming all the way from the back side and because of his effort here that play right there prevent it JT Barrett from getting that first down that's great effort by fry my own say it's been a slow starting offense touchdowns and only two of their opening possessions this season so Cameron Johnston having the best year of any punter in the country I believe Ozzie boots it down and in traffic the bear catch is made by McGarrett Kings at the 25yard line so who will get the starting nod looks like it'll be Damian Terry the sophomore from Erie Pennsylvania who's a terrific runner but has had almost no experience throwing the football doesn't have a touchdown pass in his career hasn't thrown an interception what is 3 Kirk that's it yeah young quarterback 1 2 3 but he has run the football and he's known more really for his ability to run he's a big back I'm a big quarterback 63 235 pounds and again we got to reiterate here losing Connor Cook 32 and 4 now instead of Danny turn by the way flipping back before Tyler O'Conner instead comes into jr. Joey was in the huddle of an O'Conner trotted out so he's making his score start Gerald Holmes is the tailback and he's got it the sophomore who's emerged as one of the workforce is still fighting for yards knocked down after a very determined first down run yeah he sure did he did not give up on that nobody wrapped him up so he's keeping his legs churning and the Ohio State maybe lost him there in that pile but good effort there to pick up eight yards Carroll High o Staton defensively you've heard all week about Connor cook he might play he might not play all of a sudden you see the inexperience back there your pen in your ears back and you're coming after a young quarterback and you're coming after the Michigan State running game second in short just short of the marker O'Connor that early action in the win over Maryland it caught him by surprise it was Mark Dantonio just feeling that he needed so quality reps and what has that look like a smart decision now with Cooke getting hurt later on because there seems in the way it's gone they have not really blown a lot of people out and Connor is the backup hasn't gotten a lot of reps and what's unfortunate for Michigan State is usually a strength of centers has been their running game but they've not been able to run the ball this year that the way they have in a pass looked if it's been on their passing game beat a half yard and third down connor sneaks it and they will move the chains fourthyear guy in the system so he knows everything about this offense and he's a better runner than Connor cook but this is just a big big task against this defense that has been smothering people they think Ohio State playing better defense now than in the championship run do you agree absolutely the way Joey Bosa has played and I think Darren leaves the rest of bond felt risk to these guys at the Josh Barry they bring a lot of experience to the table they put a lot of confidence right now is the defense its boza who jumped off you know was so before the ball was snapped Bosa only four sacks so the production in that department weighed down with contact defense but 15 tackles for loss a whole bunch of quarterback hurries 40 tackles having a terrific year Carmack's presents the bright side and look at this michigan state program course the 2013 upset of Ohio State denying the Buckeyes the national title shot went on to beat Stanford in the Rose Bowl they've got four Bowl winning streak first in five after the penalty indirect montage a Shelton the slot receiver knocked down after a short game haven't got a lot of production out of those jet sweeps this year haven't known in that particular case they just called it at the wrong time Ohio State actually brought a blitz from the field and and shifted their entire defensive line into the boundary allowing Taekwon Lewis did not get outflanked he turned that back to the inside and even with the speed as Shelton he could not get outside of the Ohio State defense the throat for the first time completely in the flat a flag comes down as Gerald home he's knocked down short of the marker by Joshua Perry one of the 18 seniors recognized on senior day holding offense number 75 10yard cut of the second down the guard Benny McGowan from Centerville Ohio cried out there and maybe a little bit of too much help fry a little too much effort watch the left guard McGowan 75 he gets beat right guys he just slipped he's trying to get ahold of Adolphus Washington and Washington moved by him so quickly he just ended up wrapping up around his leg so a favorable down in distance and all of a sudden I'm starting to go backwards here I'm Jamie and Terry Kirk he's the sophomore out of Pennsylvania who is a more explosive runner than a look for that matter but very little experience not much room as he ones to the boundary knocked out across the 35 it'll be further along magic Dave Warner as a play caller Michigan State offensive coordinator and prepped all week with the understanding that they might lose Connor cook you go from having a quarterback who's thirty two and four to having a quarterback who's never started a game and now you got to start to put together a package and you're using two quarterbacks so it's premeditated when they want to use carry but it's an interesting challenge especially on the road there's so much at stake it's Terry in there on third and ten dealing with the noise flushed the ball good coverage on the far side by Gary and Conley against Aaron Burr bricks the top receiver and his fourth down at Ohio State well aware by doing their scouting report of how athletic Terry can be and especially on third down sometimes an athletic guy that hasn't played a lot of football the bit the most difficult thing for a defense to defend isn't necessarily him throwing it's him buying time and making the defense get out of position either running for a first down or getting a defensive back to come up and then making a throw that time they played it very very well and stuck in their coverage tricky weather for the specialist this is Jake part partner the redshirt freshman punter collects a low snap it's the Buddha way which is too short for Jaylyn Marshall to have a chance to return bouncing around it'll be down by the Spartans at the 26 yard line second position coming up the middle of his stretch runs we check the Goodyear college football playoff rankings see Michigan State down there at nine but remember they have a chance to beat Ohio State today could beat Iowa in the Big Ten championship game cowboys and Sooners are going to collide next week one of those is going to lose probably Alabama and Florida and the SEC championship game so one of those teams gonna lose Michigan State just by winning out to get to minimum number five any of the top ten teams went out there going to be in the discussion by guys second position and it's Zeke Elliott with his first carry Elliott with a 15 game 100yard streak coming in went back to the middle of last year 125 yards and very much a Heisman candidate got two yards on first hand saw him cheering up during Senior Day sports a junior motional guy Barrett looks to throw off the option behind his receiver it's incomplete sliding to the ground there was Michael Thomas and Riley pull up then longhaired latest bullet a star for the Spartans I should shoot the junior in the middle there number 30 watch him close in these linebackers played down hill what I've seen from Ohio State a team of his struggle and pass protection as they respect Michigan State's pass rush in their defensive line and they are moving JT Barrett out of the pocket almost every pass attempt so far rolling to his left or rolling to his right away from the pressure in Braxton Miller switching back to his number five which he wore as a quarterback early in his career for senior days in the slot the Barrett flips it short to Marshall Marshall has room slips a tackle dark sound at the 45 I think that's the plan from Iowa State they've got to get away from the strength of Michigan State were the defensive line and get the ball out in space where they're a fleet's can make plays forced the linebackers towards the defensive backs to tackle the skill and the speed of guys like Jalen Marshall Curtis Samuel Braxton Miller Michael Thomas and I think they'll continue to go back to that ball out of the hands quick from JT Baron to these athletic receivers and his speed they have on the perimeter now Braxton Miller in the backfield to the left of Barrett it look his way in the flat Braxton throw the ball Kirk but he decides to run with it for a fouryard gain as we check in with cassidy Hubbard for an update from the studio over time between UNC Virginia Tech Marquis Williams Quinn shot for the win the Tar Heels clinched the Coastal Division though police faced Clemson second and six Barrett design run it hard as he falls forward it'll be a third and short Craig Evans one of the defensive tackles who rotates in on the stop is they like to get their defensive lineman to pin their ears back this respect for that front empty backfield on third and three Spartans have been a very good third and short defense and two before not very good and fergan long this year berrak running that's the corner plot down what a tackle flying up was Monty Nicholson the safety to deny a first down when you go empty and even though they've motion in Nick Fannett this is who it's oneonone this guy against this guy can you get to the first down marker he's trying to get right to that 45 yard line heck of a play and he didn't hesitate something that Monty Nichols said would have done early in the year now playing with a different set of confidence different set of skill set that allows him to play and react much quicker that was a heck of a play to keep Barret short of the first down just regained his starting job tackling has been an issue for him this year but not that time he got the message when he got on the bench he's playing with a different attitude he's last couple of weeks urban thought about it for a second fourth and one but sends out Johnson knew it'll do what he does as well as anybody knocked that went deep and the fair catch is made by Kings at the 15yard line so Michigan State's offense makes a stop on third and short gets the ball back scores in Columbus ESPN college football presented by Kay Jewelers Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay The Home Depot were saving more doing an nisa premiere partner of the Heisman Trophy given the high honor on senior day as fourth year sousaphone player Neal Stephan's dotting the I before the game scoreless in our dr. pepper championship drive game of the week is joining us Connor cook unable to go at quarterback the shoulder injury suffered last week just not able to throw the ball with velocity and without pain so we're watching two different quarterbacks Tyler O'Connor who started and that Damian Terry who came on midway through the Spartans first possession Kirk there backed up here at their 15 Laing the tightend motions into the backfield fossa for the second time today jumps offside and the Spartans will get five yards Joey's key that clearly eager today to to get a jump on Cody keelaurow there thank you jack Cal in the center a little bit of credit for the hesitation defense number 97 fiveyard penalty repeat first down you know you go on the road you go silent counter you'll seal fort about clap at a michigan state's case submission the quarterbacks lifting his leg and then watch the center just that slight hesitation instead of putting his head up and snapping it right away Joey Bosa trying to find that rhythm here early and he's jumped a couple times but Jack Allen it's the center on the road using the silent count deserves credit for mixing up when he's snapping the ball Jack down knows every trick of the trade that knew that allamerican candidate at center captain of this team LJ Scott the true freshman tailback is in there but it's a keeper for Terry very much what we expect to see from this sophomore short game and I think that's the schedule report that Ohio State has read on what number six comes into the game is you got to attack the option and then time boy they were flowing well as a unit linebackers coming down here you saw the Taiwan Taekwon Lewis as well making a play now you see more than O'Connor Norma thrower coming into the football game second and two LJ Scott crew freshman who had some high points couple touchdowns against Michigan and his first start but fumbled the ball in his first two carries and rode the bench the rest of the way last week absolutely and it's interesting they go right back to him to show that they have confidence in a know the heck of a block by Donovan Clark on a trap block on Adolphus Washington opened it up and gave Scott enough room to be able to pick up that first down there'll be a lot of physical plays between these running backs the middle linebacker Raekwon McMillan number five l'action honor fire is complete near sideline catch made by aaron Burbridge his 66th of the season in front of the Elan Apple and see that that's when we came into this week that was the matchup everybody wanted to see his Burbridge going matched up mantoman against the Ohio State corners especially Eli Apple who is one of the top corners in the Big Ten and how about the throw by O'Connor puts the ball low and away and gives birth Bridget chance but waived from the defenders a heck of a throw is he's again very early in this game trying to settle in establish some confidence Herbert's closing in on 2,000 yards the rear receiving yards second in for Scott Sutter steps and moves the chains again across the 40 they'll rotate the backs no Spartan back had more than a hundred Ares coming into this game so the opposite of what Zeke Elliott does for Ohio State maybe you mentioned the fumbles by LJ Scott watch him here with the two hands on top of that football he's definitely been thinkin about fumbling the ball or at least trying not to fumble the ball after two attempts last week against Maryland and the two fumbles but if you're just tuning into this game and Connor cook is not in you're seeing both of these quarterbacks from Michigan State and I think this will continue the entire game you're gonna flip back back and forth and back and forth I don't expect him to stick with one guy Terry back in there on first down playaction and takes a deep shot to guys tangled up its incomplete no flag thrown his bond Bell defending on McGarrett Kings got away with one maybe that was shocking it was early in the round and a good job of creating a matchup they feel very very good about Kings matched up even Avant Bell has cover skills there's a lot of contact he raps on to him that's why the Michigan State contingent was fired up it was early in the route not in the late late later in the round it was early enough very very surprised the officials did not throw a penalty there on bond Bell season Terry flips it to Scott who cannot escape Joshua Perry drags him down at the 44 yard line it'll be third down one of those seniors is at a terrific career as a leader in this team absolute great effort by Josh with Perry I thought that play once the ball was actually thrown by Terry it looked like it was set up very nicely for Scotty at a convoy in front of him but somehow herring navigated his way through Lewin a very short game boy it is tough to execute this pro style offense while the verbage for an inexperienced quarterback in this noise Ohio State says they have it Sam Hubbard came around the end hit the quarterback you know Iowa State's defense makes a huge play Adolphus Washington fell on the ball well it's almost hoop Where's Waldo with Joey Bosa most of those all the way over here he's normally here this allows to see Humber to get around watch how you see fossa take up two blockers it frees up a oneonone matchup with Sam Hubbard who already had four and a half sacks on the year he goes right by Keeler with that speed so the Buckeye defense forces it take away in Ohio State will set up shop with the Spartan 32 only the ninth turnover for Antonio's team in querque tell me the one category he can feel good about because on paper Ohio State has all kind of edges is turnovers bad start for the offense here Elias eight from the 32 Elliot behind Barrett in the pistol and he's got it little Running Room against that top fun +13 for the Spartans coming in and turnovers typically very good Ohio State was 1 on the season like I said I bought Michigan State at Mark Dantonio and Carla Cornett Mike trust when you put up a plan together against Ohio State you've got to take away see Kelly JT Barrett the running game your pin in your ears you're coming downhill in a hurry which means JT Barrett's going to have to make some plays in the passing game to make to kind of get them to back off and then get back to the running game slams forward still fighting hard down inside the 25 hear the crowd say Zeke will be a third and three yeah I mean right now that that's the plan that they have come in and watch them attacking and getting up feel this is an option game it has tough to do when you're getting penetration from those linebackers at defense alignment this is third and short you have a safety that's freed up look how quickly he comes down collapses and oneonone attack on the open field and Nicholson made that play here's another third down this time for IO state they need three Hamer's forward don't move the chains into the redzone they're attacking down here that is great blocking but a left guard Billy price right guard Pat L fine comes up picks up the linebacker right there puts Ryland bola riding his back a heck of a block by the right card l fine out of Pickerington they have been ruthlessly efficient in the red zone with Barrett at quarterback this year but inside of beloved flies forward for a pic for Sanjay hey you know when you have safeties and linebackers flying down it's down hill like that you're either getting get them for a short gain or maybe a loss or if he keeps his balance there there's no one left right then he's able to get into the endzone quick first quarter dominated by defense but the Buckeyes in scoring position back after this message and a word in your local ABC station rainy day at the Shu ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers national championship trophy we learned last week in Waco that it's it's rain proof here once again presented by dr. pepper to the winner of the championship game January 11 Monday Arizona Buckeyes behind four runs from Zeke Elliot have moved into position here following the fumble recovery by Washington and usually an area when talked about the red zone zone read when you have the threat of Zeke Elliott and JT Barrett usually comes into play for Ohio State down in this area bitch pursued and hammered hard by Nicholson at the 9 yard line 23 red zone trips of bereted quarterback 18 touchdowns and two field goals if there's one reason for putting you say why he regained the starting job it's that it's the red zone no doubt about it I mean the last five games you can look at the numbers by the way that would rank up around the top in the country what percentage it's 70s close to 77 percent in georgia tech's right there at 77 percent so that's how effective they've been in the second half of the season too tight and look to the left but is knocked down terrific play by Riley bola who just don't been there to hit the running back low but they do move to change first and goal with a block on the left side by Taylor Decker and Billy price short yardage watch the left side watch 54 in 68 you want to follow but you want to know where to go that's where you go right there then you throw on the right guard he'll fine that's how you open it up on short yardage great shot by Decker and price and I'll flank coming around same formation this time Barrett looks to throw in the flatbed net Mexican is knocked at immediately by Nicholson they rarely bothered probing down here because the running game is so ruthlessly effective yeah I think it shows you the respect they have for Michigan State's defensive line but you know typically they might try to catch you out of position they tried that time to catch the safety Nicholson out of position fighting down on the run and thought they made three up Nick vennett but the Spartans were there I mean now you see them go back to that combination and seek and JT Barrett berrak runs all the way has increased time for the end zone touchdown Ohio State make sure the ball crossed before the watch 81 that blocked right there he takes horns Thomas out of the picture it's just going to come down they have to take a peek at that knee he did hit the ground just as he was lunging toward the goal line right there they'll take another look at this for sure nice cut there lonna sign of Raschke these are tough looks is the pylon can see if it stays in play there's that block by the way I was telling you about he took him out completely off the field another look from this angle knee down there hard to see whether the ball did break the front part of that white line may not be enough to overturn the call it's a good look at it he might be under about the 6inch line looks almost simultaneous there me down yeah it's a tough one let Dave Kataya come in and talk to us about what he thinks the expert you take a look at this play and Kirk what you say and Chris as well it's too close to overturn it ok it looks like that he has broken the play of the goal line when that knee goes down but there's nothing here I see to change the call on the field van capron who's the referee Tom Herbert very accomplished replay official is the one in charge of of this call well here's another sign oh here's a different look I think he broke the plane I think that I think I think what you guys said makes a lot of sense it's not enough it's a counter the call on the field of touchdown absolutely even from this angle you see the knee down here which is not the greatest angle right now but you can't tell the look at pylon cam you love this toy it's got four cameras in the pylon neat down to there the foot of the defenders in the way have you seen anything that's definitive that would counter the Gaul touchdown after review the runner's knee was down with the ball at the 1/2 yard line in return for 1348 1348 you never know in the big ten now one of those shots I remember I said I thought the sixinch line but who knows that we're also so closer I'm glad they're making that call not us just not in this beautiful of them I agree with your day but it seems and that's what you usually go with the call in the field stackedup didn't get there Michigan State squad with support from rescue the linebacker after the reverse of them now be fourth and goal and you're right Chris risky and Riley Bullivant to two linebackers they're able to get involved as a nice job at the Michigan State defense line of getting low low man wins and he's goal line situations but then clean it up by bulla and rush he was very very key because you know see Kelly it is a second third emperor kind of back and that the linebackers took that second third effort away Barrett's trying to quiet the crowd the Spartan crowded that corners makers annoys Urban Meyer's to the 5yard line lake lockdown at 1:00 and Meyer was all over it the shifting they weren't ready to snap it there so the fiveyard penalty saved by the timeout here and admire tremendous confidence in this offensive line and his backs in this area absolutely and I think Michigan State has tremendous confidence in their defensive line and linebackers that's what makes this especially for the 00 game such a big point in this game fourth down when you come back to Columbus Spartans defend their goal line as well as any defense in college football to fourth and goal stops already this season what does Meyer call here on fourth down what his strength is his offensive line in the running of Zeke Elliott and that's what you would think they've spread him out now with three receivers but that out flex to the right trying to create some better matchups I think they go off the middle here with Zeke Elliott they do Elliot died touchdown after the fumble recovery that drive was just about all Zeke le fitting that he finishes it with the fourth down down when you get into a situation you've got to trust something you don't want to get to you even though but you can say that's such a great defensive line a great group of linebackers you've got to trust your offensive line especially that left side led by Taylor Decker and then you give it to the big physical back Zeke Elliott you trust it and it's ends up coming through for you on fourth down Sean your burger won the kicking job over Jack Willoughby so the ball knocked loose by Hubbard recovered by Washington and then a methodical Drive ten plays nine of them Elliott runs and he finally finishes off over the top on fourth down as the Buckeyes jump in front in the second quarter in Columbus ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers brought you by New York Life here to help you keep good going Buick proud partner of the NCAA and AT&amp;T mobilizing your world the captain Josh Berry's second to last and then Braxton Miller the last one out on senior day switching back to Jersey number five warm exchange reserve admire this senior class that came on the heels of a seven loss season and his 48th in three in their careers twenty seven and one amazing amazing accomplishment and seeing Braxton Miller they're just everything that he's been through throughout his career the good the challenging RJ Shelton will not bring the kick out as we welcome in Chris FeliCa cozy and dry in our truck with our Aflac trivia question for this afternoon bear what do you got well Connor Cook would have had a chance for his second win over Ohio State today but unfortunately he's injured the Kirk I think this one is up your alley our question today who are the only two Michigan State quarterbacks to have multiple wins over Ohio State I think you're gonna get this one okay cousins had won for sure Billy Burke f2 cousins had one here Billy Burke came in here watching as O'Connor as a quarterback homes in backfield throws it into traffic the ball that's a play you've just got to make for your quarterback I'm gonna guess Billy Burke and I'm gonna go with Bobby McAllister the answer to the f thought should be a question mr. Herbstreit you are correct two for two for two knocked off that number one ranked Ohio State team in 98 and then Bobby McAllister of course let's starts their old tire yes pretty good that's a walkoff right there you'd like that zombie McAllister but you recall every Ohio State loss with the Reds are white great Michigan State team a michigan state more than any other team has ended ohio state perfect seasons when the Buckeyes have been in the top five one of them at that 98 game when they were given a low percentage a chance to win yeah Cedric Irvin a big game that day real challenge to the fire in the face of the Spartans you again to touch 739 we both always a factor here hioh state loves to move him around we got him now at his natural position rush for Bosa dropping back the completion on the far side and a crucial first down to Aaron Burr bridge when we talked about that oneonone matchup earlier and Bert bridge is one of the top receivers in the Big Ten against one of the top corners in Eli Apple number one that gave him time and a good job of having presence in the pocket is stepping up and away from Joey Bosa and there's the oneonone matchup very similar to what we saw earlier and a great effort there by Burbridge to get separation make the catch and then not give up on it pick up a few more yards about that a lot of wrestling going on he was able to shake the tackle of the corner there it looked like the right guard that time they move Clemens it's a backup guard this Michigan State offensive line is finally healthy they've had multiple guys use multiple games with injury shuffled parts throughout they haven't played great football but they do have their group healthy for today which they've been good about and I think that's not only important to give them a chance on the road but when you take out a quarterback who has 36 career starts and you're going to a guy who has never started a game you need that obviously but they also need to avoid mistakes and miscues like the last play first of 15 O'Connor's flushed the pressure gotten adolphus Washington having a big start to this game Adolphus Washington with Mike Bennett moving on has taken over to the interior this defensive line Joey Bosa there's 92 right in the middle two great effort they're working around Brian Allen where that is tremendous athletic ability for a guy close to 300 pounds his great feet that's his fourth sack now on the year and strength he just grabbed it with one arm the quarterbacks ankle and brought down and 225 pounder and launched just a yard second in 16 and steps up again while he saw bolsa coming off the edge parry cleans it up but this is a young quarterback who's very aware of the rush now and then you do is a young quarterback kids you look at your primary receiver watch him look at his primary own when it's not there he bails he just starts to check out he's trying to follow his back homes but look at the hit there by Josh Perry lowers the boom he's getting chased from Tommy shut from behind and that parry hits him in the face Joey Bosa where they move third down they're gonna keep him on the edge here the edge right there Oh Connor this time the gas pushes the ball downfield coming back in was Berg Ridge and saw that on the other end was he forced out they're going to call this a good catch that inside the 30 will get Dave in here but it's all about the effort to get yourself back in to become an eligible receiver you can't just stay out of bounds just because you got pushed out of bounds you have to make an effort to work your way back in it is kind of ironic that this happens to be the Michigan State team that got this called against him there's the push but if he makes his way back he's fine Dave what do you think that he did he try to get back in play well he's clearly forced out and you watched him run he takes two or three steps steps on the sideline to me pass interference defense number 13 he just did get a foot back down on the field of play just before the ball arrives he got back in time plus he reestablished himself as you say Chris by getting that foot down in bounds you talked earlier about how physical kind of handtohand combat between Burbridge and Apple that is going to be a great oneonone throughout the game that time I actually called the interference on Apple the Michigan State declines because of the reception 36 yard game 30:14 Holmes from the iformation makes a cut nice game of moms bangs for about 10 yards on the left side before Darren Lee forced him out it's a heck of a run there on first and 10 and it's amazing after you hit a big pass play you have been able to run all game and all of a sudden it opens up the running game and that was that was really just good blocking up front to tie it in Paul Lin ended up having one of the key blocks that allowed them to be able to set the edge and he got to Josh Perrin open that up get a little bit more there for Gerald Holmes who's a physical back too tight and look on the second and one Holmes emerges from the scrum down at the 12yard line its first down Michigan State it was seen see Kelly and have some chances and try to run the football but we've not seen him have much room to run and what's been tough for Gerald Holmes with these last two plays the Michigan State offensive line getting a hat on a hat and creating just enough room for Holmes be able to hit a priest there and pick up some big yards on those last two runs Spartans have not been nearly as efficient in the red zone as Ohio State 47 into three kings in motion they fake a tumor Connor fires to the end zone catch me down here the Pendleton touchdown Michigan State the fifth year senior fullback one of the Ohioans on this roster which is his fourth catch of the season and a great effort and a great job here by the quarterback O'Connor of throwing the ball and throwing it instead of lobbing it into the corner he put a lot of velocity on the ball and it the reason that's important as it gives his fullback a chance to catch the ball and hit to the pocket on cam there there's evidence that he got to the pylon because our camera went out and he hit it right there doesn't touch it till he hits T until he hits the pylon you know review it as they do scoring plays but Michigan State a 75yard Drive highlighted by that third and 14 completion and watch how he's right here he's going to act like he's going out here and then he turns and Josh Perry is gonna try to stay with him watch Josh parry kind of wait hesitates so he's got to throw that ball with a lot he can't throw it and just hang it up the way you normally would throw that ball he recognized where Josh Perry was so he knew he kind of threat had to throw it again with a little bit of heat on it and Connor cooks like holy cow what a play the veteran Pendleton touched up and seemed pretty easy for time Herbert and Michigan State has what a drive and a potential confidence builder for O'Connor with that big throw in third one that the big throw it just changed the complexion of the tribe and the field Connor and the offensive linemen after the long pass they ran the ball for a couple plays and then that's set up a really nice call where they got the fullback which they've not thrown the ball to him much they just three receptions on the entire year so kind of against their trend what they do down in this area put some velocity on it makes a heck of a catch by the big fella then reaches for the pylon his first touchdown since 2013 and Michigan State has the Buckeyes here in Columbus on Tuesday night town 25 rankings ship is on a bike chickfila you guys back in the studio this week after venturing to Chicago Davis Kirk and the panel also streaming live on a watch ESPN app an estate second in both polls ranked number three by the playoff committee behind Clemson and Alabama coming in just ahead a Notre Dame heard of Samuel back deep they received the kick from Cronin who drives it low and it scoots through on the wet turf touch back Oklahoma certainly wants to be part of that playoff conversation and the Sooners will host TCU tonight 8 o'clock here on ABC sad news that trevone Boykin the Horned Frogs quarterback not going to be able to go he's he made the promo but he won't make the starting lineup it appears and Josh dachshund so many guys for the Horned Frogs are out but the suitors meanwhile trying to build on the momentum of the game we found last week in Waco can play with that same intensity you and I I think pose were really impressed just a win but how they played and how focused they were on really both sides of the football can't let the guard down bedlam on the road next week right one frog is still still dangerous but guys from the 25 and again that front of michigan state with support from an excellent line backing group really well remember ohio state they got the turnover they went 32 yards in ten plays to go 32 yards in Michigan State's defensive line has set it on the first series they are the real deal they're athletic they're confident and they attack the line of scrimmage and the linebackers are coming down hill and I think Ohio State again they're gonna have to make plays in the pass game to be able to move the ball consistently off the edge as well it works with the speed of this defense and you're kind of rolling out and once you decide you're not gonna throw in the ball look at this defense how fast flowing they are you side you're not gonna throw it there's just nowhere to go because not just Calhoun but you have rush key there yeah Riley Bullas they're almost on every single play looking lookout Calhoun works off of Taylor Decker and there's just nothing to do there for JT Barrett they've run 21 plays Curt just su have gained more than five yards in third and 17 empty backfield Barrett clips to the cross the middle too high for jaylen Marshalls high and behind him the Buckeyes go three and out and momentum swinging to the Spartan side now down to Heather Cox Chris a little bit of a weather update for you this believe it or not is Ohio State's first weather game of the season they're using six balls on each side 12 total they've also got eight more that are approved to use once these ones get too wet they've got hand warmers in each of the balls to keep them the bats to keep them warm and also Michael Thomas the receiver switched buzz from a sticky glove to a leather drive to help him out you told us he might go back to the old school leather glove high snap Johnson just bouncing along the ground here picked up and now returned from the 35 Johnson a very reliable putter that was a funky looking punt and Grace and Miller decided to return ative for you yards that rugby style kick and I don't know if with with the wet conditions if he lost control of the ball or what happened there was it bought this be interesting to see what happens to the football if he just is a total shank it was actually deflected off of a Spartan and then Miller the true freshman picked it up he's running right to where Hall the Michigan State defenders are it's like it went off the safety there Zek Leinbach cut a little piece of it but one of the top hunters in America with a funky punt and the Spartans set up in great field position in a tie game we've had some fun mishaps in the big 10 but Zach Leinbach 42 there watch the ball will be in front of the line of scrimmage so this is just it goes as a block but then it goes off an Ohio State player brillante done number 25 the running back in the ball becomes dead right there and that's why it's at the 23 yard line so it's a 5 yard punt one of the premier punters in the country LJ Scott is the tailback lost the handle momentarily knocked down after a loss remember he's the guy that fumbled twice last week sai Kwong Lewis on the tackle Lewis really good job of getting it some penetration but I don't know if there's a distinct the ball looked like it was in you fumble a couple times last week maybe you start worrying and thinking about a little bit too much for the true freshman just a big brawl athletic runner that has a bright future in East Lansing they thought eventually he might take over and become the levee on bail for this offense this year you're just you know for some guys it takes a little bit longer but we'll be a future star here for this welcome to my mind Hubbard in Ohio lost war in the first down carry whistle and it's going to be a shovel pass flag before the snap we're not set for a second by rule Raekwon Macmillan came running up to the line of scrimmage and just slammed on the brakes before the ball was snapped Emily on Michigan State Antonio knows this is one of those moments you get the break with the awful punt the great field position you battled hard without Connor cook you feel like you need points out of this drive at your Dantonio position the best of the day you lose yardage on the first player you almost fumble to LJ skeleton and second in nineteen you know Connor at the last minute flips it incomplete pass as the ruling there was some hesitation was it a lateral but O'Connor who was in the grasp just able to escape Bose in and get the ball away it is tough to deal with Joey Bosa and right now they've actually moved Donovan Clark who plays from guard and tackle him mounted right tackle that is a tough matchup one on one for anybody 76 look at Bose he gets pushed back just relentless never gives up on the play and almost comes up to the sack it's an example doesn't go down as a sack but one of the productive play is one of the many of the what everybody says has been a terrific year for him despite the drop off consent very much French field goal range in these conditions so in third and long they flip it short here and this is Delton Williams the first touch for the junior from Erie he gets some of the lost yardage back to the 25 a more reasonable field goal attempt now that's one way to deal with Joey Bosa just kind of bade him there's a quarterback and then shuffle pass underneath him the very least that gives him his shot here at a field goal to maybe take the lead for Michael Geiger a thirdyear kicker at a terrific freshman year struggled a bit midseason slump but he's worked his way out hasn't missed to kick in the last four games this from 43 into the breeze knuckles wide never really had a chance he's gonna miss one it usually does hook to the left so Dan Tonio's team unable to cash in the poor punt a blown opportunity for Mark Dantonio for the Spartans and at the same time a big stop for the Ohio State defense after that horrible punt Michigan State giving great field position there is a young man who's probably happier than anybody now we said it's going to be very tricky conditions for the specialists all afternoon four and a half until halftime the game stays tied Jarrod Johnston's had such a great year and even last year so that makes a mistake he's got to be able to shake it off and get back to being the punter that he's been to last couple years as we said soberly that didn't cost his team berra throws nearside Thomas just dropped it everybody struggling with these wet conditions as we send it back to Camp City Humber for an update Chris Taco Bell studio update USC and Oregon Vernon Adams to Darrin Carrington Adams third TD pass of the game ducks up 2114 this game over on ESPN elsewhere in the pac12 UCLA Leedy number 13 Utah 10 to 3 loser of that game will be eliminated for the pac12 South detention but the Ducks to go to Stanford and win and now leading USC after many had given up on this at one point they had lost to two of three games they were sitting there at three and three and they may win out and finish nine and three win a bowl game another ten win season in second and ten shovel pass into heavy traffic and nothing they're just completely clogging the middle I was banette who got it they're waiting for that that's reading your scatter report and understanding him look at the linebackers just attacking downhill they're not Shane Jones number 49 a backup the bola quickies in there the net didn't have a chance but he got the football in the shovel pass he looks up in 49s right in his face they took every aspect of that away they took the quarterback Barrett away with Calhoun and the shuffle pass with the line and Jones it's one third and nine option look Barrett slips a tackle will be knocked down short of the first down by five yards Riley bola there's some grumbling from the Ohio State fans another punt coming off this mitt again continue to repeat myself until it changes but they are just attacking down hill at JT Barrett and Zeke Elliott in the running game Ohio State and JT Barrett they knew coming in they'd have to make plays in the passing game and if they don't start getting the ball on the perimeter and trying to get the ball to the outside and down field it's going to be tough sledding against this Michigan State defense three completions total of 20 yards this is more like the camera Johnson we expect to see and Kings makes the fair catch at the 28 and got pretty close so this Barton special teams have been much maligned but this was nearly putting Johnson under pressure again is scrapped tea on the rugby kick and he went back to more of the traditional fine boy which could stakes so close no noteworthy of course that failed punt attempt by Michigan so many big ten games have been closed down to the wire involving Michigan State and Michigan Ohio State hasn't had the complete scare yet now they go with Damian Terry Kirk 3:13 until halftime of the two backup quarterbacks who are playing today known more as the dual guy he can throw but also has ability to run the zone read and some option looks so straight run and Terry gets around the corner and knocked down after a five yard first down game without Connor Cook in the game Connor and Damian Terry they've had to be aware of what they need to deal with against this Ohio State defense and there's what what Joey Bose has done if you take him away with a doubleteam it opens up for other defenders that time it was Sam Hubbard also what he can do as far as not just against the run in the pass to me it's his relentless effort that time he forced O'Connor to have to throw the ball before he was ready but Michigan State's trying to settle in away from 97 with these backup quarterbacks second and five in the backfield it's games it takes the hand up and the receiver does make a first down if flag comes in Bosa a Lombardi finalist so unselfish this season always cited by the coaches younger Allen brother Brian Brian Allen just the guard was trying to make a block here he goes down on the ground and just grabs a hold of the ankle of Tommy shut the umpires they almost just looking right down on and saying that's another blunder another mistake I was an easy call to young fires right Brett right beneath him the Allen brother has been shut up all Illinois guys played in the same conference in high school so you know that's going to be a battle on the pitch those guys go bigger all the tricks to the track second and 14 Terry looks near sideline and off the hands of kings doesn't quite have the passing proficiency of o'connor doesn't no no you know and i know they have a plan with cook out how they're going to use the two quarterbacks but just by watching them here in this first half I really feel that tyler o'connor started to settle in a little bit and seems to kind of fit with what they're trying to do throwing the football run the ball with these backs and trying to throw the football at Tyler that's really been straight to their team all years the passing it comes off the bench he had a completion on the 1314 the last time tasting this situation steps up looks neater side a short completion knocked down as kings so it's fourth down that's the conservative play call that's the beauty of being able to rush for and get pressure and be able to drop seven guys in in coverage play soft zone keep everything in front of you and still get pressure make the quarterback get the ball out of his hands but everybody rallies to the ball we're seeing both of these defensive lines making it very challenging on both of the offenses in his first half you know talking to cook about the challenges of a of a prostyle offense all the verbage you've got to get out in the huddle over this crowd noise it up a play like Roger Rings shadow seven week toss naked right who's your alert spider 2 y banana that's a that's an actual play you're gonna yell that over this crowd noise in the huddle very challenged very tough to do there's a good boot from Hart Barker and Marshall Field's at five to go before halftime yes it's fight or to live a ten I did as a Jun group special watch ESPN app you can stream every game live download her to go to watch espn.com essential for college football fans I knew you'd appreciate the Gruden Academy a reference though but the fact is this is this offense the Michigan State runt has so many complicated sounding plays as opposed to what we see with so many other words they may have had to adjust that with with the backups playing and go to the wristband and allow them to be able to look and use that wristband as much as they can but that is a mouthful and on the road they get the wristband numbers signaled in with him he's got to spit all that stuff out what were the Buckeyes do they've been a slow grinding offense so far no big boys still think you need to see some plays in the past game in order to open up this potential in this offense those who the ball downfield Braxton Miller just over his hands and a shot that gets to meet to discuss oneonone just overthrown see that's the macho that's what we keep asking when will they go to this when will they take some chances Braxton Miller matched up against the safety wall you know even though Cox has ability to cover he's played some corner this year because of some injuries it's still a matchup the Ohio State wants to take advantage of because of the speed of Braxton Miller he got separation at that time he had JT Barrett just not quite on the same page in the change of direction Department that's a huge mismatch Miller Cox you saw it right there they got to go back to that I mean if that's if they want to move the ball then you have to make plays rolling again Barrett pressured knocked down Thomas makes the catch on the far side it'll be third down the Capital One halftime report John Saunders mark made Mack Brown will have analysis of this one scores and highlights around the country in 44 seconds on the clock and running third and five Thomas is now caught a pass in 27 consecutive games one of the juniors perhaps playing his final home game here I prospect well different than last year's collision between these two in East Lansing when Ohio State scored seven touchdowns in eight possessions after missing the early field goal yeah it was really one of those games where a high o state became I think a different team as far as respect and who Ohio State could potentially be with the first year of the playoff they the night they left East Lansing it was a different team but I'll tell you what this is a different year and Ohio State is a different set of challenges as they've had all year with this office you know they can run the ball but if they're gonna beat teams like Michigan State down the road Michigan and if they get to a Big Ten championship game you got to have balance you have to have a threat and be able to throw the ball and they've not had that and until they show that tonight it's gonna be tough to run the ball against Michigan State we talked Derbent I said do you mind the fact that even though your offense has been brutally effective it's a little boring and vanila said I hate it I hate it but I like sipping that glass of wine after a victory at 10 o'clock at night so he does what's been a win in the games but he's not comfortable with this as a play caller no and I think I don't know if anybody would be comfortable with this as a play caller because Urban Meyer typically has offenses that are explosive and are balanced and when you rely just on running the football as good as e Kelley it is as good as this offensive line is in running the football you play against better defenses where you just can't use better talent you've got to be able to kind of mix up and use a scheme you've got to be able to throw the ball and have the balance he said that after the game last week when they were in Champaign I are talking with Tim back who's upstairs at Warner the cooffensive coordinator offensive line coaches on the sidelines in the 10 o'clock Eastern Time and if insiders Sunday edition gets it started then 11 o'clock Sunday NFL countdown I was made of Cam Newton's TD celebration last week find out what folks like white shoes Johnson ickey woods Terrell Owens thought of it all tomorrow morning on ESPN I can't brag about the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals anymore now you notice I didn't say anything that's why I brought it was a rough Monday night watch 38 seconds to go on this third and 5 they fake it to Samuel Barrett will now flip it to him in the flat and he's not short of the first down by Darian Hicks the Ohio native he's waiting a year for this game because of some mistakes that he made in last year's home loss but the Spartan defense does their job again well again they're attacking the line of scrimmage and they're playing a lot more zone than they have had in the past usually they play a lot of mantoman and I think Hicks took the loss last year at Ohio State personally because of those missed tackles and he got beaten coverage and you could tell he's playing with a little bit of an edge the second round against Ohio State and JT Barrett absolutely missed the tackle on Thomas and that slant that really turned the game around in East Lansing backspin from Johnston Kings did not call it fair catch at the 4 that's crazy in this condition you just filled in the pundit before takes a hit as Tara McLaren flew down there in coverage with 21 seconds to go that's risky that is especially when you're still you know playing a couple quarterbacks that you're still trying to get some confidence established and you don't have Connor Cook back there you should always you put your heels in tenth the 10 yard line and if you go back you always just let the ball go especially late in the half play this hole mogera thought he was gonna go 96 you're not going anywhere you're gonna take a knee here the kill the clock anyway so the first half shaped by perhaps the absence of cooks shaped by the conditions and the conservative gameplan of Ohio State 77 if you're Dantonio and you've got 124 total yards and you gained 50 more then you're on position with that reporter but you're thrilled that halftime you kidding me white Mark Dantonio they're sprinting off here they're feeling really good about what they didn't you're right they deferred to get the ball to start the second half a lot of tension in the horseshoe on Senior Day and as the undefeated Buckeyes 77 with Michigan State the Capital One halftime pork is coming up and Heather will speak with Mark Dantonio right after these messages to the dr. pepper Championship Drive game of the week set for the second half in Columbus ESPN college football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers the swirling rain here in Ohio Stadium seven apiece at halftime as Ohio State's offense Kirk has had for three announced their one touchdown drive was a didn't play 32 yard drive after a take away it's been very strange Michigan State's defense deserves a lot of credit but so does the play calling Ohio State had 28 plays in the first half 16 of those plays were for three yards or less so I think it tells you a lot about how they struggled offensively and yeah let's face it you lose Connor cook with a 36 career starts and you go on the road in this environment you start a young quarterback two young quarterbacks Michigan State's got to be very happy with how they play there was a to play sequence there they all stay in good hands sequence here this is it this is the third and 14 playing when Burt bridges pushed out of bounds fights back and makes up 36 yard catch I think that was the turning point in the game it set up this touchdown a really good throw by by O'Connor the way he was able to place the football he gave Pendleton a chance to reach for that pile on which our pylon cam caught and then tied his football game up that kind of changed the momentum of the game it doesn't wasn't a tie game it really changed the feel of this stadium and the confidence that the Michigan State team had without Connor Cook we knew this big 10 weather reply apartment but close to the best this is the game for you forget all that those deep shots all that big buff stuff this is just grinding stuff a Pacific Life game summary 75 yards total offense for Ohio State Barrett had the one deep shot when Braxton Miller was open with the overthrown and you'd love to be inside that locker room and wonder and hear what what Urban Meyer's said to that team along with that Warner and Tim back because they've got to make some changes we were calling for it up here they've got to throw the football they've got to throw the football even in these difficult conditions if they want to open up their offense and try to move the ball consistently it's the only shot they have because they're not going to be able to run the ball against that Michigan State defense you rely on this excellent defense to make a play on us sakes defenders have scored four touchdowns this season this is my gets a couple of yards again if you joined this late Connor cook Ohio Nate he was never played a game in the stadium was so keyed up but the shoulder injury he suffered last week against Maryland just couldn't deliver the ball with any velocity so he has had to sit this one out and watch O'Connor and Terry try to operate in tough conditions tough for him personally he really wanted to play in the horseshoe growing up in Ohio at the stove Walsh Jesuit High School up into the Cleveland area in he's played against Ohio State twice was one in one dishes come to the tiebreaker he's had to sit it out and got to be impressed with what Dave Warner has done with Tyler O'Connor and Damian Terry in that first half let's see if they're able to avoid that disastrous play in the second half that's as important as anything for these young quarterbacks connor made a change in the play clock at 1:00 as he snaps it always has a little gap ran through the arm shackle of bosons the pond for a first down down to Heather Cox Chris you talked about the importance of this game to Connor cook I've been watching him throughout the first half he's very involved very supportive but a little bit more background on the week he had every intention all week long of playing he participated in every practice he didn't make any throws he played in all the running plays and that O'Connor came in for the passing plays he did four hours of therapy each and every day trying to rehab that shoulder ice and eminent elements when he just didn't have velocity didn't have zip on the ball he and Dantonio decided to pull the plug on him I agree with you this is stilton Williams began to look at the injury that was suffered early in the game against Maryland Cook is a strong guy but he doesn't have the the bulkiest upper body landed on that throwing shoulder come back in didn't have a lot of zip didn't agree the decision to pull him out at halftime but that reaction right there told you that was a much serious than Michigan State was leading on this week they're very vague and almost defensive throughout most of the week with the local media about his health they were very secretive it but but it was a bit of a block from cook as well he eats only he he'd be good to go Williams makes his way for a short gain it'll be third and three Michigan State working into the wind the ring getting heavier perhaps snow on the way you really feel like at the next sport in this game is just monstrous well I think if you're in a seven seven game with weather and with teams struggling offensively just by scoring points not only to give you the lead it gets the other team for either team that's able to get those points on the book because he put so much pressure on the opposing offense empty backfield on third and three now they motioned Shelton back take the shovel pass O'Connor just couldn't get to him and he's knocked down by a rape on McMillan and Darren Lee it'll be fourth down I sniff that out yeah but guys with a very very good play there to start the second half on third down joy Bose is so effective you know it's not just the pass rusher abilities but it's his ability to defend the run when they run option football he helped take away RJ Shelton that time and forced the quarterback to keep it and then ran down the line and it was involved in the the stop to keep him short of the first down now Jake Harper the wind just howling in his face just hoping it could get the snap and get it away you dude you this sense that every punt Kirk is a potential misadventure in this game absolutely beverage team touches it at the 12 annex where Ohio State will take over deadlock third quarter let's take a look at who's been putting in work brought to you by car heart and the Michigan State defense have been putting in work we've seen Malik McDowell make plays by getting penetration how about the defensive line who dominated the first half eating up double teams and freeing up Raleigh bola and the rest of those linebackers even the backup Shane Jones who's out of Cincinnati Ohio closing in and making plays so they are attacking the line of scrimmage and the Ohio State offense 28 snaps 16 of those snaps for three yards or less Buckeyes have had the last three possessions be three and out with a total of two yards gained Elliott knocked down yes they're tough conditions but this is a Michigan State defense that has been giving up huge plays lots of people not even great passing teams they started three true freshmen against Nebraska got destroyed back there everybody has really thrown deep on him until they begin to get things together last week yeah the Hicks came back from some injuries he was back at move Demetrius Cox back to safety Nicholson playing better Cole hoon so this the best our secondaries looked the last two weeks pump fake from the jet sweet from Barrett he charges forward another conservative play call third down again but to your point and what we looked at all week and we kind of anticipated was with the the way Michigan State secondary has been exploited the weakness clearly is their secondary even with the even with Hicks back and Cox back at safety between the front seven and trying to run the ball against that front seven or trying to get them in space and throw the ball you'd rather take the latter but Ohio State at this points only throw him for 29 yards against that Michigan State defense both Miller and Samuel in the slot the Barretts left on third down he rolls that direction pump fakes and delivers couple of drops by Buckeye receivers today and a Michigan State defense that had only forced 29 three announce ten twelfths in the conference the fifth time today they've done it they roll them away from the pressure but because he's late with the ball Michigan State's still able to get pressure on him and he had a wide open Jalen Marsh we see oh he's hesitant then he came back Jalen Marshall threw the ball with some velocity up high make it a pretty tough on Marshall to come down with that kept to the first down anxious punters on both sides and now it's Johnston's turn to just hope that he can collect the snap and get things away that low goofy punt early this one is driven back to Kings who collects it at the 33 he's knocked down after a twoyard return their spartans turned on offense on a dreary cold day in the big 10 ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Kay Jewelers brought you by the we style decor from Honda Pacific Life for life insurance annuities and investments choose Pacific Life the power to help you succeed and IcyHot smart Lalit tens therapy turn off pay back with our dr. pepper championship Bryant game of the week Ohio State fans soggy chilly and anxious at this point because their team is tied at 7 with Michigan State Buckeyes have generated 81 yards total offense four consecutive three announced Spartans give the first touch of the ballgame to migrate London's have used four different running backs which they've been doing this year but in tough conditions you come off cold invention and football for the first time I'm dead yeah but you have confidence it's a group that big has gotten it done all year they've got a battle through some injuries almost all of them but this game as it goes on and it feels more more like a game where both teams don't want to be the team to make the mistake they're erring on the side of caution and not being very aggressive because they don't want to have the lose fuel position battle and have a turnover or something bad happened to the office straight keeper as Terry comes in he must lost the handle the ball Taekwon Lewis brings him down after a short games backtoback plays by Taekwon Lewis a sophomore who because of the attention that Joey Bosa receives and makes a lot of plays comes into this game with 11 they see six go in there they're not thinking as much about pass they're thinking about some kind of quarterback run game and nice play by Lewis to come back to pick the play bolsa was out now he comes back in third and five London is still the back Terry straight one again so again cautious but that time effective yeah and a great block by price the tide in here on the right they just do a good job look right in front of you right there nice job of setting the edge there and now they've got some room some speed there by tarrying 235 pounds but it was the block there the doubleteam by Clark and price on Joey Bosa that got him to the corner Mount Airy to test the right side not many teams run to the left of Ohio State's defense very effectively where Bosa Darrin Lee and often Vaughn Bell are patrolling it was a big conversion on third and five it sure was keeps the drive alive and more importantly gives him great field position they're now in plus territory and they back it up with a six yard game with quarterback run game again with Dave Damian Terry Kings motions to the backfield and they give it to him you see the footing may become an issue kind of a tentative cut by the receiver their third down again and if they give Kings as many touches as they can just because he is so fast and all he needs is just a little bit of room and he could pick up 5 10 15 yards in a hurry just a very different feel from all the other facts that they have were a little bit more physical and even though he's a receiver he has background in high school playing some tailback who knows what the it's like 34 he was met by Joshua Perry it'll be fourth down it's a good job by the senior read that played perfectly nobody got up to the second level it's a good job I owe States defensive line of office Washington and company eating up those blocks he said you could see how easy it was for Perry nobody climbed up to that next level to get him just close down on it but field position gets potentially adjusted depending on how this punt goes for the Spartans San Antonio the elect not to attempt to pass in that sequence and now Hart better try to pin the Buckeyes deep I kick into the wind marshal steps up to make a diving fair catch at the 15yard line that's trusting your hands shelter from the storm today from the Allstate bus convened at the Allstate it's good Scoob sakes for a chance to win an hour thousand bucks plus a VIP trip to the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the national championship game as well as weekly prizes throughout the season whatever eight thousand nine hundred seventy five a new attendance record here although some plans I think of made the choice to head home and and watch this in a warmer drier place many are still here huddled hoping their Buckeyes can make a play here Barrett with the keeper some space and that's the first first down they've made since their touchdown drive what's interesting here is Shelley Calhoun slips he goes down and that's what gave JT Barrett a little bit of room to be able to get away from that pressure that he's felt on almost every single snap from this defensive line so the conditions in the footing there of Calhoun opened that up for JT Barrett we wonder what Meyer who back and had Warner we'll think about calling in this Drive by Joey Greg Evans there it's easier to throw this direction into the wind of the fourth quarter it's gonna be a little tougher yeah it will be the conditions are gonna get worse and worse but boy how about Craig Evans a freshman out of Wisconsin he gets off of his block and shows the speed of the big fella 318 pounds closed in on the ball care boy he is this entire defensive line so far just had a great football game this is Evans can again right he is namoore run stopper in the interior line the motion Miller out from the back fields Barrett straight ahead move backwards to gain yardage it'll set up a third and three now to sure will power from JT Barrett there was not a whole lot of room there once again into the interior the Michigan State defense to strengthen their defense Iowa State continuing to challenge the Michigan State defensive line and linebackers he stopped right there for about a two yard game but just continues to give great efforts not done yet picks up another three or four yards the heat three on third down empty backfield again bunch formation to the right we wouldn't bet against a quarterback keeper here the Spartans are ready for it they slammed Barrett down short of the first damage simbu's kind you saw it I saw it and you know who more importantly saw it Harlan Barnett Mark Dantonio and the Michigan State defense in Harlan actually Damon Knox at time got off to his block seems like we're calling different names the entire time we've called McDowell and Lawrence Thomas Joel he shall eat Calhoun Dimitri's Cooper Craig Evans and now David Knox that's great point we've seen them rotate in with success the linebackers have made a bunch of plays hardly talked about the secondary it's because they have been tested by great you have to throw the ball to be able to talk about the secondary Johnston has been tested a few today we just talked about these two teams are trying to avoid the disastrous play both teams are erring on the side of being cautious nobody wants to be the guy that's gonna make the mistake and here's Kings making that mistake with the wind and the rain the ball gets away from him and a good effort by the Ohio State coverage team getting down there looks like the freshman Terry Maclaurin is able to come down there and get on top of the football there's the mistake at Ohio State now gets great field position to see if they can capitalize I'll tell you you just Dantonio keys believe it in a day like this just better let that thing I think he's actually just trying to say hey ty you gotta shake it he's not gonna lay into him right there maybe the filled room it's not right there in the swirling wind I think the ball got away from over the last minute we would extend his arms so first and goal for Ohio State at the six takes the lead first pass attempt indeed in the second half Michigan State is taking more about the run game they were lined up to stop JT Barrett from running the football overcrowded the line of scrimmage created a oneonone opportunity on the outside some more moon burger last year's kicker has just earned the job back at the BAC the guys 147 here is Harris and linebacker his Jalen Marshall but by showing why he get two linebackers out of position and it creaks and creates a nice big window behind them it's a matchup right there with Jalen Marshall against a linebacker he's going to win that matchup every single time just waiting for the right time to try to call some flashy balls and pass plays and they wait back to the big turnover the first play JT Barrett baits the linebackers in the oneonone matchup with Marshall and Harris the Buckeyes score another touchdown for the touchdown reception for Marshall he's had a couple of drops today with the onehanded snag damn Tony I really felt like his team needed to be +2 or better in turnovers they are minus 2 today and the Buckeyes have passion both mistakes in a touchdown a team that's plus 13 third in the nation coming in on the road in this environment as you said they knew they had to be plus and coming in to be able to win this game without Connor cook there they're at minus two and just want to do a boy that that that played that disastrous play that could it end up costing you a ballgame we'll see if it does which have been shivering the wind at his back the easy touch back tonight on ABC at 8 o'clock the big 12 expected you some you seen here at TCU shorthanded no Boykin no dachshund missing so many guys against Baker Mayfield and thrown his hat and the Heisman ring lately no doubt about it especially the way he played last week he has done so much for this team all year I would argue the last five weeks the Oklahoma Sooners had played as well as anybody in the country and it has a lot to do with Baker Mayfield he is just a guy that they're feeding off to his energy not just playing well with the numbers but when you watch him play he's affecting his offense in his defense and the confidence overall they go form the super team so now they go back to Tyler O'Connor the last series being the spot north inspecting the sudden glue deficit the last time this offense fell behind after a Michigan State misty they were able to answer Ohio save the long touchdown they're running into the boundary that Ohio State defensive line was actually slanting and angling into the boundary and Adolphus Washington continues to have a great football game he just kind of waited and waited and waited with the block of Brian Allen and then got off of him threw him away and made the play on Holmes they flip it back to Shelton the change of direction there Siebert breaks loose first down more across the 40 before Macmillan Roman got Ohio State napping actually got Josh Perry out of position watch him right here at linebacker see how he moves out of the way and by him following the play to the field there's nobody there to be able to slow this down that he picks up a couple good blocks and there's the speed he just outran Adolphus Washington and Michigan State with a big gain their little misdirection catch Ohio State napping first touch where Shelton Me's from this position the longest one in the play of the game 18 yards oh nice left side bow save dragging down but not before a five yard gain where they are doing a lot of slanting watch the defensive line slanting and angling hit there move it this way Joey Bosa seen Darren Lee Blitzen he's got to get off the block of Clark and pretty impressive with Hallums and the legs straight there to carry Joey Bosa five yards secondary Michigan State moving another first hand of the Ohio State 37 about Jack Allen and just a nasty leader on that offensive line takes on Raekwon McMillan who's blitzing right in the middle you'll see number 5 blitz right there boom 66 does a great job of picking up that block you also saw Brandon Clemons 64 some good blocks up front took Darren Lee out of the picture and Kent Gerald Holmes with a little bit of room to run with Brandon Clemons the guard and was helped down we got to give a salute to this this Michigan State offensive line Jack Allen just like his counterpart Jacoby born both of them are finalists for the Campbell trophy which is the academic Heisman to be given out in New York in a few weeks the center's there are three of the 12 players who were finalists but centers of the cerebral guys and middle of the old line they really are they're like quarterbacks or the offensive line they make so many different calls that fans would be amazed how much talk there is between offensive lineman wild and while the crowds yelling and making noises they're turning and making sure the guards and it tackles everybody's on the same page but it all starts in the middle there gallon has been a it's a terrific player from Michigan State of the year first downplay its O'Connor dimes for four in the final minute of the third quarter Jalen Holmes made the tackle the ring has now stopped but the wind is still whipping and the turn around the fourth quarter to be at the back of Michigan State definitely see that wind you brought up a good point about the fourth quarter Michigan State will have the wind at their back in that fourth quarter Michigan State this would be an incredibly impressive performance by this offense and they were able to answer Ohio State's one play touchdown bones behind Pendleton that he cuts back to the left tackle is jaylen Holmes when Gerald home and it'll be third down when the final quarter starts here Ohio State's 23 game winning streak well straight at home on the line as well as playoff pubs for both teams for this message and a word via local ABC station we all say good hands play Kirk is the best display of hands we've seen in a chilly rainy afternoon Jalen Marshall with one hand goes up and collects the jump pass from JT Barrett and that's the difference right now 147 high estate very fortunate with the 2tone turnovers they've had a drive for 32 yards and a touchdown and a drive for 6 yards and a touchdown so collectively they have driven 38 yards for their two touchdowns but the benefit of a plus 2 in the turnover margin is the reason they've got their points three quarters Michigan State facing a third inning you wonder if this is a Ford and territory Ford antonio's offense number Aaron Burr Bridge is to go to man in these situations typically the empty backfield fourman rush O'Connor delivers in the pocket and it's incomplete Rick Warren McMillan who's all over the receiver Burbridge there and so now a fourth and eight they don't get anything in the third down play and will then shape the decision it's a really tough call at the beginning of the fourth quarter you know you either are going to go for this you're probably going to punt it and try to pin Ohio State inside the five or 10 yard line even with the wind at his back this would be a a 52yard field goal attempt for Geiger which a little too optimistic poor town in the Spartans keep the drive going whistle bolsa came across into the neutral zone and then there was a flinch in the michigan state side you know that's on Joey that's his third today it's on Ohio State which makes it a much more comfortable fourth in three now he's trying to get a jump at the top of your screen trying to get around in the tight end you saw moving and reacting to Bosa look he got back the reaction from the tight end is what they call on BOSU you only have three penalties Ohio State all three of them have been on boasted that st. penalty so now fourth and three I watched the push on the right side by Joey Bosa and adolphus Washington they push him back but he gets around it and then cuts underneath the block patrols a of price but a good push by Ohio State put a nice job by Tyler O'Connor getting around it and it pick it up the yard the Spartans operate the tempo after making the first down Holmes slipped down after two yards that Tyler O'Connor there Chris for a guy that has not played a lot of football and is known as more of a passer Terry Moore the option guy really good instincts and feel they're on a crucial fourth down getting around that's that penetration and push of Washington and Bosa and then the field to be able to get behind the block that Josiah price was a bigtime play there on fourth down by the junior he trots off and Damian Perry the sophomore comes back in Terry run all the way Mexico collision knocked down by Joshua parry it'll be third and short Michigan State didn't attempt to pass in the third quarter and now Terry having to limp off you'd think this would be his kind of play on third and three four yards and drives have been very very tough to come by for both these offenses ten plays in 63 yards so far on this drive from Michigan State because Dantonio thinking in two plays to get the three yards here and forget about the field goal attempt no Connor Street keeper makes a cut first and goal what great patience I thought he might pitch it when he hung on to it he's going to get Eli Apple 13 right there put a good little cabbage and shoulder fake Apple went out onto the pinch and another great job there by Tom O'Connor just a good feel running the option for Michigan State Michigan State he has moved 68 yards in 11 plays trying to recover from the disastrous fumble point Holmes makes it cut slips it's a cold man powers down to the two really good vision there by Gerald Holmes sophomore out of Flint Michigan play was designed to go to the right but the Ohio State defense collapsed to his left like all great backs you got a head bitch and especially down inside that 5yard line he was able to pick up some positive yards from Michigan State get it down at the two yard line but that was just a got another good feel of the vision on 63 yards rushing he's out rushed Ezekiel Elliott the stud in this conference of that position so far it's like Luke fickle ran out of the field to call timeout so now state spends 1 on defense second and goal Michigan State trying to tire Michigan's say two yards away from trying to tie this game early a fourth quarter this is kind of Flintstone football I mean the the quarterbacks have carried it more than the running backs for both teams Kirk we have 12 completed passes for 120 combined passing yards that's amazing stat Michigan State 22 runs only the one pass second down it's not third down yet second down the option has been pretty effective you know once inside this red zone you wonder if they might give Conor O'Connor a chance to run the football game down homes the tailback Pendleton in the backfield guitars quickly but spins and reaches for touchdown now take another look but another great effort by Gerald home yeah I think he got across city you're right about the effort he got hit right there by Tai Kuan Lewis the knee is not touched until he breaks the plane that looks like a touchdown to me a 75yard Drive in 13 plays took six and a half minutes after Ohio State had questioned the fumble punt for a touchdown what a performance of this offense with two backup quarterbacks today this team is playing with an edge to him we heard all week about how upset they were about how big of underdog they were they felt disrespected and they have played without Connor Cook they played with an attitude I love the option here to keep this drive alive by Tyler hoechlin er got him down inside the 5yard line the way with Gerald home Shaun toughness running right through Taekwon lewis and into the endzone for the touchdown to tie it up ESPN college football presented by Kay Jewelers Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay cialis and Mission Impossible rogue nation own it on bluray December 15 the quite contract those who own house a fans have to appear every game right sure seems that way Michigan State to kick off now and after a long punishing touchdown drive on the ground tremendous Brazilians shown by this team once again through the end zone our Pacific Life game summary we'll look at the miscues by Michigan State that set up Ohio State touchdowns Terry hit by a nutburger Washington would fall on the ball and Ohio State would go 32 yards and a whole bunch of plays and then Kings fumbles the pun a one plate touchdown drive to got to Chandler Marshall for the touchdown the Michigan State how about the answer Tyler O'Connor keeping this drive alive with a couple option runs and then Gerald Holmes goes into the end zone with tough hardnosed running to tie it up at 14 and Ohio State offense now gets the ball back not only do they have just a hundred and five yards they have four first downs in the entire football game in seven points Barrett option look bitch the backfield pushed out for a fiveyard gain by Darian Hicks to Cassidy uh birth thanks Chris unbeaten Houston trailing 13 to 3 to Connecticut Kyle Postma its chance Allen with a 38 yard score right now it's 13 to 9 this game over on ESPNU Thom Hartmann Boston used to do called the players for Ohio State in their championship year this offense not presenting that group at all at the moment second in five Barrett delivers nearside catch made by Thomas but a bunch of Spartans converge in and quickly it'll be third and two you know you've got to get the ball to the outside to give your speed a chance to make plays against the secondary of Michigan State Zeke Elliott still sitting out the last play in this play as well coming up on this third and short but yeah he's going to come back into the game and sometimes you know he could come into the game and just block I mean he is one of the better blockers you'll see a college football to help JT Barrett run the football the seekin buses a long run the fourth quarter his streak of hundred yard games is in serious trouble at 15 Elliott 11 for 32 so far and it's Barrett the crease a good block by Zeke right on cue and they move the chains a lot of times you know you expect a Heisman Trophy candidate to just be worried about running but if I'm the quarterback I don't mind following number 15 nice job by the line also good block by Chase Farris but see Kelly just chops the linebacker right there Riley Bowl it down and there's the room to run it but he got Darion Harris like chase Faris maybe got bulla but now yeah better field position still been waiting for Ohio State to attack down field throwing the football took the one deep shot the ogor throat Sam Miller early on mother's in the slot to the left looking downfield now just throws into the bench under heavy pressure there by Lawrence Thomas and no flag it's really really good coverage I think the coaches were thinking the same thing they wanted to go downfield but they took all the receivers away and Lourdes Thomas came at JT Barrett high after he threw the football but he was close enough that as soon as he threw the ball he made contact and he followed through and ended up coming down on top of him discussion whether or not it was grounding the ball did go beyond the line and he's also outside of the tackle box so as long as it goes past the line of scrimmage he's okay but Thomas brought all 3:05 right down on top of the quarterback their bio state and a hundred five yards Kirk through three quarters no team all season are colorful had the lead after three with that few yards it's nowhere to escape got a yard but Thomas and bola closed it down it's slow developing play against a defense that's attacking downhill defensive linemen and linebackers that are playing with confidence and don't feel threatened when you don't feel threatened downfield you just pin your ears down and you take away JT Barrett's running and you take away Zeke Elliott's running and until something happens to make you come out of that that muck that mentality that's what you're going to do especially on first and second down so far boy get Marc Dantonio and his defensive staff all the credit the world for the plan they put together the guys need nine on so down berrak facing a blitz Leaguers nearside catch made by bad nick but not enough for the first down but before yards short see if he did get the feet down but that time miss she can say brought a bunch of light pressure they sure did something they've not been bringing a ton of pressure with man coverage but this time they did in Monty Nicholson was caught with his eyes in the backfield there was a big cushion between the tight end and the safety Nicholson who had him but because the pressure Barrett had to get the ball out of his hands quickly and Ohio State Welsh or the first down made a change at punt returner RJ Shelton and after Kings mishandled that last pint and he's not even a feel that just look the thing bounce do a tremendous job among the best to the country they knock it dead down at the two yard line Gary and Conway a starting corner down there make the play and Michigan State will be pinned back taking over in this tie game Robert crap a tree its owner among the luminaries sickened in this game today newspapers really get to ten and OH Monday night against the bills no love lost in that rivalry countdown who's gonna buy Applebee's at six o'clock kickoff at 8:15 late in the season whether here the rain has let up the wind has died down a bit and still at the back of Michigan State he takes over at the 4 yard line for the Dayton point we haven't seen any rain the entire second half this kind of a steady drizzle I'm trying to make it tough for the young quarterback and a true freshman tailback LJ's Scott in the I formation Scot verse four nice game still running protecting the ball but making yards up to the 24 boy nice job being pinned back deep in their own territory Ohio State's taking about the flip in the field watch the linemen get up nice block again by the center Jack Allen he also saw him get up to the second level get with LJ Scott a physical runner but you can see when you don't slow in town he's got some speed as well you know a safe team that is used to bullying people the line of scrimmage they are being outplayed in the trenches on both sides to the ball from the beginning of the game from the opening series of the game cuts it back picks up about five Heather well Chris you noticed in that last party possession no Damian Terry option in the redzone and the reason he tweaked his right ankle had it reached over his shoe he's walking very gingerly but head athletic trainer Sally Noble told me he is cleared to return so Michigan State can go back to that two quarterback system if they choose Heather thank you did you figure that would just be in an emergency situation yes like O'Connor's game Connor is really settled into the game it was after the throw that he made tuber branch on that fade that set up their first touchdown to Pendleton he seems to just add relaxed and he's just playing right now this is Scott and the freshman showing the strength again yet another Ohioan on this roster highly motivated to play as a young guy and bounce back from that to fumble program is last week it's a good point you know how a young back when he makes a mistake from two mistakes and last week's game huh badly he wants to be able to get his hands on the football I admire the Michigan State coaches for going right back to and tonight they've given him the ball six times and averaging close to seven yards and carry Scott again fights for him for two and Kirk with the methodical pace of this game you check the clock now we're down inside of seven minutes Michigan State would love to just continue to churn and chew and eat at the clock and perhaps just win the game on this possession remember the last possession that they had when they put points on the board they didn't have to put the ball in the air they moved the ball and and chewed up a lot of Clark and if you're Ohio littered they will have one pass attempt in the entire second half here Ohio State and offenses struggle drop the entire game you go down even by a field goal here you start to get concerned coño and second Anita's pressure it has to just throw it away it was very quick penetration from Michael Hill a backup defensive tackle it's a zone blitz when they bring the pressure with Darren Lee right here but interesting they dropped Joey Bosa and by dropping Joey Bosa gets into the throwing Lane of where ko Connor wanted to go at the ball he got in between O'Connor and Kings who he was throwing to it's an interesting mix up the change there by Luke fickle and Chris Ashton but he did it at the right time right into that passing lane over Connor has been able to convert a couple of 30 launch this app 10 leads 8 this time Ohio State jumps outside it's a free play this time it was not boast of a Taekwon Lewis the four time they've done that it's happened on these these fourth alongs third and Long's to make it a lot more comfortable for this offense salutely they have been off signs a crucial moment we saw it on Joey Bosa a couple times fourth down and eight made it forth and torito's be right before the big run by Tyler O'Connor now it's third down and and long and now all of a sudden another player offsides this time Lewis and gives them a much much more manageable situation here late this game on third down just opens up pages of that playbook for Dane Warner with his two cutset underdog here as the crowd comes to life no Connor looks to throw garyun kindly tried to get the ball to King's on a slant at the sophomore corner was right there nice job by Connelly anticipating the quick slant or a quick throw on third and short and does a really good job of working his body around the receiver and uses the right hand to knock the football away no pass interference got his body around it's a great eye so look at it right there it gets his hands around and knocks the football away to set up this punt so they decide not to try to run it on third and three the Buckeyes defense gets a muchneeded stop driving Marshall back Hilda's let it bounce and now it's Michigan State's turn to do a nice job in coverage Ohio State backed up at their seven five forty nine left cassadee Hubbard's with their studio update unbeaten Houston in the battle with UConn Garrett Anderson on a double pass to Noelle Thomas 45 yard touchdown pass but Houston just returned to kickoff 94 yards for the TD it's now 20 17 Huskies on ESPNU Cassidy thank you Buckeyes worst starting field position with the game back at their at 7 yard line under 28 yards total offense so far it's marshal in motion with a bag looking at throw from his ends I'm looking for Thomas downfield jump off broken up almost intercepted argent Cole Coonan was in coverage there and that's the problem thrown into a stiff wind that stiff win and also he got pressure from Lawrence Thomas and it looked like he may have thrown that football of his back foot it just didn't have a whole lot to it ball is well the ball is thrown short of Thomas and really good positioning there by Cole hoon and it's one of the few times we've seen Ohio State at least be willing to take a shot and throw the ball downfield we talked about a vote for it gets getting it tough in this quarter into this wind that when you hung up Thomas never had a chance again John russki the linebacker who'd go to the strong position when Winnett Davis got hurt preseasons played a terrific game well he's played a terrific game and he's had a terrific year the Stoff the sophomore who you know you talked to these coaches Mark Snyder who's a linebacker coach was at Texas A&amp;M defensive coordinator said he's just been blown away by how consistent he has been and understanding his role there in that Sam linebacker spot and now the Buckeyes need nine you know they can't get a first down here Johnson's gonna have to kick into this moon Michigan State could get excellent field position but they gamble a bit its Miller on the tops makes one man miss braxton miller not down at the 11 riley bullet demetria stocks grumbling from the cloud moon it's Riley bull on who does a good job of containing the speedy Braxton Miller number 30 but you also see Demetrius Cox get involved right there bola gets in to force him back to the inside where Cox and the rest of the white Spartan jerseys are waiting for him Buckeye fans will hold their breath who's Cameron Johnson excellent punters already had a crazy low punt earlier in the game but Shelton at midfield and that kick just knocked down by the wind actually the ball was touched there by malik big defensive tackle there Malik McDowell got a hand on that ball they've been pressuring Johnston all afternoon he finally got to it because he ran into the punter after he punted the ball but right there you can see he touches it he ran into it and the punter looked up to say hey give me the call but the ball was touched by Malik McDowell meaning there is no running in to the punter or roughing the punter just a fingertip touched by McDowell right there index fingers left index finger 37yard punt and Michigan State with 407 to play will set up in Ohio State Territory through the take command of this division macing you could lose a starting quarterback for three years thirty two and four and come into this environment with a couple guys that haven't played a lot in being position to maybe win this game LJ Scott reverses direction after a three yard game you know when you lose and something happens like that to you you either panic and everybody has deer in the headlights oh gosh what are we gonna do or you get you kind of rally around the backup quarterbacks and the defense says hey we got your back in the offense says hey man we're going to help you out and watching them play now for $0.55 56 minutes it really feels like they've rallied around the question mark of losing Connor Cook I totally agree this is a team that had the chip back in its shoulder after their controversial late loss and weaken this is the Michigan State team you sort of expect two single years second date gotta hurry play clock at one no Connor delivers complete farside Burbridge can't escape knock down a yard short of the marker by Apple third down create awareness there by Tyler Connor guy that hadn't played a lot of football there are a lot of guys that get out there they've played a lot of football they're not aware of the play o'clock he was making some checks moving the line the way he needed to completely aware of managing the game and understanding the play clock clapped his hands real quick to let the veteran Jack Allen though he needed that snapped a little thing that could go unnoticed but a good job again by O'Connor he was the first completed fast by Michigan State in the second half Scott in the game deep in the eye and 31 but it's a keeper O'Connor he's got it but a surge right there on third and short Jack Allen has been leading the way leading leading the way up front a good push Brian Al and his brothers in their left guard Jack Conklin don't forget watch the fullback kid he's got to get involved trend Pendleton he's gonna push try to help out a new rule now in college football you can get behind and help out this is just turned into a rugby game that's it first down to ten to play Scot cameras to the 30 in the clock becomes a major component here Ohio State wondering if they're going to see the football again frankly you know the wear and tear of Michigan State running the football now 47 times against this Ohio State defense those are body blows that Mark Dantonio his offense has put on the Ohio State defense and is talented as the Buckeyes are upfront you have to endure that over and over and over again you start to see the vision State backs have a little bit more room to work and you got to give credit to the Michigan State offensive line for being that physical they are working the play clock now minute and a half to play Scot he's knocked down at the 29 that will be third and two loop fickle and Chris ash anticipating a conservative approach obviously now we're down close to a minute to go in this game and a field goal potentially wins it they are attacking they're blitzing linebackers are bringing their safeties down try not to give up even another yard to give Michigan State a chance with Geiger to potentially hit the gamewinning field goal Geiger an experienced kicker it's his third year he's an Ohio kid from Toledo picked a 37 yarder in this direction that would be about the distance that they don't get another yard final minute Scott again Spanish squeeze Spurs down Michigan State now the spartans with all three timeouts will begin to conserve time you believe yeah it's a good effort there forget him Warrick trying to pull the senior Josh Perry there's also some good blocks on that right side Donovan Clark another guy from Ohio out of Cincinnati nice job being able to get up to the linebackers had such a component this rivalry the 29 players from the state of Ohio many of whom perhaps wanted to play for Ohio State won't recruited by the Buckeyes they go to Michigan State will always be extra motivated and they've never played a game in this state or in this Stadium and a chance for a a signature win if they can close this out great point and if you're Mark Dantonio and this team has come this far now it's about Geiger now it's about all the reps all the practice do you like it within these conditions on the right hash do you like it in the middle do you want it on the left hash where exactly do you want the football that's where we're gonna put it for you we have two timeouts to try to pick up a few more yards and then you're gonna try to put the football exactly where Geiger wants it you can see Demetrius Cox and others trying to keep him loose it's all good it's all good no problem you got this guy the most nervous moment that's when you smile yeah then not show the tension but this is a very emotional picker by the way he could be feisty and he's had his ups and downs this season missed one left looking picked from 43 early that's why you see the players coming over to try to get him ready in the right mindset but where they want to try to quit the football Scot stacked up you'll lose a yard if you're that if she can say the offensive line you'd love to say wait a minute let's not just leave it on the kicker here let's just continue pushing let's try to make this a comfortable field goal attempt and Michigan State will spend their first timeout Giger continues perhaps warm up for his big moment we send it back to Cassidy Hubbard sconces still with a shot to the wind fourth and goal six seconds Bart Houston in complete northwestern hold on for the 13 to 7 win risk for me back to you surprised already in the big 10 Michigan winning earlier at Penn State Michigan in the position having to root for Ohio State of all people to keep alive that's the thing I think a little bit this week there's been so much talk about Ohio State being tested a chance for them to chest it by their ranking that I think people forgotten about Michigan State after their loss a couple weeks ago in Lincoln they come into Columbus a knock off Ohio State they beat Penn State they're the team that's going to the Big Ten championship game to play maybe an undefeated Iowa and you win that game Michigan State stayed in there saying why not us why can't we be in the top four so this is not just about Ohio State it's about Michigan State as well Penn State the final opponent for the Spartans in East Lansing next week 25 seconds timeout remaining we love to get Giger closed at the moment it would still be a 42yard at Santa they don't get any closer Scott makes it cut McMillon go no farther than the 23 vonabell combining in the clock ticking down 13 seconds interesting that they had the ball in the middle of the field and now they're on the right hash very very different very very different from the middle of the field to the right hash remember he hooked one earlier he missed one earlier in this game in the second quarter the wind has been swirling around it was very tricky and Michael Geiger Toledo Ohio a junior a chance to snap Ohio State's win streak at 23 give the Spartans the command in this division keep their dreams alive holding the conference and making the playoffs who tell me his pulse rate isn't about 120 right now he looks calm wonderful hi Oh state with the two timeouts will freeze him or fail let him go ahead and attempt this without falling the timeout from 41 yards Geiger meir standing next to the official calls timeout we waited list until the ball is snapped and as you suggest it did freeze him in that ball knock through but Geiger will have to wait a little long as they sting the watch Urban Meyer because he he kind of walked over and said hey listen I'm tap your shoulder I want the timeout he walked he was standing there for maybe 10 or 15 seconds kind of whispering and the guys here and then he eventually taps the official and he was probably telling as soon as I touch you want that timeout so with one more time out he decides to freeze him in Michigan said we have to wait we wonder whether this junior can deliver a victory that would be extremely sweet for this team that entered the season with tremendous expectations off the Cotton Bowl win over Baylor guys like Cooke and Calhoun came back because they believed this was potentially a national championship team haven't hit their high note all season waiting for complete performance we still got a timeout Kirk if Maier wants to freeze Geiger again he can but he's not standing next to the official this is Geiger from 41 for the win Michigan State as gutsy as it gets spoiled senior day snaps Ohio State win streak and takes command of the Big Ten East behind two backup quarterbacks and an Ohio native kicker and a tremendous defense pretty incredible to faked an LJ Scott's last run moves the ball from the middle of the field to the right hash and Giger's probably be the first one to tell you he didn't necessarily hit that ball to cleanest if he's ever kicked a field goal and it had a little bit of a spin on it it was moving to the left in a hurry deserves much credit for the effort what he did replacing the quarterback cook from Taber pepper Matt max wood with the hold and Geiger knocking it through and then he did about a 20 to wit Mills of the right arm running down the field that has about as sweet as it gets for a kicker back in his home state to meet Ohio State up until Ledo went to Ottawa Hills High School up in northwest part of the state of Ohio and can imagine he's dreamed about an opportunity like this his whole life and Michigan State Kirk continues to be one of those programs that when they are counted out or doubt it just steps up and delivers again and again and this one stings for Urban Meyer this would be the second potential national title shot denied by Michigan State in what's been a brilliant four years here for urban tether all right Chris coach congratulations on the win you come in as an underdog you guys played with the chip on your shoulder and crap too all week that way without your starting quarterback how did you guys get it done yeah we just keep reaching higher I guess you know we just keep talking about it just be mentally tough and we said coming into this year that we needed to reach higher and this was the day we had to do that chips are a little bit against us and I thought the one thing that made a difference you know we've been chased all year long so far in ten games in this game we got to be the chaser so we could chase this game and so we could play on emotion and it seemed like a lot of that came from your defense amazing to think that they held the Ohio State Buckeyes to under 150 yards how are they able to to really limit anything that the Buckeyes could do on the field first thing we had to do was wound up front on both sides of the ball and I thought we did that second thing we had to do was allow no explosive plays obviously we gave way to turnovers but big turnovers but we rallied back and that's just an attitude you know we rally back you said that all of your goals are in front of you how does this win helped you achieve those goals well I think if we win the next game we're going to Big Ten championship game so that's a start go to the quick prognosis on Connor cook and his availability for next week well we hope they could be back you know missing if it's a daytoday thing you know the human body you do amazing things with it I'll let you enjoy this smart nation total team win for O'Connor and that defense a team t strong performance looking at strong defense from Michigan State v first towns for Ohio State 132 total yards Myer will certainly be criticized with the game plan very few downfield throws but Michigan State's defense had the answer for everything they tried today we've talked all year with Ohio State about their potential and could they ever live up their pinch potential and we said two things are going to happen either they're going to start to live up to their potential offensively and show that they can throw the football are they going to lose the game and today we kept waiting like we've waited all year for them to throw the ball we never saw the balance we never saw the threat downfield and it's a great defense like Michigan State who is just attacking down hill against the Ohio State running game they're just nothing that they could do as far as creating rhythm on the offensive side all the FBS teams this year the Buckeye is 132 yards is in the bottom 10 offensive performances all season long by teams in the FBS at Michigan State Dantonio knows it they're right they play Penn State at home next week win that win the division to go to Indy with perhaps a real chance to make it late rush like Ohio State did last year in the bracket we talked before they ended up winning this game about how it wasn't just about Ohio State coming into this game they're in the top 10 they have a lot of teams that are ahead of them they're going to lose football games and by beating Ohio State the team that's up in the top three you knock up Ohio State the committee is paying attention to that especially in Columbus especially without your quarterback now you have Penn State and then you maybe get an undefeated Iowa as teams ahead of them lose if Michigan State keeps winning despite the loss in Lincoln they're gonna have a real shot to get back to where their ultimate goal was absolutely just a complete gritty performance here you get the true freshman whoa hi Oh making the runs in the last couple drives the kicker from Toledo knocking through the winning field goal a moment he'll never forget and for Kevin O'Connor is fourth year in the program you do all the study and watch all the tape you prepare for a moment like this when the starter goes down for everybody out there Kirk who who prepares and wonders that they'll get their chance this was a game for them I don't think you can really put into words how tough it is to imagine losing a quarterback that's a threeyear starter who was 32 and for the winningest quarterback in the history of the school and Connor Cook is signaling in plays that was his role today still provided emotional leadership but Tyler O'Connell Damian Terry boy they will go down forever remembered as the quarterback still at Michigan State to a big win in Columbus against number three Ohio State Spartans stunned the Buckeyes take command to the east and stem very much into the playoff picture 1714 is the final in the horseshoe tonight on ABC playoff contender Oklahoma against TCU presented by Walmart for Kirk Herbstreit Heather Cox and our entire crew Chris Fowler is saying so long the scoreboard and John Saunders coming up right now all right Chris thanks a lot you can see the celebration still going on in Columbus although there are
