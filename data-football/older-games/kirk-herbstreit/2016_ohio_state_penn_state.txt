============================================================

the following is a presentation of ESPN on ABC a windy and wintry whiteout the Beavers idiom has these Penn State fans sort of push the Nittany Lions to a signature upset and sidetrack Ohio State's playoff votes welcome to ESPN Saturday then Football on ABC presented by Walmart and a Big Ten collision involving number two undefeated Ohio State and the Penn State Nittany Lions who come in at four in two off backtoback victories and welcome to Happy Valley we are certainly happy to be here Christopher Kirk Herbstreit Samantha ponder will join us once a year they white out this state even try to impose themselves on the visitors Ohio State seems pretty undaunted by most experiences on the road they've won at Norman when it Madison of course in overtime last week they'll not be freaked out by this but we'll see if the Lions are inspired by it Chris I think that those experiences even though this is still a young football team give them confidence coming into this game in this white out atmosphere the other thing is JT Barrett the quarterback for Ohio State the fact that he has been out there and played in so many of these battles they know how he'll react and they lean on him and obviously rely on him face it last week in Madison Ohio State still trying to kind of find that passing game but one thing they could count on his ability to improvise often times he was holding the ball in that backfield good coverage downfield but he's able to find the first down here extending a play third down and crucial moment the game he feels the pressure steps away from it there's the strength to get away keep the play alive and instead of running instead he finds Curtis Samuel downfield for a big first down and this is kind of that factor I always talk about the leadership in overtime willing his team to a victory kind of finding a way to get it done and keep in mind Curtis Samuel may be the most electrifying player on that Ohio State offense they're gonna find unique ways to try to get him out in space to give him a chance to make some big plays yeah they score about 50 a game so Penn State's defense needs all the help you can get to get some good news because two key linebackers will return tonight after injuries Jason Cabinda middle linebacker Brandon Bell on the outside they not start they hope to get a lot of snaps out of these guys all hands on deck knee to the slow down Ohio State but Eric sickles their top defensive lineman sits out the first half with the suspension and the Lions curb score enough points to pull this upset well they got one of the best backs in a big pin to say quam Barclay had a big game last year against the Buckeyes close to 200 yards I think he's coming into this game played in the last two games against Minnesota at Maryland I think the quarterback trace effects orally to me is the key for Penn State he's still a young quarterback he's gonna be going up against the very athletic Ohio State defense they run a lot of what Ohio State will do a lot of zone read he needs to be involved in the running game to open up opportunities for Berkeley and that could also opportunities the playaction pass he really admires JC a Barrett kid he live up to that standard on a wintry windy night little precipitation in the air Ohio State and Penn State coming up live from a white it out Beaver Stadium the Nissan freak a rush with Stan Barret Matt Brown and mark may is next after this message and a word from our ABC stations welcome to the Nissan pregame rush nissan premier partner of the Heisman Trophy welcome into the studio along with Mark May backgroud I'm staying beretta let's show you what's happened earlier today in college football number one team in the country Alabama taking on Texas A&amp;M Jonathan Allen big defensive lineman scoops him scores 30 yards in for the score his second score of the year the Crimson Tide's 9th defensive score 20 in a row for Alabama 10 straight games with a non offensive touchdown Illinois taking on Michigan Michigan getting into formation to set it up for Wilson spate I think coach Jim Becker sent this from down from heaven mark that's it Tommy play he dumped at the out formation that is the I formation and the defense good issues with number eight Nebraska to Purdue Huskies best Reagan since 2011 Tommy Armstrong Jr DeMornay piersonel easy pitching coach not even touched on a play score for Nebraska Nebraska Vin's is that lost to the boilers last season TCU taking on number 12 West Virginia Mountaineers six and over the first time since 2006 Skyler Howard I'm really impressed with Skyler Howard and the entire football team West Virginia's gotta be taken serious number seven Louisville NC State Lavar Jackson 431 total yards four touchdowns give him 34 touchdowns on the field it's over Heisman is over I'm calling it right now breaking news he's real good gonna have some company in New York with JT Barrett though who wins tonight in what I think Ohio State wins but I talked to urban yesterday is worried about the environment being tough white out got a stuff that tailback JT Barrett needs a fast start his last two games he struggled in the first half if he gets off and hitting on all sorts in the first half this game won't be close I'm picking the Buckeyes excuse me notice excuse me Ohio State 20 straight through road wins under herb admirer let's set it out to Chris Fowler Bellus thank heavens right this can be a very tough environment a stroke of marketing genius about ten years ago but a new twist tonight fireworks fire blowing around in this in the evening Kirk labs making a grand entrance emotion is a given that will they challenge quite a scene big opportunity for both these teams tonight unity is the reason behind the white to bring this crowd more than a different 5,000 together and imposed themselves in the visitors from Ohio State with the great road teams he has seen in the history of this port 20 straight road victories and there is say Quan Berkeley the guy that Kirk hired out of the opening can he have a big game as he did a year ago and a loss in Columbus and JT Barrett the steady hand leading the Ohio State offense this has been the Nissan pregame rush kickoff from Happy Valley coming up but now we'll look inside these Heisman House all in white and on their feet as a welcome back to this presentation of the Big Ten on ABC the rain has moved out to the east the wind is howling 15 to 20 miles per hour with a be a factor it will feel a lot colder than 43 degrees of 100 percent chance of a whites out Penn State won the toss to Kirk James Franklin said he wants to establish early momentum get the offense going it's worked the last couple weeks he's taking the football interesting interesting it you would think with this atmosphere he want his defense out there but he doesn t told us boats on the field before the game that want to take the ball and get the ball in the hands of my quarterback back and try to create some early confidence in momentum david networks household after a debacle on the big house two feet down loss at the hands of the Wolverines backtoback home wins Minnesota in overtime and then Maryland they looked very good offensively in those two games but the challenge much greater tonight we'll put it away true freshman miles Sanders back deep for the Nittany Lions urban drives it and it'll go through the end zone so here comes tres McSorely the sophomore who won the Battle of his starting quarterback and brings an interesting skillset to this game he sure does I think he's very comfortable with his system his ability to run the ball make quick decisions he's got a compliment sake WAMP Barkley and I in that zone read game quick reads when he gets the ball out of his hands quickly he's very accurate I honestly think he's gonna have to take some shots downfield against Ohio State who plays a lot of mantoman coverage you get a great group receivers they've got to try to connect downfield they averaged about eight shots a game down field and money could mix early connect on Myers says this is the best group of receivers that he's faced in in a while not just this season pick another reason he wants to try to get the ball downfield as the battle in the trenches on paper favors the young Ohio State defensive line they've really planned well these last two or three weeks packed with a couple of freshmen at guard for Penn State Berkeley in the backfield they fake it to him and it is a run from its early comes out of Ashburn Virginia wit guy not overly physical here's your pack players from chickfila well are you gonna start with safe want Barkley we've talked a lot about him tonight also Paris Palmer who is in starting at left tackle he played a lot last year had 11 starts but with the injury to Andrew Nelson he steps in at left tackle and Brandon man moves from left over to right back for one second and five at the laid hand off the court he's got we're safe on Barclay barreling out here midfield he had a breakout game against the Buckeyes last year at Columbus 194 yards just talked about mantoman watch the linebacker Baker turned his back and run with it tied in there's nobody left here because he's dropping back in coverage concern with the tie did so getting through the initial surge in the Ohio State defensive line all said it opened up for a very talented state want Barkley get 19 on his first carry trying to get the edge sama Humber did a good job forcing him out and Jerome Baker was there as well part of this office having success tonight and opportunities is when you run Berkeley and you get McSorely involved in the running game all the Sunday Ohio State defense gets concerned about that the linebackers the safeties and that opens up opportunities for playaction pass to try to throw the ball downfield Bassets bankís Nikki the tight end gangly dangerous receivers speeding down inside of the Ohio State 30 just talk prints about what running the ball can do and watch the linebackers because they have to be aware and respect that see how they both came off you saw Raekwon McMillan and Chris Worley both come up see 35 he hesitates nobody behind him and into a good job again getting the ball out of McSorely pans quickly for a quick throw the city is a six foot six former allamerican in high school basketball and football and now mcsoley he's leaving his way for a nice gain on first down shows you what he can do making making the linebackers miss there he is a lot like a point guard running out on the fast break in a basketball court going up and down the court that's his kind of game with his quickness in the open field please don't really play a I temple they line up quickly but they didn't take plenty of time to make adjustments and they often use a lot of the play clock the sticky slips down after bacon indention he'll lose four yards well they had a lot of momentum going back to a James Franklin told us on this Drive I mean they had Ohio State back on their heels with that tempo and with attacking the way they were all the sudden they slowed down just for a moment and all of a sudden they lose a few yards and now they're third and medium this world high O state will really crank up the pressure on that defensive line yeah third down has been a nightmare for this offense all season long at 120 third in the country converting at 27% Barkley's in the slot to the right McSally trying to escape will be brought down late at the line of scrimmage by shame on the home was one of those speedy pass rushers along the edge and a field goal attempt coming up here from Tyler Davis who has been perfect this season Kirk 10 4/10 made 18 in a row and this would be a bonus for Franklin to get points out of the first drive they loop the ball well there and at second downplay call just slowed em down and when you put Ohio State's defensive line in a position on third down there get they're gonna come after you they're as good as you'll see this from 39 yards to give the Lions quick lead it's got Ohio State blocks it and the streak ends learn to pick it up in return ''tis the web he's gonna get some box on the far side a flag comes in he'll be pushed out near the birdie but so much for 18 in a row by Tyler Davis now looked like they blocked in the back by Robert Landers a defensive lineman but first a block go high o state getting great penetration really low kick do that but he is able to get the holddown but it looked like just a low kick yeah there's some precipitation look like gula has some trouble sort of handling that snap and getting the ball spun properly so penn state drives 54 yards but comes up empty and after the penalty ohio state will be backed up here No unwelcome surprise for you yes well it is part of it obviously right Fernet student section long d5 is part of the stadia Barrett and the tailback tonight Webber in the endzone and to get the Lions to jump they were discipline on a short game whoever plowing forward actually heard to do a nice game by that they go line give good initial surge there urban Bayern head the plays the offensive coordinator backed up near they're all in they're just making sure too be very efficient here I think you're gonna see more of my to ever last weekend I only had 11 carries against Wisconsin I think you'll see that up to 20 to 25 tonight ticks are the wear and tear off the JT Barrett the running be a good idea and again muscles near the marker you're right that could be very difficult to operate offensively the student section down there it is the loudest part of the stadium this is where the boys at number 16 is so hor solutely and if those the tackles Jones and Fred state they're looking in they're very short whoever moves the sticks you practice this all week dealing with the crowd and we talked earlier they've been in Norman they've been to Madison so they're used to dealing with it you have a veteran quarterback that knows how to handle adversity but as far as this snap town itself you know those offensive tackles many times are out on an island where they can't hear anything and they're looking down into the ball to be able to see when the ball is being snapped and happy to look off then after the ball staff can react to the defense those peepers prepare and he has swallowed up immediately hit by Terrence Brown defensive end this defense knows coming into this game that Ohio State has not had great success throwing the ball down to you they're passing in the last few weeks have been born short to intermediate so they want to take away those short to intermediate throws and they really want to lock in on JT Barrett Michael Webber and Curtis Samuel in the running game Samuel and the slot to the left empty backfield to bear on second and nine delivers a pass grotz Noah Brown and posing receiver couldn't come up with it 39 now he would have been short even if he was able to come up with his catch but it on a cold night these receivers from Ohio State keep track of drops for both sides we got to do a really good job of concentrating few L to secure that football before worrying about taking off and running JT's straight back for the pocket crossing around dontre Wilson stretches does not get first down yardage Brandon Bell the linebacker again back from an injury holds about and here comes upon yeah you talked about bail in the open and he's one of the more instinctive linebackers they have they've missed him obviously a lot with Cabinda these last four or five weeks the leadership if nothing else and big there for the Pitt State defense to get a three hour to get to the forced to punt here to get the ball back to their offense John Reed back deep receive the punt the Aussie perhaps the nation's best Johnston I'm sit pretty high and pretty deep and read did call the fair catch and head state after a impressive but ultimately unproductive opening drive goes back to us see : Berkeley is their freshman a year ago told me he was almost in awe physique Elliott and Braxton Miller for Ohio State but he busted out a breakout game of 194 yards Griffin after the game Zeke the guy who he looked up to racks in all those defensives does now in the NFL came over said hey kid you're a great player keep it going to meant a lot to him very cool to hear that and he's genuine what he says something those of guys he had been watching what he's in high school it meant the world to him he faked it to him and first down they sorely loots it down field and the city who has both catches soap off the line site could not come up with it Malik hooker was assigned to guard him and I'll be an interesting matchup absolutely to tie dingus tricky it's six six 252 pounds does it create catch radius whatever it takes tonight at this kind of game right whiteout should have some sod in the facemask in a game like this hey looks like he's not only the grass tear you want to get a little bit banged up he's a great physical who's a lanky guy that did not go for blocking mixer pitch off there he goes to Chris Godwin the receiver so a little tricky play there from Jill moving on the offensive coordinator he's read the end man on the line of scrimmage right here this is his dive read once he makes this read he decides okay he's committing down he's gonna pull out now once he comes out here now instead of pitching it it's it's again it's a lateral but that is a form of a triple option at today's football did you play with the tempo here and tempo throw far side Godwin dropped it Joe Morehead hired by Franklin to run the offense he was at Yukon for a while it was young a head coach at Fordham in the last four years I think he fits in here perfectly when you talk to him and he's got roots and Western PA is family and I think that was a big part of you know that James Franklin felt he was a right fit because he knew the community and knew the state wants to be here wants to be a part of the Nittany Lion family totally different offensive system than last year McSorley gets good protection score a tight end that's Pancoast in there with his sticky out for the moment and it's third in 10 if you've seen these first couple drives one thing that you're saying is to get a lot of pain there one thing that they're doing a good job of is with Ohio State sobota to rush the quarterback they are getting him back and the ball is out and not only is that important to give him time it also happens to be when he's the most accurate is when he's back one hitch ball is out he's going to usually throw the ball on the money so far he's been able to keep the Ohio State pass rush away from him they rush for chased and throws it away it won't be all night they're gonna be able to keep bosun company out of there is it and when they get you to third down you're gonna see Nick bozo with Jaylin home Sam Hubbard in Tae Kwan Lewis and look at the four these guys what a luxury to be able to win oneonone battles up there to be able to get look at if you're flushing the quarterback which is four and you still have seven in coverage very very few teams Washington's doing that out in the pac12 very few teams can do that on third down without half of the blitz late Gillikin is a freshmen punter he's been excellent this year was a real area of weakness last season for Penn State he gets their way to most and makes a fair catch at the 26 yard line Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart this Halloween save on candy costumes and more at Walmart that did part by Nissa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy and chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich so zealous there's some battle scars in him spiffed up for tonight's game our aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear committed to honoring blimp or the athletes to demonstrate hard work on and off the field Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff Mike just sickie the tightend walking slowly to the locked room to have that leg looked at that would be a blow to the Lions offensive game plan if he cannot return second possession for Iowa State Weber is in the backfield as Jason Cabinda the middle Packer who returns tonight for that hand bandaged up made the stop he's right here in the middle watch him shoot the gap nobody accounts for him time's up that blitz perfectly it's the rest of the Penn State defense call third 41 also involved there but Cabinda how refreshing for Penn State fans to be to see him back into light off the net with that experience he's the commander of a transitioning into the plumbing practice was missed last few games the option Barrett it's a Weber who shoved out that that one yard loss on first down Billy has lost now a total of three yards rushing all season in E and almost a hundred carries that's mindboggling I'm good the guys up front of blocking yeah absolutely in this case on this play though Chris if that play was just strung out against a Penn State defense that even though they lost a lot of guys last year especially the defensive line this group has experienced at the second and third level and they can run and you're gonna take that long on an option play they're gonna chase it down wherever out wide to the right Samuel in the slot bare up from the pocket on third down deliveries to Marcus ball but it's item is gonna be stopped short of the first down again we're surrounded by Cabinda and company here comes apart again you go back to the last couple weeks with Ohio State's offense not comfortable right now strong to ball down the field so Penn State knows that and they're not threatened by it at this point until they are threatened by it they're gonna squeeze the underneath routes let him throw it underneath rally to the ball and forced to punt on third down wind is blowing left so Johnson nice to drive it pretty low that is a heck of a punt given the wind Reed trying to escape makes the first man miss and is knocked down at the 25 yard line scoreless and a defensive nominated 1st quarter here in Happy Valley gastly hover for their Taco Bell studio update number 16 Oklahoma visiting Texas Tech Baker Mayfield who else Dede Westbrook for his ninth touchdown in four games Sooners looking for a fifth straight win against the Red Raiders 13 nothing in the first Chris Harvey back you guys audacity Thank You senators off to a good start West Virginia looking impressive out of the big 12 today are their best point of the year the Lions from there 24 feeds sake one part play onto first and he bounces it gets the edge it's hard to do that against at Ohio State defense McMillan was chasing him but a nice game the tackle Brandon man actually made a really good block here on Sam Hubbard to be able to get him to the edge the Wisconsin had success getting to the edge on the jet sweep c6 Hubbard right tackle man does a good job of locking him up and he's got the speed if you give him the edge to outrun the linebacker there Jerome Baker their best offensive lineman Andrew Nelson out for the season with a knee injury so man if he can make watch like that fill in well it'd be good news for Penn State Victor Lee keeps it and he is wrestled down immediately by Hubbard third and short now I estate starting to tweak their their attack and how they're defending that zone read look that time they had two defenders Sam Hubbard right in position to be able to take to quarterback but they also had Baker the outside linebacker taking away say calm take on Berkeley nowhere to go there it's a long yard mark the emotions back in to the right of McSorely and they feed it to him Berkeley first ticketed to secondary in the Buckeye territory at 2:40 Chris Watson kaya the center get up and make a big block right here he's reading Hubbard but it's too blocked by the center climbing up to Macmillan it opens that up along with a nice block by man again the right tackle and all it takes is just a little bit of room he's 225 pounds but because he is so quick it has such great vision he accelerates through there in a hurry guys defense that a great job is here at limiting explosive plays by opponents the part that got 27 and Penn State's but they can a couple big players already they actually make slowly a dab field shot looks it DeAndre Hopkins in a jump ball but it's broken up by Marchand a lot of oil I'd like to call my job or head here have some success running the Ohio State defense is thinking about stopping that running game to get oneonone take a shot mr. best vertical receiver in Thompkins he's got to be able to fight Lattimore before that football just back to it almost came up with a play but Lattimore looks like he just got a hand on it found the ball late there and knocked it away the record Tompkins averages more than 18 yards said his 18 catches has been a down field weapon this is Miles Sanders fake the reverse and the freshmen escape he's in deep trouble and he takes a big loss back into the Penn State side of the field jaylen Holmes Damon Webb a bunch of white jerseys were around jigglin Holmes doesn't get talked about enough but but I think his instincts I think he just keeps getting better and better at 6'5 275 pounds plays very athletic off the edge for his size that time just did his job was it concerned about the reverse going back the other way had his responsibilities took away the play in the freshman after Holmes had it retreated more and lost another five yards and now an all too familiar situation with this Lions offense third and very long 80 20 yards here to keep the drive alive McSorely buying time he's a good runner needs a block or two and is gonna be stopped at the Ohio State 40 gets 10 yards back but it's fourth and 10 James Franklin uses all these analytics he says you should go for it on fourth down more than the coaches handbook says you should but when they need ten you think he's gonna pin it back you know Penn State now the last couple times they've had to ball they've had some big runs they've gotten into a high o state territory and I think it's been a combination of just not quite going with the right play remember earlier on his second down they slowed down the momentum on the previous Drive and it really affected that tribe this time they tried or doublereverse that play blows up on them so they're forced to be in third and long in both those situations so here's Gilligan the freshman trying to knock the ball deep drops the point picks it with backspin it's a tricky night for Perot returners and it was both there but guys retain possession but dontre Wilson has had a is it an adventure the last couple weeks fielding punts Kirk yeah and with this win in his history of not necessarily always judging the ball that well I'm surprised he continues to get opportunities back they're returning punts for Ohio State just because the most important thing is securing the football he has big play ability but oftentimes it's it's a battle for him to come up with a football now he's seen it in the last three weeks about Darian motley the clutch starting boomer who had a a pick against Wisconsin other would call back he recovered that fumble so the Buckeyes are backed up again starting from the eight very poor field position for Ohio State in this first quarter getting the loudest part the stadium nothing for Weber in the middle again that's Brandon Bell imposing himself it's a good point about the field position because you're on the road it's early in the game one thing we've learned about Urban Meyer with this young football team is he tends to err on the side of caution when it comes to his play calling when he comes to field position like this they've already been somewhat conservative here in this first quarter but now backed up inside the pen again you gotta expect the running game and a quick drunk and JT Barrett I'm sure that's what the Lions defense is expecting the crowd is howling the wind is howling rainfall a lot from offense to think about here on second and nine lions some pressure they pick it up flip it to Weber in the flat and he is fighting for its two yards across the 15 it'll be third and short the buxom pusher against me there at that time yeah they sure did no higher state actually sent some receivers downfield to take some of the defenders with them intentionally trying to just kind of clear it out and give weber some room but get marcus allen and the rest of that defense a lot of credit for being able to come in there make a play get Cabinda very very active after missing the last full last month basically a playing was his team and being that leader it was saying maybe he give us 40 snaps they get 25 for balance take a commodity readlyn kicks in those stories want to play the whole game Berek from the pocket escapes when there is Brandon fell off the edge here plan 20 steps tonight he wants to make it impact now the pressure again comes from the outside to them to the offense attack or the ride it's Sharif Miller who's a freshman look how quick he is and you see bail get in there but it was really Miller with sickles out here in his first half Miller's had to play more it gives you an idea what he could do there with his quickness bounce didn't get into the wind the last one was 54 yards this one not quite as good but it sucked and the ball clock for an ohio state has cashed in the takeaway terry McClure in the receiver we knew it'd be a tough night for special teams and that was an illadvised attempt by John Reed there yeah the corner who is the punt return man to Maclaurin all over that and you figured somebody's gonna get a break here with the way this game is going with the field position Ohio State's been backed up deep in their own territory and it's a drop punt return that opens up the opportunity gives Ohio State great field position now and deep internet deep but in Pitt State Territory after practice on Thursday Reed was the last guy in that field working dan fielding wants out of the judge of a Shane but it wasn't quite as windy as it is tonight I was gonna go back out there at the corner position try to make a play to redeem himself curtis samuel surprisingly doesn't have a touch yet he's down in the spot right here whether bounces it gets blocks stiffarm down inside the 20 get out of bounds and no flag but an excellent one at Ohio State trying to hit the takeaway in the red zone down that time Manny Bowen took a poor angle and runs support the outside linebacker took himself completely out of the play you'll see 43 takes himself out and then it's just a lot of room on the outside there Penn State almost a late hit there for a 23 yard gain JT rolls out was very close to the line of scrimmage when he fires incomplete on the far side his 18 second sound of the first quarter who wondered which team tonight would make that first mistake those have almost made it for Ohio State but oddly saved him reads fumble setting up the Buckeyes here second and ten Sam Hill now in the backfield is the sickie prospect at the sidelines and the Buckeyes be backed up five but a false start false start fanon is our referee see Billy price to veteran coming over to talk to the true freshman Michael Jordan it's nice to have Pat Elfa Elf line up there the center 65 at Billy price with some inexperienced linemen around them they kind of steady the ship along with JT Barrett especially on the road there is from the pocket what's downfield tried to get it to Samuel there was some confusion in the coverage he was open but JT misfired again it's it's about trying to find the rhythm and timing see for watch him kind of go in and then wake his way back to the outside and he kind of got held up there and because he was held up but didn't allow him to get to the outside where JT Barrett was anticipating him to be and give us another example just a little a little bit here there with JT Barrett and his wide receivers in his past again his three of six but only 20 yards on those completions 93015 Berra looking again flips it out short this is whether is gonna be tackled at the 15yard line as the quarter winds down Ohio State had scored in ball twenty four quarters so far this season but they don't hear field goal attempt will begin in the second quarter cool corner Happy Valley back after this message and a word the local ABC station now with the second quarter ESPN Saturday two Football on ABC presented by Walmart Big Ten border rivalry and after a scoreless first quarter as well attempt to feel go here Tyler Durbin eight for eight this season earlier they blocked to Penn State field goal miss from 33 yards Durbin knocks it through so after the muffed punt by John Reed the Buckeyes move it 22 yards and take the lead I think Urban Meyer is a bit frustrated for the felony had a chance for a touchdown you saw him yelling at pears Campbell let's go back to the second down play where you could see the Paris camel to the far left is trying to clear out his job is just a clear take the defender with you and by doing that it will open up a huge hole in the outside he was held slowed down got in the way a Curtis Samuel see how he's being held there he can't clear that defender it affects the timing and then urban on the sidelines let's Paris Campbell know you've got it clear that defender just small things like that clearing a defender can open it up and make the throw from JT Barrett to Curtis Samuel accurate and probably a touchdown on that drive instead of a field goal you know so many components in the passing game execution and again we're just not yet see me but people wonder what what's going on why is it missing it's little things like that that that's all it takes for you to be off by just a little bit difference between after settle for a field or get a touchdown to the left corner Lucy if miles Sanders has a chance freshmen from the five very quick running back is a highly tatted recruit out of the Pittsburgh area and they keyed impact as the returners to check back with Cassidy in the studio Chris Harvey number 11 Houston in some trouble against SMU Ben Hicks James proche a 20yard touchdown hits with three passing TDs and one rushing it's 28 7 SMU at the half over on espn2 guys 28:7 I don't care if Houston's havin an off day or not that's it how about chat doors to the Mustangs the diss you students have you bring back any kind of memory for you and Saturday morning and College GameDay finest once I know you did kugel that so now McSorely trying to reestablish the rhythm that was lost or Mike gets icky a tight end went out for an injury they vacancy Bartley mcsoley looking downfield looping the bahai that's Hopkins who goes up and makes a nice catch now they say incomplete thought he had it Flickr was in coverage but couldn't quite collected on a cold evening well that was a great effort by both Tompkins and also the safety hooker to separate the football I think they that's an interesting look there look look at this effort here by Tompkins and receiver well that looks like that looks like it well at the end he didn't complete the process to the catch he still being looked at by the trainer's if the tires are rules expert Dave how do you see that one well right here as you can see if he's going to the ground when you go to the ground you have to maintain possession here you go he's got it there never when you hit the ground there he's got to maintain it all the way through and he doesn't I was gonna say Dave complete the process of the catch I think some fans see his shoulder hit he still has the ball but then it comes out that's the incompletion exactly it's like a centerfielder in baseball show me the ball exactly if it held it a split second longer impact was hurt his bachelor boy and he got up slowly don't be helped off they they need to have Thompkins in there Mike the sickie since he went out Kirk he had the two catches material has included a pass he if you look in the last few weeks Kazuki and Thompkins have been a big part of the advancement at his passing game for tres McSorely no longer tied in on the Penn State roster façades kisi ki has a catch this season Shirley keeps it and the black eyes were all Chris Worley and Sam Hubbard its third long another defensive lineman dream on Jones 86 another guy that you don't hear a lot about but watch him being able to affect the timing here just the penetration nobody does a good job of blocking him and because he's able to get in there and have an effect you have Sam Hubbard and Chris Moore Lena a host of other Buckeye players in there with great pursuit this is that offensive line nightmare you got four defensive ends for the Buckeyes on the field Kirk did they come and they're also showing some pressure they end up only rushing for those poor guys flushed McSorley out long way to go was already across the line of scrimmage 20 pump fake that he's gonna be stopped short of the first time by Jalen Holmes you know the high OH State gets you to third down they've got it obviously a great chance watch the pressure from the floor what this does kind of like Alabama has an ability to do this it allows the other seven in coverage see McMillan he's looking it's a quarterback in case he's gonna take off and run our net another's a Nickelback is in there they don't have their backs turned in blitzing their their plan zone and looking at McSorley as he takes off to scramble the rally to the ball Wilson back to see the punt of Gilligan it bounces and Wilson's get immersed in the backups another risky play Garret Taylor here for the third time the Buckeyes are gonna start in poor field position it's an adventure with number two back there isn't it pick 10 fans get a monster tripleheader on ESPN next Saturday Michigan and Michigan State East lands to get noon for the Paul Bunyan trophy northwestern losing that horseshoe at 3:30 and then in prime time that Braska still unbeaten after that he passed s keeper to today they visit Randall but guys from the 11 yard line James Franklin was very steamed in that time ie felt that the spots to get back at the eight that's where Wilson was tackled after fielding that on the hop Barrett as they pick up the pressure has good protection all kinds of time and now lobs it for Samuel down the sideline he's looking for his first touch that was overshot and I think that's that's where Ohio State is right now probably the most confident in their passing game I think it says a lot about what's frustrating Urban Meyer is when things break down JT Barrett's ability to improvise keep a play alive and basically its backyard football he's trying to find out one of his guys on a scramble drill break free that time Samuel did and he's just unable to find it Barrett for completions before just 24 yards for vane whoever throws his strength and muscles were about six it'll be third down this Penn State defense Chris you talked to the open about Brandon Bell coming back and Jason kapenta these guys have been very very active physical on the run being able to come out there and make plays and set up this third down there it flips it far side and again Noah Brown cannot come up with it took it it's a it's a bother tied in and Marcus Allen none of the hitters in that secondary the safety delivered a shot yeah Allen leads his team in tackles he's essentially an outside linebacker it's like they have a flag down illegal substitution defense 12 men on the field in the ball of snap fiveyard penalty results of the first down well that's costly James Franklin begs to differ what do they look so active on defense they see these players trying to get off the field there that's Manny Bowen hmm he's right right there right it's a sideline I think Franklin feels like that was a very much Penn State Ohio State did not substitute to the umpire to God Penn State rolling the dice they're trying to substitute Bowen could have been quicker to the sidelines yes see if that Cruz really costly moves the ball to the 22 that was a punt he'll do at the pump there's deflating for a defense a series of downs whoever spinning fighting it's 11 yards and another first down long that mesh point is with JT buried and Mike whoever I mean you see the zone read but two great quarterbacks that run the zone rate they stay on that ride a long time with the quarterback to be able to make that read good job there with Webber Eric keeps it no game you you're Arbor Kirk he said that Webber's going to be a bigger part of the game plan more of a work force tonight's it takes on the load off Barrett and I think it's you and I've talked about that I hope it's expressed it I think he's just these last couple of weeks with JT Barrett when things have gone sideways 26 carries against Indiana 21 on the road last week against Wisconsin whoever's had to get more involved in already tonight he's got nine carat parrot an excellent protection downfield complete that was jeans Clark the intended receiver and grant Haley in coverage certain town he's just throwing that up and hoping there's not a little think about where this Ohio State offense was early in the year I mean they were scoring almost every possession if they go into Norman Oklahoma which is a good football team in a tough environment and they they just stumble into Norman they put their foot down in a tack down field to Noah Brown and ran the football threw the football and it's amazing to think four or five weeks later this the same offense then right now is just buttering when it comes to this passing here they freak Dodge's the rush and delivers brokenup excellent coverage there that's John Reid who had the muff earlier makes a nice play to break it up and here comes upon he does a very good job at the top of this round watch him off to the right they're fighting they're both fighting there and it's a berry and does a good job of being able to get up there keep the Goron away from the football undersized by the way 510 but there's a good job they say with his ball skills and his quickness when of those cerebral players it brings the iPad with him to study tape all the time at a guy who's tough with himself and he makes some mistakes you know he's beating himself up but the mistake on the punt Johnston placing Sanders as a punt returner and he's stopped after a short return at the 17 yard line Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart brought you by Pacific Life helping generations of families achieve longterm financial security for over 145 years at Ford we go further so you can Sam you've been keeping an eye on Micah sickie hobbling around down there the Penn State sideline good news and he came out of the locker room with that left ankle heavily taped was trying to warm up on the sideline you barely put any pressure on that left foot if he does go back in I'd say he's under 50% that has a hard time making putts I'm guessing we will see and thanks saying that was the leak cooker that was a play get her kind of kicked him and advertently in the ankle there Barkley is wrapped up and dropped for a loss on first down another new name his time it's Devon Hamilton another freshman this went out of Pickerington talked earlier about this defensive mind really emerging as the strength of his defense he knew about Tai Kwan Lewis and Sam Hubbard Jalen Holmes coming in the Michael Hill drama Jones Robert Landers Nick Bosa from incredible depth considering they lost three starters to the NFL make surely stampers free shows his quickness moves the sticks for a first down he's a guy was a good lacrosse player good basketball good baseball player in Virginia one of those kids it just grows up playing everything well absolutely in here because of safe want Barkley the linebackers have to be aware of him in the center of coverage what you love there about McSorely it's recognizing right away to take off and go earlier this year he was kind of holding the ball and waiting in the pocket now that he's using his legs more and picking up big yards like that keeps it there they fake it's at Berkeley the passing game is really struggling now so imperative that they get Bartley going quarterback runs to help the cause yeah well again I Twitter the weather was perfect tonight it or not Joe Morehead knows it the best way to try to attack Ohio State's defense with that talented defensive line is spread amount spread the linebackers out and try to find some spacing there from McSorely to run it along with along with obviously spike one Barclay second and seven thanks to early guys to elude McMillan and this has to fire it nobody open on the sidelines Godwin was wellcovered rare allout blitz there from Ohio State they brought the pressure and again they have an advantage up front against his Penn State defensive line both these offenses here in this first half Chris struggling mightily on third down Ohio State is one of six in Penn State so far one of five you look at the places third Nate or longer this year Penn State it's 30 30 of them coming into this game that that's just a humongous number no wonder they're converting at 27% I'm prepping all those pass rushers in the game again on third and seven play clock it to McSorely wafting the ball downfield Hamilton again very well cover some of the Lions fans wanted a flag they meant Arnett the backup corner was there and another punt coming up Ohio State locking him up in mantoman and Damon Arnett is another freshman keeps saying that about Ohio State but this is third down and you like Ohio State's passing game it's just that's your execution you're literally that's the 10% chance that that might come down and have a chance with the coverage and in these conditions throwing it downfield that good temperature Gilligan this is a fair catch made and that's more likely that's what they want dontre Wilson to do just making the safety yeah Buckeyes back to work after a 47yard punt visit down from the bear down in the truck with our Affleck trivia question for tonight Chris have a little history and social studies lesson for you tonight Walter Camp holds the record for the longest road winning streak to begin a tenure to school he won 25 straight at Yale president when camp began that's freaky it's a theme an election theme Kirk you wanna take a swipe at that when I have to know the answer I was tipped off gotta see what he's looking at there potentially a blitz here read what they're adjusting that maybe Penn State calls a blitz off but JT parent recognize that two backs in the backfield and it's Webber running right into heavy traffic on the left side all right mr. Philly could throw it at us here it was the president we will answer today's Aflac trivia question the answer to the question about Walter Camp and his 25 straight road winnings when you date winning winning winning streak sorry his Grover Cleveland in 1888 you know it was noteworthy about Grover Cleveland oh they're good I was gonna say sir two nonconsecutive terms let's guess a bonus question which term was it no it was the first to open your wallet courtesy there it gets good protection and delivers to Samuel finally Curtis Samuel gets a touch gets involved and gets across the 40 I'm surprised Penn State let him get free underneath they brought up blitz and because the blitz came from the outside linebacker JT Barrett does a good job of seeing that getting the ball out quickly and now Allen the safety has to try to make a play against probably the most explosive player in the Big Ten and one of the most explosive in a big panic for Samuel and it's hit them 24 plays tonight on offense before he finally gets a touch watching your game samulet motions over to the left side it's the reverse and to come back against the grain and knock down for a loss Govinda was there in a hurry go a farmer also the outside linebacker kind of found a home there at that outside linebackers spot right here in the front his job is not to let the fleetfooted Samuel outside of him it's ok if he cuts back in because you can see there's two other jerseys there but just can't let him get outside of you and say that farmer who's four four guy I mean he can run yep been playing some safety but he's kind of settled in there outside linebacker with some of those injuries early oppressed in the duty that everybody who could even be conceivably be a linebacker was moved to that position Parker Catherine the defensive tackle is is down on the field you see that Jason cabined I didn't know he said earlier but I you went in the locker room there number 14 he got Jack hams old neck brace which was laying around put the hele it's that kind of game like brace up that neck for these collisions that is a great look it only fits in this stadium I think there might be an unwritten rule if you're gonna be a Penn State linebacker you got to get that race it's like Suey's baby Paul Shuey you're going back today is there what do you make of this I mean we came into the game wondering could Ohio State get the pass game execution could Samuel get involved and right now just kind of a grinding three nothing game for the Scarlet grain yeah it is I think both teams are being a little cautious all offensively you do have some wind here the conditions aren't bad enough where you should just be struggling that bad and with the offense I think both quarterbacks are waiting for an opportunity to be able to to make a big play but the passing game that the downfield passing game continues to be a thorn in the side for Urban Meyer and fro Ohio State so they got to come up with different ways to to try to move the football the decisive plays so far in this game up filled elaborate low kick by Penn State's pitcher Tyler Davis and then a month to punt I read setting up a 22 yard field goal drive for Ohio State Katie Barrett recognized a potential threat there this time from farmer 70s coming the pocket dumps it off again but Weber they've used that outlet pass pretty effectively tonight whoever has to be thinking thank goodness I'm back involved in getting my hands on the football it's been a quiet couple of weeks for him think about the pressure Mike Weber loves it he welcomes it the last three years Ohio State they've had Carlos I go over 1,500 big went over 1814 the national championship year 1800 again last year Mike Weber's chance to become that featured back talked about big shoes and that legacy empty backfield on third and seven Barrett steps up and delivers a strike or a first down and they get Samuel involved on this Drive his second catch in there at the 46 of Penn State well he does a good job of working and finding the area in the zone see right here he's covered but watch him work back to the outside there's the timing right there between JT Barrett and his receiver Curtis Samuel that was perfectly done I got 11 yards a whistle before the play here 11 yards Kirk that's only the second third down no house it's converted in seven tries Orton thing the offensive line gave him time there to allow Samuel to warp back resulting in a false start fiveyard penalty remains first down bigbig would be in Tallahassee next Saturday night deshaun Watson an undefeated Clemson comes calling both teams off a bye today the rest up get ready for that one so first and 15 now and most encinia out there looked that way now fires back to frown on the right side and eat mussels for about six yards what an imposing receiver he is TP doesn't do this guy justice when you speak the person on the field yeah he's his physical receiver as you'll see it missed him at 218 but I think he's off here 225 remember he lost some weight a couple years ago had two leg injury a year ago he was ready to have a big year and fought his way back this year to become the featured receiver with all those wide receivers now into the NFL what he's become is that red zone target recalc fight to put a football with your brand Haley lining up the prostitute give it away about 40 pounds I'm also there dart across the middle and Wilson cannot collect it Leeson cabinda was active again there its third and long again Penn State's starting to bring some pressure to bend out they're leading the way providing that leadership making sure everybody's lined up but starting to bring some edge pressure with these outside linebackers and safeties that time it was Co áformer who disguised the late and came from JT Barrett's left and really forced him to get rid of that football pretty quickly very different Penn State defenses seen in recent weeks having Cabinda and Bell back in there and again they're going without their best defensive lineman Garrett sickles in this first half suspension he'll come in after halftime get a call timeout your Penn State I think at this point you'd keep an eye on Kurdish Samuel with him third down an eighth play coming up after we step away free flee the student section has lots to notice what's my man down there and there what is in the bloodstream that allows you to be shirtless on a night like this oh come on a few Ohio State I said fans right in the middle and it did it grew up in Ohio there's tutors here for this to a buck on the oil in the right at the middle of them right out the student section third day after the timeout empty backfield Katie Barrett five of six on this drive after starting four at ten Lions back out don't Blitzer Barrett has all day flips it short Paris Campbell makes the catch fighting but does not get first down yardage fourth and that's perfect defense the Ohio State tried to look for receivers downfield they took it away they forced to throw underneath and then they tried to chase the ball and now it's gonna set up Urban Meyer to take this chance here on fourth down yeah if they run a play here fourth down for the 13th time this season learn 9 of 12 the reporter back draw always an option here on four to shortout empty now Penn State's Brent fryers the defensive coordinator they spotted something there that caused concern it's for those things you want to make sure everybody is on the same page Brent fry taking over for for Bob Shoop who left to go to Tennessee as a defensive coordinator for the volunteers make sure again there's a lot of things you prepare your defense for a lot of things you talk about but on a big a big play like this it's worth that timeout make sure everybody's on the same page think about certain tendencies on Ohio State gets to that third or fourth and short what they're going to go to usually involves JT Barrett as a run threat it was like an important play offense a kid could make a stand here get the ball back little time before halftime to try to get something going on on fence the Buckeyes if they could reach the end zone on this drive that would feel real big going double digits up Barun keep it all the way and mix the first down and a lot more down inside the 30 predictable but tough to stop girl yeah I mean you know what's coming this time Billy price watched the right guard come out it's a nice kick out block he just goes right underneath that block right there you can also see the freshman Jordan climbing up to the linebacker they're so well executed by Ohio State they're on fourth and short they owe 10 of 13 diverting fourth band this year now put up inside the Weber tries to bounce if it'll be wrestled down after a short gain he's getting a little feisty in there state trying to get a better push with that offensive line with the double teams you have elf line and price trying to get a push left side you have Jamar coach Jones and Michael Jordan but give Penn State some credit on undersized defensive line holding their own up there at the point of attack parrot from the pocket what's the short baudet idea just banging off people spitting staying alive and scoring touchdown a high estate you deserve the Flex set to making a catch and run like that and to take a peek at his feet what an effort here by ball what a tremendous athlete inbounds there keep in mind six five 255 pounds spin move all the way into the end zone Jr out of California did stay in bounds guys just bounce it off of him would not be denied his second touchdown reception this season last week at Madison the catch he made when he went up into the air spinning in midair and getting his feet down for a big catch acrobatic moves there yeah all the snap not handled cleanly and the extra point is missed by Durbin on a cold night it's been tricky football perhaps a little bit wet and Durban not able to convert camp Johnson the five Hunter was a holder there you can see action this way with Ohio State and it forces the linebackers and even the safety back here to all come up they're out of position Allen number to see how quickly they're coming up because of this action right here and look how quickly he gets out behind the safety makes it very easy the best thing that JT Barrett did was he sought right away and quickly got the ball thrown out to Marcus ball now that he makes the catch he can lower his shoulder right there take the hit from Haley and now fight to try to get to the end zone so great effort by the tight end but great recognition by JT Barrett and a good job of getting the ball out quickly after those linebackers and safeties came down hill we talked about Haley the corners given away about 70 pounds that's head had tried to go low there he didn't work this be 80 in Johnston that was a pretty good snap he just he couldn't handle it cleanly didn't get it down in time for Tyler turbine and the but guys sitting on a nine and nothing leave there is JT ferret settling in maybe seven of eight on that drive 68 yards and a touchdown plus he had a the 10 yard run on that fourth in two so a big drive there by JT Barrett and Ohio State with the way their defense is playing those command of things for the moment Sanders well is his explosiveness and scoops out to the 30yard line as you check back with Cassidy Hubbard drive update Oregon State busy number five Washington and here Jake brownie Dante Pettis the Huskies already have an FBS high five thirty five point wins this season working on another a 41 to 10 in the fourth guys so Penn State with McSorley's struggling since those two early completions tikkas sickie who hasn't been able to return is over 8 barclays have been their best weapon rustle down after a short game and what that does when you take away a target like this icky is it puts obviously even more on the running game of Berkeley and McSorely but it also it to me it forces your passing game to change guys like Godwin who have been around in Hamilton and Thompkins maybe some underneath routes trying to challenge that mantoman coverage some rubber outs Pancoast the tight end trying to fill in for is to keep it off his hands and it's third down again yeah I mean and when you throw in the middle to a Titan look how crowded this is look at this throw from exhorting look at the arms that are up there I mean he got it in there but you're throwing it through a lot of different arms and bodies there to try to sneak it into a back up tight in who it doesn't have a catch yet this year I think the backup said it knows how good multicooker is now hard he hit see he seemed to know it there hooker his sophomore who's been a stud this season as a first you started different look for Ohio State here on third down instead of the poor they're rushing three here for showing pressure definitely looking for a quarterback scramble they're all over that next Rory showed us some of that moxie actually escaped and made something out of it but McMillan stops him short of the first down watch the spin move by Jalen Holmes over here to the outside he actually does a good job of fighting against Parris Palmer spin right there now you're rushing three and now you've got linebackers you have Baker and McMillan there in case McSorely takes off to scramble you've got him bracketed so he can't go left or right you've got him corralled there's nowhere for him to go once the threeman rush got home he faked out Jerome Baker but he couldn't quite escape the tackle of McMillan Gillikin has been busy Wilson has been as well collects that fair catch Sunday 10:00 Eastern and a villain Snyder's of running his pian with all the stuff you need to know inside stuff for your fantasy teams in it 11 o'clock Sunday NFL countdown right up to kickoff on Monday night Brock Osweiler and the Texans take on Juan Miller and the Broncos Osweiler Beck against his former team at Mile High 8:15 Eastern Time kickoff how your Broncos look at this year good start as you know rough patch couple losses but it's going to go down to the wire in the AFC West a mention how good JT was on that last touchdown drive throwing push conversion running on the fourth down Ohio State now a chance to add the lead they will get the football to begin the second half as well very very important for Penn State's defense to get off the field without all the more points on his possession berry papaw have time they were all over it let's incomplete yeah the greatest thing you could probably say about JT Berry is after three years of starting experience when when things aren't going well and you're on the road as a head coach or as a play caller you look out there and you're essentially looking at an offensive coordinator of every quarterback in the country out there the one guy that's going to be able to give you a chance to be able to execute your system and not be affected by what's happening or the conditions or the atmosphere is JT Berra about his performance here two years ago the overtime win over Penn State takes off again and is knocked down that was when Barrett showed everything he's about toughness leadership resilience that's really when his legend began as a leader he fought through a seconddegree MCL sprain game went into overtime Penn State was hat they had the momentum going into overtime and he fought through those two overtimes and I've talked with Urban Meyer and some of the players on that team they said Ohio State ended up winning that game Joey Bosa had a sack and over time the locker room after the game they said those emotional guys were crying and hugging each other they said that was the turning point that night in this Stadium for their national championship run Barrett needs four on this third down yes good protection and deliver is that Samuel with a little cushion there pushed down out near midfield it's exact same route that they ran earlier remember they ran it to the right on a third down this time they're gonna run it off to the left here again see how Samuels stuck here works to the outside again comfortable has time throws it to the outside in between the corner and the linebacker nice little window fear from Curtis Samuel guided and wide reciever some good instincts there is a wide Restatement to find that hole so still no deep downfield chance the real efficiency from Ohio State's passing game at the moment bring suppress your barracks still escape JT ferret galloping free dives how near the 30 wrapped up but he refused to go down out at Windsor 54 missing it bringing everybody windsors right there he added the outside linebackers have it Brandon Smith has it not always the escape a loss he picks up huge yards and 19 yard gain of what should have been a loss that can be a crushing blow to a Penn State defense that could not Corral the quarterback the runner was not down the previous plays under further reviewing there is no charge timeout let's spin this back Dave khatai and see if Barrett did did stay alive of course anything other than the hands or the feet touched the ground you're down exactly and touch it touching the ball the ground you're not down let's take a look at it right here see the ball all right balls good ball he's still up right now Branca he used the ball to keep his balance there and stay alive incredible it's a great great look at it there Franklin was hoping hoping that they blew the call the only thing that touches the ball yeah that's good yeah he's live unless something other than the hand or foot or ball touches the ground and give Jim Kimberley confirmed first out replay official tonight he was active with way way way back at the hurts tree there yeah it really great guy great official big tent love it the easy call for Jim to the guys there jinda 10 yard loss Kirk 19 yard gain of a massive play inside a two minutes before halftime now another example of JT Barrett maybe that doesn't always show off but if you didn't watch this game you might not know you talk about a big play this game especially if they go down and end up getting points on his drive bear it again from the pocket fires downfield just before he's going to get tackled and Terry Maclaurin the receiver makes the catch down inside the 15 wow what an effort to not give up on the play and watch the recognition here a JT Barrett is falling he's going to look right there and speed defender that time Danny Bowen coming up as he goes out 43 s coming up that frees up McLaurin behind him recognition as he's fallen makes the throw what guys trying to punch it in here Punk fake from bear and flips it short for Weber who drops it it takes more than a Jersey grab to bring JT down doesn't it absolutely has great lower body strengths that time just working his progressions he started left with a pump fake works from the left to the middle to the right to finally checking it down to Mike Weber using his eyes and using his shoulders to try to impact the safeties and linebackers try to freeze him to give his receiver a little bit more room to work with talk about a guy that has more than 2000 career rushing career passing the arts 2102 as a starting quarterback second and ten Samuel motions out yeah escapes and had this fire is it into the ground crowd wants intentional grounding Mandy Bowen that time was able to influence the throw he had a receiver theirs is tied in in that area it was a receiver here it's an interesting call here for Urban Meyer on third down remember I showed you know around that last play he's been very effective for Ohio State this year in the red zone he's going to be up at the top and next to him might be the next best target Marcus ball the big tight end who's already scored a touchdown they featured the bats and the tight end Bob to touch 10th not really the wide receivers so far tonight pressure farik delivers that net was a misfire was bhai and father was running a post there as forth intent they timed up the Blitz very very well there they brought brendan bell chris talked about him throughout this fire first half what he's meant but he timed it up very very well the fourth JT Barrett to get the ball out quickly he's trying to go to his receiver to tighten and go to inside ball because of that blitz he just had to get rid of the football so Durbin made it earlier from 30 and drives it right through so Ohio State lose it 58 yards 9 plays and adds to the lead here 12 of nothing with a minute 14 before halftime after that one halftime report stands erect mark met that crown in the toastie studio scores and highlights the might even wedge in a baseball score Kirk the Cubs a poor zip bottom of the fifth and Wrigley trying to close out the Dodgers in one of the World Series I'm falling I'm on the Reds fans I'm a nationally guy I like to see the Cubs win I would too just fine with that well the passing game has been a huge struggle for McSorely tonight just two of 11minute 14 before halftime mindful of the fact that the Lyon state will get the football to begin the second half Lions will need a a rally similar to the one that we talked about that game two years ago when they got back into it after a scoreless first half unable to ventually force overtime Sanders charges up in fixin at the 11:00 works his way across the 25 about a little Graham Bennett here with a couple timeouts with this strategy might be for Penn State look look at what they have done here they had some success for their first maybe two of their first three tries but the last Street Drive did not gone well at all in fact their last 11 plays they've had 27 yards and McSorley's missing his last four passes so you're Joe Morehead and you're James Franklin as much as you'd like at least maybe a field goal the offense has not been executing here his last three or four possessions very well you don't want to make another potential mistake and give the ball back to Ohio State Berkeley is carried at just six times he's in the slot to the right of McSorely motions back in they fake it to him nobody open and scampers for a twoyard game select about the game here in 2014 when the heroics of Barrett eventually wanted he was a defensive play and helped the Lions rally from from 17 nothing a defensive touchdown interesting that McSorely was looking to throw right ends up going out of bounds becomes a pivotal play here for both these teams ohio state also having two timeouts left barclays the sidestep traffic in the backfield as garyun conley came off the corner very quick and blew the play off Hubbard on the tackle yeah Urban Meyer may be thinking about seeing how this half ends he's gonna let the I guess it gotta let the clock continue down he's got two timeouts to work with certainly would have a little time and force upon here a chance to add to the lead the flashback again it was a whiteout Elias a undaunted jutsu was over time and he said forget about my my botany you just keep calling and I'll get you the win and then most with the sack here I'm a convert get closed it out you can see at the beginning of that celebration and I think again I think for for the teammates of JT berry they really learned a lot about him in that first year when of course that was a year the Braxton Miller went down with the injury in camp trainers Kirk will look at it and say Quan Barclay there he took his shot on the last play leave number 26 to be healthy and good to go to have any chance of mounting a comeback he's gonna happen here you get to shuttle and I guess Bosa coming up and hitting him in the back of the head Nik picking up his Butler left off and we wearing the same number of course three sacks already this season for the younger posit my third Nate who was Penn State that's been a timeout they're not Ohio State McSorley from the pocket fires complete Godwin as the first out of the first completion in a long time Lions in visnoh infield they get the ball behind the linebackers first time we've seen them have that chance to give him time to throw and to get up receiver coming across the middle behind the linebacker McMillan the 19 yards us the first completion of someone other than the sickie or a short loss mosa Robert Landers was there another one of those freshmen couple freshmen their pocket just collapsed and that's when they rushed for that's what they have an ability to do robbery excuse me Kirkwood liens gonna spend their final time out here with 29 seconds and the ways to go to get into field goal range for Tyler Davis and a night like this probably have to move the ball about another 25 yards to feel good about it perhaps they try a long one if they could move it 20 on state took a while again to get the passing game going hasn't been a super productive offensive night and all in all areas but the defense travels and it has again tonight it sure has and you know that perception by Godwin was the first perception of the night from the wide receivers and they've got a pretty darn good group of receivers that have played in some big games including against Ohio State they just haven't been able to shake free from the Ohio State coverage Barclays okay he's in the game blocking the Flex is mcsoley Lutz it downfield and the catch is man down near the 20yard line is the Andre or to be Deshawn Hamilton his first catch of the night the junior out of Virginia has great quickness and this is just adjusting to the ball and Damon Arnett the freshman not quite recognizing where that football was and adjusting back late but give Hamilton all the credit that were the world there and also McSorley for just putting it up away to pose a sideline for only Deshawn Hamilton really had a chance there to get to the football so two long completions after a bunch of empty pass attempts for McSorley move the ball to the red zone here 21 seconds no timeouts can't afford a sack Berkeley leaping for coconut Raekwon Macmillan that's those are two future NFL players max up headtohead there huh yeah and you think about usually you see a big running back leg Berkeley at 225 and Macmillan at 245 you see him in the middle this is basically a wheel route after he came in motion all the way down the field but chose you the athletic ability from Raekwon McMillan Chris he brought up a good point without any timeouts be very very important for Penn State to be smart here with 15 seconds working the sidelines of course if they can get to the 10 yard line they can pick up the first down to stop the clock but this is where McSorely has to be efficient and smart playaction he's going to take a shot for the end zone again Jeff but God was got a touchdown Penn State and a Penn State passing game that had bitten into the deep freeze for more than a quarter comes alive on that drive how enormous was that throwandcatch with nine seconds to go before halftime milah davis adds the conversion Chris Ohio State has a lot of confidence in Gary on Conley they leave him right here oneonone you see a safety hooker but he actually comes up because of the action to the running back Berkeley so they're gonna leave him oneonone up to the top now you just got to put it up in a way take Gary Connelly I think he looked up and found the football but I think he got to get Godwin a lot of credit he used his arms and to fit the position of the football Gabe got one a chance to come back kind of that back shoulder be able to go off and make a play on the fall on the football so the fact that was underthrown just a bit gives God what a chance to come back right there to make the catch good work of a progressive pylon can get a win battle so many times do we hear that from coaches in the meetings that was a battle finally won by Penn State and McSorely Kirk on the drive after all the troubles we talked about with his psyche I hurt three or four 73 in the touch two of eleven coming into that drop those stats sound great but Godwin has a lot to do with two of those big receptions I mean adjusting to the football going up and making a play and mint states coaches told us listen it's hard to check the ball against this Ohio State defense we've got to take some shots downfield and our receivers are going to have to win oneonone catches until this Drive their receivers didn't have a reception on the entire night Joey Julius and approaches it along and the return out to the 40yard line made by joke burger the linebacker a chance that touched the football there the kicker tackler he's aggressive he got he got smoked there he he's the guy that loves to come down and and knock people down making tackles but he's been targeted literally by by teams in the recent games yeah he's a big guy who can be very physical when he's covering his own kickoff did note kind of a nose tackle who kicks this is what he has him quite a reputation for hitting people and when you're looking at Penn State look at that ladies he's knocking guys out peppers made a business decision they ditch a Jessica block then then special teams start to look at the film and they say okay 99 he's in play he's not an irregular kicker the game for targeting jury is not on that play and then Maryland got thrown out for unsportsmanlike conduct and Penn State and is going to go to the locker room down only five after the Buckeyes have put together a couple productive drives or a little tempers flaring at the end of that half they get the guys separated now 12:7 Ohio State halftime here the capital one halftime report is coming up and Sam will speak with Urban Meyer after these messages Johnston into the wind I owe state the takeaway touchdown Ohio State the sugar amber set for the second MPSP and satyr Samantha ponder back to if you want a white out evening in Happy Valley JC Barrett in the Buckeyes a 127 leave it was Penn State driving down the field some big plays in the passing even cut into the lead it really changed the complexion of a first half Kirk where defense has dominated special teams miscues also played a part as well I picked the score for Penn State at the end of the half is obviously huge to give them some momentum going in Ohio State because Penn State elected to take the ball in the opening coin toss Ohio State gets the ball to start this second half and I think how they attack and how they create some momentum of their own here to start the second half will be very big but the touchdown makes it an interesting game as we get ready here for the second half Barrett 13 pass completions in the first half at a twenty four attempts also ran it six times at a big fourth down conversion might Weber had 60 yards rushing the good news is that Mike Kisuke the excellent receiving tight end for Penn State who left with an ankle injury appears to be good to go they've wrapped that thing up he's trying to get back involved in this game posta breaking it in that kicker the big fella Joey Julius have to contribute to the tech hooker big fella getting down there and actually helped prevent that from becoming a big return from Campbell let's take a look at our Pacific like Pacific Life game summary and misuse early for Penn State ahead of this field goal three points for Ohio State cousin JD Barrett kind of found his rid of this is a big conversion to be able to keep a drive alive two plays later he finds the big tight end market for a touchdown to give the Buckeyes the lead but if you just talked about right before the half McSorley seven plays 77 74 yards and a big touchdown there in that first path total yards this is going to surprise him as it feels like ohio state's more dominant we had 15 more total yards in the first half than Penn State option look so ever another look at the tackle on the second head kick a big ninetynine at 260 pounds getting down there and making his impact felt there in Campbell share of the tackle he has a history of being a great athlete growing up and likes to get involved he loves all done on kickoff coverage he's done it all year he's gone public recently about his battles in an eating disorder working hard to cut down his weight Bubber got six on that first down carry the option bitch that's on nobody hit for a loss mani Bowen the linebacker erect about third down when you're mani Bowen and you can stop the quarterback and then also come he's trying to pitch off a bond but he is so athletic Bowen takes Barrett and he gets out and gets involved to making the tackle so Bowen makes to play but Grant Haley the corner also getting off of a block so that play the option didn't have a chance therefore Barrett the Buckeyes well played by Boeing he rotates out now on third and seven three receivers to the left for Barrett and JT pressure that time he cannot escape Evan come on and Garrett sickles who's back after sitting out the first half suspended incident Packer that's right sickles on the left chuan on the right and this time the pocket collapsing on JT ferret Chrissy says sickles wasn't able to play in the first half but look at the difference in quickness from sickles on that side and chuan together especially on third down the first sex of the Lions Barrett was really untroubled by the rush in the first half Johnston drives a low punt bouncing around in break Garrity fields it escapes briefly he just dragged down at the 40 that's what he told me they were gonna do is bring as much pressure as possible against JT Barrett and of course they got after it really quick offensively he said even with the injuries he feels good throwing the ball down the field as we saw in the last Drive and he feels like as long as they can come down with those 50/50 balls they've got a good chance in this one today this tough salmon there is get sticky after some treatment and a half time back out there flexed to the right scoot Singh to Ohio State Territory at the 45 yard line he's reading Sam Hubbard on his own read right here he collapses down and there's nobody to the outside the safety Willy cooker also got caught inside so when he pulled that off of his read of hopper the only guy there's two corner Lattimore after a big game gets a 16 and then tough conditions cuz the rain is falling more than it has still swirling around in here hesitation some confusion it's back to the line of scrimmage before Lattimore the corner absolutely and that play didn't have much of a chance Lana more on a corner blitz blew that play off but it just looked like there was something not quite right with Vic sorely the timing of that play is right guard McGovern was polling but no chance there's a key play Kirk because a couple times of the first half Lions droping a Buckeye territory that drives would stall with negative plays like that to kind of ruin the momentum see what they could do on second and ten Shirley flips it and way over the head of Godwin who is bracketed over there this time they bring in another blitz from that from the bound tree Marshawn Lattimore the sophomore corner they brought that blitz and it freed up the receiver but I don't think McSorely felt it or solid into his a little bit too late so now on those read it third in long plays Lyons two of eight on first down that's all about right at first season percentage of 27 converting flower downs the sick he stays in the block then releases Mitchell he steps up and fires over the head of his receiver Sayid black know and they sport down tough to execute on third down against this defense they actually did a pretty good job of giving him some time to throw but give credit to the coverage downfield Penn State and I'm able to find any open receiver because of the Buckeyes mantoman coverage like Gilligan a freshman will again try to pin back Ohio State get the Buckeyes poor field position one more time Wilson is its sail out of bounds and they'll move up and spot the ball at the 18 yard line Barrett company go back to work a five I'll take you back to a warm September afternoon 42 years ago 1974 Stanford against Paterno's lines was the Oprah that season Oh top dot says the fullback got a duck down past clients Rubin 80 yards for a gamewinning touchdown the gamewinner 24:20 Penn State over Stanford Kirk the very first couch football game with the city person the place looks a lot different bouncing pretty cool he went to went to a high school game today or this as well my old school district their Barrett on the keeper the little Lions undefeated this year knocking off harrisburg I a team that featured a couple of future Penn State commits for the Lions no those the last time you have been in that high school come on it was a diet of flats just fun for you know watch that game in 74 it's not as compelling as the world anyways I'm sitting next to Eunice it's a thrill to call I came here for the first time with you JT and Samuel collecting it will be third and Brandon Belle big impact tonight his welcome back came off the injury Kurtis Samuel continues to be the guide @jt ferret knows he can count on to be able to find those openings in that zone between those linebackers and those safeties see if Derrick didn't convert one more time we only need to hear so tough to stop the Buckeyes in these situations Samuel we running right punch it back coming Samuel in the clear a footrace they will not catch him in the buckeyes strike quickly early third quarter 74 yards Chris one of the things that seek Eliot left was his ability to block not just run watch Mike Weber here lead the way right there and set that up that alley that was Jacek cabinda who was trying to fill the hole and it was Mike Weber who blew it up and opened it up for Curtis Samuel with that great speed that was his first carry tonight five catches in the first half it took him about 24 plays before they got number four involved tonight but now he's made a huge impact and house eight has stretched the lead back to 12 points if see Kelly it is sitting down on a Dallas at home tonight he's got to be proud because that's one of the things that he prided himself on was playing physical without the ball in his hands and that's what Webber did there put it up for curtis samuel for a huge touchdown for the Buckeyes here represented tonight Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart GMC we are professional grade AT&amp;T mobilizing your world director of Penn State and Valentin the 1986 National Championship team which was honored at halftime in the knocked up Miami and the Fiesta Bowl intercepting bitty Testaverde a bunch of times a win at 1410 the fatigue of the Canes showing up like you always say nobody gave Penn State a chance right yeah they were tired of hearing about it was it five interceptions by Binney peak gift topless making the one to secure that in the red zone but on estate striking quickly to quiet down at ground that was pretty raucous after the Lions had gotten on the board late second quarter brief plays to cover 82 the 74yard Ohio State's longest one of the season and the longest play Penn State had given up this year Sanders from his goal line he's gonna be a promising money back and returner his career did quite freshman that shows you his skills Chris let's go back to that touchdown and again nice run by Curtis Samuel but 25 Mike Webber right there with the big block on cabinda we'll give you another look right here from the other side just really lowering a boom there and opening it up and you can see once he made that block it was like everything opened up they sold out to stop him there on that short yardage play and the Lions answer now they try to feed they're stuck back but Seco on Barclay is swarmed under immediately there Jerome Baker there Robert Landers again the freshman tackle disrupted it in the middle this is where Landers who can make a play look at him in the middle how quick he is he's listed at 6 1 he's got to be 510 they can't block him because he's so short and quick and that at Dayton ready for bigtime football immediately as a true freshman they certainly thought about a screen it wasn't there and now will be dropped for a short loss by Jalen Holmes and another freshman of course Nick Bose has made an impact tonight Landers actually forces him to step out away from the pockets yeah freshman boasts of it he also have Landers involved again this is it this is a point in the game at 19 to 7 you're on the road Ohio State's talked all week about how tough it is Urban Meyer is as good as there is at knowing when there's an opportunity to capture a football game and I think he feels that after that long touchdown road run the crowd is out of the game big opportunity here for his defense to try to get the ball back to GE Barrett sorely short mass no the hands of a Sean Hamilton that's a great point you feel the urban that does it as well as any coach maybe better than most just senses of sentiment yep he could feel it remember Penn State scored at the end of the half crowd is back into the game it's 12 to 7 Penn State's believing Ohio State gets the big run by Curtis Samuel to get their offense going I guarantee his message to that defense was go out there get a three and out let's try to kill the will he falls on it you've been a touchdown but it'll be a safety for Ohio State and another special teams miscue tonight by the Lions well that it never had a chance ball went right over top of him he never even touched the football just sailed Tyler Yujin is a really reliable long snapper normally but he airmailed it Gilligan did a nice job to at least prevent a touchdown there's a fivepoint play to recover it yeah for a true freshman to have to jump on that ball before the fleetfooted Terry mix will mix Lauren McClure in rather is able to get on top of it saves his team giving up a touchdown there so the book has an unusual 21 points but you talked about the momentum and now they'll have to kick it away and the Penn State defense you feel like almost has to come up with a stop here to get the ball back if Ohio State builds this lead it'll be tough you saw a shot there at JT Baron when I just talked about with Urban Meyer that trickles down to the leaders of his team these guys have played the leaders like JT fair JT Barrett and Raekwon McMillan had elf line they understand it's not just the coaches so they're communicating right there now right now he's please say the exact same thing that we're talking about watch field goal punt and now an airmail it's snapped resulting in a safety for Penn State special teams tonight not what they needed Baris Campbell takes the freekick and he gets the momentum before being dragged down at the 40yard line a flag comes in on the return or is it not of fire I say because a shoe came flying at a white shoe not a yellow flag excuse me to Cassidy however in the studio thanks Chris number 23 Ole Miss taking on number 25 LSU after missing the last three games let in Fernet is back and back in the big way six carries for 171 yards of two TVs in the second quarter averaging 28 yards of carry right now Tigers up 2113 on ESPN Chris Erbe thank you Cassidy update from Wrigley by the way five nothing Cubs trying to close out the NLCS and the Dodgers tonight so the Buckeyes with great field position Kirk than what is a really important moment in this game and they build even more mother it in the backfield and as Weber nice penetration by Sharif Miller a redshirt freshman yet a gage Alexander man missed it assignment they're back up tied in mr. freshman out of Burke Virginia coming around there and just missed a block there on Shareef Miller made it pretty easy for Miller to bottle up Mike Weber by that crowd in the student section trying to help this Penn State defense come up with a stop very from the pocket delivers a strike and s Marcus Broadwick terrific touchdown reception earlier it'll set up a third and five with the big body of fall and I'd say he's becoming better and better each week as a receiving threat as a big tight end healthy now but is set up there in there in the traffic where all those linebackers are and really you're you're trying to get to third and manageable to try to give yourself a chance to pick up the first down it's not about picking up the first down on second down it's to set up JT Barrett to give him a chance and open up the playbook a bit once you get to that third and four third and five range five receivers for JT and the neighbor Paul start there was the right tackle Isaiah Prince backing up quickly yeah 59 510 leave her down the last couple weeks on the road at Camp Randall and tonight here at State College it's been tough for him I think of all the offensive linemen that have had to deal with adversity on the road he's proudly been challenged the most because of the crowd and being out there on the edge and kind of guessing a little bit jumping a little bit on that staff count those changed the complexion of the third down tall boy doesn't have any 10 yards buying time moving around the clock their first down before he slides down at the lion's 45 another big play by JT the one thing you can't with JT Barrett has let him kind of maneuver his way through there without somebody spying him I'm just shocked to see that they would free him up now they brought a blitz and they they rolled the dice a bit to try to get to him but by bringing that pressure it's picked up and there's nobody left after he's able to get around the Blitz because the line did a nice job of picking up the linebackers at fifteen yards in a play that's going to be deflating to this Penn State defense the adjustments here played pocket to there it keeps it again ducks down after a five yard game I talked about Urban Meyer and Ed Warner trying to take the wear and tear off of JT Barrett tonight and they've done a very good job up to this point he's carried it ten times tonight but in comparison to system just that the hits that he took against Indiana and especially on the road last week against Wisconsin it's been a very very different game and I think intentionally done by the Buckeyes where they've relied more on Mike Weber and some of the other players yeah totally agree been tuned up like that if the Badgers were doing him he has been these scrambles can't get away that time they came out of the backside that was Garrett sickles has made an impact here in the third quarter second time we've called his name and he just fights with cha Marco Jones he's out here he'll get involved in a battle here but it's just relentless with his attitude you can see he just doesn't give up on the play fights through notches Jones but Michael Jordan watch the left guard try to come over and help but sickles 64 to 60 was on the opposite side of Karl nest of a year ago so has played a lot of football that time that attitude phrase off for number massive Andre Johnson Anthony's elbow the NFL yeah Henry actually four defensive line if you count time on Barney's on the just practice squad wide open Weber a little push it and he's shoved out of the vents a sideline inside the 45 farmer will be fourth down bringing that linebacker blitz again his time is Jason cabinda up the middle Iowa State picked it up JT Barrett checks it down and it's known another one of those situations where it puts herb admire the position because he's not going to kick a field goal here he's gonna take this chance and go for it but those yards that they just picked up there on third down give him a chance the zone read order back run game usually what they go to in this area is desperately in need of a fourth down stop the Buckeyes can move the chains here add to this lead they take a timeout here consult about this fourthdown call important play coming up with the Buckeyes now up 14 and say hannah touched and rajesh perhaps time but honest they see fence other thing that drive has been pretty dominant tonight lions backed up their seven feed berkeley and he kind of cuts back in a loser yard berkeley has had a lot of ones this year trapped behind the line of scrimmage as the guys up front have struggled to block for him and he's avoided frustration he's got a great attitude of battery says it doesn't want to reflect any frustration because it won't make the guys up front feel good about block informa refreshing her that attitude from a young superstar running back mature beyond his years he's got it again spins for about seven it'll be third manageable yeah early in the year especially i think it was a combination of the young offensive line shelling and him maybe dancing around a little bit too much looking for the big play trying to live up to some of the preseason i think the last couple games and even at times tonight it's been more of just him getting the football and just lowering his shoulder and trying to pick up four or five or six yards lions deep free Buckeyes defense in an aggressive posture which surely takes off escapes flipz as he tries to make it cut his right in front of jerome baker you can see the frustration and i'll have to pipe he slipped but the guy he's trying to shake jerome baker's is it a linebacker the Urban Meyer and Luke fickle Greg Schiano just smile when they talk about him runs a four for playing linebacker he's a tough guy to shake in the open field for a quarterback and losing his footing obviously didn't help him but Baker's a bigtime player don't don't even know if leader to get around Baker to get the first down though but it cost himself a chance and so here's like Gillikin at the goal line this snap is not high but low does handle it and get it away Wilson makes hesitant fair catch at the 44 Kirk gets a final from Wrigley Field on the Chicago Cubs our world series bound as they close it out in six a shutout Hendricks emphatically beating clayton kershaw arguably the best pitcher in baseball five innings gives up four earned runs and how about the Cubs again Reds fan happy for the Cubs love to see it hope they keep going you got to feel good though about both teams in the World Series it'll begin in Cleveland and the Indians obviously trying to try to build a great sports here and that's it it's gonna be a great series and Indians and the way they've done it in the postseason they become the charm team it'll be a heck of a series before to watch on that Mars have a poem for he's a huge tribe fan oh yeah ask tubular Ohio new Cleveland says Samuel now the big 74yard touchdown run his time goes to the left and is dropped for a loss Buckeye State pretty good sports here caps Buckeyes very much in the hunt tribe trouble series tribes dolana there's all kind of things in minor league baseball that would come into play sue the Blue Jackets are gonna win the Stanley Cup every we're talking now you're talkin I've gone too far I know hiyo State won the national championship a couple years ago calves made the files but two years ago before winning it all JT comes abeyance whoever is turned a slip and slide out of bounds at the 43 this is Urban Meyer tweeting news support riffing on the Cavs dropped by to talk to the team deliver an inspirational speech about Championships there's a great relationship between Urban Meyer the Ohio State football team and the Cleveland Cavaliers because mainly because of LeBron James and how much LeBron loves Ohio State makes it very very wellknown his support for the Buckeyes so I think it's the feeling is mutual from the calves and the Buckeyes third and 11 this time they do drop back and spy fair but that opens things up for Marcus ball who makes the catch and gets the first down we'll keep talking about how they working the middle of that defense with ball and he can do things after the catch see the nose guard drops their little zone blitz not affecting the throw he tried to get his hand up on the ball but it be impressed with how Marcus ball catches it and then knows where to go for the first down now Webber a short game the Buckeyes continue to build that momentum and Brett bleed away some of the will of this Penn State defense in the final minute of the third quarter with another third down conversion there like whoever is one of those bags like a lot of power backs the more they get the football in their hands the more they like that they get better they get stronger as the game goes on he's 1 for 60 to occur he's popped by passes through the big block you highlighted on touchdown run by Samuel JT pursued and dropped my sickles a flag comes down but sickles his second sack that was sitting out that first half yeah they gotta come back with a vengeance son big time it is a holding penalty and tonight on ESPN after a full day of football ting offense number 59 penalties declined brings up third down SportsCenter at night go Brisco John Buchi grass those NLCS highlights the college football stuff that you need and again if you're just tuning over for a little football after watching the Cubs clinch we welcome you to Happy Valley Ohio State scoring nine points in the third quarter a safety and a touchdown run to build on what was a five point halftime lead and trying to stretch it now as the third quarter wins berrak shovel pass inside it's a different look that's know it Brown a receiver something we haven't seen a lot from them this year and that'll be the final play of the third quarter the Buckeyes try to March to building a 14point lead and to free a Happy Valley back after this message and a word from your local ABC station undeterred by a stormy night good gear of providing our aerial coverage watching over the hard work and determination to blimp for the athletes for more than 60 years Goodyear official sponsor of the college football playoff and number 2 ohio state trying to continue its march they hope will be a mother playoff season a couple of big big ten showdowns to come for ohio state soon and they couldn't get out of here LEED Johnston methodical waited a while and that time boots it deep at the 10yard line a TNC inside access takes you to Nitin evil I choose to be called paternoville or the students sit pitch those tents it was warm weather earlier this week James Franklin passing out refreshments this is what they do to queue up to get the best spots in the student section they are huddled together try to keep keep hope alive over there we do it'd be kind of a mix of Halloween and whiteout tonight Kirk over there in the soup section by this student section in America you labeled them back I did and they're proud of that maybe you can take that title back from what huh no just it's just to reevaluate you know over time oh all right it's a fluid things like the rankings so late takes off and flips it to a wideopen cos sickie who fell down had nothing but space in front of him just Chris he just got lost in coverage was he still lipid curtain yeah telling if he if he keeps his feet there that's a 30 or 40 yard game that's 16 you can see that after leaving the game early with an ankle problem he's farm monitor percent kind of tough it out and that Barkley with a burst Barkley gets away and gallops dead inside the 40 he got lying around the cooker but normally reliable safety but it's his own read and reading Klose but watch the block here by the right tackle man doubleteam climbs up to the linebacker that's went free Barclay there but they read the defensive end ich close up and to tackle getting up to that linebacker opened up a nice running Lane that time for safe want bar Barclay he got hit hard at the end of the ride by Worley there he's out of the game and Myles Sanders the freshman is in as McCoy fakes it to him and now goes down via looping fro what now has got it inside the fire called beat Marshawn Lattimore Ohio State is all of a sudden taking their eye off the ball here losing a little bit of their aggression ball goes up at the air and black ball does a good job waiting on it somehow holds on to that football progressive my candy is really good you have holding on to the football after a 37 yard run by Berkeley a 35 yard pass play sets the Lions up with the two quarterback keeper and misfire gets it ki and open and trace would like to have that back this is what you talk about but you have linebackers like this looking in the backfield you look at in the backfield completely lose your responsibility sliding right behind he's wide open that wasn't a little off that was a lot off is this is this guy's six six that he has a huge catch radius solutely work they back in the game on second and goal again quarterback chased by world for the pylon touchdown Therese mix early makes up for the misfire by taking it in himself and Penn State still in it but great speed to get around the edge there around Worley and also rape vom McMillan knew he was going to keep that football as a footrace look at the progressive pylon damn he knocked it out there look at that race right there I'm a Penn State back against the wall fans are a little bit lukewarm I'm thinking about a possibility of a comeback here in the fourth quarter five plays 90 yards for the touchdown I'll double check to make sure that he got in but that does kind of sum up Tracy McSorely he's not a guy that's got elite arm talent he's a good runner but they just they call him a winner a guy that the team gravitates around and go to fourth Street state change 55 and 5 they went to 4th straight title games a seat is the nose across as the knee touches down that's what they're looking at it's any part of the football over the front part of that white line it's very close down there the angle is a little bit deceptive from that camera they've Kataya czar expert up here gym camera wings say can you look in the replay booth Dave how did you see this well you got it you've got a really close shot with that great pile on cam after a review the ruling on the field stands touchdown which I agree with that point of the ball looks like it's over there's not enough to show any green between that white blunt light of the touchdown and a field of play it's early was was excited at Joe Moorhead and wise old offensive coordinators good job calming him down it's got to feel pretty good Kirk as a quarterback who made a very poor throw and a wide open touched after just taking it yourself the next play the big run by the like that they're in the end zone big semicircle header Kirk next Saturday at ESPN but with the Wolverines at any trouble in East Lansing from their rival there the Spartans who struggled this year I can't imagine that can't imagine that Michigan right now is playing great football northwestern with a big win today over Indiana they're starting to gain some momentum we're gonna Braska unbeaten going to Camp Randall what a game that'll be Wisconsin right now continues to be the best to loss team out there well today we get out of there at Iowa City with a win julius drives a dick go down take a look at this Pacific Life game summary the quarterback comparison certainly told me how much he admires James T Barrett for his dual threat skillset for his ball handling the small things as well as the leadership JP obviously a lot more experienced a different stage in his career and a very solid performance tonight yeah he's a great quarterback for a young quarterback to look up to you know I think tres been sorely should be proud of what he just did in engineering that try five plays at 90 yards to get a touchdown it is team within one possession down this game felt a lot worse than a twopossession game because States kind of taking control but in the blink of an eye mcsoley and embark Li lead the Lions down it's a onepossession game crowd back in the game how many of those fans thought the lands illegal 90 yards in the five plays to cut it to seven high snap Barrett Corral's it as opposed to the curb the Penn State says they have it whoever may have gotten the ball back after a mishandled exchange as Ohio State does have the bull and dodges disaster yeah it looked like Manny Bowen number 43 the outside linebacker along with Mike Weber went after the football it looked like Bowen had a chance he comes off to the right ball is on the ground right there watch a boat go for it and Mike who ever uses that strength definitely get this football back from Iowa State they catch a break about that high snap bad timing offensive lineman actually bumps into ever and forces the fumble sloppy execution but guys it only lost two fumbles on the season now the lion bring pressure JT steps away and delivers and the kiss made by paw short game but again the Lions can't quite get 16 of the ground they're doing a good job of mixing up the looks here there's Marcus ball his has really been his one of his goto targets tonight throwing the football limping off but again to pressure that time it was 43 bandy ball and bringing out her pressure off to the right Ajit Baga rolled up on the ankle so he's out on this third and ten on the Penn State defense trying to rise up and get the ball back build on this momentum with ball it takes away where JT Bear has had success in the interior between the linebackers in that 10 to 12 yard Urban Meyer called a timeout as the play clock was winding down to two so he'll spend one here to keep it at third and ten and state with a quick strike trying to build on this Saturday Night Football presented by Walmart save money live better and in part by fire stove whatever you drive drive the fire stove find it interesting that Urban Meyer during these crucial timeouts he walks away completely away from the huddle talking to the guys upstairs I mean he's very little dance move he is locked in with Ed Warner upstairs communicating with what he wants but away from the offensive huddle Warner and Sid Becker upstairs combining into play calling is a seat ball outlet over not available in this third damn way Garret sickles number nine force here this second half up at the top there Samuels slot near right there has to step up Aleve pressure again keeps his eyes down field and now it is one out of bounds short of the first down Buchholz for the back up defensive ends gave chase and Penn State's defense gets a stop to two defensive ends sickles and chuan do a good job of collapsing but they Penn State defense that's a good job not letting JT Barron escape into the pocket and have room to run for that first down a great coverage downfield by the secondary the Lions are going to get the ball back Dameron Johnston steady putter northern cities spectacular is a weapon but it's blocked blocked by Penn State to go we'll be turned over inside the 30yard line a backup safety collects it that Penn State special teams makes a huge play that looks like the freshman can brown on a football Johnston who is one of the best putters Chris he's a true freshman at 65 220 pounds he got his right hand lies on a huge opportunity Johnston is everything you wanted upon her but a little methodical there what be style the Aussie cannot believe it terrific play by the range he freshman Brown but you have believed this turnaround Lions the touchdown away from tying this game kiseki stays on his feet sigh the 20 he's playing hurt but he's took the trip fitting we talk about Marcus ball big a tremendous athlete as it tied in his sick even went they the hurt ankle goes up into the air because he's so long he's it's able to extend for an eightyard gain Markley dance is free and cannot escape couldn't get the corner because Taekwon it was chased him down but grabbed him with a horse collar and draws the flag definitely a horsecollar by Luis he's trying to make sure that Berkeley doesn't get to the edge loses containment just a bit right there crabs up to the Jersey horsecollar tackle they want to give up that ass says he grabs the back of that Jersey which is an automatic horse and a 15yard penalty down to the 10 yard line now they grab just above the number not the neck which you typically see when you get that call and lose the ball as you said to the 10 yard line at Penn State incredibly improbably going to tie this game that's not McSorely dropped for a loss Dave what did you start to say we used to take a look at that he's got the back of the Jersey below the collar line he's got his finger in the collar line or in the shoulder bed looks to me like it's below surely will lose six yards after that penalty so certainly second and goal from way back to the 16 and surely pressured as to escape on the far side a short gain and now a burden goal it's interesting point Dave I think any time we see a defender grab onto the back of a jersey the assumption is a horsecollar you're saying his hand needs to go up to be able to pull that down well you can see if you can see about four inches of daylight from that collar and where the grab is now the sickie big option here tied in you can see him they're lined up to the left we've also had some success Godwin at the top just kind of throwing the fade up trying to make a play oneonone Kirk they got Denzel Ward matched up 1 or 1 at the top of the formation but they took too much time there so they had to spend a timeout after the block punt on state move to first goal that went backwards facing third goal for the 16 now gastly help us with your studio update Oklahoma and Texas Tech Baker Mayfield connects for his fifth touchdown out of the day and Joe Dixon made that onehanded grab look easy the Sooners they're up 44 37 38 right now because Texas Tech just scores back to you guys Chris herby another night in the big 12 Cassady thank you it's a Google Big Ten stuff here Penn State what's the call Kirk here and third and goal from the 16 here I think you take a shot to God went up at the top it's early he looked that way now he's running for his life it just has to fire it away they gave him some help him they did then I think Santa paiting the same thing they had two different defenders dropping with God it's third down you're gonna take a shot in the end zone either the tight end a sickie or to Godwin who's already gone up and over Conley for a touchdown Ohio State waiting on it had two defenders there to take him away and he all he could do was throw it away here's Tyler Davis whose first attempt from 39 was blocked his first miss after 18 consecutive makes is from 34 yards and he knocks it right through after the flock on Penn State special teams they don't get the the tying touchdown have to settle for free they're chipping away at things and very much alive in this fourth quarter Curtis Wilson our bus driver the allstate bus is here the San fear your street cred brought to you by Allstate yep we've been doing this all year kind of a seasonlong celebration all stay tonight give it out straight Fred on Twitter each week looking for the best performance every single week in college football and how about West Virginia today against TCU as we keep talking about West Virginia it's gonna get tougher it's got a good tougher today we thought would be a big test for them maybe their best performance of the year in Phatak 34 to 10 win over TCU and they jumped what eight spots last week 120 to 12 you got to wonder if they have an opportunity to move up again this week there was one of the most pleasant surprises in the country not many people thought the Mountaineers are gonna be sitting there in the playoff mixes the second half of the season begins yeah and the schedule that they have in a back end it started with TCU but there's some big game still coming up dator hope Dana Holgorsen said earlier this week this could be one of the better teams that he's had since he's been in Morgantown and playing great defense with Tony Gibson the defensive coordinator suitors coming in in a couple weeks down the stretch julius with the kickoff and gambol two yards deep bringing it out Campbell can't escape the Lions coverage team does a nice job there fawn Walker on the tackle tomorrow morning said Eastern on ESPN and a fill insiders followed by Sunday and I felt Canton I'm right up to kickoff and on Monday nights from Mile High Stadium von Miller and the Broncos are trying to get after Brock Osweiler coverage begins at 6:00 with Monday night countdown really really interesting point in this go the Penn State offense had that five plate nine yards it gets a block punt defense has started to gain some confidence at sea JT Barrett the Buckeyes on how they attack pin back a little bit deeper in their territory than they had hooked Markus ball Kirk is back in the game he's winning motion there the tight end quick penetration Weber just barely escaped the backfield but then runs that out for seven yard gain the key shooting to blitz with Danny Bowen he almost got to JT Barrett I think JT bears the last thing he's taken about in his own read is a guy jumping him from behind but right there he almost did he just got the ball handed off there tonight whoever whoever makes his way lose the sticks for the first down across the 23 bourbon Meyer would hope today the Ohio State offensive line would be able to kind of assert themselves better than I control the line of scrimmage run the power running game be able to sustain some but Penn State playing in fear with a very gritty attitude tonight making it tough on Ohio State in their running game looking at the logo goes wrong grinding six seven minute drives to bleed the clock and perhaps build on the lead the Weber stuff to mediately bicycles Garrett sickles he missed the first half out the first half he's been all over the field here in the second half as eight tackles now three and a half tackles for a loss two and a half sacks and he's been all over the field listen class isn't the bye week and had to sit out the first half but he is coming back with a vengeance here in the final 30 minutes jaesi from the pocket now delivers across the middle grounds running free no Brown a big catch and run into Penn State Territory and the Buckeyes in business again watch how JT parent does a good job here of actually moving the linebacker does a nice job with bail see the eyes right there moves him to the left opens up the vacancy right there Noah brown but it's the eyes to the left shoulders that moves Brandon Bell and then it creates that opening where Noah Brown is coming in well done by JT Barrett because a 34 yard game the longest pass play tonight Penn State number one in the country fewest big pass plays allowed that's a rarity and an enormous play to improve field position River for a short game some big quiet at the crowd down sure there's something there's some big collisions down there it's Rio safe and save it with a friend absolutely Mike Weber is that your course their fall himself out with looks like Jeff but this kid Mike Weber really one of the first games where he has been asked to get on the road and carry the ball 20plus times and it's physical game holding up well whoever's got it again lucky missed some of the Buckeyes players and staff about Weber's evolution from a guy that didn't work as hard as you're expected to work when you're starting running back in Ohio as they said the leadership at the team fair Heather's got with him and he he's come around in a huge way I keep going back to see Kelly great things about Zeke was being a star running back but he took a lot of whoever and some of the other running backs who try to teach them work ethic and what it takes to be the starting running back at Ohio State did he do on his third down they're running all away all that window dressing with those receivers trip left II know the quarterbacks gonna take it up the middle if he's back there by himself he's more often not in those short yardage situations you know it's coming you still can't slow it slow it down most often he picks up the first down Penn State defensive coaches scouting Ohio State noting that empty back feels really one of their favorite formations the crowd is frustrated by the spot let's see where he goes down and you safely made it across of the first down because out there at after halfdeaf just like last week on the road in Madison terrific secondhand nine for nine here 83 yards passing and severe ons behind who was struggling on that leg couldn't make the cut move back to it gotta admire both these tight ends tonight the city has fought through an ankle injury and our Saint Marcus ball and Barrett trying to get on the same page they're so important with where Ohio State is in their past a game without the ability to dispatch attics it's the interior it's a big part the football tonight and to lose him would really hurt JT parrot the passing in great point both tie then just suck it up they know the value to the team they're trying to play through some pain tonight this is Samuel it's a backwards pass that he spins is knocked down a bard shareef Miller made the tackle and goes inside the 30 it'll be third long good support there by Golden's safety 6 I stayed Urban Meyer's their offense they stretch you horizontal try to set up sometimes once they stretch you horizontal then they'll try to come back they're passing game in between those middle linebackers empty backfield again on third and seven Iowa State sidelines going crazy trying to get to play change for JT Garrett right down the middle almost intercept that he lost to the boa and John read the corner was the closest I'll making a play but Lauren was the receiver what they solo why they're going crazy as they had a oneonone opportunity with Maclaurin to be able to try to win against John Reid they've not gone downfield vertically but I think they felt that before had a chance because of the formation to be able to cap create a little bit of a rug route and to get behind him but giving a lot of credit for being able to avoid the other Ohio State receiver and be in position almost came up with the interception Urban's thought about it now they're going to rush the field goal team out here because this is a career long attempt for Tyler Durban a super reliable inside of 40 this is from 45 Marcus elevate the block the veterans safety scooped it up in penn state incredibly has the leading an Urban Meyer usually special teams such a strength for Ohio State they've had a block punt now the blocked field goal this one for a touchdown 4:27 to play Davis to make it a threepoint lead and nothing is automatic and a night like this with the special teams able to get it up and breathe first half was a special teams disaster for Penn State serious atomic as this blocked field goal has given the Lions the lead see him get airborne to knock that ball down into to pick that ball up and to be able to have the speed to take it all the way to the end zone an enormous block and Bieber stickety him Franklin Lions are often 427 left a 17 nothing fourthquarter Penn State run keyed by a blocked punt to set up a field goal and then a blocked field goal by that man Marcus Allen the safety and the corner grant Haley picks it up and scoops 60 yards for a goahead touchdown and suddenly this 20 game Road winning streak the wire seems have never lost a road game since he took over there stunning the 217 Lions were in deep deep trouble I keep going back to that five played 90 yard try but McSorely when the Lions were pretty much downandout it 21 to 7 crowds out of the game and that all of a sudden sparked in and led to that block punt next say you know them Penn State is believing that they can pull off the Upstate was a great play by Kirk by Alan T Kirk but you wonder if Meyer is questioning they took a long time to make a decision to trot out a long field goal attempt by turbine maybe not quite organized Julius the example of chance but he drops the ball has to pick it up and Paris Campbell down at the 11yard line so another good job by special teams there's the block again and go back to Marcus out same in the back he gets a running start not only is he go up but he goes through the line he actually jumped into the line he didn't get up on top of anybody but he wouldn't he used his acceleration to allow him to get up into the air and it also torched a kicker McSorely showing the grill as they say that said the guys call that celebration your your legacy as JT Barrett is your intangibles your leadership the game's on the line you're the xfactor you make great decisions he's got another potential chapter here let's see what he does at 421 left Bailey around the touchdown starting corner not in the game right now they're giving him a breather Barrett chased immediately escapes again down feel but Hilda scoot out of bounds at the 12 yard line lions are getting after the quarterback a miscommunication on the offensive line by Ohio State on the right side with Billy price and Isaiah Prince liberal hioh State has had trouble last week and this week with Jamar coach owns a left prints the right tackle with outside pressure it's been a concern for them sometimes causing them to jump a little bit a little early but right now Penn State was Schwann 94 and sickles 90 they have cranked up the outside pressure on Barrett Katie's got a hurry here just gets it away when the pocket delivers to Sandhill step out of bounds before he was shoved out by a defender it'll be third down and short if it stays in bounds there is there something is this some green between the shoe and the wine that matter again then state again they're not feeling threatened downfield at all it's really about Ohio state of trying to keep everything in front and trying to rally to the football it didn't make you do without Haley the corner is getting a breather after that scooped up blocked field goal JT takes off a flag go false start before the play so hold on nobody could hear the whistle and the noise but to tie it in move to his out flanks as a receiver ball that time well start another tough environment this whole high o state offense is executing pretty well tonight but that that could be crucial that's that is what Urban Meyer wants on third down and four that's the kind of call you can run the quarterback and that would have been a first down but now because ball jumps now you push him back seem at the middle at the top up here now you're looking at third at nine who's JT have some more magic Barrett has to step up and deliver some of the middle to Samuel and they moved the sticks watch but I tell you Curtis Samuel has made some big plays here he's going to work into the middle here does a great job at how much a TV watch you work in the pocket keeps his focus downfield and a nice job of finding Curtis Samuel look at the eyes he knows exactly where he wants to go with the ball but to be able to maneuver around inside that pocket keep his focus downfield oh that's a bigtime play there bootjet zookas Marcus out on the hips and nose as soon as the ball arrived they get 14 of her denial now ferret just dumps it off short took a brief look down Beale Kirk but again assess it check it down the Weber yeah best state taking away anything that might be downfield again in your Brent Brian the defensive coordinator that's that's the message to this defense they played very well I don't think again they feel threatened by the vertical pass but they want to keep everything in front and then rally to the football here getting now close to two minutes with Ohio State still two timeouts remaining exactly Kirk but for this clock running this is beginning to feel like who knows perhaps Ohio State's the last chance meritbased again n flips it to Weber who works the sidelines dive outofbounds across the 30 the third is short now Penn State kidding tremendous pressure they're not even blitzing here it's just they're rushing for and whipping the Ohio State offensive line in pass protection very very hard to execute in a passing game a defensive line is doing a good job of getting pressure with war they've got seven guys without a vertical passing game makes it pretty hard on the quarterback Vanda ban across the board here and be back field again and once again Barry has to hurry snaps it at two delivers world catches made Wilson just able to make them catches the last four jump he could try for the pick well I thought Malik golden six watch him coming from centerfield he gets a jump on it he comes in just a little bit late JT Barrett does a good job of getting the ball out of his hands quickly and he put it in a spot it was that could protect the football with his fire so Barrett has made two clutch plays to keep this drive alive quotes you can been at the half lift let's again barrack just has to throw the ball away to avoid a set pressure from Sharif Miller this time Finch stayed actually bringing the Blitz they are mixing up dish looks for the offensive line doing a good job and mixing up coverage downfield see Minnie Bowen here the middle of the outside linebacker gets in there almost affects it they chased him out of the pocket Miller almost gets to him and Barrett very very fortunate to keep that play alive and just be able to throw it away to stop the clock and not have the staff and have to use a timeout ghazal already taken three minutes to move the 31 yards Barun going downfield taking a deep shot and it's off to helmet James Clark was out there that it bounced off his head Jordan Smith was in coverage it was a great throw I don't know if he'd lost the football if the ball bounced up looked like off of his forehead right off of his helmet bullets drove right on the money here right hand he's uses to pull down here right off the facemask pulled just before the ball got there by Jordan Smith just a splitsecond but not enough to draw a flag third and ten what kind of things of course those screever interference that was that was close Jason Cabinda gaana its fourth then real law they slant to defensive line this way and they bring Cabinda around to the right of Isaiah Prince 59 ceiling collapse down it easy for Cabinda to come down welldesigned blitz there by Penn State and Brett frying the leader who has missed the last four games comes up with a huge play for the Nittany Lion defense and Ohio State Kirk is going to have to convert on fourth and real long because they were so with article in this Drive you and I are watching the clock bleed away took a long time to get things going here they don't have enough time now to punt it away and stop Penn State they're gonna have to go to convert on fourth and 23 especially with only one timeout you really don't have much of a choice here you've got to come up with a play I'm sure think about all the playmakers that you have part of Samuel you would think gives you your best chance to come up with a play designed for him you talking about a football program it's still trying to emerge from from sanctions from shame that has not had a signature win under James Franklin they've beaten the people that's supposed to be they've not beaten the teams they're not expected to beat tonight was certainly fall into that category a 20point underdog at home down 14 entering the fourth quarter one defensive play away the rafts securing that breakthrough landmark victory fourth and 23 Barrett stepped up pressure to get a draft is going to get their signature win night at Happy Valley thanks to special teams just enough clutch offensive ways Garret sickles and Evan chuan they've done it all night coming off the edge force JT Barrett to step up into the pocket there's nowhere for him to go because the biggest surprise Gooden to you Ohio said offensive lines inability to control Penn State's fun yeah yeah and I think if you look at the last two weeks against India in Wisconsin I'm sure that's a big part of the Urban Meyer and Ed Warner's frustration that had given up five sacks all season give up five in the second half to Penn State now when you can't throw the ball downfield and you can't control the line of scrimmage to run the football that's that's a that makes it really tough on a play caller to be able to come up with it but right now it's more about James Franklin and Penn State and what they overcame tonight and as you said you use a victory like this this could be a gamechanger for this program and where they're trying to take this program they had some seniors step up come back for some injuries tonight this was in all for but a lion 2020 the way to fight back and win this football game 59 seconds until before grab up show tonight that Penn State fans and these players will not forget that was Marcus Allen who made the block of the field goal his buddy grant Haley took 60 yards for a touchdown McSorely in shotgun victory formation as the second stick down character beat watched this had an upset that really shakes things up until tonight as number two is going to go down it always happens every year you think you have an idea of how things are gonna play out and they never quite do and this is the big upset the first domino but again this to me isn't really about the standings or the rankings it is a playoff to me this is this is a great football game and Penn State deserves a lot of credit for the way they were able to make plays their offense with McSorely didn't look like they're going to have enough tonight but they did they came up with it this is a big one not six 1964 is an unranked Penn State team ranked in the top two way before all these students are full friends and their parents are born a night that those here will not forget the Penn State family Sam has coach Franklin players determinist so this is stone for healing process tonight son can be proud look at the performance that your defensive line I want to say something real quick Oh Jeremy Tuesday night and this game and this winners for them as well this valley hasn't been this happy in a long time and there are plenty heroes and overflowing emotions on the Penn State side looks like about the Ohio State side in a moment because they will feel like they let this game slip away blew it with special teams blunders but Penn State show a tremendous resilience down after a dominant third quarter by Ohio State Penn State had negative yards total offense in that third quarter but the other 17 nothing run in the fourth quarter the Northwest mutual top five Ohio State going down no doubt Michigan will move up we'll have Clemson at Florida State next week as the Tigers will be severely tested but what if what a special football game McSorely winner right that's the label he has a ton of help from all the faces at the team but guy finds away about him engineering would you say this has to be the biggest win and how many years on this campus I can't can you remember the last win that they had perhaps you'd have to go back more than a decade time and this is big opportunity and you know it got off to a slow start when they were down but more than anything if you're if you're James Franklin the resiliency of his team I think is really really impressive for them to be able to fight back to win this game it's a whiteout has spilled out onto the field of Beaver Stadium what is seen down here when you consider that they beat an Ohio State team that has been one of the great road teams we've seen in this sport ever a 20game winning streak and true road games snapped in a tremendous fourthquarter team Ohio State had outscored opponents coming into this game in the fourth quarter 62 7 and it's a 17 zip fourth quarter for Penn State again the block punt set up a field goal and the blocked field goal provides the winning points I have to go back to that drive where it was five plays in 90 yards put a couple balls up into the air and his receivers adjusted and they plays on it got him within a touchdown and they had to block punt they hit a field goal and it was all the sudden just an avalanche it was like they've been waiting and waiting for this kind of game of this kind of opportunity and they never gave up felt like the stadium may have given up a little bit with his 21 to 7 but those players and those coaches never gave up and they put themselves in a position to be able to win this football game what a tremendous seed here Penn State an unforgettable night for the Nittany Lions and their fans as they stunned Ohio State was 17 in the fourth quarter 24 to 21 we're at Tallahassee next Saturday night for the Clemson Tigers and the Seminoles this game was produced by Bill Fidel directed by Derek Pompey now the dedicated crew here in Happy Valley mental whiteout night for Penn State see you next week from Tallahassee before wrapup show is coming up right now if you send it to Cassidy Hubbard
