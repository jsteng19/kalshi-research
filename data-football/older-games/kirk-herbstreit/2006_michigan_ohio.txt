Dussel high estate offense he provides them with a margin for error they don't have to be perfect they don't have to block everyone because he can make plays on his own unbelievable amount of pressure on him today possible Heisman possible national championship with the reality Kirk he's faced it every week and embraced it troy smith to me is the difference in this football game well he seems to embrace anything to play his best game when it's a big stage like this but I'll tell you what if you're the Michigan defense you've been waiting 12 months to get another shot at number 10 and this defense has made offenses all year onedimensional they're number one the country in stopping the run and if they stop Antonia Pittman their defensive line Allen branch up corner Lamar Woodley they have to win the battle of foot and get questions like this if they do that build in the game the countdown to kickoff now is closing in when we begin number one against number two csb in production is available on ABC HD presented by DISH Network 19 senior making their final appearance here in Columbus Ohio just moments ago quarterback Troy Smith was introduced to this crowd more than a hundred thousand on hand sharing Torrey Smith and awaiting him head coach Jim Russell and then it was into the arms of his mother Tracy Smith and his sister Brittany Smith such a rich tradition between these two schools Michigan number one ohio state number five in victories Troy Smith has won the last two showdown against Chad Henne nine Heisman Trophy between the two schools Lloyd Carr with the national side Jim trussell with the national title and both of them trying to get back again for the championship game the winner no doubt will go to Glendale Arizona to play for it as the Wolverines come out of the field and you know when you look across the way you can't help but think about Bo Schembechler of course he passed away yesterday after delivering his final speech to the team the night before I can only reflect you on what's going through the minds of coaches and players the Big Ten has lost a legend an icon Ohio State has lost an alumnus and friend the Schembechler family has lost a beloved father grandfather and husband bo made the game of football better in every way our thoughts and prayers are with his family and everyone who mourns his passing a meanness director of the Michigan marching band to honor America please rise and join the band in the singing of our national anthem and so we stumble back about to begin we'd showdown with Chad Henning and the Michigan Wolverines against Troy Smith and the Ohio State Buckeyes and what an honor that is for build Aman da at the referee you will bring the cocaptain zout to the middle of the field and coin toss about to take place and in a game like this normally when you talk to coaches they would refer the win the toss and deferred and Brent one thing that a lot of experience with Big Ten officials sometimes you only think of this in basketball in the big game I think it's very important if these officials and I think they will let these guys play today for some great match out there and wide receiver and DB also going to play right up for the wizard captains either to be here please introduce yourselves gentlemen were privileged to have mr. Paul Warfield here to help us with the coin toss I simple heads in details your call heads is the call all we do the options let it hit the ground come up tails Ohio State you want to talk oh hi oh steaks one the cost and defer to the second half well this is such a great rivalry but you know I have five others that I put on my alltime best list that I've had the pleasure to be around besides Michigan and Ohio state college basketball Duke and North Carolina North Carolina and Duke they just keep coming after one another you go back to the age magic and bird it didn't give me better than the Lakers and the Celtics in the NBA and then a baseball the Red Sox and the Yankees every year they seem to bring the drama Tom Landry and kill Gibbs whatever the cowboys and the Redskins going for NFC title but one of my alltime best in these three fights and smokin Joe Frazier and here today we've got a heavyweight battle Ohio State and Troy Smith against Michigan as we check in with Lisa while Brandon is game day but no doubt for the Michigan Wolverines players will be playing this game with heavy hearts because of the passing of oceans by force I talked to one Wolverine assistant coach about an hour and a half ago and he said I've been in shock for about 24 hours ever since I heard about what happened yesterday but all in all he said I think we're going to be okay sim back where did talk to players on Thursday the day before he died I'm told that he talked to them about the importance of this rivalry the importance of this game and about how proud he was of them for everything they've already accomplished there was more the Buckeyes gonna go see Lisa not much to report on Ohio face injury front left tackle a Laguna's back after missing two weeks with a knee the field here at Ohio Stadium was Eckley on IR for a while but after being rethought in a few weeks ago the players saying it's a good case last but not least Jim Tressel managed to find a way to entirely lose him voice on Wednesday that he told me happy honey than I could ever imagine I gotta faculty said really doesn't matter they're not going to be able to hear me in here and that is the truth body this is one of the noisiest failures in college football and finally we are underway and in a go out of the end zone come on on the 20yard line quarterback Chad Henne and so Bob what do we expect from Chad in this Michigan offense well Brent Michigan's played it close to the vest they had let that great defense reform but if you look back to the Notre Dame game on the road the Penn State game on the road hospital environment they came out and opened it up because a Chad Henne who can handle the pressure in this situation so I think it's very important this mission offense to take some chances on first intend to give any a chance on playaction resting goes to the formation my partner was not healthy a year ago on a slant behind the left side and beyond to David Patterson now our IBM star walk and there is the note heart is healthy last week Manningham two receptions eleven yards and last week is Indiana Dresden was a field position in monster 231 total yards second down after the mic part run need 70 very question they might be using to the slot a train across the formation any changing up in the piece of all this goes the threestep drops lamp got it to the 47 yard line mariel maiming ham his first reception and his longest gain since returning from injury everyone worried about Mario Manningham sneak peek he's healthy and Chad Henne checked to that quick slant against at Ohio State defense his own defense a night vacancy in Chad Henne in rhythm where he is most dangerous to a seed right into the chest the Mario Manningham only four yards and they go right at number 14 but walkon Antonio's Smith is now on scholarship deeper drop hitting he keeps it in the air and keeps it in the arms of number 86 he comes back to Manningham and now our City offense and I want you to focus on number 77 Jake long he was playing right tackle last year in Ann Arbor first play of the game a year ago he drove into linebacker Bobby carpenter carpenter suffered a broken leg and did not return for the rest of the season for the Buckeyes Jake long is a firstround draft choice waiting to happen he is the left tackle from a Wolverine second now and three they're going to keep it airborne they think they can do business against the secondary another first and ten at the 35 yard line and the Wolverines showing their hand here early that was parson Butler the tight end and now our city Buckeye defense all three levels are good Quinn pitcock outstanding defensive tackle James Laurinaitis finalist who the is Malcolm Jenkins notice they did not slow in the direction of number two on that quick slant to Manningham they know exactly where they're going against this defense Jenkins goes over the right side on the corner now first down and 10 for plays three passes Michigan clearly trying to take the crowd out of the game Michael board an aggressive game plan so far Olivo is the fullback you lead the way splashes own block here's Hart hard to bring down with the first man trying to reach for the first down there's to be just a little bit short of it Antonio Smith making the stop Michigan wants to run the football 65% of the time this year they've run the football and this guy gets the carries when they handed up my cart weight upper body strength and one of the things that helps my card be able to get through there is the passing to slow down those safeties and slow down those linebackers it's hard hair has determined running back that picture is thank Michigan library in hard yards into the teeth of a tongue detail Kinney again slant got it preaching for the end zone cut no wait a minute out they're going to call it down just shy of the end zone reaching forward 25 yards on that play I'm sure replay will take another look at this as to where he was going down with his knee Mario Manningham coming up big again and Chad Henne right now coach didn't think but his motion is big very comfortable and when he seen Dantonio Pittman oneonone with Mario Manningham that's where he's checking and that's where he's going but he had a Antonio Smith to the outside and he hit the vertical seam mites grow they come back with the running back Michigan strikes first somewhere someplace Bo Schembechler is smiling Marielle Manningham's returned triggers it Chad Henne justesen has been all season with the Wolverines on target he goes for for 467 yards on the opening drive the aggressive play Colin much like when Michigan played at Notre Dame earlier much like when they played at Penn State and in those two games they averaged 15 yards of completion on first down so you knew they'd come back to that again in this game very Grievous that's on the extra point so it looks like Troy Smith will have to try to do it again come back in the fourth quarter that's that is amol against Michigan more than a hundred thousand on hand first time in history at Ohio State and Michigan they've met at number one and number two not one single third down and now it is the Buckeye field position star Ted Ginn hoping to get his hands on this kickoff they deployed key wingmen at the 15yard line of apparel Rivas women take it sealing up on the white side again looking for a same bright spray at the 31yard on let's go back to the big text by Manningham here's exactly what's had him he saw I saw the pre safety in the middle so he knows he has oneonone coverage with the corner Antonio sniffing Mario Manningham it ends up being sown coverage and watch Antonio Smith's body he gives in to a goose Mario Manningham he inside which is a big mistake in a very easy throw for Chad Henne which had hitting frozen rhythm he been very accurate quarterback especial open he's the postman we've got done and they will throw it he'll put it in the hands of GIMP time to come right back and that is all the outstanding corner they decide to throw the first pass and here is Troy Smith and what do we expect for the Buckeye game plan Baker well I think you're going to see Ohio State try to spread the athletic Michigan defense out with multiple wide receivers and give Troy Smith an option at the line of scrimmage B to go to the run with Antonio Pittman or try to find some oneonone matchups on the outside depending on how Michigan's defense tries to come after the Ohio State off here's your second per name rolling to the right a sec the game for the first down so point they put it in the hands of number seven and results in a personality for the bugeyed IBM star watching for Ohio State Antonio Pittman last year he scored the winning touchdown Ted Ginn jr. though had a big day with nine receptions for 89 yards but it was Anthony Gonzales who made the catch inside the 5yard line in the fourth quarter that set the table for Pitman's winning touchdown now burst down at then ball at the 44 pulling back looking downfield got great time here's Jen breaking free and complete and they hooked up it would have been six pressure that time from Lamar Woodley number 56 and I'm sure that the coaches upstairs noticed it and we know the key to Michigan is being able to block the front give him enough time they get excellent pressure from Woodley really forced the incompletion as you see Ted Ginn beat Leon Hall down the field he beat Leon Hall and more importantly he got behind the safety Jamar Adams that's something that Ohio State feels they have an opportunity to do with Troy Smith has time but you only get to get that many opportunities so often in a game like this second and ten and again Smith firing back underneath the Brian part line his first catch of the game for the 50yard line they've got about six and Chris Graham making the stop so our city bugeye offense and let's focus on the left tackle because you know they can have to match up Alex Boone did not start Tim Schafer the seniors started but Alex Boone after missing a game is healthy then a little bit Impe on Amy we expect to see him a lot he's only a sophomore he's the left tackle the tackles and the guards will have their hands full on this Ohio State offensive line but a different quarterback draw every fine rhetoric years Becca and third down here go for another coach content to the 41 yard line and reaching out of Brian Rowe 50 against this Wolverine defense we've already talked to you about Lamar with a Dave inherit perhaps an underrated and Leon Hall the Buckeyes have not backed away from him so far the Buckeyes five plays all passes one of the reasons they like to go there for wide receiver look is to try to see if Michigan's defense will try to take away the speed of Ted again and then work to the inside to hard line and Anthony Gonzales from the 45 yard line missing trouble and there's the first sack of the game and rondell bigs number 91 is credited with it rondell is a senior from Southfield Michigan and we have an injured Wolverine down that's Willis behringer one of the four safeties we expected to see tonight we talk about Tim Schafer the tackle right here starting for Alex Boone and right here rondell bigs we actually kept the tight end and tackled both in that is a great effort by the end opposite Lamar Woodley and illustration of his power and going right through the tight end so la 10 Behringer will take a break as you look down on the famed horseshoe here in Columbus Ohio top of the hour in these do we see that bullets derringer being helped off to the sidelines so 4:00 p.m. Eastern time and he starting to set here in Columbus but will be on before this remains Torrey Smith in the face of pressure again dropping off the screen passed this time and the very aggressive defense there is David Harris coming up to make the play in Woodleigh obviously exchanges inwards with number 10 but the Wolverine front bringing pressure the whole key to this game can they protect again you see a screen pass we're going to give penetration not quite that much penetration for Woodley is one of the best pure pass rushers in college football played at 274 last year now at 250 this year his acceleration he went right by Schaefer third and 16 here comes the Blitz even when trying to get there first down inside the 25 Roy under enormous pressure number ten shows you why he's the leading candidate for this year evil most of all will I think a good job of protection right here Michigan comes with a safety blitz allows closed if enough time and right here a race rolled away off they beat John and fears number 25 he hasn't had a lot of playing time this year at home and that was a great shot of the arm strength from Troy Smith but if Michigan's going to bring pressure and being one opportunity if they don't get the Troy Smith he's got the accuracy burning let me correct myself I wasn't even when I was 21 in Monday on the plate so here comes now Pittman and he splashes across the 20yard line and the Prescott Perkins number six makes his thought so that completion by Torrey Smith on third and 16 for 27 yards you see the key already in this football game first candle high estate protect Michigan 40 stacks on the season 24 by the defensive line it's going to all come down to protect and cheer Russell Jim Tressel's well aware that that's why you've seen so many different formations he's trying to show a lot of windowdressing to try to slow down the Michigan keep at the foot second and five and from the gun lead again incomplete it was a forward pass and that will bring up third and five another third down here saw that formation we talked about formations they call that the shot in incredi Ginn is in that slot right there that's a cow Pat Maus came early in big games like this was so much hype the coaches who have the perspective that we have looking down and seeing where the adjustments need to be made after the first two offense has been on the field five receivers underneath akin Roy Hulk's uh conception he's inside to Tim it will be first and goal Buckeyes and start to talk about the coaches flexible game plan or awesome bounces of quarterbacks both teams with quarterback that can do it all Michigan atop only rushing three and big boy Hall about 330 pounds making the catch for the first down interesting play call there because they had so many receivers in Michigan defense so we're in the middle of the field that they sat back down the middle of the field and it opens up a nice David Kennedy plate a plant another conclusion to the two yard line putting in a new arms of the pullback they slipping out they told us they were going to include this in the game plan and Stan white junior a good receiver watch him come out of the backfield he's the fullback there's 89 and I'll tell you what I remember when they talked about Russell ball heel position great these banks kick field goals roll it over down now yeah and I think that in the history of puzzle game two head coach at Ohio State for five years in this rivalry that's been his MO that he has been aggressive with his play calling he chokes in plays that he hasn't shown all year on second ago Hitman's plating it cannot get there and now it is third and goal and this is a tough call coming up here fort whistle baby mentioned the one play videos' had over there the bag of quarters the quarterback draw with Roy Smith and so difficult to defend right here on first down at the 2 yard line they can run option they may go power looks like they're in for wide receivers right now the 2 yard line would be shocked to see them spread this great Michigan defense out and give Troy Lee an option to run or throw because of his versatility I was they better hurry but I call timeout later Torrey Smith approximately sideline his final game in Columbus played magnificently last year in Ann Arbor previous year against Michigan here in Columbus we can remind you now this is just the beginning of a tune Saturday tonight on timeout you're not going to want to miss this Cal USC 80s earn a BC High Definition I know Curt DeBaun features we get to oh yeah I would miss snapping at this I think this will be a shame at the same week it is this game because it's one of the great games of the year now of course looking ahead last week when they went up against Arizona and Mike Stoops is a little pause and up said the cows still playing for the right to get the pass again in a trip to the Rose Bowl xlix put there we want one thing about this game you look at both coaches wide open there's good pressure and there's bad pressure to meet good pressure as we look at Lloyd Carr you come in here on Lebanon hell if you win you go to the national championship game if you lean for working go to rofl bad bread you come in here about 6 and 5 and if you lose your fire so it's a little bit easier I think proposes to play a little looser and a letter with a nut job running on home this time throw it every down for sure physical Scripture this is the fourth third down of this drop Oh wide open touchdown at at glory all but his third catch of this drive the I've seen birth third and poor I've seen birth third and poor third m16 third and five and our third and goal football's a game about preparation how many times you think Roy Carr and Ron English look at Jim Tressel's often in practice against a five wide receiver look from the two yard line those are the little wrinkles that Jim Tressel tried to save in this big game because it means so much he stood defense confused from that look natural Aaron pepper freshman from Kentucky tax on the extra point this is not what Bo and woody had in mind like that Ohio State eyes are done seven all six minutes remaining in the first foot let's go back and look at the touchdown some people may say this is a rebel pit but as I said in the open do not get that solve the big game those kids in efficient will keep that flies in the five here in all men employed all fit the player that's a rough around here is defensive player at the same Brian will viscous father is smiling I was a bigtime NFL move with the receiver crossing over and taking two defenders out with a little sub show ESPN college football on ABC's presented by bet Spa wrap up the Wow this holiday season only at Best Buy dodge you can take life as it comes or you can grab life by the horns Allstate are you in good hands and Remington I've named shavers temperature in a high portals where no rain or snow in the forecast will remain with the ball for the second time and then they're going to put it right back up in a receiver fell they were coming right back and there is a first slip on the new turf but there was get pressure from David Patterson it's the first time that Ohio State has applied pressure on Chad Henning but he still had enough time and it's been interesting to see Mario Manning and stay on his beef he stays on his feet that's another completion for hitting and I think we're going to see a lot of footages as the day goes on the field resided three weeks ago I've had a chance to steal with a lot of open teams on their field I can tell you with the power you here's heart gloppy trying to get the angles I'm about the 24 yard line picking up : never leaving third and say that was mouthing Jenkins the corner day and I know Bob David just tackled me because he likes to see corners who have ability to cover but want to come up and get physical he just hit me you like that I wouldn't I saw when I just you hear exactly right I was interested I'll because I love myself I love the skateboarders in this day and age everybody idolizes Deion Sanders how about a corner this big cover could also like to come up and hit you I blew his Michigan's first third down boy we're down and stuff at time through hard for the first down rusted his first reception of the game working against the nickel man Donald Washington who slides to the outside and the nickel package frequently and I think not much conversation if any about Chad handing all week all the attention to Troy Smith and coach this is just a great role right there the press but not to mention going after a player who had word on the field a lot in his game he goes right to this right to the question Don Washington like the match up with Steve Breaston against them and put the ball right where it needs to be and a movement by the lifeguard Alex Mitchell ball start 73 offense fiveyard penalty first down but the young man who almost came to Michigan and decided that the wealth of baseball was just too great to pass up Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees but since he passed up an opportunity to come here he has always been among the most loyal of Michigan Wolverine backers and he's among the many athletic stars who are here game generating such of bugs across the country for weeks first down and 15 he has great time he's got me wide open incomplete he has the big fella wide open that time and they could not hook up Marielle Manningham was headed for six and court Mario Manningham is the best double move wide receiver in the country right there is what I mean about double hook you thought he was wide open against Notre Dame he was even more wide open right there and he's saying oh my gosh I had it in the double moves because of the way he accelerates in and out of his cut did Malcolm Deacon finally get feet but was confused and looking around for safety or helping out on suck it down and 15 protected holds and they are moving marcin Butler off the line of scrimmage that tight end who has come on so strong here for the Wolverines he's just a sophomore from Detroit they're flexing him off the line and that's a couple of times that any has hooked up with 85 and you don't think the other receiver gets a lot of tension watch golf written right there a people Sabonis 265 both man in here at sir Jim hey Cassie heap at the court in Ohio State and we can't stop and once he did golf the line we'd have to put a defensive end on it to try it slowing down they swapped man the third and five where he hit question there now it comes for you we'll throw that one away past the line of scrimmage and out of bounds the linesman right there on the throw as many alertly fires it he has to get it past the line of scrimmage and out of bounds the Buckeyes were lobbying and now they will send John Dallas and Ginn back deep on this punt so here come the field physician twins for Ohio State and now Lloyd karma show his hand it doesn't like to put away from people because he said you can was enough to easily there's a penalty however to about line three going to put it in GIMP and and he is down at the 20yard line remember we have a flag back at the 35 yard line Turner booth was the young man who got down there on game and that is against Ohio State Building on yay one of the very best in the Big Ten that gets an outstanding officials who he's working with fellows like Rick Nelson's got his hands full he's the umpire today and here comes your entire list and just go to the bottom folks Tom Quinn was a great referee for many many years in the big ten he's our replay official upstairs another Kirk Herbstreit when he quarterback games for the Buckeyes Tom Quinn frequently was said as his referee he takes number six that fiveyard penalty would not result in the first down the penalties decline ball turns over first out good decision by Malik Autry atomically how many times have you seen Tom bid half here for the Ohio State Michigan game one of the best of all time from the big 10 I'll tell you Michigan really does the bullet because you're going to get a face mask right there I mean a plate I don't that's a 15yard facemask they're very fortunate that the referee did not see it he be blown recording of safety on the cover where's Dan White who scored the touchdown and at that fullback spot Jake Ballard husband hiding in zone of the right side Neil Ferguson 25 he's into the arms Prescott Burgess number six in our fine aerial coverage on this beautiful Saturday in November brought to you by Goodyear tires between triple tread technology with three separate tread zones for peace of mind in any weather but we saw the Ohio State defense make some adjustments for it looked like we're going to continue to see the offense is going down the field but Ohio State's defense may be adjustments of course the punt now we'll see if on English and his troops have a chance to do the same thing second date and solace in motion and the Wolverines are chasing him they play the game and he is definitely short of these silly yarder for some others at the 30 believe Morgan print the corner who made the tackle I think developing store will be this field again we mentioned was restarted I mean right there Lamar will be just flip him coming out of his stance perfect not so sure that Mario Manningham wasn't slowed down when he broke three on that pass and that the quarterbacks are going to have to adjust a little bit again has been overthrown Manningham has been overthrown this track is slower than you would normally expect there remember the Turkish just been down down for three weeks we were down to yesterday it is wrong one hurts here the quarterback is you lose some of your anticipation if you have to wait work on the adjustment lose your clothes down play David Harris making their stop if we go back and show you the scene on October 29th a stripped away the old turf and it was the second time that this field was resurfaced this year I recommend field turf you're a person who donate their money only a million dollars give us your penny I'll chip in provide from what I heard about that house you had the party at last night you can afford it when Simone desert reactor the wee hours while we were preparing preparing Villarreal second and six because three become first down again stepping on the fire at the 41 and so number seven has been a preferred target agree check in with Bonnie grant I talked to a bunch of the Ohio State players before the game regarding the field they said it was in pretty good condition but I got excited when guys were taking cotton warm up a bunch of songs were coming out as you approached the sidelines of the problem with this field the season has been so much rain a lot of rain in October which is why they had to ring sodded and then this week it rained a bunch on Tuesday and Wednesday they have the tarp down Ohio State never even set fields oughta set foot on this building for the day 1st down and 10 and one thing by both teams opponent they're both going to have to deal with here's picking for a couple of yards and then they suck it down and long Troy Smith so far 11 of 13 for only 83 yards and out to a great start but it's interesting I think that Ohio State and Jim Tressel probably going to go back to the deep ball just because a lot of their throws have been under me would not be surprised coming up soon to see them try to attack the Michigan secondary especially those safeties down the middle the field continue to come out with a four and five wide receiver look spreading the Michigan defense out the shotgun heels off to Smith's life if he downhill in complete and couldn't hang on in my mind I don't think there is a more improved quarterback in all of college football than choice me it's unbelievable how far he had developed as a quarterback and I think also off the field as well I mean Jim Tressel welldocumented he had some second chances that he has taken the place of most of those opportunities I asked him what's the biggest difference preparing for Michigan as a senior from your sophomore year before I could get the question out and said the love for my teammate that shows you how much he's mature third and nine Wolverines show blitz here they come throws it up for draft they'll have to punt so the Blitz applies the pressure on number 10 Troy Smith and the Wolverine defense makes the adjustments Kirk spoke about and they force a punt anytime you go after you have one two three four five guys Michigan brings one two three four five six so you better get rid of it quick run into society let's come up one of the ways to if they could have noted five wide receivers one of the ways to defeat that as you said just outnumber them and get to them before they Gordon you in man coverage that fresh the news backseat AJ to pass up the time they said them over to his left that he makes the surf catch at the 14 yard line and he was giving ground a little bit as he made the catch 44 yards on the cont 29 seconds led to the merge borders Monday night I'll share some of those fellows are watching us right now the Monday night game down in Jacksonville the gmen and the Jaguars 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time such a Monday night game coming up High Definition dearest Anna really come from put in a quick break in because it's a whole new game face down in any doctor in the noisy part completely clothed in not particularly nimble of me ago down at the 11yard I'm Lawrence Wilson where he's a young defensive lineman sophomore from Akron Ohio 667 days Lawrence Wilson provides gym hey talk deaf there is a rotates about eight or nine defense different defensive linemen and that's where you hope as a defensive coordinator to wear down an offensive line because of that death so we come to the end of the first quarter both teams score the first time they touch the football but then Ohio State and Michigan defense show on the next goround this thing do patek third and fourth James Laurinaitis fairly quiet in the first quarter but do not own display Laurinaitis gets been there along with John Kerr John Kerr they're giving you a chance today there he is right here missing the initial contact Laurinaitis pulling over John Kahrs I've been playing a lot but because this games expected to be more physical he's out there or they're watching from the stands wearing the son's number 33 you of course many of you know the story professional wrestler known as the animal one of the story fourth that between receivers vastly different public hearings in nesco leftfooter is fielded by Gonzalez's clearly to good field position for Troy Smith in the Buckeyes coming up here so we'll take a break the 100 and 3rd meeting between two ancient rival said the stakes have never been higher there are a few but maize and blue quiet fans there in enemy territory today surrounded by the sea of scarlet and gray first down and ten dollars towards bed keeping it for the first time taking the end around and taking a heavy blow by David Harris who makes the quarterback pay the price Troy Smith even though he has the ability to run he has shown that he rather throw the ball this year the faithful reversed its content again he open field his David Harris the leading tackler for the Wolverines puts it on and I'll tell you what the most underappreciated player I think maybe in college football Brent this kid has lost 10 pounds from last year he's as good as any linebacker in the country David Harris bucket and pour and no quaking prey headed for the end only Oh the young man known as meaning the freshman in the most heavily recruited running back in the country Chris Wells ignite the fire Chris Wells has had a history of fumbling this year as a true freshman at Jim Tressel was elected to stick with the freshman going back to him despite losing the four fumbles that have paid off here early in this game I saw what was it talked about risk versus reward you see the roles like really hit the ball very well that's why you keep going back through exactly right his longest run of the year and it comes against Michigan so Chris well his seventh Washington touchdown of the season showing you there he's from the Shawn Treville from the outside pulling right there would love to have a chance back at this play because he could have had beanie well tackled for a loss but he's able to get through that initial contact and then it was just a big hole that opened up through the middle that missed indecent and how about the stood coach did he show in the open field for a big man and that's what surprises me at 245 pounds at 99 yards last week against Northwest in the best things business fumble an opportunity here to carry the football he fumbled two weeks ago he until annoying and was almost at five oh no what would Jim Tressel to the next week and he elected to try to be able to ball as he said folks against Northwestern I think the mentally preparing for this game in this Michigan defense number one in the country in rush defense for me give up 20 million yards for the game the deep return map of Michigan State the Wolverines poilane for the first time which Sarah for the first time the stadium here is alive keeping it away from rusting picked up by the short ban on the 17 so libo feel that that brings it up and we get an update from Matt Winer in New York hi Brent is a Taco Bell update from Tuscaloosa where the Iron Bowl takes a backseat to no gain Auburn is won four straight with series into two outputs Kenny irons 8 yards for the touchdown 14 3 there Arkansas can win the SEC West with a win at Mississippi State not running the ball well today the beating their Notre Dame still very much in the national title picture and leading army 2017 and that the eyes of the police and USA tonight because they meet them the Los Angeles Coliseum a week shop most people you are thinking here is now fired up by a touchdown the Buckeye defense so rocker let's take a look at the Michigan time line if you remember this team came in at number 14 early in the year coming off a seven and five year and I think there was pressure on this team and I think they had great confidence and when they went to South Bend and 147 to 21 that was one of the best wins of the year for anybody and they have just continued to roll off both sides of the ball and regain that confidence second down and Oh Chad him welcome to linebackers list and find anybody in trouble going to go down and he threw that one away there's the penalty Lemonnier is on intentionally grooming and Tonio smith discover linear open ball gown keep talking about the importance of adjustments for the both of these staffs and Jim Haycock right now has had the upper hand bringing pressure Laurinaitis the middle linebacker Antonio Smith is number two on his team in tackles eventually getting there but you're starting to sense the Ohio State defensive front is starting to win the battle in the trenches of all Antonio Smith a walkon corner who controlled the nipple ask him before well he does a lot for the bunker 18 yard loss on the side makes it though 1:27 86 uses the middle to get a few of them back to the 25 appeal to their Camila shoving birds out after the tackle but quickly official jump in believe it or not you know this is a nasty library on the field you talk to former player to play in this game and they'll say it's one of the cleanest games that they've ever played in in their careers because we respect 52 teams have the Michigan make a little frustrated there without having a chance to pick up the first down so Dan mess go a big leg quick in giving it all let's do with the house Giri there is a penalty flag they're ketches gold at the 30yard line but there is a penalty flag back at the 30yard line they're going to call roughing the center on this play I believe Tyler booth the Center for Michigan on the defense number 38 a direct blow to the center following a snap 15yard penalty automatic first down and they were going to call that every time often score number 48 lined up right over the center and he is going to get into Tyler booth watches the ball snap right there and people at home they look at that and they say why but again it's another roll for safety that Center is so vulnerable to and the timing could not have been any better for this Michigan team that they needed to catch a break with the game starting to tilt toward the Ohio State side that was huge a huge break for trout hitting and boy talk it came on fourth and Watchmen for the Buckeyes and the linebackers are right there to meeting with the line of scrimmage one more look at this coat and the key on this you have to allow the center to get his head up and protect himself he never got his head up that time and that's why it was called so it's not so much about the force of contact it's about the timing exactly what you said is 111 Oh wasn't the most vicious of rules or a bit they were going to call that and reject Edmund Burke see with Michigan to do it that's the set of downs man a man goes out to the right and Kunio Smith locked up they doubleteam and Rustin comes in that direction looks the second screen coming back the other way part who's the first pack was that this was the third and long one of the ways that Michigan likes to slow down a team that starts to be able to get pressure on their quarterback like any team if you eventually go to the screen and Michigan's one of the better screen teams that we've seen this year because of the timing of the quarterback with the line and michael hart so comfortable the derrick a lot of scarlet jerseys formants on there the problem right now for this game they came in number one in the fifth Cameron was awful I don't feel I can run the ball a real close eventually get back to them they're going to bump on man a man at the top within see the corners on third down he looks in that direction can't find a light have to come back to Preston underneath show to the first down Marcus Freeman he delivers the hit but it was clear that Chad Henne wanted number 86 and upstairs Luke speckle had signaled down to go ahead and pump on him and Haycock related to the defense that guy why he played this game the last game of the year there are some lips in this football game I think these things could play at school now it is fourth and very short the three protectors for Michigan nesco is back again and Gonzalez the return in this is fourth and very short they will punt he'll be content to play field position there catches signal by in at about the 8 yard line but with 755 to go in the second quarter the Buckeyes will take over leading it by touchdown on Criswell explosive run the freshman putting the puck eyes ahead and Columbus 147 they're back Ohio State football Kirk that was a big exchange of field position with that dental huge exchange there 26 yards that Michigan gained because of the personal foul after Ohio State allowed Michigan to have the ball back now they're inside their own 10th Smith 11 of 15 for 83 yards in this game stay back in the shotgun is Pittman back on the field we check in with Lisa on an injury Michigan side Lisa well Brian number 19 Willis behringer he is now standing on the sidelines with his teammates but for about 20 minutes after he got injured in the first quarter he was over on the training bench they were working on his right knee he had ice underneath as I walked by and I said are you okay he just shook his head no it is doubtful that he will return right away and that's a blow because remember when Chris Wells exploded he went right in the middle of the field Pete yards touchdown the senior to the point one show blitz becoming and Smith a Newton and I receiver with left standing through 50 into the middle of the field what a play by first Smith avoiding the pressure and then row Biscay working against the corner 39 yards it was an old thing sometimes it's not the up to know with the Jimmy for the jelly right here Troy Smith explains what I mean about that person well this is a great job of not only Troy Smith behind time to get outside of the pocket but what you can't see here is Brian revista adjusting coming back to the ball too near receiver anytime your quarterback breaks as the outside you've got to come back to the ball and a scramble drill to help him 4:54 a young receiver great instincts there and Leon Hall miss and daylight 10 yards on the left side there were a couple of things obvious on that last play number one Allen Branch lost his footing the big Michigan defensive lineman trying to close in on Smith number two Leon Hall should have wrapped up pro biscuit so I won just an unfortunate break for the Wolverines or the other a big time mistake by their best corner and you also just another example of how explosive the Ohio State offense is one second they're pinned inside their own 10 and a couple plays later they're already in Michigan territory they're one of the more explosive offenses in the country because of the way they spread you out and then they have speed and an experienced quarterback and Troy Smith the amazing thing I don't think Anthony Gonzales at night year he had any Falls relative most people thought would be the difference in this Ohio State offense today in this game instead it has been Roy Hall who caught a touch and world this Keys been a goto guy and also Brian Hartline and it goes again early and often but number eleven Anthony Gonzales remains more the best in college football mr. law six point eight out here in the second now watch what Paul here and logistic slips the tackle we got way too high his dad carry revista Brent you referred to it earlier than in the NFL coaching for a long time he's now receiver coach for the patron Brown great bank wide open down Ohio State and it was off a beautiful fake by Troy Smith a 39yard explosion and just like this the Buckeye show everyone why they are the number one ranked team in the country that's right as the extra point watch this faith anytime you have a back it's at a sprinklin game and well the safety in the linebackers came up Ryan money gets out of position they worked on this play I'm sure all we can practice Teddy Dan one on one for the touchdown and you better bust ass get at the line of scrimmage you let them off I don't care how fast you are you want to get it done out in Columbus it's 21 7 and Troy Smith does it again interesting on this play low high stake in a hurry up huddle and then an unbalanced line look they have four five guys on one side to get maximum protection not only that but how about the timing of the call the officials the good call the timeout to measure making it second one they come out it on formation when they rub the football and they catch him off guard with the playaction fake now Rustin the 1 yard deep he'll come out for the and he is out of bounds at the 20yard line so ESPN's College Football on ABC presented by Best Buy wrap up the Wow this holiday season only at Best Buy Cadillac check out the Cadillac navigation event went on now Cadillac life liberty and the pursuit singular raising the bar and a plaque ask about it at work so the Buckeyes go 91 yards in only full plays with this explosive offense and Chris Wells has been a major player he was the running back choice to take two on the dive play and he carried out the fake beautiful with Ted Ginn breaking down the middle now a somewhat rattled Wolverine team trails by 14 points and we take a look at the first four drives the Wolverines scoring early but since then they have bogged down again Jim Haycock and Luke pickles defense they went seven plays 80 yards went right down the field in complete command a lot of lot of flash and passes and since then if you said look Bickle Jinhae caught making some adjustments this is it not only a big drive because it's 21 to 7 he's brought for Chad Henne on a consultant's to get their confidence a whole map of heart heart breaks into the middle and he midfield and down stumbles to the 49yard line so heart thirty yards his biggest run of the game interesting that Michigan goes back to the bread and butter we keep talking about how important it is for them to throw the ball but I want a cut by my car do you want to know why my car is one of the best backs in the country because he can cut just like that on a dime he takes advantage of Jamari O'Neill and gets up feel good block by only Bo the fullback post as well on that link to all right they'll release a little quicker back off here on course content to midfield somewhat surprisingly they come right back with hard after that big one and this will put him in second and long Vernon gulstan makes the play defensively the Brent we go back to how Lloyd Carr identified first of all the problems from last year at 7 and 5 they lost five football games in the fourth quarter in his opinion because they were a little out of shape that more important they couldn't run the football this is a theme that's run about 65% of the time they are still a running team gathers the loin part that's the problem they have way many men in West been working on the left side of his formation in a third straight time it's going to be heartless and this will be third and fairly short for the Wolverines after that run Brandon Mitchell making the stop so here comes the third down call for Lloyd Carr busy communicating with his offensive assistants the coordinator Mike deboard movie to that position prior to the season the biggest change zone blocking they work long and hard with the assistant coaches from the Denver Broncos as ilanic blocking with the lioness permit that freed mark big run on this broad but here now is your third and two becomes a linebacker quit any against this close Hein and complete and there's a penalty flag the penalty flag is thrown against Malcolm Jenkins and this will give the Wolverines a first down this is the second big penalty against Ohio State 15yard penalty previous spot automatic first out and let's take a look at this because as you know in the NFL you can't touch them after five yards now the question here the only question I have was that football in the air when you collision him because I didn't really see a lot of fun or anything there was another thing down field it had to be the initial contact right field on his friend that officials want the right at the ball there as for the flag comes out ball goes in the air you cannot hold up a receiver first down and well inside the 30yard line he's under pressure Stockton down at the 40yard line Golson is there Jo kitten is there Richardson in on the linebacker comes John Carr on the Blitz occupying two offensive lineman and mistake that time by Marvel not coming over because it free pit to come right through this right through the interior the offensive line a mistaken miscommunication because of the Blitz there from John Kerr and that's exactly this season started everyone wanted to know fiddle house take offense score enough points because of in general I say people : 17 years in the country come into the game nothing important guys man down the sideline puck down they put it in the hands of number 16 Adrian Arrington 37 yards for the Michigan touchdown and the Wolverines right back in it what a play not only by Arrington but for this offense what I thought I thought was interesting is with two receivers to the bottom of the screen the Ohio State defense got caught up with the speed of Steve Breaston and it opened up a huge hole of the outside to Arrington perfect river running out wheel route which takes a lot of time great pass for catching by the Michigan zone Regas connects on the extra point back to 7th Michigan scored first in this game then they fell back by two scores then Harrington made it a one touchdown game again I'm out in Columbus well back here in Columbus it's time for our Aflac trivia question the score 2114 Cory Smith has beaten Michigan twice who is the only Ohio State quarterback to beat Michigan three times Berkeley nope Noda rode up on the elevator with not know giving all that it's here exactly your era and one of my guys launched was an athletic director in with Western okay are we going you can use 140 this looks about the under 2000 a little confusion here by Ohio State's defense breasted actually going to go to the post Arrington's coming out to set it up and then a wheel route down the sidelines confusion because of the corner going to the middle of the field following the poll yet look at the vacancy on the outside Donald Washington playing outside thirds if the post didn't take care of this area responsibilities on the field but keep in mind we're in Ohio State goes to nickel Antonio Smith goes to Nichols on Washington comes in as the 15th of the back the corner Antonio Pittman the running back for the Buckeyes on their own 20yard line there's a fake coin and Thomas was first into the game for a first down at the 31 Monday the safety makes the tackle our Pacific Life game summary here and it has been a wideopen highscoring affair so far 35 points in a Michigan Ohio State game in the first half and you could see the 1 team's past 444 the other four 161 yards in this game the Buckeyes have been lethal on third down on first down from the gun indications and that's get to the game over Ohio State continuing to work with Coach the three and four receiver looking it's again just to try to exploit the Michigan secondary with Troy Smith's aren't well you know what I read this week we're talking about Roy Smith maybe a second or third round draft choice are you kidding me judgment party first rounds after I would take it in the first wrong right now I don't care if he's 511 in a hand if you know the comparison to Vince Young yet I talked with him this way you know who he reminds me of Drew Brees Oh drew Brees is who employ Smith is he bore like troubies degrees than any other quarterback I've seen their second and serene opera first down at the 45 yard line that pops has got to be awfully proud of Brian Rowe Biscay here today he is having a great game and tonight into his arm strength he has the ability to squeeze it in there right into the face of that defense and look outside a window that was such velocity on his throws six of 6224 196 yards and takes a lick I mean he was smashed by Sean Craven number two got loose on him that done cradles from Massillon Ohio I think Shawn cradles the wild card to this defense they've done such a good job with Ron English moving Crabill around he's a linebacker but they moved him around and try to confuse the offensive line to get pressure in that time they were successful Brett member lauraclark photos the other night fastest long chopper in the history of Michigan football and all right and ten balance again is an underneath for another first down Ohio State steps out of bounds at the 31 yard line about every break that we have gone to coach and I've turned to each other and said if they throwing that tuple to Gonzales because it just doesn't seem like he's involved yet when you knew that eventually they would have to go to a stake here out and giving the balling pentagonal position for Michigan continues domini saw Johnny Spears right there miss left tackle on Gonzales emptying that backfield out again 1st down and 10 from the 31 I'm using the kite in underneath for a few yards that brewery nickel Troy Smith is spreading the ball around to any number of receivers in this game rava ski and Hall and Hart line in Gonzales adown nickel and it's amazing how he's dumping it off to everybody he just sprained this Wolverine secondary that time they used Teddy Ginn and Anthony Gonzales at decoy to set up a Titan freed over the bid for the feelings second and seven he kind of where you again the catch on the drive they're going to them and they're finally getting the match if they if they need in the slot if Gonzales going up against Chris Graham a linebacker week in the Ohio State Iowa game and that's something that Ohio State exploited against the hawk on big holes in that the interior of the Michigan defense I would say box present a fair opponent they taking this fun seven from Michigan basically out of his football game and that defense has just asked attention well it's so wild Michigan I'm Sergeant it's so hard for a safety it's so hard for a linebacker to stay with the slot receivers on Ohio State you have to pay so much attention with the safety overtop and helping against Ted again coach it it opens it up over the middle of the field well we've got a moment let's go back to that Aflac trivia question Torrey Smith trying to beat Michigan for three straight times mine who's the only Buckeye quarterback who have ever done it and as Curt says this is my generation folks and he was a pretty good one as we take a look at him Tippie died and back in the 30s I guess before William both took over in this rivalry if he were number 50 back there 4994 I think years old now it made it back go to this game or he was excited coming on the elevator before kickoff he was so fat he said he had a chance to talk to Troy Smith yesterday it practiced if you look at those Michigan excuse me Ohio State offers of bats keep in mind this is the number three favorite defense in the country right here as we look at the Michigan deepen and coming in you knew that the 405 wide receiver looks spreading the athletics front of Michigan would be a problem it really is going to come down to Allen branch a Lamar Woodley getting the pressure on Troy Smith you know the ball comes out so full propagated on first down another completion this one to the 7 yard line is done will Biscay the target still two timeouts left for Ohio State I think Jim wants on him right now he's got a rule change few years back the coaches can come out and call a timeout and while we take this break here let us check in with Matt Winer and another update I present Verizon Wireless update from the Iron Bowl Mike Shula trying to get off the snide he's never beaten Auburn John Parker Wilson Nikita's Stover short pass long 148 yards they go for Xun and dokin versus 14 9 their Arkansas still just 55 yards rushing but leading at Mississippi State trying to win the SEC West and Brady Quinn has thrown his 90th career touchdown pass that leaves all active quarterbacks thank you and here it is 21 14 Ohio State leading Michigan with 24 seconds left in the first half you know I think the biggest problem Michigan has against this spread set is they have to play zone coverage Troy Smith picking apart because Michigan or really England health in the country has a hard time matching up and playing any mantoman against these four or five other things well and because they spread you out before receivers they still have the ability to get physical with Antonio Pittman in Chris Wells so total pick your poison with the way they're all fence attack let's see what Russell wanted to emphasize in that time that's what he wanted cookin stein stick it in the end zone number 11 poor catches in this bride we were wondering where he was to be remember we said a lot of time left for number 11 play zone covers against this guy he was just picking them apart you might as well try to go to a tie and coverage because you're not going to have any success with Chris Graham or any other linebacker for that matter walked out for Anthony Gonzales that's the point is added by pepper well you have been balanced here you've got a linebacker walk here you've got the option to go whichever way he wants it in Spain it's difficult he tries to take away the inside but you're talking about the best wide receiver on the Ohio State team as far as route running and it's just so hard in space for a linebacker of that size to stay with the quickness of Gonzalez what happened even Michigan runs out of talented corners to try to match up and play man under coverage on five quick wise receivers like Ohio State has tremendous game plan by Jim Tressel remember yesterday I asked him is a chance to throw a lot of feedback to try to get Michigan an eightman front and throw the ball down the field now I realize why he looked at me like I always complain go five wide receivers all the way from students what to do and the guys three different Buckeye receivers have a touchdown man we'll see how this game finishes up and I can just tell you as a former Ohio State quarterback coach Smith had the best two games of any Ohio State quarterback in history this rivalry coming into the day in fact that's all we heard about all week he wondered it the pressure to live up to those expectations might be too and at 241 about three well two and a half games without a single intersection and again they keep it out of question past couple loose ball and they're still 15 pick to the clock left here in the scrum for the football Buckeyes are hoping the fullback down there or libo have a little bit of difficulty with the short kickoffs as they keep it out of breasts and hands margin is 1442 points put up in the first half of an Ohio State Michigan game that has to rate was one of the highest firsthalf ever do their job I think Western excuse me Brent Steve Breaston coming in there the poor boys almost feeds us because a lot of things for this football team that some parents throw this good recovery right go help a example a good hustle take a look at how the officials are stopping the Buckeyes remember the players many of you've seen that they cross here at the horseshoe and right now let's go to Lisa well we've missed some assignments and obviously we've got to do a better job of stopping big blaze we've been a team that hasn't given up big plays all year long we gave up to today thanks a lot closures over to Bonnie coach Michigan's only allowed 12 points okay one of your spread formations Johnson neutralized what they usually like to do Michigan is a great defense for our guys have made some plays will pass protect them pretty well right it's a long game got a 14 point lead what inside sides in the locker room to make sure they let it go to life you tell them is not enough Michigan's got a great offense you've got a great football team it's a great game I thank you all right Bonnie and right now Troy Smith is having it his way Ohio State 28 Michigan 14 I'm Brent Musburger with Bob Davie and Kirk Herbstreit and coach 21 of 26 what must the Michigan defense do here against the Brent first Ohio State pulled Michigan by going five receivers and spread in the field now Michigan's had time to see it they know when five wide receivers are in the game at half time I think Ron English had to find a way to match up personnel to place some man under so they can test them throat if they play zone tore Smith will continue panic and the problem with that though is they cannot get pressure on choice hit because they're mixing up the play calling it up and he's getting rid of the ball before the pressure can hit there so and see if they can maybe crank that pressure up here in the second hand here comes Ben just shy humble ballsout always marked down you could see that it popped up so let's go down to our best buy the playbook game was big plays it was well the freshman 52 yards his longest run of the season great fake by Smith looking for give another of his three touchdown passes getting Dulles and Jim couples are going one more touchdown for a quarterback Kirk you and I were talking I mean toys Smith has been unbeatable in big game he plays his best in the biggest games and you always hear players refer to big games when the opportunities that we've seen that in his career where is opening the second half the fill was low and roy hall sitting down there so it'll be second down and 10 our Pacific Life game summary and just to highlight some of the numbers that Bob Davie was referring to 241 yards against that Michigan pass defense a hundreds of 44 yards for hynny remember they went right down the field Michigan did with his first series of the game Manningham caught three balls on that drive and they've shut him down ever since so here is second down in Ohio State you complete in and out again hands and it is suddenly third intent to know I love the play calling of Jim Tressel not getting conservative right here coming out in the second half why he has a 28 14 lead is because he's been wide open and throwing it and he's continuing to do it stick it out to execute kick in with wide open I think I said four wide as he sent me this personnel package out relaying the signal so a hand signal is passed on to Troy Smith he checks the wristband calls the play and they got more than four they got five out there right now again this has been lethal again and a quick tackle short of the first down and a good stop by Morgan time it's exactly what Michigan needed to start the second half down by 14 they needed to get it three and out to get Chad Henne the ball back and also show their defense the defense has a lot of pride made some adjustments by Ron English and I know Ohio State had chances but the bottom line is they didn't execute and fish can get the ball back and you said it just getting off the field is a huge confidence builder for Michigan even though Ohio State helped them he'll feel better regain that swagger this is only the second part of the game for Picasso that's the first cream for the Buckeyes and on the side and out of bounds trying to keep it out of Brest ins hands so good field position for Chad Ninian Michigan 60 yards away it's only 31 yards on the punt so there you see the Wolverines going with their first and their second drives of the game Arrington scored that second one but the Buckeyes pounced back in answer and what really helped by Jim Tressel being aggressive I mean Michigan has the football right now obviously for Geno to the third quarter they want to run the football they don't look like they're going through he'll burn five rival Michigan impede the back here and a control on the flanker screen and that's many Lien's first bits of the opening drive of the game Antonio's Smith a corner with the stop component O'Neill's about the cat Kirk and a told us yesterday they did want sure this guy could ever beat Lee starter for them obviously a threeyear walkon wingzza scholarship that was a tremendous player well he's physically the number two tackler on the team in he's five nine at 195 pounds really the boundary quarters he's no room officially that was a labral so it is a run by Han first man cannot stop the little rascal he gets the midfield with John Kerr the linebacker their tremendous leg strength by michael hart he is going to run through a tackle by James Laurinaitis right here great play by Leonidas fighting off the fullback Vicki Burke you see the strength of Michael her strength pitching balance competitive spirit and to keep the spark plug and his Michigan team and a big turnaround if they've enjoyed this year Berlin Shore indices of 100,000 first down at heart breaks free one man defeated he pushes him out of bounds Malcolm Jenkins the corner saves the touchdown 33 yards for Hart and Bo Schembechler would love this one because watch the pullback a leap oh right there a great block on Brandon Mitchell to safety up in the pond that is boastful Beckler isolation football brain and poet also loved his left ankle takedown and the way he took control of Golson turned his body out and open that hole first down come right back with the running play to the two yard line with their opening drive of the second half Lloyd Garth Wolverine showing a lot of fight as we open the second half there Braley by 14 looking to make it a 7 again this is Michigan football dude this is what you think about you think about the Wolverines over the years it's a big powerful offensive line the running game so much notoriety of course there's own watching team it just a little roll up our sleeves here and start second half and see who the better man is on the first end told touchdown Michigan call your friends folks call them where how this was good real interesting didn't amazing they start the game with a break drag they come out in the second half and how they break drive they just have to sustain and maintain is right now if what when lay cars stood in there at halftime and he said this is what has to happen when we start the second half this is exactly what needed to happen for Michigan to not only climb back into the game and hopefully but then they get within seven but also on the sidelines there's a different feel and curlies that seeing that right now north bonny bird from Jim Russell tell them we got to score more we don't have enough points coach Tressel was all over five plays 60 yards we're back to 749 points and we just started the second half this ESP in production available on ABC HD presented by Dish Network so Mike Hart having a huge day 14 carries 115 yards and 203 touchdown talks so much time passing at five receivers Michigan starts the second half five plays running the football right down the field against the Ohio State defense to set the tone for them in the second half interesting chickens Wolverine's content to let begin take his chances gone out meanwhile that keep it away from Weston and he's down short of the 20 yard line I want to remind everybody that tonight in prime time big one out west California looking for its first Rose Bowl berth since 1958 and they can wrap it up if they win tonight meanwhile USC well they're still the national title picture and a win will keep them in the hunt eight Eastern five Pacific Cal and USC and the Coliseum cannot wait to see John David booty and Nate longshore would have put a great quarterback battle tonight in the pac10 club next book where dad's out there to throw up first down and and there is the handoff Prescott Burgess coming up to make the stop and now here is poised with the defames just what you talked about it this is the four biggest games that he had in his career and the way he's been able to step up you see the touchdown to interception ratio which is amazing hug just circle that you include the first half tonight against Michigan he was one of these guys that's a big we became the bettery place and the calmer he is his team seems to feed off of that book zero interceptions the Buckeyes spread the field again pull wide and few tight ends high and incomplete through quickly and he was under pressure that time the Wolverines got heat on number 10 we check in with body well Brad this has been a really emotional week for Troy Smith as you imagine he's a fifth year senior on Thursdays all the seniors addressed the team and Troy told me this week he said I knew it I would break down at some point on Thursday night was anything I was standing at the podium looking at all of my teammates I just wanted them to know how much I love them how much I appreciate them and how much apart they have been of my maturation process I'm on a third and nine Russell sends in a running back Antonia Pittman for Troy Smith to that empty look that time the Wolverines were bringing Thunder the previous play a timeout has been used here by the Buckeyes so they use one of their three secondhalf timeouts here well when you listen to troy smith talk about his teammates you just understand the maturity that he has shown under trussell i don't live in this moment for me you know I live and I try to do everything for my teammates and everybody else that I represent because the average student you have a person doesn't understand that the daily decisions that you make affect so many other people is not just used in anything they affect pretty much everybody else he is a cover boy for showing progress here's a young man who had a little problem he took some money under the table he paid his debt came back he now lectures youngsters about it about doing the right thing I can't tell you how much he has matured circus coming to Columbus had experience in the leadership did look at him looking into the huddle he's sensing right now momentum is swinging to Michigan he's challenging his team in that huddle to help him out here on this third down did you see the players look back at him did you see those don't do that blur yep third and and again the Blitz is coming they try to pinch in in hitting on the release intercepted on the deflection Alan Grant came back big Alan ball deflected first turnover of the afternoon but it was a heat that was being brought by the Wolverine and we talked about half time of judgment outers ronny was with the time he has at halftime the 20 minutes come up with the plan the pressure this president this time though they only rush for blush course Navabi blows the football into traffic and how about Alan branch at 320 pounds we just talked about how Boyd Smith has never thrown interception in big games can Michigan applying the pressure he takes the chance deep in his own territory balls deflected and branches very secure the 45yard line more than a hundred thousand enchant many years I mean back when my party puts on the cutback and still battles Israelis 20yard line wrong run Curtis Terry makes the stop the blatant about his again defense keeping his gaming chef early allowed Michigan to stay within the framework of their office and give this guy the ball the number 20 number 10 Delilah says for Smith a lot of heart and michael hart for michigan just as much target this is a lot of times when you see michigan try to find a theme routes of Manningham into the end zone once they get you to think about the line that's when they like to throw the ball and they get oneonone to Manningham second in five Buckeyes were blitzing and Hart battling and giving ground of a couple yards third down coming up and it is huge for mission for what a change of momentum Widmark his staff deserve a lot of credit for the way this second half has started nice have to throw it away under tremendous pressure that dime on the third down burning Goulston in on hynny boys offered by placed in the right defensive end of the he knocks number 57 Adam frost that guard back into a quarterback that was a great pass rostovondon Erik Revis 39 yard at them and Garrett Rivas holds the Wolverines three points closer now it's a fourpoint game 28:24 after the troy smith interception this is play the most impressive stat I've seen all year let me explain this Ohio State has turned up all over now 14 times that is the first point so hyoe state defense has given up all year after a turnover that is the most unbelievable statistic I have ever seen in college but kind of one of those hitting notes throughout the season that's become very impressive meanwhile they've scored a ton after they take away and you could see the top part of that oh here we go now Michigan for the touchdown on a field goal after the turnover they closed back in and so team to get outside these out of bounds about the 20yard line we checking down below why they chase again this will be against the kicking team and they come over after number seven supposedly when we check in with Bonnie O'Brien after growing just v take off season president was absolutely inconsolable on the bench no less than five of his teammates tried to come up here look he will not even make eye contact Troy knows how much is on the line in his game the Big Ten championship the trip to the Rose Bowl and even though he won't think about individual accolades if he doesn't step up tonight we will be calling him the frontrunner for the Heisman not absolutely obviously but this performance could affect that bitch 1st down and 10 for Troy Smith of the Buckeyes who lead at 28 24 right back control again after the interception here's begin and he's out of bounds and the arms of Leon Hall obviously with confidence Jim Tressel in Troy Smith he's not on Dickens over the joy Smith was not cute Barone I think it's the confidence three hands in the fact that he's going to make good decisions with the ball even after the interception he goes back to that this is where you really show what you're made out of at the quarterback when you hit some adversity point a few times all season with leading the way this time if Antonio's Pittman the first half belonged to Chris Wells but they closed the middle again 56 yards for the junior and the Akron twins Pittman and Chris Wells have done the job went late hit on the kickoff gave Ohio State's offense some life and some yardage and room to work with I found the Esteban 3524 watch the middle of the offensive line well first of all spear airing number 71 comes around on the powerplay and get a block keep in mind this is the number one rust offense in all of college football once they Priest the line of scrimmage you see number 22 tomorrow Adams was facing up South folks there's no one in the second level of people that was coaching broke the line of scrimmage he was calm but it was about speed acceleration once he got through that initial surge for the Michigan defense but I think Michigan put nine guys up tight to the line of scrimmage on such short yardage Pro hyoe stayed to come up with a first down second time we've seen Ohio State come up with a big play when it's been second from very short Jim Tressel is simply the best play caller in college football that I've watched in a long time Michigan giggle 20 perfect game Russian that can't happen again for Michigan people twoonone our cohosts a jab tonight deep resting with a comedian come out on the 20yard line let us go to Matt Winer in New York right here's a vote for the Pontiac gamechanging performance of the day Alabama trying to end a fourgame Iron Bowl Club John Parker Wilson Travis McCall 13 yards the tide is turned BAM up 1514 to vote for your Pontiac gamechanging performance just go to espn.com and type in keyword Pontiac we've got a boat on we welcome you back to Columbus with Bob Davie Perkins Street Lisa Salters and Bonnie Bernstein I'm Brent Musburger Notre Dame McCarroll army so they're on target to head out west next week and play their archrival USC tonight of course don't forget USC and California will tee it up at 8:00 Eastern Time 35 24 Buckeyes lead by 11 and we got a timeout an Ohio State Michigan game with already more than 600 yards of offense 386 for Ohio State they've rushed for 136 yards and that's gone for 250 miles now they'll try to dig in the Wolverines we're his goryeo Manningham since the first drive deflected incomplete suckin down anything the play they hit earlier on the first drive a quick slant they wanted to try to get the ball that time the Manningham the Curtis Terry got back but it was deflected over the line of scrimmage by Jay Richardson second and ten Clark planning for the left and you know we better than half of it in Laurinaitis the linebacker over there defensively a very instinctive linebacker you see Michigan where he loved to run left because a big offensive tackle number 77 Jake Bronk I heard Mel Kiper the other day on the radio saying this guy Jo Thomason Wisconsin he's only a junior has another year they posted his top 10 graphic the NFL Draft this I don't mean what a difference in inference now that he's healthy this year long as the senior this is throw down and these battling the nura's level here fires it off end a little for the first and tenth so the offensive line gave him time and Arrington who scored his last touchdown at the end of the first half 15 more yards for Harrington and I really think the injury to Mario Manningham really helped the development of Adrian Arrington he has become a guy that can count on his flood situations Turkey feed Antonio Smith the point in mantoman coverage Marty and in on that stop as ghosted who has played very well here in the defensive line for the Buckeyes we've talked a lot about Troy Smith and his arm strength back to that previous play the arm strength of Chad Henne he is a tremendous on when I had to go over to the Ohio State deciding this week interview choice myth and I said that there's one trait about Chad Henne you could have what would it be when he sent arms for them from this hash on the left side guys he throws as well as anybody to the right side he has a and coming seat got every kid again first and 10 at the 33 and that demonstrated the arm strength colors right there you just said he liked to throw to the right as well as anybody he just beat the Ohio State defense in mantoman coverage and this time they exploit the zone coverage code now they're going to get three deep coverage and Adrian's and arrogance going right down the seam watch the safety you run away from him right here again a great timing flow right down a hash to put the corner in the face there's part nothing doing our the bounce outside to the lab between mccottry fine defensive technique senior in the state of Ohio and he figures to go high in the draft when you talk about all these fellows are going to be seeing some day on some day and I'm sure that so many of these great players of the past Buckeyes the Wolverines were playing Sunday football or watching this and right then second down and ten Jenny on the throw and it was incomplete pressure was being applied by Vernon goldsmith Vernon's a sophomore from Detroit turkeys have a heck of a day he's been probably the biggest surprise for the Ohio State defense this year he's just kind of overpowered Jake long come to his inside shoulder didn't go through the back my heart still kicked the chat him it's a blouson movement on it to get a super right there third and ten parking get it off because if david paterson the senior David Patterson is going to please moving lie in number 72 right there on an inside move there's so much talk this year guys about how young the Ohio State defense is you just talk about fifth time he and Patterson have really provided leadership going to go here going to go on fourth down ten Manningham ago less than an antique into the right Florine in underneath that question slips on the pipe oh hi Oh State football Malcolm Jenkins with the coverage Ruston tried to cut back and his peak gave way on the new sod less than on the crossing route you know it's going to take yards after the catch and right here obviously the turf give out on him right there the surf gives out and Malcolm Jenkins his hair and safety coming over to see why boys hard excited to go for that really out of field goal range and here's where the turf was torn up inside handoff here on first down Chris Wells who exploded let's take you back to the first half and let's show you Wells spinning little openings nobody in deep centerfield that was just the first moments ago center field open and Pittman takes it to the house receipts how many talented players in this game because of poverty fighters have a play you know a lot of fake games you see one guy doing a half after that this has been spread around across this entire thing second and six four horsemen penalty flag is thrown by the umpire parents tailor we have not had many flags thrown by Rick Nelson but he was right in the middle of that one whose risk so Dave Perry has said in a group of outstanding officials here to work this game headed up by Bill Lemonnier it's an honor I'm sure for all these guys that to be assigned to this game holding number 50 on the offense that Penn League declined third down that's the center Doug daddy he was the tackle the offensive line a year ago when Nick Mangold moved on to the New York Jets and I believe mango was missed only one snap this year if I heard correctly on a radio last week he was out for one play and somebody told me that he had made all the line calls already for the Jets and he was one of the best centers I'd ever watched over here at Ohio State he's a good one I drew mate was a Jayhawk how about those two together my day after the good they were down in 11 with buns Troy an incomplete Rose was intended for Rory nickel which I in Lamar Woodley is applying the pressure again we're going to see Woodley right there a little bit of slip close to a late hit by David Harris coming on the outside like there but another big stop by the Michigan defense from Paso on the punt now for the Bucs rush things back and let this one go this is a lot of bounds the angle punted it'll be spotted at the 34 yard line well ESPN's College Football on ABC brought to you by Best Buy wrap up the Wow this holiday season only at Best Buy on ya go online look for this week's Pontiac gamechanging performance ratings titanium shavers and Discover Card if I'm a credit card put you in the driver's seat this is Mirror Lake but of course this is a great prediction on Thursday night jumpers waking the spirit of would he any high and incomplete arrington the intended receiver you look down a hundred thousandplus hair Columbus and our aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear tires featuring triplethreat technology with three separate red zones for peace of mind in any weather speaking of weather this is about it it's good at de Klerk if I can remember for an Ohio State Michigan game not here but just up on that bolson we were talking earlier before the game to like these games to be played when it's about 30 or 40 degrees overcast maybe sitting a little bit of snow but you go turned out to be a great thing that first man can't get him and he battles for 8 yards in Jenkins the corner heart is amazing when the first tackler just cannot bring him down how about the quickness in the hole after the jump then I watch this move on Brandon Mitchell he split the two linebackers but he makes Brandon Mitchell missed right there what's quickly here's your third down and one marks the favor let's see what the Wolverines come up with here we're going to try to throw four going long downfield Manningham Dickens just scored and he's got it intercepted on third and short Michigan Gamble's and Malcolm Jenkins makes them pay what about this Paul first of all guys I don't want to put yours in short you throw the ball down the field like that you got Jake llama 320 pounds of left half of michael hart says matrix face and break his ankles and we hope the field I would around the ball they've had so much success running the football let's see if it is an interception it's all a review yeah it looked like I don't think his hand got underneath it it looked like the ball actually hit the surface and I have to review that thank you guys for exactly right under review so the former Big Ten referee upstairs will start to take a look at it inserted one called they wanted the oneonone matchup with Manningham against Malcolm Jenkins they had got to look and Jenkins is one of the better cover corners in the Big Ten but I guess my point will be and I understand if it would have worked it would have been a great call I probably on boat right now but Michigan made a huge commitment Kirk as you know the reason they felt they were 75 last year they couldn't run the football we may have to that was an opportunity in my opinion to show you've been running when you happen not to mention we've seen in second half their offensive line take back control the line of scrimmage and and a half left here in the third quarter and upstairs there they're reviewing some of you might not be familiar with the colleague rules unlike the NFL doesn't always have to be challenged by a coach every play in reality is being reviewed upstairs even though there is one coaching challenge available as you go around the country let's see where the money is indisputable video evidence the past is incomplete without michigan right come great job yeah exactly not to mention for as much as replay has taken a hit how efficient or is that true Tom Quinn now Henny was putting his helmet back on and Lloyd's got a decision to make trailing a minute and a half left see now he brings Hindi back anyone to go out and go for it there was no question they're going to have him sit down what do you think about this decision that all the quarterbacks would discard heartstrings paid by one Errol Bruce was here with all three was all the way out on the field on both on trying to go for Andy he wants a chance to pack this Buckeye defense now we'll see if that review helps or hurts Michigan because you're hunting about the 30 gainer Gonzalez in papers better off it wasn't as much no doubt about that very interesting I believe the ball was like about the 23 yard line is where the pick was so let's see what happens who gains our illusion here in field position I am in I only pick up three yards here we go it will come out on the 20yard line that was a 57yard punt we take a look at the two quarterbacks the fellows who've missed braids or have mentioned braiding cleaners it's a 22 a 30 against army 217 3 TD had a pick and another Dame rolled and that's what Troy's done here today if I may put my studio hat on here it Choi Smith wins this game with the first half that he's had the Heisman race is over it's Troy Smith trophy enews coming into the game he lost if he loses the game it opens it up for a point was Pittman stumbling boys first of all that's why I got in Italy that's life as an alum now now you get your chance now it's still open right first of all Brady Quinn from right here in Dublin Ohio they're knocking five miles out here again I'm a great big pig raising clean fan as I've been for four years we've um choice and their family go ahead get that super safe different laws no look open nonrefundable ticket because you're going I'm throwing in my little guy my card at the beach I am they can pull this thing out there we go cause you could he wins and he was before the copyright it was together oh look on the ground Michigan branches in on it Alan Blanche who had an interception earlier and suddenly this game takes another twist Doug daddy she played tackle last year when he mission at least the center you see the task on his hand right there he broke that risk early anesthesia had a wrist injury since that point is healed that Jim Bollman the offensive ankles makes him snap with the cast on because the superstition reason that's the fourth badmouthing panel and here comes Hart trying to stretch it to the left and he is locked down from behind David Patterson was coming from the backside and Lawrence Wilson was over there and those two big fellas simply surrounded it so the final seconds have ticked away in the third quarter the money quarter folks is coming up ESPN's College Football on ABC returns after this message and a word from our ABC stations the final quarter begins with Bob Davie and Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger Ohio State in a highscoring dual League Michigan by a suck it down from the nine yard line as Laurinaitis and this fifth Buckeye defense coming up into the teeth of the crowd that closed in in the round Trustin trying to get free meat supply end zone reaches touchdown Michigan the 9yard in drowned Steve Rustom the senior from Randolph Pennsylvania with great speed coming around the edge J Richardson had no chance to get to him in the acceleration that he has allowed him to get across the goal line and into the end zone and I do see the right lead down but I think that ball was extended to break the plane of that goal line right there I think that will stand of the customer they will go for two here trailing by five they'll chase it now and there could be a review on this yes it will be under review when did the knee hit the ground and where was the football so Lemonnier will come over quinn upstairs we'll take one more look at this now where's the ball when the knee touches down knee down this one is very very close it must be indisputable now and my guess is that it depends on your point of view in columbus they're saying knee was down it's short of the end zone and an arbor they're saying he clearly broke the plane and that translates after it's not indisputable rights right I don't think the album usually in a case like that usually they go with the call on the field where the official was standing right there now you wonder coach mean things got the edge if they wind up going for two on the next play here they're more time for the offense but play indisputable video evidence the runner did not score for the third and goal I am making number 20 a prohibitive favorite and what Lloyd should do is forget about the controversy and concentrate on the next play this does we know good knee was down that's the ruling upstairs by Quinn get to work on the next play this is wasted time burnt you'll ride with her down the ball will be obviously inside the one yard line once they get it spotted but you have to think it's four down territory out there right now resident in the crowd wrote such a huge factor right now in these real short yardage play where's Kenny could try to put his helmet down behind mark Beale the center or step over behind Alex Mitchell and slow down they all said only go to the right stop it be stopped touchdown this time from Michigan his third of the afternoon an amazing performance by five foot nine inch Mike Hart out of Syracuse hundred 96 pounds you want to have an idea how powerful this guy is he's going to run right into a safety and Brandon Mitch when a linebacker John Kurt all the more physical attack lers on a Ohio State defense and he ran right over top of them to get into the end zone now they're go for two trying to put it on sweetie they settled before that would be little different than five you can chase a timeout president Russell I believe is down to one timeout left here on the second half with this decision but he saw something he didn't like you wants to whatever he can do try to leave it on a five rather than a three so you know we came in today and honoring the memory of a great friend of all of ours I and all people in college football I mean Bo Schembechler was such a wonderful character and I think how unlike Bo and woody this game is today up and down the field high scoring but you know those two Rascals are up there somewhere looking down on this and having a great afternoon Oh without without a doubt you know these the emotion on the field every year in this rivalry is unparalleled and tonight because it's one against two not only is it bragging rights is of course about trying to get to the national championship but what to ten years between woody and Bo did for this rivalry is it took it from being a great rivalry to being I think the best rivalry in all of sports because of the way there were two generals going against each other for those ten years and I'll tell you what they'd love first of all there's some collision by the football all over the place but Morgan you talk about some young guys stepping up on this stage and just entertaining everybody across the country with some great effort I mean Vickers all we thought it could be right here everybody want to know if this game would live up to the height how could it live up to the hype I'm curious right here while Boyd is kicked into such deportment he suddenly changed and why the ball is off but not remove it wasn't a face they changed their mind and Garrett rebus puts it on a poor the puzzling folks real puzzling time so it's the scarlet and gray here today amazing blue stands out out hunger trailing by four points as Lloyd Carr expeller with time for the two to put it on the tray doesn't want to chase it right now we've got most of the fourth quarter to go Mike Hart three rushing touchdown through today 135 yards on the ground such a huge difference not completely healthy a year ago and then all the Rory Smith chomping at the bit he's had a couple of turnovers here in this game again runs up to the 10 they try to put him on that side of the field and he was down at the 26 yard line and so Troy Smith Kirk with final words from coach Tressel on what to come up with here legends are made in this rivalry he's already had a chance last two years think about this second half of what has happened to him he has got to be able to reprove their first five drives Ohio State turn the ball over twice it had two punts it mixed it a score for Troy Smith wants to go to that elite status forever he's going to be able to find a way win this game in the fourth quarter or down linemen for the Wolverines offensive line holes and he snaps it off underneath his second completion here of the second half as we take a look at the Pacific Life game summary and it's been Mike Hart so as far as the end zone was concerned for the world remains free touchdown tremendous fake the first half getting in for the touchdown and in the game Smith three touchdown passes part rushing put three second down and three my name is worry for a first down you know Kirk you bring up a great point I mean in a game like this you need to remember Hitler forgotten as a coach or a player how's you doing the thing it's not about the body of work bottom line all the season was great but it comes down to the fourth quarter right now what's your legacy that's right for both both teams have been very surprised here in the second half in Co high estate going away from that five four and five wide receiver look that helped him so much to generate those points in the first half power i formation sticking on the ground with one of the little subplots a Heisman Trophy and of course through the years these two great schools that when they're shared Eddie George in attendance here today he wanted to Ohio State Desmond how are things on the set earlier he won one up at Michigan with that famous pose in the end zone game against the Buckeyes and there's the five receiver look we just talked about an end six the collection is lame man singing aloud to the outside and out of bounds but he crosses the 40yard line with a 38 Lamar Woodley with the Blitz bring him up to get pressure on Troy Smith and he was just a hair too late in getting the Smith anything you don't get the Troy Smith and your man the man on the outside Morgan Trent against Royce again set again if he doesn't make that place there's nobody else there and he almost been around him for a storm that's when the man on second time off the cuff him and Pompey met the line usually has votes in cook because I think he's more dangerous after the kids Thurston's had the ball at the 37 yard line in underneath the tide in crossing Lorinda : out of bounds on the far side good first down play we talked about Jim Tressel you mentioned a little bit earlier just a second ago your little surprised he's not opening up little ball in the 4 &amp; 5 wide receiver once he got a little pretty efficient he got right back to what got him to this point her first mother and his sister watching here second and four boy that's short of the first down so this will bring up a third and short and Brent let's go back just I'm a little surprised as we all were of Lloyd Clark kickin that extra point to make it a fourpoint game here in the fourth quarter and why he didn't go for two I'm still not really sure why right now he's more concerned about stopping this third down play here Jhin comes to the bottom of your screen that's Gonzalez in the slot ever dangerous from that spot humble falls on the ground again on a bad snap daddy should snap one hi a short time ago has another bad snap and Michigan takes over goes back to your point coach about how he doesn't have a good grip on the football well then he has had cast on right hand the cookie gone about five weeks straight of not having a bad snap but you know what a life a lot of confidence people don't think about shotguns pass or punch snappers when you lose that confidence it's hard to get it back he never had to go up on a I never had control the ball at all we slipped out of his hand you talked about guys team remember to forgotten on this game dad is right now half the bounce back first and ten for hitting the Wolverines down for under pressure drop by Manningham who is coming across the middle as we check in with Matt Winer hi Brenner is a singular ESPN allamerica Player of the Week update on Boston College linebacker Jaylon Dunbar big Beatty win over Maryland gave their ACC title hopes alive and Dunbar played a huge part 14 tackles inside an NC doublea record by returning two fumbles through school Tech's most 8 7 6 5 4 on your singular folks second down and 10 and he's going to run my cart on a cutback he gives ground and this will be third down and short coming up for Michigan talks so much tonight about what Troy Smith is meant to this rivalry but how about Chad Henning Chad Henne right now the ball is starting to come into into his hands in a position to be remembered as well in the flabyrinth played it only the freshman and a sophomore didn't go his way it's the quarterback to get on the road big places like thin fade earlier this year he's ended Notre Dame he's in the Columbus twice his poise is crucial here is the old brains try to come back to win this game slot formation to the right need three in complete Weston was not free all over him Donald Washington that time and it brings up a fourth and three another great spot by the Ohio State defense we showed that graphic a little bit earlier about sudden change after it's home over that time they bounced back after giving up ten points in the third quarter half the town over what was he thinking could retrieve those looks I failed our Michigan Senate let's go back to punt Ian and Gonzales banking to the bottom except the return hims got it on the 16 and phone down at the 15 yard line and terrific coverage that died by the Wolverine because they come right down the field with Darnell hood the captain of the special team Ohio State football 1038 remaining in the fourth quarter 35:31 Buckeyes with the football coming out from the 16 yard line after Darnell hoods tremendous tackle on Ted Ginn and we have a story about her to do a play about her momentarily but guys come with a conservative draw play during the week at Michigan hood played the role of number 10 Troy Smith he's a speedster a onetime defensive back he's been the captain of the special teams for Lloyd cars Michigan Wolverines and watch this tackle on Tech in one hand pulls him down by the jersey keeps you in shy of the 20 yard on that there's the young man and Lloyd Carr says when one point during practice if I did knowing that you could throw the football that well I would put in quarterback great to see guys take so much pride in their special teams work that's his job and watch the shotgun snap right away snap my daughters and take take off himself stepped out of bounds at the 29 yard line with a first and 10 and a Kirk let's go back here now the last six drives by the bucket amazing to think that in the first half they scored 28 points they had one punt Ron English the defensive coordinators you can tell he's made some changes to turnovers when oh hi Oh state has hurt themselves but the Michigan defense has played very well indeed second half considering how close of Ohio State look in that percent Ron English he's done an outstanding job as the new defensive coordinator this year Hansen has to be up for the Frank Broyles award for the Pacific coach of the year first and ten for the Bucks now timeout Michigan highball goatskin sat down to one second timeout that's not a happy camper right there he is all over his safety remember he lost with a spare injure earlier in this game in Ohio Stadium record 100 and 5708 as they see number one versus number two Ohio State Michigan the winner will go on to the national championship game 1st down and 10 great take again by Smith if he hands it off it's like a drop here sipping day right side I finally pushed out of bounds at the 45 yard line David Harris with the draw play after they fake to the last in a play open something truly a matter a matter of when they're Antonio Pittman gets to the outside look who is downfield dog Dadda SH downfield on atoms of safety he's 25 yards downfield he obviously has the body to take care that but he needed something to get him back into this game well statue of Willie the top off of it five teams inherit the land bought Romo sideline once these six yards for Pittman p2 is over a hundred yards rushing in here today power look and beginning tomorrow folks you could download all the action today his name as well as other classic games you can mention 73 9702 from the storied rivalry only on iTunes and iTunes downloaded all tomorrow right now we have 66 points aboard Chris Rose checked in as the running back he had that explosive run indeed in the first half the freshman hitman with 125 yards well for the 53 our country looking down at Alinea filled up by the Wolverine 35 31 under nine minutes to go big debate in the last few weeks is could we see a rematch if this game were closed in the national championship you want the best two teams to play in January agent Len don't just answer that one question you want the best 15 hi I came in with a pretty strong opinion not wanting to see a rematch and after the way this game has gone lots going to depend on us teams tonight against Cal and in next week against Notre Dame the very consent the ones the last game oh yes this one oh yeah third down and five so in blitz stand on the slant first down Ohio State as he comes back Danny hit number nine Brian Hartline Richard Furstenberg jokes typical Iowa become a factor in the passing game they had receivers three receivers to the left he wanted to get the ball the heart line the entire time and hard line had to work hard to get off Johnny Sears who was physical in his coverage he did a good job at hard line did not give up on the route and either destroy Smith tony'll Pittman reports back in the 25 the running back to the bus wheels right behind their backs and works they're either second and long well just what you were talking about Gus Kirk are all state BCS standings and there are one and two but don't rule out the Trojans if they hold the table over California Notre Dame and UCLA they got a factor then we've got Florida Arkansas for the SEC Notre Dame trying to claw and did you ever think that you might be saying Rutgers and national championship game in the same breath what a job by Greg Shanno and that coaching staff of the fold that's what we're sucking down and but you're hit on the release incomplete and a blindside ripped by Lamar Woodley who was in on number 10 that dive we talked a lot about running was making adjustments one of the adjustments I'm saying is Anthony Gonzalez is one of the best receivers on Ohio State's team Leon there's a big hit like you said from Willie on the outside untouched one of the adjustments is trying to put their best cover corner on a slot receiver and Anthony Gonzalez who shut him out one of the biggest adjustments is standing Woodley up in this football game and getting him away from Shafer and boom and let me blitz from the linebacker spot what an adjustment by English no wonder he's been coming from that spot he's their defensive end over there and he was tied up in the first half third down and ten there's a whistle before Smith debating it the letter game offense he thought he got it off in time fiveyard penalty still flirt down this makes it third and a 15 now interesting to see what ron english the defensive coordinator does on this call they've been playing mantoman coverage in lifting this for y5 live looked at on third and 15 i looking for I look for him to play zone the front board needs to get a pass left right here for Michigan then Davos is your slot man now he is off to the left he has made so many big plays the last couple years for the box looking in that direction this has to take off dances free now he'll throw incomplete and a penalty flag Michigan will debate this grayble over on the near side Smith was going out of bounds personal foul a huge call was 649 to go the thing that Shaun Crabill did is he came high towards Troy Smith head gear anytime you lead with your helmet that is not to mention it was out of bounds but if you lead with your helmet you're going to get called for that every time no corpse in an excellent all like vomiting on a huge car third and 15 that'll give the Bucs an automatic first down that's the toughness there of choice myth all his teammates always talk about his leadership the intangibles and the toughness of trying to get up from a hit like that Truong Crabill from Maslin Ohio and he can complain all you want there was helmet contact on the nearside if your vision convene fence let it go lay the hold him to a field goal right now horse down and then got a first down broke this key thing that they're going to spot it maybe adjust a little bit short but see go ahead to slide the line to the left of blitz coming from the left it's picked up and it's a oneonone matchup with Ribisi against Morgan print makes a good move in the balls thrown on the money to Morgan Trent who is Michigan's fastest TV again playing off main demand Ron interesting a lot of mantoman coverage here lately Swoboda so second down and short and Smith he did himself was your first down signal for the Buckeyes who walked down to six minutes because near the end the game was like they shrivel a player of the game from each team and to honor their determination channel a will make a one thousand dollar contribution each University's general scholarship fund I can certainly remember Torrey Smith winning it in Ann Arbor a year ago with that wonderful performance here he's up by four five fifty five to go see how shuffle sent it up he's content for a field goal we attack with they open it up if you look on the clock I'm going to fire boys enjoy got it cuts down goes back the robust beam Brian wrote Biscay as Jim puzzled fires away that started with great protection from the offensive line and the confidence you have in your quarterback if you're Jim Tressel Boy Smith the role of the football these are going to check the feet over there on the far side on this reception just to make sure that whiskey has won inbounds and control it's a design fade stop by Ohio State to come back and Morgan Trent flips let's see if he has the foot inbounds on possession here it's too high there for he's in it already good call it look like it looks like there might have been two blades there I'm looking like a great technique right there and I tell you what to make that call and to be focused as that official right here and all these guys down that was a great job perfect to this rate mechanic and you go back to the Shawn kraebel bleep hit on third and 15 to keep the drive alive no question about it now with the helmet there on the near side yeah that is great mechanics right there if at all by the size estimate for John loose advance team announced the game right that's the five judge on this pine crew is signed by Dave berry to this game forty one thirty one extra point time that is the fourth different Buckeye with a touchdown reception in this game eleven plays 83 yards and more importantly five minutes off the clock and three on the extra point the Buckeyes are five and a half minutes away playing for the national championship aerial coverage of the showdown in Columbus brought to you by Goodyear tires between triplethreat technology with three separate red zones for peace of mind in any weather last chance time coming up for the Wolverines now they're down 11 I didn't have to go Weston the exit down he's going to come out consider the 20yard line Lia's pians College Football on ABC presented by Best Buy wrap up the Wow this holiday season only at Bev five Chevrolet American brand Chevy an American Revolution the city premier passed credit card rewarding very very very rewarding and Verizon Wireless folks there's the best deli in the east of the Mississippi right there that's blah Liana KFC or number thirteen with a great kicker for Woody Hayes he made he's so good even Michigan ordered sandwiches they got 160 of wild and special waiting for you in the club after 1:00 and 2:30 go to hot the funky the supplementing man that died mitts on him and that is the first catch for Manning him since the opening drive when he had three in that opening drive like a new Bond the first I remember the clock will stop at Arrington picked up the first down momentarily but Michigan needs to keep hurry that's a great point Brent in college football as a quarterback when you're in this kind of offense it's all about getting first downs and getting out of bounds giving salivating much time if you can chant Haynes in a comfort zone here having done it many times comes back underneath the fight doing on that won't be falling here for an Iowa State defense I don't think a lot of things for state turnover today that they have 21 interceptions on the year which is number one in the ncdoublea so they're throwing into a secondary right now the kicks and balls off Jimmy Hickok keeps fresh defensive linemen on the field there is Manningham and at the first down at midfield and that is a big play Laurinaitis back defending for the Buckeyes and that's 17 yards games going back to Mario Manningham 7 o'clock Eastern Time which is an hour away from USC in California if the Bears can go in and upset the program they'll go to the Rose Bowl and without dating Kirk Herbstreit off for their world wrapping up another conflict between Michigan and Ohio State looking at the 44 yard line that's Arrington Malcolm Jenkins there something to keep in mind as you're watching the clock is void cars expended two of his timeouts for under four minutes to go they're down 11 every second counts and his precious may only have one timeout remaining and he can throw this one beautiful throw and hanging on his Arrington he took a lick from number 33 Laurinaitis and held on and looking bounce right back up I've been really really impressed with Adrian Arrington bountifully is going to come back but the entry to Manningham as you indicated earlier Roy Carr he's fired up we're going to get a hold on Rubin Riley on burning Golson right now but that was a great hit by Laurinaitis holding 72 offense tenyard previous five second now the thing that's so impressive about James Laurinaitis how BP got on that drop but let's go back and look right here Ruben rowdy the big offensive tackle I think Vernon Golson at the top number 50 it played an excellent football game when there's a hole right there second down and 14 meaning deflected incomplete now off the receivers hands third down coming up 14 yards for the Wolverines he put the coordinators when they get into this situation and Bob you know all about this is you dropping back into coverage trying to keep everything in front of you so you can come up and make the play without Michigan picking up the first down take off the defensive coordinator and Bob baby he's done a superb job remember this year started Ohio State's offense for off course to help this young people those infants have been outstanding all things alone lost and nominee started from the defense a year ago the one in a Fiesta Bowl walk the great trio of linebacker led by AJ hi now third in Finnegan Haycock defense Kenny will not get it on he is son Jay Richardson number 99 the senior from Dublin Ohio is in only quarterback that is the full sack of the game for the Buckeyes and his second when you pressure with four it allowed you to drop seven and play zone when you can get pressure before that is goal for these at the port mater the play before we saw Riley hold Richard still this time Richardson gets around Wiley and through Mitchell to get that pressure Jay Richardson today's link senior year that's his full stack on the season right now the fellows from USC Florida Notre Dame Arkansas Rutgers they're just happy to have that extra touchdown pack by the buck so what happens to these teams in the Big Ten well here's our full breakdown presented by Capital One the Rose Bowl and of course Ohio State will move on to the national championship game if this lead holds on and then that would give the Rose Bowl the first pick and perhaps they will quickly select Michigan if they don't draw an assignment in the championship game but there's the Outback Bowl the rest of moving Pigpen beans go we've come a long way in Hanuman's diluted Ohio State Michigan being possibly ends up in Pasadena about if we had a blowout start completion now could blame these coaches the lesson missed starters in this game but everybody want their playoff think about it more than 60 with 255 time those deep down the far side incomplete Cunningham interference Michigan retains possession jamario O'Neill the safety Michigan's still alive best interference defense number 315 our cuddly automatic first down if you're sitting at home and you're saying that wasn't pass interference I don't want to hear about it because if you're a defensive back one of the things you never do is turn your back completely to the ball and it had no idea where the ball ends whether or not he touched him or not is irrelevant and official will call that every time when you don't know where the football is the amazing thing about Mario Manningham you know that double move is coming you just can't stop it but great thing about college football 1500 penalties and not the quality of the great thing to the defensive good you got over is talking only what really was the second to the court first out of 10 and here's any irate hi he's out of bounds on the far side stops the clock at the 36 yard line guys I am really impressed with Chad Henne his string arm strength composure he has played an excellent football the engineer 19 to 32 for 230 yards more importantly the numbers two minutes 40 seconds Sam and it the Geoghan and the colosseum us ceiling California still ahead recommend for firing aiming rolling catch for a first down what a brilliant play that was as mike Massey slips out the tide in watch 83 here again burgundy covers you see Mike Mastin has been like I said we've had a brother play here at Ohio State individual antic Michigan so he is as an interesting background but a great catch from a young man from the state of Ohio first and 10 then high and infinitely then it'll be second down and down angry first got to get the ball thrown obviously down to now that they're out of timeouts things like a sack things like coming up short with the ball staying in bounds short of the first down that would be obviously problem there Fortran hitting this Wolverine effort to get the ball into the end zone depending on the sideline the way from the pressure still has to throw and does complete touchdown Michigan bounced right back and they hit Tyler after so two fellows who have not countable all day Massey and Eckhart text them here and now Michigan closes back into within five outstanding job Bob you and I've talked about Chad Henne the composure we just talked about how he's been in this kind of situation he's comfortable in this kind of situation leading his team down and a great job of showing composure on that last throw stepping up through the teeth of the defense and finding the tight in so the question becomes can they close it to within three and then one timeout left 216 up on the floor first things first tip we can go time grows bored he's got it it's a threepoint game on Ruston's twopoint conversion 42:39 the classic continues in Columbus Ohio number one in number two check the football they got two missed connections on snacks one time wait this one people in inferno they come back our foot back and 2009 yards on first down that's what's coming up next at 8:00 Eastern California and USC again if the Bears wanted off to Pasadena they March and who knows how this is all going to shake out with the BCS we have an injured player down for the for the Wolverines I think that Kirk brought it up and I just my personal sentiment is I'm not in favor of a remain yeah I would like to see the pac10 the SEC big 12 I guess they don't have a contender I realized I can always these are the two best teams in the country I know that argument I think it's valid Bob what do you think well first of all I think the two best teams should like I think clearly these are the people s team the problem I have tonight the national championship for me because 50 days from now I don't think that's fair with that kind of layoff I think you're seeing the best team in the country tonight and the best two teams in the country III said before the game the loser is out and I still feel that way I think USC to it they're the wildcard USC wins tonight we didn't count and they went out they should be in their championship game I want every snap of course Lloyd cars defense to try to strip the ball as it keeps an eye on that clock one thing I'll add this becomes very relevant if us he wins tonight in Notre Dame upsets us senior boater and you're looking at this Michigan team that you've battled against Notre Dame didn't Michigan play Notre Dame earlier this year we were dollars and I think they went to South Bend milking the clock that's alone too be mobile Ohio State we'll play for a national championship the guy beat their archrival again Jim Russell 5 and 1 against Lloyd Carr let's go down below to body Jim Tressel cut too tight game in your mind one health number one emerge over number two well those are two great football teams when our team has got a lot of belief in one another they love one another got a lot of humility and they just keep playing now that you play it what are your thoughts on a rematch to the national campus again we're going to enjoy today the Ohio State Michigan game and the Big Ten championship thank you
