============================================================

Thank You Reese you are looking live at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison Wisconsin for the marquee Big Ten matchup of the season tonight will be the first time Ohio State will have to deal with a truly intimidating environment and Wisconsin looks to be tougher than any other opponent that the Buckeyes have faced all year good evening everybody and welcome to Kirk Herbstreit I'm Brent Musburger so settle down we'll watch the new number one the Ohio State Buckeyes and terrelle pryor he's really got the offense humming I think the big key for Ohio State tonight on the road as you said is the current terrelle pryor loose the last three times the Buckeyes have been on the road and Big Ten play they've only averaged 17 pass attempts they've been very conservative coach Tressel opting to rely on the defense and special teams tonight that he had the confident to turn throw prior lose after such a great game throwing the ball a careerhigh 334 yards last week against the anyway look more in command hurry did the Badgers have the weapons to drive punches for the Buckeyes I think they do Brent I think most people think about what Todd needs in front of a running game got holding their quarterback shows that they have balance they can go the football I think that's important of that Ohio State defense then you look at the back for Wisconsin this year John slay last year's big tent offers the Player of the Year and a little bit dinged up and the freshman is been sensational James White out of corner so far this year has been a great compliment because of his quickness to the more powerful John Clay but I think the balance tonight will be very very important for with confidence Jim Tressel legal and big games in the conference table on the night game for the Badgers well I think the fact that this game is in Madison the Camp Randall in front of the student section definitely gives the Badgers hope to be able to pull off the upset because this crowd can affect the defense and also affect Ohio State's offense negatively as burns their communication upfront and trying to make their ball game faces are on partner the crowd ready to explode as the Badgers file out of that tunnel and the new number one the Ohio State Buckeyes determined to prove to one and all that that's where they belong the kickoff is coming up next on ESPN in college football primetime presented by Hampton hotels the newlyappointed the Buckeyes have embraced the hype of a realistic run to the title game but against the number 18 Badgers tonight in prime time that title picture can be changing by the end of the night Erin Andrews is down below with Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema so let's go to Erin now grant thanks so much turnovers killed you against Ohio State last year I know you've been harping on that all week long whiskey and taking care of the ball against this defense well good decisionmaking ball security could be with a guy running with the ball and also the guy throwing the ball so Scott's been aware of that we've been pretty good here as of late we just got to carry forth what we've been doing talk about your defense what effects well briar game have you asked them to maybe key in on tonight well you know last week was a little different game for him you know so figure out what they're doing and I'll be able to have the answers and go off field on third down are you well let's follow up on exactly what aaron was asking about if you go back to last year's game in Columbus the Badgers dominated everything accepts the finals for but take a look at the bottom of that graphic special team two defensive touchdowns Ohio State with three to pick sixes and a kickoff return turned it around completely and so here Jim Russell will see his defense out Furley tonight as the Badgers won the toss and they will take the football to begin the game interesting to see Wisconsin front of this crowd you think they might want to try to pin the Ohio State back get the defense out on the field and try to affect terrelle pryor and get the ball in the second half but it against against the grain there to see Bret Bielema saying let's take the football and attack this Ohio State defense so trouve so the young distance kicker if you will for the Buckeyes will put the ball on the tee and will be under hood Curtis making the trip from Columbus so subtly and everybody it's going to be a noisy night in Madison and it's a pleasure to have you along with us with another wonderful Saturday in college football in Mora hit us you under way David Gill race from the three twentyfive thirty thirtyfive explodes it peels attempts to repair the opening to go for six he'll take it to the house 97 yards David Hilary the senior from Minneapolis Bret Bielema bran talks about how important it is for guys to make plays in this kind of game and how about the very first place coach Fiona gets exactly what he wants from David Hillary's huge return Philip gross for the extra point it was so quick that Ryan Wikus burg had to find his helmet to dash out on the field he pulls it and it's kind of nothing Ohio State special teams have been a Akili feel to the Buckeyes all year remember Miami head Lamar Miller take one back for a touchdown in week two and Hillary gets a few golf but guys out of their Lane picked up and hit the theme and the Ohio State not having the speed to be able to catch up to the very very quick David Hillary the boy what a way to set the tone for the Badgers with the opening kickoff at home grace locks up cloth and jewelry hit that steam and he didn't slow down could be just to follow up on what you were saying about the special team woes for Jim Tressel couple of field goals blocked the punt has been blocked out to kickoff returns for a touchdown not to mention a punt return and they start out that way here in medicine very uncharacteristic of Jim Tressel team creep off but usually goes on the road and he tries to make sure that special teams are buttoned up and the defense is ready to win the field position battle and now first play hilary's makes them pay and takes it all the way to their home in Madison functioning at San Jose State back on the field good for the Badgers maybe delivers on the opening kickoff 87 yards now it's 12 seconds later whilst with the kickoff and come out to the Buckeyes on that far side east of the 29 yard line and so Herbie there comes to wrote fire you and I certainly watched the game in which he exploded on the national scene beating Oregon to the Rose Bowl I think that was his coming out party and I think this year you're really seeing a more mature terrelle pryor and a quarterback just in more command of the offense making great decisions a threat to run in to throw and as I said in the open Brett I think a big deal to Ohio State come out with an aggressive approach with their play calling or are they conservative we'll have to see looks like the shotgun to start things out moving here on the running back to his left and fire is going to throw on first down complete for a first down and he hits the beer cozy the junior from Cincinnati with the lie back and he makes the stop so offensive Lee as you might expect a very solid Buckeye contingent in here with Brandon saying stepping out as a pass receiver Aaron is more of the inside there is one of the better offensive lines in the Midwest right there it is now first intent after that pass and option look late picks to Harry over his head ball free outofbounds Buckeye football at the 30 took that two loss Braille prior and the option here the ball is actually pierced stretched and if the defensive end outside linebackers exactly what you want to do is make the quarterback gets close to the sideline he runs out of room decides to just kind of flip it and it's high and it's got a lot of speed behind it tougher boom Herron to be able to be able to secure that football and the book guys fortunate that the ball went out of bounds loss of 12 which Ohio State in a second and 22 playaction fire dumps in underneath to the fullback and that sack boring makes his first catch and Blake Sorenson to stop for the bathrooms defensively Wisconsin will line up this way and keep an eye on number 99 JJ Watt he's one of the better defensive ends in the Big Ten in shorthanded at linebacker Mike Taylor back from an injury from a year ago just the software in that secondary well I told you he's a key player the corners will have to hold up and appeal for his first play love it's third down this same victorious looks it for him and then goes down field goes up over the top and was it intercepted and completed out of bounds intended for sons and baakir but Aaron Henry the safety came over and grabbed the ball but was on the bottom I want to create effort Brent here on third down Ohio State giving throw prior enough time but Aaron Henry the former quarterback goes airborne and I know he's out of bounds but it's a great effort foot coverage it's tight a just misses getting his right toe down for that interception and guess who's back mr. Guillory he will return this puck then Buchanan jewelry's could have take a crack at it to the 35 stakes that echo has gone down yet tonight what it is pushed out of bounds at the 41 brand insane downfield on the coverage the Badgers jump out ahead of the number one team by a touchdown well the Badgers come in five and one and what about Scott Rosine only loss of the season uppity slant in against Michigan State Colton I think his efficiency very important for the Badgers I think tonight cousins are going to have to be able to throw on the early downs to get back to setting up their favorites running game is John play behind him and clay will come to the left this was the play that the offensive coordinator told us he'd run because that's who we are if we take a look at another outstanding offensive line but of course that's nothing new here in Madison then you take a look at the young men who will operate behind it Nicktoons with a turf toe and he's a key white out Lance Kendricks is a wide receiver who is now a down field threat as a tight end and there is that front pool and I mean they are good second down and six in the middle first down and they gash the Buckeyes that time before Watts omen makes the south they have a jet suite coming around just to freeze the linebackers just enough and that's exactly what happened to Brian roll see this all over the country sometimes quarterbacks to be handing it off in the Jets leave other times they fake it just to hold a backside linebacker and John Clay the coaches had been challenging him the last couple weeks he's healthy now and they wanted to see him start to run with some authority so far off to a good start the first couple parents and as you know Paul Chris he loves that Jets treat that's a big part of the offense or they sit still this time he comes right back behind the road breakers not defensively for the eyes and arguably this is the best defense in the big ten this year Cameron Heyward 97 you might want to keep an eye on him folks he'll move around that defensive front Brian roll and Rox Holman are both tackling machines is a secondary check wall all Big Ten performer on the corner Devon Torrance also enjoying to give you a Wert is down extreme first down and Nicktoons makes the first catch for him and Jermel times with the tackle nice job by towles bean and this is what you need to do just to keep the safeties in the defensive backs the corners respecting that you have this in your repertoire not just about the running game with wisconsin towles een completing about 70% of its passes coming in you touched on Nicktoons you add in jewelry Lance Kendricks might be the best pass passcatching tight in another way in the big bin one of the tops in the country so they've got enough weapons on the outside to make defenses like Ohio State have to respect that element yes a Buckeye through the yarn look again and play it close across the 15 yard line this young man where's number 32 and there's a penalty fly again now I want to quickly tell you why you where's 30 his father was a huge fan of Jimmy Brown the Cleveland Brown Hall of Famer and the young man learned at his father's leave what a great running back Brown is and that's why he wears that number there are two fouls on the play after the play personal foul number 34 on the offense personal foul number seven on the defense so Falls offset that was Ewing for the Badgers and Hinds for the Buckeyes great blocking up front and you know early in this game you're going to have some emotions flying Ohio State a little bit frustrated Ewing getting in there at hind anytime you shoot it right in front of the official after the whistle that's an obvious obvious penalty but how about Wisconsin's offensive line right now the mind you're talking about controlling the line of scrimmage and giving John clay plenty of room to operate play is still there in that deep set on first intent of the redzone they come behind bucks down Badgers go on to scores on the number one this offensive line continues to dominate and he doesn't kiss touch couple Ohio State's linebackers kind of whipping trying to get around the line but it's very tough with the linebacker you start to try to get around a big offensive lineman and they're just turning them away from the ball carrier is very easy for John play that time iron all the way into the end zone Welsh Tech's on the extra point the Buckeyes have been stunned on the road in Madison well right after he scored that touchdown look at the former Heisman Trophy winner that's Ron Dayne coming up to congratulate play long that drive carried five times for 51 yards the numbers carved into his head those are the numbers of his offensive linemen he had that done yesterday wells put the kickoff and Jordan Hall comes out for the Bucks to the 25yard line for me let's take a look at our chickfila drive recap Wisconsin the way they control things on a stick plays 58 yards 51 of them on the ground by John Clay and it's because of Wisconsin's offensive line look at the blocking on front great game designed by Paul Chryst the offensive coordinator Ohio State to nine some of the blocks to safety slow to come up in fill and right now there's no question about it early in this game the Badgers is taking it too high oh say much more physical both Karen and Seine fire just keeps it all the way and nobody lays a hand on him until he reaches the 47 yard line and is finally shoved out of bounds this is a very important drive for terrelle pryor and Ohio State on the road down by 14 hostile environment some good blocking downfield thousand Bakker trying to stay with the corner that time does a good job and it's what Pryor is going to have to do for Ohio State now obviously down by 14 not just his ability to throw the ball but when he can scramble and create with his feet he picked up 22 Herron leaves st. is a running back next room there's a quick flash screen and that is something back there his first reception is Vico Therese Davis Pro knocked a breeze Brett Taco Bell studio update a record most points ever scored in regulation in the game involving SEC teams and Michael Dyer revolvers guts the Razorback deep end as the final now Auburn went 65 to 43 did I hear you say 65 43 grace what's happened to the defenses in the essay mmmma prior backfires incomplete intended for Posey great coverage by Fidelis Pinellas was all over in that time mr. Brent Fidelis I think doing a good job of anticipating the route terrelle pryor trying to telegraphing the ball he brakes on the ball very very quickly but that's just knowing what to expect on second down and short to medium and being up both to the line of scrimmage and not giving too much of a pushes to the veer opposed a good coverage dead time Ella third Andrew southern for prior in the Box going to take off the credit run port Tiny's pour it when you see terrelle pryor in person you would think if you didn't know that he's a defensive end he is that big he in camp Newton right can I the New Age of quarterbacks puts the other linebackers clear out Brett I think terrelle pryor recognized that right away and thought I can get there with my speed he kind of aborted the drop aboard of the route so all the linebackers clear out and picked up the first down plus the 45 yard line throwing on first down hits good time for the offensive line and then an errant throw incomplete Posey was in the neighborhood find out what kind of composure terrelle pryor has where he's on the road he's down by 14 number one ranking all the hype all the buildup for Jim Tressel on the Buckeyes David Gilreath returns the opening kickoff this stadium's ready to collapse it's shaking lift drive they move right down the field and the Stewart Pryor has right now he's down 14 he'll kind of compose her boys he has they punched receivers steps in that direction fires back in the middle incomplete and again it was cozy so far you know hurt me rushing the ball it's been all prior here for the box watch close me on the back side he's got to be able to feel the linebackers and just kind of settle down he did not give his quarterback any room to work with the team would have settled down and about that first the right hash mark it would have given to her out prior plenty of room to be able to throw over the backside it was a big window on the opposite but he continued and he almost couldn't selfinterests goes out on 3rd and 10 and a great grant just shy of a first down by Sampson Bakker and they're going to give him a good spot on it it looks like as you see the ball being put down if the yellow marker is right on the line and let's change that to stone burner who made this great catch off the injured list let me correct myself that falls down the ground will not be ruled incomplete they'll take a look at that I think the tip for the ball hit the surface prior trying to get to the line fast but I think he'll probably softest they did not and here comes no home if there's a penalty flag let's see if the communicator was trying to get the attention of the officials the line judge quickly threw that flag and stopped it prior to the stamp and prior to any foul that might have been committed the previous play is under further review Jim Augustine was getting the signal down to the field that Dan calf Ron's crew they got it down in time and the Buckeyes as Herbie told you were quickly trying to get the next snap there doesn't seem to be much question about this as the ball right on the end of it comes up in his arms and that will be ruled incomplete by Jim Augustine here upstairs I believe yeah you're right Brent about great effort by stoner to be able to reach out and be able to hold on to the football but when you get a view you get a second look at this you can clearly see that the nose of the football is he extended himself he's reaching out trying to hold on to it but when the nose touches the ground like that that's going to be an incompletion set up a fourth down and of course now it becomes an issue they'll take it back to the original line of scrimmage so they'll bring it down to the back to the down cause it'll be ruled incomplete so just a refreshing you remember sometimes I even forget that not coaches challenge with instant replay but every play is being reviewed in the college game there's a communicator who signals them down on the field and then they continue to look at it upstairs here they make the decision and they pass it on long to the crew down below tomber being back in the lineup just to talk about him physically heat gives ohio state had tied in who can actually get vertical he's a wide receiver in high school and you could see his hands there you know it's probably going to come back you can see he's pretty athletic pretty nimble he's out with an ankle so him getting back in the lineup a big weapon for Tyrell prior to try to use you know how well the Badgers have used tight ends small have another great well guess who's here tonight being recruited by Wisconsin one Nick O'Leary now there are fans in Columbus you know immediately who I'm talking about it's Jack Nicklaus is Branson and blaze for Dwyer high school down in South Florida down in West Palm Beach he and a couple of his teammates including the quarterback who you saw in the Herbstreit game Cincinnati in that controversial game another good player like being recruited by absolutely you know Bret Bielema does such a good job of recruiting in Florida as an assistant coach and a coordinator winning for Kansas State in Iowa and even Wisconsin until review the receiver did not have firm control of the ball for sound please reset the game clock 25 right call and that is the beauty yes I know that sometimes the delays seem a little pain going sometimes been perfectly honest did he take too long to make the decision but the key thing that you want get it right the chain could already move and it already signaled it for a first down so now they're trying to figure out where the where the ball should be and making sure they get everything lined up properly I think they can bring back another 5 yards didn't the referee say yes they're going to bring it back another 5 he said the bully in Yardley which is what Jimmy Augustine told them upstairs and so it'll be buchanan cunning and David Gill returning in case you were watching another game just joining us now for a short time Gilbert's returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and they're like a turf catch on this punt at the 11 yard line we'll take a break the number one team in the nation by ohio state buckeyes trails by 14 and 10 now for the badgers there is big play John Clay 255 pounds junior from Racine slipping in his slide on that carry now this is a note here Herbie as far as the Buckeyes are concerned the last time they have given up 14 points in the first quarter they lost that game you know what else is interesting they were ranked number one in the country in that game when they lost to Illinois but an interesting parallel we'll keep an eye on things as it goes on but it's a long way to go in his football game Pryor has a chance to get Ohio State back in and they switch running backs and James White the pressroom from st. Thomas Aquinas in Fort Lauderdale your first look at him here tonight for eight yards check law makes this table there's a young man who's been a difference maker for the Badgers great quickness Brent in the vision for a young back feel the flow the offensive lines getting a good push this offense is designed wore off and really for James White on the cutback design cut back to back side blocks do a good job of just trying to get Ohio State's defensive linemen on skates pushing them from right to left and a wife recognizes that little jump cut back to the right and picks up big yards step toes aim with a third and two for the offense white stays on the field try to get the first down and he does with a second effort first down his head up by 14 you can't be surprised at what Wisconsin is doing right now keep the change and move the clock and he pounded a man it you know what we had Stanford earlier this year the three tide in sets and talked a lot about Jim Harbaugh old constant to me is a little bit different but they're going to get into their three tight incest but they are going to be physical they're committed to running the ball but they also can pull it out with the same personnel grouping and throw the football to a very talented group the Tynan they flush it to the outside to Nicktoons his second reception and he picks up nine as we go to restate Missouri's French port Center right now brought to you by discover Iowa 15th in the country beat Michigan 38:28 Ricky sandy Darrell Johnson colleano's hooked up for three touchdowns Robinson won four 143 yards and two touchdowns on the ground Game two of the ALCS Yankees down five again but running out of time for a rally Rangers have a 72 lead trying to even the series at a game apiece and here Reese Wisconsin has jumped out to a two touchdown advantage over the wrong team Iowa State white trying to work his way toward that first down marker Nathan Williams the junior makes the stop for Jim Tressel's Buckeyes confident they're going to run the ball and I'm going to keep you honest they throw two passes tonight early in his day it's a quick little pass a quick pass to the outside of the receiver again keep those defensive backs out there keep them away from the running game and then get back to run the ball you feel like they're starting to squeeze down fire another one out to the outside it's kind of a reading and reacting to what the Ohio State defense is doing Ewing in the game and white is an excellent receiver also this time they give it to him again however on the ground and no more than a guard against that Buckeye defense moment makes the stop on wipe I have States defensive line which has been a strength of pro high o state for many years really being challenged tonight they're going to try to rotate as many bodies then as they can to try to keep the blockers off of players like Ross Holman and Bryan roll to allow them to be able to make plays instead of eight or nine yards downfield they've got to try to penetrate it create some short yards or even negative put towles een has completed both his passes here tonight suck it down and nine he moon is whiter than the other side he's looking for the right fires high complete dangerous throw got away with it Isaac Anderson the senior from Minneapolis who attended Blake high school picks up another first down and it's a good thing the whole team threw this on time because Turmel Hine almost came up with a big play to get Ohio State back into this game Hines jumps the route but because Polzin threw it on time and to the outside away from the defender he was able to get away with this seven first downs for the Badgers already first down they pound ahead and James white brought down by Cameron Hayward it's pretty physical in the trenches Hayward's in their battling trying to make it play that time when he lowered the boom on the true freshman in Hayward at about 290 pounds the leader upfront for the Buckeyes and I'm fighting off of a doubleteam and knocking James wipedown see the size play checks back in the 255 pounder replaces he gets the first call middle got another first down so the little breather on the sidelines he comes back refresh and he bounces to the 40 keep an eye on 77 cyclers a guard the right guard gets up to Ross home and he's been doing that the entire game he's trying to hold on to his doubleteam and respect that and in once he feels that his partner is able to secure that first block he's able to get up to the second level and lock in the Ross Holman and there's nobody left there to take on John play play with 65 yards 80 total rushing already here for the batteries with number 32 and it is play to the 35 and Heinz forced to come up and make that tackle herby they are working their way with this offensive line through those defensive tackles they're opening some big holes huh 16 flings 13 runs and controlling the line of scrimmage and Ohio State on almost every snap has sometimes eight sometimes nine guys up by the line of scrimmage in the box trying to stop the 20 game and it still came second and five here comes play again in that time Hines was coming from the backfield and he was able to jam it up back there so Jimmy Haycock brought a little outside pressure that time they were able to sort of jam up the point of attack per play and he will take himself over to the sideline the answer to that not necessarily here on third down Brent but the answer if oh hi Oh state starts the Blitz the safeties that help out and run support is a little bit of playaction you fake the success of the running game and then hit Lance Kendricks behind those lines for a big pass play now white good receiver we have pointed out checked in on this third down play holding looks the other way and it will depend on the spot check draw does a fine job on Anderson that time the point of the football maybe touching the line they're not even going to bring out a measurement here's a check for that time great reaction to come up because it looked like Isaac Anderson Brent really had enough room to be able to make the catch and then get a feel for their first down timeout has been called the field stands as called fourth down this drive started back on the Badgers 811 yard the 13th slave the out zine under center straight ahead Peter Khan's as a sophomore from Neenah Wisconsin sixfive 313 times the coaches here think he's going to become outstanding Center he lived away that time for tolsey pretty nice as the quarterback would you have constant company leading your way on a quarterback sneak probably the shortest game that was constant had all day with that all offensive lines doing a good job got enough of a push there to easily allow their quarterback to pick up that first so the quarterback from Rolling Meadows Illinois 63 senior back under center here's the handoff to the young running back and that shows you why they are so fond of him Holman makes the tackle on white and the students hold up those sheets of white paper honor their freshman he has a little bit of a burst if he gets daylight he can take it I think people assume because of clay weighing in at 255 pounds and white at about 198 that he's the quick back and clay is the power back and maybe that's true to a certain extent but it's just salt right there from James white he's going to lower his shoulder and he's going to try to carry some defenders for yards Henrik's is the tight end on the right side of the formation heat flux is off they come back with white and not this time as the Buckeyes were ready Johnson Orion Johnson the sophomore from st. Petersburg Florida comes up to make the stop the fans here appreciate the effort by the Badgers in the first quarter cheers 14nothing we get started here with the second quarter and white the freshman running back players out cozy on the move wide open and that's the young man and return to kick off David Guillory scored the game's first touchdown but hang on penalty flag coming back right I think they're in late hit here on the quarterback by the defense of it broken the Panther defense number 43 the penalty will be assessed at the distance to the goal for sound to things Nathan Williams comes in late in hits towles in but the other thing is Devon Torrance on third down giving such a soft cushion to the receiver Guillory third downs you've got to tighten things up on the outside once he made the catch very very easy for him look at the Brady has to work there to make porous missed anything get upfield I know some of you disagree with that goal but remain they are really protecting these young men more than ever this year in college and in the National Football League John Clay it is the running back behind a fullback first down and goal here comes clay and struggling to get back to the original line of scrimmage if we take a look back at how specific is doing in the red zone and it's brought to you by Verizon and the Badgers have been very effective they sure have you know last week at Minnesota van is a rivalry game stick time for the red zone dick touchdown so they come into this game with a lot of confidence in a lot of momentum off of last week's game and the way John Clay is running with my would be surprised if they may be a little brute leg or playaction pass just part of the end zone it will be third down and goal inside the one yard line for the attendance going right back row same boy it's working and I thought maybe ball Chris might try to catch look at Ohio State 11 guys in tight where you fake that you maybe try to fly too tight in behind that it's probably an easy touchdown but John Clay is so successful this offensive line still getting such a big push in that time fine showing his toughness in 215 pounds meeting the big sail back there and holding him out of the end zone big third down play for his second touchdown of the night a shocker in medicine good job here at third down oh hi Oh state gets a little bit of a push but a good decision I think there by John Clay to get airborne at 255 pounds he fits up just enough and nobody wants to meet him that was very very close there looks like his extension right there gets him into the end zone but he landed very close to the goal line well adds another extra point they go 89 yards in 19 plays and it's 21 nothing Wisconsin Buckeyes need to get something on the board before the intermission now Wisconsin obviously took the ball to start the game and a big kickoff return I think for Ohio State on the road Jim Tressel tried just thinking stop the bleeding trying to come up with anything and remembering that start the second half today kind of get something going girls kicks it off and it will be fielded at the Senate here's Barry and very is out to the 32 yard line if we take a look at this week's BCS standings along with the AP and the coaches poll you can see that the humans have the Buckeyes first but you can see the projected VCS has Boise State number one and the Buckeyes number five based on strength of schedule now tomorrow we will get the first official standings and there's a good chance then still be Boise State in Oregon one to Oregon Idol this week and Boise State blames San Jose State out west believe it later time so that's your Allstate standings here with Dan Haren to the left of Terrell Pryor he gets his first carry of scrimmage and no more than a that's only the 12th offensive play jon kyl watching for the Badger bench muhtaram makes the stop for the badger you and I did in game last week down in Miami and we watched it in a game we thought would be inspiring in the Florida State Miami and one team showed up and played in fire one team was physical and that was for two state through about the first quarter and working now into the second quarter right now hi Oh state looks flat Wisconsin look more determined they look hungrier both sides of the ball that went in the battle up front the trenches you wonder how things can begin to turn for Ohio State the way things look right now fire is looking to turn things going deep down that far sideline got a man covered and there was contact over there on the play no flag Corey Brown the freshman from Pennsylvania covered by Niles Brinkley and I mean Brinkley was on him like a glove he was and Brown has great feed for a true freshman he can get behind coverage in a hurry but that is great coverage Brinkley doing a good job finds the football very keen for a defensive back locate the football and the receivers I'm brown signifying that he's looking for the ball as hands go up frankly finebut Knicks will turn no stadium in a foosball official sees that you're playing the football absolutely I was like we've got to stop each here a timeout you we are back now for third and nine it's real fire in the box he is old for his last 5 3 of 9 overall flush loser tackle reaching for the first time and he's got it as he steps out of bounds three receivers off to his left to the field is to be Rosie off to the right and I looked at that formation I thought he did severe Posey to the right scan have to make a play or four el primer is going to have to scramble this gives you an idea what he can do in the open field does it necessarily look like he's moving that fast but it's six six he those long legs he's covering a lot of ground obviously able to get away from the defensive line but even the linebackers in safety even safe have a tough time bringing him down things that's out of the backfield high are going to try to set the screen with heroin the other way crosses midfield for the 45 yard line and to who the defensive lineman back there and making the stop number 91 Jim Tressel trying to slow down with this aggressive Wisconsin defense they're feeding off of this lead in the crowd and the energy of the stadium and they've gone the first down call smart call by Jim Tressel they're trying to go back to the backside screen trying to get that with constant defense flowing to the field to follow through all prior with Kirk Herbstreit and Erin Andrews welcome you the Saturday Night Football on ESPN the number one team in the nation down three touchdowns and here is Kieran picking up a first down for the Buckeyes we're putting together the most impressive Drive of the night Claxton a backup linebacker makes the stop but the Buckeyes for the first time tonight and it was a big third in nine they converted but they are starting to move the ball a little bit you and I also talked at the break about Ohio State being down all the pressure being number one the importance of having a head coach like Jim Tressel who calls the plays not to of course the game plan try to kind of stick your guns and haven't gone well and just try to work yourself slowly and methodically back into the game but this Drive is big for hyoe State obviously the readoption prior takes it trying to get the corner and he has hooked up that was Pinellas who's made a couple of fives like the corners for the Badgers have made strong plays here in the first half that is a great play by Pinellas this is not an easy thing to do watch who's got good speed at the defensive end almost chases down Pryor makes them go to the outside but you're right Brent's divot the corners from Wisconsin they're not going to go to Indianapolis at the combine and blow you away but in this system they're just physical they're top their gritty they're willing to do a lot of the dirty work to allow the Badgers to get the rest of their defense in position to make plays second down and five big hole for a first down heron into the red zone but down by July they decided this time wisconsin decided to bring a blitz and a blitz and actually put themselves right out of position by blitzing they took a chance rolled the dice to bid on first down speed Claxton on one side coming through st. Jean the middle linebacker coming through and when they didn't make the play at the line of scrimmage there's nobody left there and that's big yard for boom Herron there in the junior from Warren Ohio gets the handoff again it finds a break that they like the end zone just short of it down to the two yard line and Fidelis again but now the Bucs are knocking on the door here in Madison for the first time tonight it's really the first time all year that Ohio State's offensive line is that a tribe where they've kind of taken the fight to a good defense like this and they're now kind of taken a page from Wisconsin's playbook saying we're going to try to get physical with you as well and try to get boom Herron to the second level without being his prior running all the way saintjean the linebacker up for the stop anytime you put the hand control the ball in the hands of terrelle pryor especially done inside a 5yard line it's always a threat to a defense maintaining that time in perfect position but like to see the ball on the right hash tip terrelle pryor that ability to get out on the edge out on the perimeter of the defense with his chance to throw the football or has covered a false and run and head to the corner suck it down and goal for Pryor try motioning out he motions out it's a wildcat it's heron back there with a fullback he'll run it to the left side and he is stopped picked up about a yard it'll bring up third and go Russell trying to get his running back to the point of attack a little bit quicker on that direct snap which is why you see so many themes using the pistol the Buckeyes have used their version of it a couple of times in this driver you line the quarterback up like four yards behind the center and the tailback right directly behind him they split him off to the side on third down and goal for Ohio State Pryor and suddenly it is portend goal Sorenson saintjean make the stop Russell electing to keep it on the ground that time rather than putting it in the air as a quarterback when you run the option when you take the football you have to have a mindset that you're going to keep the football and you're going to take it to the end zone until they take you away the grin there's two defenders there but you'd have to have an aggressive mindset and attack the defense forced him to take you away and then try to pitch it out here tailback he was very tentative there on third down 27 yearold Devin Barker to attempt this field goal and the onetime MLS soccer player puts the number one team in the nation on the scoreboard but they still trail at 21 3 doses to the Ohio State family the family of Larry Siegfried who passed away after suffering a a heart attack he was a member the best college basketball teams Gerry Lopez John Havlicek you know Jill Roberts and Larry Sifl as the Buckeyes defend that kickoff and it's time now for the Aflac trivia question why hurry who are the three quarterbacks they're all big names besides terrelle pryor since 98 now the return to school after being named the Rose Bowl MVP I'm gonna give you a hit I get to a couple of our national championships okay okay we'll give you that means big name big hit yeah well you know I'm feeling good I got you last week I know you've been excellent all year where's that antenna just got protein and the Badgers who lead it 21 three going deep got a man incomplete so Kyle Jefferson a senior number three and Taurus is the defender Brabeck and running and running that time they got a matchup with one of their better receivers isolated against your male hime who doesn't play great mantoman coverage they had in beat on an out luck they just weren't able to have to do Rosie's first incompletion battling back with babe play from the scene Wisconsin and he picks up the first down with Ron Dayne here tonight he reminds you a little bit on the way he's been running and again he is he had surgery to surgery in the offseason for his ankles weaken a little bit tended coming back this year this is a last week was a little bit of a glimpse of how he was coming back when over a hundred yards last week against Minnesota but the coaches said he's had a great week of practice and because we're James White has been stealing so many of the headlines people kind of forgot had been about John clay white replaces clay there's that flash three now for the outside in tune he picks up another let's going to restate misheard update race alright run Brent want to put our fingers on the prime time pulse NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Bank of America 500 at Charlotte here to be under caution on ABC Kyle Busch is leading Jimmie Johnson Lisa chase up by 36 points to start tonight on espn2 South Carolina is spanking Kentucky 2810 about halfway through the third and on ESPN you Dan Mullen in the swamp a 10 nothing lead on Florida midway through the second that holds up perfect did you tell me that be three straight losses for the others yeah not good news white across the line of scrimmage picking up a couple of second down below with Aaron and there is a penalty fly but let's go to Aaron anyway friend just want to give you an update while we wait on word about this penalty here Ohio State's defense after John Clay ran in his second touchdown defense came over to the sidelines throwing thing throwing cups their helmets the Buckeyes coaches came in very quickly to kind of cool them down give him a talkingto to be interesting to see how they react here on this drive heads up two guys crossing first oh one more thing Brent rock home and linebacker for Ohio State he actually had his shoe off with an ankle injury we've got to keep an eye on him tonight that was a very good linebacker they can ill afford to lose imminent in a fistfight like this which is what they're going to have the rest of the way with Wisconsin's offensive line and those running back and John Newsom now comes in and they'll move Andrew sweat over to them linebackers convinced that Roman was playing the interesting report from Erin this defense rohi o state has seven senior starters it's a veteran group now this is unchartered waters be on the road down like this but they've been around and played a lot of football so it is first and 24 toll zine and the penalty after the pen lay I should say on tune toe seen straight back takes off not going to hurt you but he wasn't going to gamble on an interception at this point of the game Williams brings him down you could see how he was securing the ball first time that Ohio State's been able to get pressure on tolls Dean and he actually instead of just firing and how quickly he actually gets back into the pocket and I think it really started with Cameron Heyward just pushing John Moffitt back into the pocket and it forced towles Dean to bail and get out of there and then eventually Nathan Williams brought him down inside of five minutes first half Badgers lead the Buckeyes 21 to three returning the opening kickoff for a touchdown closing the senior now with a quick change' at the line on second and 15 as plenty of time chosen interception picked up by sweat and he has given the Buckeyes a chance at the 40yard line the late flag came in there as well Brent where if it's a late hit over there a bit of a scrum over there on the far side you can see the coaches immediately stepping in Aaron just talked about Ross Holman being out of the game and sweat his moves position John Newsom is in there it's better on to a new position steps up and makes it shiny play privacy Wow late hit Wisconsin number 84 15yard penalty first down Ohio State that's their tight end Kendricks guilty of this sweat is off to the left just barely he could barely stand it speaking of barely thing and I don't know it's got toll teen I don't think saw him at all he threw that right into the chest of sweat who makes a huge play and still sweat hasn't played a lot of football this year Brett the main reason they've been playing so much nickel tonight he's gonna have to play a lot more hello I tried I tried I didn't see that personal foul either regardless Simon Baca coming around the left side looked to me like the tide in was going to the ground and rolled into somebody on that replay that was a very tough call against the Badgers regardless here we go second down looked like he kind of kept block his momentum rolled rolled him out take another look at the end of this now remember it's on 84 he's been blocked down on the ground rolls in that ball the official didn't see how it began that he was stumbling and falling to the ground so regardless second down and nine now for Ohio State prior mid all incomplete posy number eight that is preferred targets an Jabari they're the two wide receivers that he likes to go to a new situation clear down here hurry Brent I think email locked in that time to severe Posey because look at 12,000 Baca working behind the linebacker Co a break 3 put it in a tight window but a much easier throw than throwing it underneath there's a beer closer must reach the 30yard line and timeout has been called that's the Badgers who was my mom's up timeout being behind the stakes get even higher you surprised pickups third down and nine 29 yard line that was jj1 and what a story this young man is what's a tight end over Central Michigan transferred back walked on and here is and the right tackle JB shoe guard just whipped on third down and long shoe guards just misses what you gotta expect an outside move shoe Garcia's surprised into quickness to the size of jj1 it's 295 pounds he went right around him so here comes the Barclays field goal attempt a 45 yarder no going the Badgers have returned to kickoff for a touchdown now they survived a field goal as he slides it to the left it is still almost constant hard for the JJ walk to the world and now wipe the runningback pounds straight ahead and here come the Badgers again the Bryan roll making the stop I couldn't say enough about JJ why and the story it's amazing you're right and to see the passion that he plays with how much the game means to him and on that third downs you could just see the energy kind of coming out of his body as he was able to get by the Ohio State offensive tackle and just went right by it on third down you know who I was thinking of what he did that Jared Allen yeah good call same passion second down and three Rosine takes the screen and weight picks up the first down and that clock continues to move that missed field goal was so big for Wisconsin and a hurt Ohio State so much they got the big interception remember the late hit was real controversial gave them 15 more yards good field position cut out what Jim Tressel wanted to see maybe to get into 21 to 10 with the ball to start the second half Wisconsin forces the field goal they miss it now the Badgers are back out here on the field still trying to look for points in at the very least work this clock down and the clock continues to tick right for the breeze on that right side stop made by roll again I estates rushing defense being challenged in a big way obviously that's the talent and the offensive lineman facing the best that they had seemed coming in they'd only allowed 78 yards to came on the ground already not even a half time over a hundred yards rushing the team has gone 29 straight games without allowing a hundred yard rusher that also has almost been reached by play with 88 yards in the first half that chat in the round jewelry and Gil Reese is pushed out of bounds there is a penalty flag back on the 45 check logs it's the runner out of bounds holding offense number 84 10yard penalty second down that's Kendricks we lost in to Sean Newsome who has stepped in for cross Holmen before who's become really a physical rocker that time he just got locked up with Newsome but Lance Kendricks a wide receiver would move to tied in it's kind of their H back here he's had a couple penalties not go his way here but he is a fine looking tied in and with a line of tight ends that they've had here Owen Daniels in the NFL here at Graham last year Travis Beckham and if you play tied in it was hunted kids are you going to the NFL Greg emo will try to run the clock out here in the first half suck it down 15 drops off basically a high percentage screen pass to white man let's check in with rece Davis bred coming up on the Wendy pasttime report will show you how I awoke out and able to keep shoelace all tied up Arkansas and Auburn in an SEC record shootout you won't believe how the Tigers stayed undefeated and a texassized upset I guess you could say that the Longhorns gave the Cornhuskers a fabulous parting gift if they head off to the big 10 will talk to Mack Brown it's all coming up that ivory sent here surprisingly trussell going to let the clock run down did not choose up a timeout as white is wrestled to the ground with 22 seconds the Buckeye still had two left so obviously Trussell and if I Kai's want to regroup just as well I think it looks like maybe they're trying to stop it here but I'm surprised I don't know 45 to 50 seconds two timeouts left third and 15 Wisconsin's just trying to work the clock down use your two timeouts on third and fourth down and who knows maybe give terrelle pryor a chance to move the ball down the field get in field goal range we want to remind everybody about Monday night now you'll get to see Chris Johnson he'll be running for the Tennessee Titans Maurice jonesdrew running for Jacksonville was a young man I want to tell you about blame for Tennessee his name is Mark Mariani he's out of hammer Montana he walked on at the University of Montana for two years without a scholarship last week he beat the Dallas Cowboys with a 73 yard kickoff return two weeks before that he went 98 yards for the touchdown kickoff return against Denver coach Jeff Fisher watching his son play for the Griz and he picked up a number 7 truck choice everybody thought it was just gonna be with a buddy there his son haha that young man can play I'm glad you pointed the everpresent haven't know you've never been at home no hammers very close to the Canadian border up on that High Line eight million little for small towns up there little eight we can go home here comes Brad Norton nobody badly beat bucks all upfront Kapila with caught a timeout timeout with Cantus get his team to find a couple playmakers to help him out here nobody back again Brent into the end zone with six seconds well if this holds up Oregon is idle if it holds up will it be the Buckeyes and Boise I mean I should say Oregon and Boise State one and two look at look at TCU they they won their game movies BYU anything interesting Oregon plays UCLA on Thursday night Kim Boise State because of Nebraska losing Oklahoma is up big right now you don't know if they can close the gap but could Boise State kind of break the ceiling and get up into the top two of the ap2 Harrison coaches college in Ohio State Luther that's exactly right early we still got a half a football to go come on back see if Jim Tressel can bring the Buckeyes back and definitely is the most important drive of the year for Ohio State their offense and our hopes to try to get back into this game but if you look at it as an individual there's never been more on a drive and for all flyers career than right here so here we go at the goal line and come out in Jordan Hall former high school teammate of Tyrell priors well Herbie there's been all of the criticism as we take a look at what the kicking team didn't do for the buck I had a long look at number two he'll have to throw as well as get the running game going one step at a time and for being you made such a key point about chimp Russell in the first half he's certainly not a coach at this stage of who's going to panic as you take a look at the summary that we have the Badgers to scoring drives 25 plays 147 yards you can see the the Buckeye offense there how sluggish it has been a couple of punts early in the game and they allowed 138 rush yards and I see Herbie that we have an injured player Jordan Kahoot of Wisconsin is is down nobody has forced more turnovers the big 10 the Ohio State Buckeyes absolutely and it's going to have to happen if they have a chance of coming back in this game in the second half you can look at one of eight on passes of five yards or more so not a lot of success downfield tonight for Pryor he moves in that defensive call and there is one again and insane comes in look at the size of those myths third down and eight plenty of times no receiver now in trouble again and what is picked off and that allowed terrelle pryor to complete the past at dane sands and baakir the senior from toledo boy great patience by terrelle pryor looks like JJ Watt got off so quick look at that right with the football Schubert's does his best actually doubleteam in that time with Bryan browning but it's where I think Terrell priors really matured as a quarterback he didn't panic most importantly as he's buying time Brent he kept his vision downfield and events eventually found his man Danny Haren back in as the running back and he picks up a strong 7yard Sorenson makes a stop incidentally Mike Taylor the starting linebacker for the Badgers we get word injured knee he may or may not return he missed much of last season because of that injury then a young man by the name of Borland suffered another shoulder injury and so there without him they should watch the linebacker there on the sidelines not wearing his helmet not a good sign second down for the Bucks first out on the heroin run you and I talked about it start to have look at the score you think 21 and three into the second half not a lot of time for Ohio State get back in a game and we continue to go back to Jim Tressel and his his his ability to remain calm in this kind of situation not abort the game plan stick with what you think you can get done with the running game and eventually get back to throw prior in the passing game and his creativity do you take it away from trying to still run that football clipping his Karin and he could not get away from Sorensen sure prior when he drops back the throne second down and nine now Pryor is going to back out got a man wide open and a great rabbis Panza Bakr Dayne songs and Bakker goes up and pulls it down as he broke wide open that was a good play by the quarterback and the receiver Brett and it's a play like this take time look how long this route is you have one receiver just clearing the defensive back and then the other receiver from the inside making his move to the outside it takes a long time the line this time they did a good job and Butch on almost get there to be able to deflect the football but the line held up and gave Pryor the time to make the throw from this 26 yard line boom Herron picks up about half a yard Sorensen again making their stuff these Wisconsin linebackers right at the snap of the football they're they're reading their keys and they're attacking downhill the last few plays when a high o state is lined up in a certain formation saintjean on one side thorn sit on the other Kevin Claxton really attacking downhill trying to take away the ability to run the football by but here at Ohio State same checks in so we'll follow him and the same makes a good steel block and it's a first down for the Buckeyes so how about number three stealing it up and watch to row yeah great block by Seine and also to the top right of your screen Posey makes a good block on a corner pinellas just got just enough made him collapse kind of submarine gym and it gave I think throw Pryor enough room to be able to fight for that first down so this is the first drive of the second half and the eyes have taken it to the Badger 13 yard line for a first and ten was to who headed off after being injured loud as part of the stadium they're going right into the chief or that student section and now they put Herron in the Wildcat terrelle pryor up at the top of your screen and here comes Herron looking for daylight endzone touchdown Ohio stay second time tonight the gym crustle has called that fly in the red zone how about how physical boom Herron is here is a defensive tackle that gets inside and gets penetration that was 87 he mur at boom Herron undersized at about 510 200 pounds just gave him a stiff arm and then continued on t got away from him er good job of blocking on the left side and got it into the end zone Devin Bartley so the Buckeyes deliverers drive just talked about how important was to Ohio State for terrelle pryor get into 21 said they did what they needed to do now with the defense answered the bell to be able to stop this concepts of running the ball game off perfect the second half stage one with the ball on the table on the bouncer comes Guillory 27yard everybody gets of the NFL countdown presented by IBM on ESPN Sunday the 11 Eastern Chris Berman will have updates Bach and get conservative when they keep attacking Ohio State their first play these type of behind the lightest Christian walk comes in from his defensive back spot that makes the stop play with a huge first half but those of you who just joined us at the top of the hour Wisconsin exploded for 21 unanswered points and clay rushed for 86 yards in that first half and scored a couple of touchdowns and when it comes to the sideline that means that the 510 hundred ninety eight pound freshman or Lauderdale Florida James White he leads this team an allpurpose yardage that we have not seen returned a kickoff here tonight that we usually from straight 13 feet man coverage on the outside keep it up at looking to get after it comes back inside and he did just that Harvey Nicktoons the son of a ow inmate sister who plays on the Michigan volleyball team so the teams are very busy during the winter there's a handoff now to white and neither stop Altoona Coast was a legendary receiver here in Madison you can see what he accomplished here and now his son is chasing some of those marks that pop said Paul Chryst did not say enough about Altoona is a father he said he is such a good dad comes from practice but he didn't take anybody aside to tell anybody how to play the game he's just a father sport of his children and he was very complimentary suck it down and seven and third and short as we check in with rece Davis Reese all right Grayson here at his third down and two for the Badgers lead at 21 ten short good defensive stand by the Buckeyes that time as John Clay had checked back in and Andrew sweat who intercepted the pass made the stop absolutely avoided he threw a great job here on third and short andrew sweat fights off the block and think about how much the offensive line was able to dominate the linebackers watch 42 right in the middle able to fight off that block and then get underneath the ball carrier and keep him short of the first down that's a bigtime play there by sweat Jordan Hall is back deep Norton in the Punic Jordan where he beat everybody away from it and it will be down at the 6 yard I hear a white surround Pryor firing up his troops slammed his helmet to the ground and delivered the message let's saddle up and go again and here comes to round himself picking up 8 yards on that carry shave ally makes the stop for the last time Ohio State had eyes off it back out of field move it second down and 2 and here is Herron being rustled but not before he picks up the first down st. Jean trying to stop him and couldn't one of those games where things like every series we're talking about this series is big and this series is big and I think when you're number one you're on the road and you get down by 21 and almost gets into that mode where every series becomes imperative for both Wisconsin it's a big stop for Wisconsin on this driving also for Ohio State you imagine if they're able to cut this to 2117 what's that Purdue to Wisconsin after having such a big lead low snap hand off the herring good hands that kind bike throw fires he made the handoff and Sorenson three wide and a fullback in this formation Pryor slashes underneath the Posey and they'll spot that ball I believe for a first down as we check in with rece Davis for an update courier for the first time ever amazing that there is a penalty flag the Empire calling holding I believe and boom Herron is battling through meanwhile or be in a game that we are certainly interested in the outcome unbeaten Oklahoma rolling over Iowa State 31 to nothing number 55 offense 10yard penalty for sound next week Oklahoma has to go to Columbia Missouri for a battle of the unbeatens as Justin borne is called for holding and after what happened today I think tit with Mack Brown infected getting all over Nebraska all the sudden all the attention falls on Bob Stoops and the Oklahoma Sooners as far as trying to make a run and I'm sure he's undefeated but Oklahoma is up near the top five in the country undefeated with Nebraska take it a step back they become the team to people Stane alongside glass most in 19 whoops a tackle and makes it for the 26 yard line it will be second down and long Kanellis up to make the stop on terrell mr didn't like nearly as effective at the runner in the open field second or 11 in back to pass diving reception for the first down by posing both Karen handstand on to this club keep it in the air prior group of signs and baakir working that far sideline again and pinellas and in these two drives what stands out are the passes the terrelle pryor starting to throw it really looks like he's in command right now making some great great throws I think bran insane moving out to receiver a little bit confused there with his route but it did not affect the role player in day in thousand bakker in a rhythm right now these first two guys in the second half will Hollis they seem to be gaining in confidence play page complete to Haran much of the gain is Sorensen's up to make the stop on the running back not getting away from that running game doing just enough for mixing in the one with the past at getting flyer again me that much more festive throw the ball a half in the third and there is that one player hurry just as you said he's not giving up on the run stop her down name is on the field delays and comes out in terrelle pryor takes off goes it back middle and in cuts i stanza backer for a first down made something happen shades of anthony gonzalez troy smith anthony gonzalez back 206 unbelievable effort here with constant trying to bring him down he does the cardinal sin you never throw back after you scramble to the outside but because he had his man his man and I think it's because thousand Baca that time does a good job again to be able to find a football going to make excess songs about her were three fine catches this fiber rope are what he does so very well picking up eight on that first down is the final seconds tick away student body by ready to jump around here in medicine but they're going to jump around with a little unease as terrelle pryor is bringing them down and the big defensive lineman is coming back it's Georgia who jump around I'm in medicine fourth quarter take a look at the Ohio State Buckeyes started chopping around he's thrown a halfback pass and he is run we have to battle for their first down and Claxton makes us not hurry let's go back to 2008 when we were here remember 2008 throw prior really this is the first time he was tested he was a true freshman had taken over that year for Doc Beckman Ohio State's down by four they needed touchdown he leads them on a 12play Drive late in the game for the eventual gamewinning touchdown he was familiar with his happens beer a familiar with trying to execute when the pressure gone he did that as a true freshman Olie he's the yard on third down Aaron gets it easily giorgia Paul back on the field and they line him up in the Wildcat remember he has been able to throw it he'll throw again looking couldn't find receivers for takeoff the 13yard line I'm glad you brought up his ability to throw the football because I think it affected Wisconsin they knew what to expect because of the throw back earlier this year and almost set up like a like a draw I get quarterback draw Wisconsin respected his ability to throw the ball so much and you know that they've been looking at that look all week that when seven takes the direct snap get ready but it opened up clears the area there for him to pick up good dog second aim for the guy is inside the ten is Bret Bielema three all the way down to the end of the field wanted a mouse and the book eyes we have dominated the third quarter for this set in front of hair playaction fake prior keeps it himself tries to get the edge short of the first down and Sorenson was over there pal I helped jam the play up at the point of attack and Sorenson brings him down ray call Brent pillai to the top of the screen to safety he's going to try to fight and hold off the best big ban against browning but the fact that he got to the outside and kind of set the edge that fort pearl fires back to the inside which is exactly what the rest of the Wisconsin defense led by Blake Sorenson was waiting for Russell did not throw the ball earlier in the first half when he got down here on third and the stupid he does here leading 3 keeps it on the ground we got the first down Aaron right over the top and it will be first and goal for the Buckeyes whatsits Ohio State offensive line tonight when they've needed to come up with some tough yards at crucial moments give them a lot of credit because they've got a good push and there is Zach born again getting at the block that he needs to tick off on the linebacker to free up the running back to pick up the first down but the offensive line much the line offensive line is I'm doing their job tonight against goal line it will be herring again behind the left side and it will be second down and goal but seven straight running plates for the buck make an eighth straight touchdown on Kerry Mike Adams and Justin born on the left side the left tackle and the left guard from Dublin Ohio and Pinkerton Ohio they blow it open how neat is it for Justin born the senior who transferred from Michigan to have his younger brother Zach born the leading fullback and if your boom Herron you follow 65 and 44 in the promised land every single time in short yardage now is he going to try to get it on the drink boom Herron checking the playbook Russell had come out to the 25yard line we've got his offensive personnel out there right now he'll try to get it on the three go for two years prior going to pull back fire backside the twopoint conversion read Pringle his first catch of the night they are back to within three two possessions two touchdowns and a twopoint conversion at the Quaker Steak and lube and all the other wonderful pubs in Madison Wisconsin I can imagine that everyone is glued to their TVs right now there is no bigger series than the one coming up for the Badgers they've been dominated so far here in the second half and now the Buckeyes have closed to within three from the one David Guillory now the balance on that far side we take a look at tonight's extraordinary performances on this eventful Saturday again Texas a 10point underdog with the Lincoln and shot Nebraska 180 now Scott tolls een has James White at the I bet they're going to play fake and they're going to put it up on first down he throws in underneath the brady ewing his fullback andrew sweat where we talked about andrew sweat and why he's making so many plays here tonight i think he is shown a great deal of versatility tonight he started on the strong side as a linebacker really lined up mainly across from the tight end and now because of the injury to Ross Holman he has made most of his plays on the weak side playing Ross Coleman's position and that's forced John Newson to take over for sweats original spot tonight but really a lot of versatility and really a first true opportunity to play a lot of football tonight second and three for tolls into the Badgers another blanch we're going to put it back up white the intended receiver and we check in with rece Davis for an update and here reached the number one team in the nation trying to come all the way back once down 21 nothing and they slip it through and Nicktoons for the first down what a big play big third down and it's Nick stones on up again check well look at the line of scrimmage I think check hole was surprised he got caught off guard he never had a chance in the beginning of that play soon got off the line of scrimmage without being jammed it freed him up to get downfield and once he got off the line that easily it made it very simple for hosing to find him downfield Paul Chryst is dialing up the pass girl is here with Scott tolsey they're not sitting on a thing first down and then they've got the ball across midfield John play back in the game they so quickly to the outside in that receiver Nicktoons again Pines makes the stop they were a little bit soft over there and he just flipped it to him they were soft and the linebacker 55 loose and right in the middle of the screen see how Florian even recognized the football that's what happens when you lose brought home and you put a sweat on the other side and John Newsom is a sophomore getting some of his that first time he's had a chance to play as well slow to react giving the receiver more room to work out on the outside of the defense great passing down I'm glad you're here second down and short but they elect to play it conservatively pick up the first down Johnson makes the stop for the Buckeyes talk a lot about how IO state has had to have some big drives and what gutcheck time and how are they going to respond well at Ohio State taking over and starting to dominate the second half and really a big drive for Scott Toki and this Badgers offense Buckeyes will try to hold them to a field goal Badgers will try to finish it first down across the 35 yard line you test the Wills here in the fourth quarter nine and a half minutes I mean back with clay again wet again breasts on the bottom of that pile they can play at Ohio State Jim Tressel telling Erin Andrews about the adjustments but only have to do it to be able to try to tackle better and be in position better to make plays whenever Luke fickle and Jim Haycock the defensive coordinators for Ohio State decided to do maybe they just motivated them but right now the different look in the trenches in the second half up front Pro high of stick Lance Kendricks has been very quiet he's number 84 for the factors James White good receiver back in it running back the freshman from Fort Lauderdale Guillory comes through the formation so same time first out and it the interchange white that time circling out and making the play first down and ten white stays in a four I'm back pull on the left side into the redzone Taurus with the stop for Ohio State Scott pull Dean and he said Paul Chryst the offensive coordinator from Wisconsin deciding to mix into play action by throwing a football he get back to running the football this time big hole on the left side James White's able to take advantage of that but really consoles he not talking a lot about him 12:15 tonight for 119 yards making good decisions for Wisconsin both cases second I'm for white again off the left I've got the first down sweat makes the stock so the 2headed running back in medicine plays carried 17 times in white 60 and when in doubt Brent run to the left dimes left tackle gave curry Me's office a year ago very strong and also making a 43rd start tonight and John Moffitt making his 36th start he also was allconference last year in the Big Ten and recorded USC last week hundred yard rusher again sees to talk about the confidence they have on the left side and the block for sustained upfront but let's give James line two freshmen a lot of credit you'll fresh lad put it in growth his football game for John Clay is able have kind of worked his way through that hole and then break the tackle save the puffles to get it into the end zone the Badgers will not be denied they're back out my 10 its Terrell fryers turn when you come back the Wisconsin is situated right along the southern shore of Lake Mendota this is one of the finest college towns in this country if you like to visit different venues and see college football games with down medicine must ceilings chants the dumped number one the fiveyard line is very and various top 15 28 yardline we remind everybody now join Mike Tirico in the game ESPN's Monday Night Football 30 stern it'll be Tennessee against an AFC South rival Jacksonville coverage begins at 7:00 Eastern with Monday night countdown served up by Applebee's always fun to gather around the TV on Monday night listen to the guys catch all the highlights from Sunday look ahead tee shot of the guys do a great job in the studio set the scene now Danny Haren and as the running back incomplete in his second down and 10 SEC boring the intended target right back third down and ten Torian Washington the target cool down posing the intended target we tell coach Tressel de let's go for this here on 4th down but if again third time we've seen at that time the nose of the football down creating the spin of the football to go down towards the turf and that goes three throws he just looked a little bit out of sorts let's talk about now 636 Jim Tressel's down by ten he needs two scores to tie in the Alexi or not to gamble because if they fail they would give Wisconsin just fabulous field positions we're going to put it away and Doris makes the fair catch at the 32 yard line hammer time coming up for the Badgers 6:29 with a 10point lead playaction Paul Chryst whistles up a path fires middle wide open what a play call Anderson the tight end and Heinz makes the stop and the Buckeyes were not expecting that 33 yard pass was lined up to the right the Titans to the right he's just going to kind of disguise what he's doing he clears the traffic good job by posing to step away from the pass rush a Cameron Heyward the Petersons all alone in the backside an amazing gutsy call here late by Faulk Fred we may have some schools around the big 10 or even in the big 10 looking for a new head coach I would say you're going to want to talk to Paul Chryst he's going to be a head coach someplace someday he's one of the best 1st down and 10 when you make a call like that late in the game I think it tells you a lot about how he feels about Scott Polzin is the stadium quarterback and the truck that you have to be able to make that call that's a bigtime fall late in this game like to kill the will the no hi O state defense that call no question did you pass up going for it on fourth and 10 you've got a gamble you're going to get this ball back now allow them to do this and play now is brush for 99 if we just go any other way becoming the first back to restaurants at Joe McKnight we had that game USC and go for right here he's got it passes a hundred yards memory did not gain a hundred against Michigan State that snapped his freak and that is the game the Badgers lost earlier up at East Lansing dead udderly are going to say it again the left side of Wisconsin's offensive line along with the big spinner Peter ponds too taking over these last two drives going to the veterans along with John Clay and you really need the yards that's what they've been able to come up with them and prep you told me on the field before the game we're talking about his defense or about his offense they said the Ohio State that's twenty nine game streak without a hundred yards we've got a snap back tonight that was kind of a personal challenge I think Brett put on his running back for this game here's playing tackle to the line of scrimmage I will tell you whether there are a lot of folks about to get real excited we were there Eugene Oregon couple weeks ago they could come to one in the human polls if the Ohio State Buckeyes lose this game and remember on Thursday they got UCLA absolutely a bad way to spend your off week if you're Chip Kelly and your Darron Thomas and the Micra James sit back and watch a lot of football I'm sure there are a few ducks out and Eugene right now that are watching this football game and have it off week and you move up to number one and Boise State if they take care of business yeah we put a big number up on San Jose tonight they figured to slide up to three right yeah I would say or Oklahoma I think they could get the two and I think okay exactly I meant to yeah an Oklahoma becomes a big factor there are 45 to nothing like Iowa State the big game next week for the Sooners of course where they go to Missouri and take on him defeated Pakistan but now it just continues to reshuffle with them Ohio State don't look like they're going to be able to come back from this and now we just kind of sit back and wait but Boise State and TCU another team goes down and it helps them viciously yeah because remember they don't play Michigan State Oh state Ohio State a 1 right a lot of these other unbeatens like miserable come play each other so they're going to take one down absolute everything is working to Boise State's benefit there so far there's no question about that yep they needed help and they're getting an 8:15 tomorrow night we'll all check in before we watch the Sunday night or a little bit we want to see what the BCS standings are on again ESPN will have those for you at 8:15 tomorrow so you can what come on over and see how it shakes out obviously it's early in the process but as we told you on that last run at John Clay went over 100 yards last 30 games and we talked about Joe McKnight so John Clay scored a couple of touchdowns in the first half he's a young man who has shaved the numbers of his offensive lineman and into his head prior to this game fine young man out of Racine there's the season in need award that they're all going for the coach's trophy presented by dr. pepper it's a big big setback to the market yeah it is it is aspirations with a veteran team and a playmaker quarterback is favorable gentle with the exception of coming to Madison and going to Iowa City they thought they had a real shot to run the table and maybe make a shot at a national championship game but give Wisconsin all the credit in the world you know John Clay he's been battling through those injuries to his ankles tonight great to see him get on track against the very talented Ohio state run defense he made the plays that he had to make got a lot of help from that big offensive line holding from throwing the ball to keep Ohio State's defense on third and 10 4:27 so lean in trouble and now fourth down and let's see what bill Malec Stu do here Johnson makes the stop and he shaken up on the play Buckeyes will use the timeout let's check in on the on the AP top 10 I may have confused everybody because of Oregon to climb to 1 Boise State and we can't overlook TCU Nebraska of course is going to fall look out for the Sooners be killed it'll hold on Auburn coming right yeah and that's the challenge for Boise State and TCU not just having Alabama lose last week in Ohio State lose potentially lose here this week if you have to look out for the teams behind them don't forget all burn in LSU a big showdown next week and for two teams that are in the top 10 right now they're both going to move up this week so at the big showdown at jordanhare and here is Welsh on the field South Welsh to attempt a 31yard field goal to make this a 13point advantage nails it I said 414 left would you come so we are back in Madison number one in serious jeopardy of losing and that would be backtoback weeks that we would have the number one team upset Alabama lost a week ago to South Carolina and here the Badgers are dictating 4:14 to go from the to its Barry when he's out to the 26 and of course every Sunday now you'll be able to catch the BCS countdown show for the exclusive unveiling of the new BCS rankings find out tomorrow night at 8:15 p.m. Eastern who's in the driver's seat so that's 515 out new Eugene and along the Pacific Network I know you'll be with us to see who's in the driver's seat they make the duck do pickups if they push us all either they climb it on one he's a great shape now Freddie pretender born ranking brand insane checks in in trouble suck it down mr. cannot turned it up especially in the first half Buckeyes rally and then Paul Kirsten scott told zine they dial up some passing plays they came down for that juice touch them to make a cane and fire same at the 40yard line makes the grab picket terrelle pryor earn every yard he ran to his left he came back to his elbows thought he's going to break contain to get outside of watt but he had to come back and eventually find an open brand insane but man he spend a lot of energy to come up with that first down not stops at the 324 mark and making it work for it David Gilbert that time outside linebacker defensive end chasing him out of bounds trol prior needs to be aware that even though he went out of bounds until you get to two minutes when the official starts to play clock the game clock continues not a lot of urgency right now prior although again want to remind everybody that next week for being Aaron and I will be on ABC at 8 Eastern and we will be in Columbia Missouri a battle of the unbeatens late in October Oklahoma and Missouri great game Missouri defense been playing very well he said you see the dirty thing office but their defensive challenge Oklahoma is short of the first down JJ Watt but ninetynine with that feared helping wristband out fitting that he makes this play they move him to the middle print he's a defensive end but I think they were anticipating prior on a quarterback draw great decision at times by a foreign the center and his quickness got around Brewster diving catch by Posey let's see what the mark is right at that first down mark wait for life at all gentle asking for an explanation instant replay will obviously take a look at I mentioned that wristband that JJ Watt has on that says fear nothing as you take a look at this instant replay we'll be checking this out pretty good effort that's pretty close I think email attached to it instant replay does but there's a young cancer patient in this town I know he's sitting on the edge of his seat right now Jackson Jenkins and he's had great support from Scott tolls een and JJ Watt and oh how he loves the Badgers and it was so great today on game day to see that the young man is now cancerfree it was such a great moving story the young man came here to the stadium for college game day to day and mom and dad and it's just one of those heartwarming stories about this game Harvey it really its proud to be a Rhonda let's go down for more on this story and here's Erin Andrews Erin on it there's my stripped out on this front real quick he is sitting in head coach Bret Bielema box tonight like you mentioned he was out in college game day with his Green Bay Packers Jersey on in his socks Wolsey and Jersey and he is cancerfree right now they are working and he just finished his last treatment in the hospital and herby knows he was out on set and he was as hilarious out on set with us today as he was in the video but a nice moment when Bret Bielema was talking about him feeling like he was part of the team and he was walking out onto the field and obviously he's got the head coach very emotional and this team very excited to even attendance tonight that's wonderful he came on the set after the show he had yet his Badgers Jersey on but he also had his Desmond Howard Green Bay Packers truck on underneath it he was fired and herby tonight JJ Watt had three tackles back to the tackle for a loss we take Brennan under looking but I just wonder the spot of the ball is in a first down yeah I think that they're taking an extra look at this not just because the see if he's able to control the football cuz I think he did I just wonder is the spot Gibbs in the first after further review the receiver had possession of the ball for a catch giving Ohio State a first down at the 48 yard to not only make the catch but to be able to pick up that first down obviously on fourth down and you got it you know JJ Watt 99 brandy is going to be coming after terrelle pryor again 80 1194 Camp Randall Stadium on hand here in Madison tonight see you Rick these two schools 30 now he's firing the books after hurry go down again JJ what now they move him to the outside and he just manhandles Mike Adam gives him a little bit work to the inside you talk about a combination skills to power great size great determination and also incredible quickness from Anna his guys that come in 21 now the middle fun Dibakar for a first down for the books bazan Bakker booth consistent receiver tonight suppliers been making some circus catches and sort of looked like Pharrell Pryor may not be able to give Ohio State much of a chance here trying to get points on a board thousand Bakker comes up with a big winner tonight throw by Pryor 84 yards in the game for number Clos wires got time going in zone out of the end zone I was posing the intended target other play oh hi Oh state thinking touchdown without any timeouts that have come down if they're able to get a touchdown come down to an onside kick but Jim Tressel trying to pull out all the stops to see if they can somehow get the football into this end zone but again without any timeouts pretty much down to these next few plays to see if Pryor teams somehow get it into the end zone without the clock running out running down second and ten fires out of bounds stop the clock that down to 122 Muldoon in pursuit that was great coverage that time by Nile Brinkley locks down cozy on the outside took him away and that's where Pryor want to try to get tried to get the football thrown to but frankly never gave up on the play intercepted let the party begin in medicine Blake Sorenson has intercepted terrelle pryor with 113 and come tomorrow there will be a new number one really really big win and Brett I think you and I agree for Brett Bielema he's come close in some of the bigger game but for he and his team to come up with a win against Ohio State kind of a signature win that you need knocking off the number one being nothing although higher state they've been close since he's been the head coach here taking over for Barry Alvarez congratulations the problem and his staff put together a great game plan and his players point out in executing their last play over number one teams 21 14 under Michigan that was September 12th that was right here in Madison again 1981 and now here tonight they have knocked off number one Ohio State we will see what the human poles do and then at 8:15 Devon out on ESPN what the BCS shakes out Boise State could certainly stay number one in the BCS a feeling for these Badger youngsters to come in here and win this game that's the good news the tougher news is Iowa's next for Wisconsin at jim hustle once across the field for the handshake of Bret Bielema and some of the students making their way onto the field oh yeah they're going to come definitely going to come out here celebrate it is something to celebrate when you pick off number one in this situation and do it the way they did it tonight you everybody in Madison getting a fish that little tense there in the second half Buckeyes came brawny Dempsey the neighbors lead the regime saved in the perfect place and winning coach biggest smile we've seen a long time some of his good friends here in town Barry Alvarez versus his athletic director he came in spoke to the team earlier this week right after losing the Michigan State a few weeks ago a lot of people maybe gave up on this with Constantine but they've been able to get healthy keep their focus come back on track last week with a big win over a rival in Smith
