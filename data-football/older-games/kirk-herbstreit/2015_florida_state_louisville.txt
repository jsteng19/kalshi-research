============================================================

alright Greece thanks very much and welcome to another college football Saturday here in Tallahassee osceola renegade get it started number 11 Florida State still unbeaten as they pick on Louisville and that means we are ready for college football to get underway and it is the ESPN college football presented by cars.com I am Bob wishes I'm here with rock you heard Shannon's fake down on the field Florida State a very interesting team lurking outside the top 10 last year in the college football playoff Jimbo Fisher thinks they can be there again and why not he has a running back in Dalvin cook the right now he wouldn't trade for anyway he's a great eraser he's eliminating so many mistakes is the young people around him you could see it on the other side with a true freshman Louisville quarterback as well and both of them are homerun hitters not pretty Florida State's not what they've been with Jameis their offensive numbers are way down but this is a top 10 scoring defense that is running the ball in the last time I checked those are two pretty good principals to win championships and get into that big day well there might not be any more overriding principle and not turning the football over and this has been about as clean a season as any team could have so far for FSU pretty remarkable and especially when your signal caller and ever Dolson was 22 takeaways one of the worst in college football last year and he's got a big fat 0 he's a column for Jimbo Fisher Jim was done a wonderful job continuing to grow Everett but he's gonna have to take a step today against a really good Louisville defense that like this Florida State team Bob has gotten better every single week out and for Bobby Petrino he has playmakers but boy does he have youth and that youth is going to be out on the field start never seen it never seen on my board and Bobby Petrino when we asked him yesterday is also never coached you've been in the situation with a true freshman right got the left tackle in quarterback 3 is the most difficult position if you're right out of school and all those kids came in the summer they were not early in lolis growing right in the fire doing the best they can they're at the dope today in the fire against the Knowles and they will start with the football the knuckleball kick that goes out of bounds you don't normally see a mistake made by Roberto Aguayo but he made one there it'll be great field position we picked out of bounds on the kicking team the Bowlby plates at the 35 yard line first then well now we get our first look at the true freshman Lamar Jackson that has emerged out of what once was a four quarterback carousel for Bobby Petrino any emerge because it is speed that's why he's under center right now because of all of the inexperience around him and it's not just on the line through freshman wide receivers as well the woods a great equalizer when things break down the ability to run and he is the fastest Cardinal reporting to the coaching staff and can they keep the threeheaded monster hat brushers of jacob q Josh sweat and to Marcus Walker off of him pretty clean pocket to start put an errant throw behind James quick it'll be second down and 10 let that down to Shannon hi there Bob you know this week the men's event record is beta Marcus Walker said he felt like Lamar Jackson was the biggest threat that he would face he did buy that fondant when I talked to him this week he said because of Jackson's skill and his speed and his arms he's unlike anything he'll see but remember you mentioned Jackson a true freshman he grew up in the South Florida area he admitted to me there are certainly any nerve coming into this game how he escapes the pocket and pays the price after a gain of three so third down and seven coming up for the true freshman on this opening possession in a beautiful picture in backtoback downs that very first play good protection little man beater crossing route throws it behind him stuck it down I'm looking at one guy and I'm out the door and this is that learning curve in that growth for any young player but especially one in this system as a true freshman and now dealing with the crowd noise of a go campbell stadium that is still filling in for an early start here in Tallahassee third down might now get a little tougher for the cardinals snapping attracting number 61 offense fiveyard third them and that bewdley and you pointed to where veterans with the starter all season last year who just nicked up a little bit earlier this season they have to have him in the middle he has got to settle things down and communicate to everybody around him not just four to three freshmen tackles you seen 72 they're McNeal jisuk Lee Gillie pup as well first year starter rocks event experience upfront against a really talented front for the love too rustic for there comes a fiveman run on third down avoiding a hit and finding a man out to midfield is Lamar Jackson it's Jamari staples the UAB proud of who has been come to Louisville once we love this football program Bobby Petrino was pretty clear in the past as well Gareth McGee saying this not just an athlete that you're going to see do the zone rerun all day long know exactly coming out with three straight passes in a beautiful job there of shedding the tackler in the backfield never lose your composure I found the field the third down completion little quick hit you out the tail and Smith through freshman to true freshman and the midfield and picks up three and you know I love those coaches meetings and I loved in Chatham at me and you've got two really good football minds that show you've got four between both coordinators as well in Charles Kelly and Todd Grantham along with the head coaches in look what Bobby Petrino is doing you think we're going to run play conservative sorry come out with five straight passes these are like pseudo running plays simple little screens out to the edge to move the James and they do exactly the same once again Jalen Smith but this has not been their tendency their numbers say hey get ready for all this run all week long Florida State's working on his own run all their keys all of their looks trust in your eyes and instead the tempo in the passing game setting the tone here early for Louisville little readoption tucking it under and going right up the middle is Lamar Jackson inside the 35 yard line for a gain of close to $7 you can put in his foot in the ground and there's no hesitation why he's got three 100yard rushing games a couple of the longest runs for this team this year he's willing to go between the tackles and we've said all the time about running back sure we will about Dalvin cook on the other side and when you're running between the tackles you can not have to take you cannot be you between in the youngster very adept to doing that seven flight of a drive that has eaten up the first three minutes that Ratliff in motion here comes the Blitz Jackson extends the play and throws it away preserve the down third down and three and you come out rockin you script that version series of plays once you get off the script how long do you think it takes a true freshman quarterback in this kind of environment just to settle down and settle into the gecko the nice thing is you've been in a couple tough spots already and Bobby Petrino is a demain head coach you deflate Haller and head coach and it's not just about Saturday's script there is tremendous intensity throughout the week he doesn't like to play a lot of freshmen at this position and you think you've got a special one that convened or everything that you just talked about this time of bliss comes in gentlemen Jacob q with the sack and not only is that a big loss but it pushes them out of any potential field goal range out to the 41 yard line so there's a situation where you get a true freshman quarterback that might not be thinking situational football as they may have had a chance at a long field goal before he took the sack that's fair but you've also got some youngsters on these edges that it's just going to collapse and Jackson's going to have to have a lot of patience with those freshman tackles because he's going up against sweat in few and Walker in these defensive ends and are so good it's supplicating and collapsing that pocket intentional endoverend kick from Applebee's from this field Bobo Wilson feels it inside the 10yard line so a lot of real estate for Florida State to cover on their first possession but they've got a guy that specializes in covering a lot of real estate and filling it awfully quickly it's one of the real homerun hitters in college football over 200 yard games already on two different occasions he's number two behind only Leonard fournette in yards per game and he has got I think more than anything else besides just had extra ear inset patient he still just a true sophomore he hasn't been around here for four years but he knows with a really step on that gas and be willing to take the hard runs between the tackles knowing that those set up the big gases down the field later Alvin cooks her stuff out across the 15 to about the 16 yard line to start for the gain of six and let's take a look at our intact layers and in order to slow down in the nation secondbest Russia or you can have to do it at multiple levels and rankin's up front is their best player probably on their entire roster and he can play end and he can play knows and he'll be playing in the NFL on Sundays James Burgess is a junior and he's an outside linebacker that can really run and he's got to handle the task along with his buddy Kelsey at that second level Paul start offense 77 five yards second down that's a big penalty on rod Johnson as that wipes away almost all the first down yardage for Dalvin cook makes it second down and nine a completely different look now for the nose who's ever going back there by himself as they go five live Louisville shows lips maybe they kissed their hands things like ever adults and saw what he needed to see Cardinal sent five Goldson over the middle bobbled and knocked down it'll be third down and nine if you go down to Shannon well Bob you know I spoke with Alvin closest think about that hamstring injury he said he's not in any pain it's just an Aggie but Jimbo Fisher not taking any chances with his star offensive player three to four hours of rehab a day he only practiced Wednesday and Thursday this week and when he was on the field the team limits his reps and his explosive claim he said he was good to go Cole go here today they left the Wake Forest game with that hamstring injury two weeks ago and for a brief period of time thought he was about the pullet against Miami on Saturday night last week took himself out of the game but then returned to score the gamewinning touchdown third and not here comes a Louisville blitz Colton mantoman coverage down the wing looking for hey Suz wilson and bobo can't find a football let's go covers from terrain Washington out on the edge and you better see a bliss fest from Todd for anthem especially if they can get into these predictable passing situations Todd Grantham the D coordinator comes from that Nick Saban tree it's why yesterday was so fun talking to both staffs Jimbo obviously does as well and he knows what's coming a lot of pressure is going to come on Everett Golson with those zero takeaways or giveaways and they're going to really try to force the issue get the ball out of his hand in that time the coverage absolutely shut down the go route this case in Beatty from the end zone another true freshman the year Alexander to return and he basically barely gets it away and not a great punch side hop out of bounds in plus territory for Louisville it's a great field position for the Cardinals when we come back after only a 36 yard welcome back to the ACCC on ESPN Susan Brock Huard Shannon spake in Tallahassee and a field position flipped for Louisville they had the football back for the second time but they'll start just across the 50 yard line at the Florida State 47 and maybe that helped settle down a true freshman quarterback lamar jackson after taking the fact that knock them out of field goal rank is basically right back where he was a moment ago rolled left close one across his body down the sideline and it's incomplete intended sign and hinging from as we checked in with that man Brooke for the first time at man hello Bob the Taco Bell studio update 5 and 1 Ole Miss vs. 500 Memphis and abital o trickeration yeah the double pass first career touchdown pass from the great laQuan Treadwell to Quincy attaboy Joe 7 nothing rebels back to its awning soup alright Dan thanks very much you're not normally worried about facing the Quan Fred Bowman throw the ball up right he bought us in the backup quarterback join Jackson in the backfield they run the option and Jackson keeps it and picks up six those are two good buddies he was a he was in competition in the month of August amongst those four quarterbacks and quickly Jackson separated himself but no County with everybody else in fact Bonifant is really close best friend right alongside of him and bottom it's going to continue to have a role in this offense receiver in the flop running back to Dynamics keep on the sidelines or a state blitz off the edge on third down and four and a Jackson little look over to the sideline there comes that list swing pass caught by kana fit can he get to the first down marker knocked out of bounds well short at the 40yard line so now it's fourth down and three at the 40 of Florida State that's a really good play from Josh sweat talk about freshman for Bobby Petrino well sweat is a freak show for Florida State as well these own blitz and there's not many defensive ends in college football there's and get out of that swing round and keep Bonifant short by the sticks you can see the trainer's reaction he said dang it I thought I had that play scripted appropriately some real crediting the athleticism of sweat to chase that third down out that will be his first punt in the Noles at their own 10yard line you got to try and do it again as Louisville will play field position and this time to kick ends up about three yards different than it was the first time Florida State will start their second possession when we return at their own 13 there are some mascots that get to do some cool things in college football I'm not sure that there's any mascot that gets to pay thing cooler than this Viking the flaming spear for Osceola and renegade before every Florida State home game here at the dope cooler for Osceola renegade though I'm saving 50/50 yeah either one's got about 80,000 out there cheering for them and now Dalvin cook lines up in the eye and again it's the long field for the Seminoles at their own 14 resulting back to throw escapes the pocket there's no one there in the middle of the field for Louisville and he scrambles and picks up nine guru Devante fields eventually close the distance but the decision making all season forever goals that has been tremendous in totally different system pro style system here that allows him to distribute the ball a little bit more than that sprint system at Notre Dame where it was all about him zero interceptions a remarkable number in its decisions like that if it's not there well let me just ramble and use my athleticism he's not been over running he's not been throwing it into tight windows he's taken what the defense is giving him and Trust the run game and defense helps to give it to Dalvin cook he powers his way for a first down with a flag now on the far side of the field thrown right at the line of scrimmage both side defense number 14 fiveyard penalty first down well for Everett Golson bran he has not turned the ball over and it's a player that last year at Notre Dame turns it over 22 times secondmost in FBS what is that maybe somewhat of a byproduct of him being too conservative at times every now and then do you accept an interception if you're Jimbo Fisher knowing that you want your quarterback to take some chances it's a great question he'll go play action here and send it to Dalvin cook in the black break the tackle and gets out to about the thirties and we will talk about that a moment after we check in again with that man all right thank you Bob just want to update you what's happening with regards to Baylor West Virginia this is Skyler Howard is shelling Gibson and then defense give Joey Galloway an upset stomach look at Baylor doing nothing there 70 yards Gibson goes the house it's seven all back to you Bob all right Advent second down and along to close to three here for the nose Dallben cook brought down after a gain of maybe a half yard so it'll be the third day along to the answer to earlier question about Everett in the system and is he taking not enough rest he's really too full understand that a Notre Dame he took Brian Kelly to the national title game there was an immense amount of equity in trust that was developed a little bit like Jameis here where Jimbo and a freedom that hey man you go cut it loose and he'd been there and you've done that instead of a guy coming here and he's got to gain the trust of head coach system everybody around him and most importantly he's got to win to keep his job and keep that man on the sidelines happy third down and short trying to keep this drive alive Louisville brings a blitz and it is beaten by Everett Golson perfect throw on the slant the Kerman Whitfield and then olds have a first down near midfield and to further extend that little conversation it was a throw just like that against Miami last week on a third and eight in fact to Kermit on a knee in breaking route where he did have to take some risks where he's sitting in the hole and he's got to trust the Kermit's going to come out Jimbo is going to trust that he will pull the trigger in finish I think that finishing that fourth quarter for head coach and quarterback critical to the optimism the Jimbo's feeling playaction down the sideline Aven saunders reaching for the football to the flag down at the 32yard line it looks like they'll credit him with the catch and he fought off the penalty and john harvey clemens to do it the get up 21 pass interference defense number 25 the penalties declined play accepted first half and I don't know if he makes that for a weak one the navin you didn't know maybe but he doesn't know if he's covered that if he'll come back in fight for the ball what a tremendous play I mean that is a phenomenal athlete he worldclass basketball player recruited by all the big boys on a high school for his basketball but you know documented throughout this game those throws where well I got to trust my guy on the other end he's going to be covered in two system to get after it and make sure it's Powerball nobody's ball wonderful job there Saunders fighting through the interference a worst case scenario here for Florida State even if they ruled it as they go to review incomplete they pick up 15 yards on the pass interference penalty but it was ruled to catch on the field and that looks like a good fall on the field with one get complete control the footballs and went to the ground get his arms under elbow is down in bounds nice control do not see the ball shift or move if the play stands it's a gain of 21 so it's a six yard difference in terms of whether or not this is an incomplete pass with the penalty or whether they stick with the call on the field and give Saunders his capture more and more at the NFL level and it's come on down to the college football level as well and that is those elite quarterbacks that really believe in the guy on the other end that is the corner route and everything on the TV screen and everything in the film room says that Nathan's covered he's going to hip pocket whatever Golson says but I got a 65 245pound athlete that's going to fight through that and he's going to win and then oneonone situation I'll take a peek inside the replay booth these are the looks that they are getting off of our replay monitor and you know the matrix they made a quick decision so will I'm sure at some point have a chance to take you inside the booth later on after review the ruling on the field stands is called good pet first down well there are no players as a traditional unit that I think even with the great season the Dalvin cook is at that Jimbo Fisher talks with more flowery language about that is young Titan in that group you Ron Donovan cook you've been in the class all of his own but that running back room with fenders injury does not have the upside to that room does is Owen Saunders to just young pops redshirt freshman that just add a wonderful dynamic when you can play an extra tight in package buff's Matt Golson has to cover it up that's going to cost Florida State ten yards into down so it'll be second down in 20 that's ever they're going to run a little option to the outside will lead option with the running back in the backfield and he just takes his eyes off of it wide receivers to try to get running before they really secure the catch is trying to get out on that edge and run option with cook unfortunately for the negative play both of these teams have made many changes since the start of the season on their offensive line if I'm a perfect snapper Bryan hotel and a bullet of a pass right over the middle thrown by Everett Golson to Bobo Wilson about four yards shy of the first down again at 16 we learned down in moon you can see everybody tapping his shoulder pads because he knows there's more here he puts that ball in a catch and run situation and Wilkins honors them too easy of a pitching catch I know these reads now after five weeks under my belt and feeling a whole lot better about my anticipation and rhythm it's about finishing with a captain run ball hmm Dolson extends the play and misses his target underneath on 3rd down at Bobo Wilson we have got almost an automatic kicker on 4th down and four and it looks like it will be Roberto a wild it will come out try and get the nose on the board first rather than going for it on fourth and four for the 26 a little chess match we will be talking about it throughout the game Grantham that time showing a very different picture to Everett presnap than the Blitz that came post our post snap and for seeing completion 43 yards for the future NFL star kicker Roberto as well and that's why there will be NFL general managers that in the second round of the trend will be sitting there going you know he's really good and he'll make everything we might have to make him he gives Florida State the 3 nothing lead watch ESPN as well the Miller stories here with the Florida State Dean last year that not control many games very well Corbin lamb on the kickoff return to Louisville stood up at about the 21 yard line in Ohio State who is not going to this year but you remember Florida State you've got a lot of wins in fact Louisville they were down big last year had to fight back and they were still number one in Ohio State everybody thought this row would be so easy to get back to the title game and they stumbled a little bit and you can look at all the percentage they're identical between the two teams trailing backtoback years well this year's Florida State game there have been times where they've struggled against lesser opponents we did a game where they struggled here against USF when they won the national championship with Jameis Winston and there he is on the sidelines the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner they got that respect all year there have been times this year Oh house hit struggled as well they've never dropped from number one Bonifant turns the corner and picks up eight on first down as we check in with Shannon spake you know bought Jameis Winston he's been having a blast here today this part of the pregame chance he spoke to the team in the locker room I was told he with typical Jameis just having a good time I also spoke with him I asked him what impressive most about this team he said the resiliency said it reminds him a lot of last year squad well this crew is playing a little bit more defense I think that's what stands out to me more than anything else miss Christine looks like trained Marshall down that is Trey Marshall now last week Trey Marshall was ejected in the first half for targeting on Miami quarterback Brad Kaia and after he was knocked out of the game for targeting take a look at that play last week everything changed schematically and matchup wise for that Florida State defense it sure did Miami start to get after Tyler hunter the villain who came in who is a much better guy around line scrimmage than he is in the back end of the defense trey is nasty man he is just going to light you up and he's going to get and they asked that Dean last week that and it's not just Everett Golson with that hole cut at loose feel and play not to lose they asked him to really all uncoil and that looks really unfortunate he's going to head back to the training room he's not moving that left arm or wrist at all so he's going to head right back to the locker room but he's our big hitter he's a cleanup guy he's a guy that is an Intimidator when he brings the force at impact that he brings hit kiya so hard he launched him four or five feet on that contact and target and kicked out and that's tough for Charles Kelley defense the coordinators gonna have to move some more pieces around now defensively second down and two with a wide receiver screen once again and getting right to the first down marker with Jalen spin let's see where they mark them down it looks like about a half yard shot so it will be third down and short be sure that he was out there to make the stop these are the down and distances that Bobby Petrino and staff want to live in right now this is where a running quarterback with instability tuck it and go and plans maps and everything in this down and distance favorite Cardinal read option a keeper and a third down conversion or Lamar Jackson he picked up four back to Adnan all right Bob thank you very much updating you on skip holsters Louisiana Tech team taking on Mississippi State Jeff Driskel Florida transfer thirteen passing text of this year more than any year ever had a Florida there are 14 7 Bob it's three nothing Florida's ain't got a chance for a big play James quick gets behind an old defense and the turf monster got it or he might have scored he got inside the 20 down to the 18 yard line a beautiful fine a touch pass from Lamar Jackson good for 48 well this is a really nice job of going from zone read right here's to rocketry Marshall one of the guys on the back end of either doesn't wonderful job of fruit is communicating eyes get lost boy over the head why would game play and it cuts down to James quick FSU lost him twice Lamar Jackson didn't and Louisville got the lead and he's right in the inside quick and I love it and you see this out a coordinator spent we had a long chat with Bobby Petrino about this yesterday the play works let me call again you've got the same defensive personnel you have the same eyes that get lost either that linebacker he's gotta carry for the secondary secondary defender hasn't come off his vertical route so we talked about the chess match earlier with two really good head coaches that call the play hit maintenance Petrino here in the first quarter whole panel on game day basically made the same point Kirk Herbstreit was one of the first as well to make it they expected though Campbell to be a little sleepy and maybe Louisville could use that sleepy atmosphere to jump on Florida State early that's exactly what the Cardinals have done seven three they've got the lead let's look at those two plays that James quick just from trips left empty all go special you just got five verticals there's no rocket science here you're taking quick your fastest player right down the middle of the field and you're seeing the same zone coverage and unfortunately and linebacker don't communicate okay quicks going to do it again and it's these two that have to be on the same page to either then come off of your vertical and carrier or linebackers you have got to get you a depth and run underneath it miscommunication between the do and give some real credit to a veteran play caller that sees the same personnel the same coverage and attacks it backtoback plays Everett Golson with a playaction fake he's looking for a fake play out to midfield he's got one the Bobo Wilson the gain of 20 another throw that ever goes in he puts out in front of him and Wilson may be running these are the details that you would love to see from a 50 or senior quarterback in Wilson beaches too little a little sharper a little better catch and run and it's a wellexecuted nice chunk play but there was even more in that execution they've run the option now and Golson gets wide ease and get tackled behind the line Heath Brown makes the stop for a loss of four it'll be second down and 14 that best.you at their own 40 haunt can't play the option any better than this get right in between this is the quarterback and running back in that pitch relationship you want to take them both away get in between of them that is excellent from the junior brown clock winding down to five now the Cook has been quiet only has two parents Everett Golson to throw again taste again that provide elegance of all the way back inside the 30yard line that's the loss of 12 you're going to see a beautiful stunt here on the outside and we're talking about Tom Grantham and all the looks he is going to give when you see him and that's young loopy inside this guy is relentless a couple guys on this Cardinal beat fans rank into my impact guy but young Davonte field transfer from TCU they get after the quarterback and they really felt like um an intricate they'd have an opportunity to get after Golson they beat him a year ago remember when you was at Notre Dame third down and 26 wing pass and it's just get what you can and a flag comes out a terrible mistake made by Louisville Herman Winfield had his face man grabbed by Josh Harvey Clemens on third down and forever that's like a turnover personal foul they spent number 25 defense 15 yards first down that's exactly right you're off the field yep field and you force the punt you've got a sounding got wonderful momentum when instead Harbach lemon redshirt junior transfer from the University of Georgia and played a lot of all the big back critical error on his grade sheet tomorrow so it might be the final play of the first quarter as Florida State in business Everett Golson quick swing pass to Whitfield in the flat if the blocks answers out of bounds at about the 36 yard line and Brockman will not go down in the box score as a turnover that absolutely has the force and effect of eternal that would listen to the field position look what it does to the psyche of both teams absolutely Bob and takes us to the end of the first quarter a mistake by Louisville but they do have a 73 lead to ESPN college football presented by cars.com we started the second quarter with Louisville on top of Florida State 7:3 there is a reason people live in Florida today is one of those reasons not a cloud in the sky no humidity temperatures in the neighborhood of 80 degrees just a perfect day for the fans to sit outside and watch a Seminole team that struggled in the first quarter with Louisville with good field position here Everett Golson on second down floats one out to the edge and that is a first down catch Harvey Clemens comes up makes the stop on Kermit Whitfield and that will move the chains in Florida into the advantage that ever it's been in this system for about half a season now and then obviously won this job in training camp we saw him very early against South Florida and he is a different guy in command there have been baby steps of this position within the progression of their offense but seeing the blitz getting the ball out of his hands he's made big strides here in the first six weeks again a little shutdown underneath Travis Rudolph picks up five virgin to make the tackle if the goal though was for Galvan cook to not hurt Louisville mission accomplished so far as he has only touched the ball a couple of times exactly right again some of the chest man some of the ransom on that sideline to see coordinator saying hey if I keep listening these guys right Jimbo is going to feel like he wants his blitz Peters and he wants to get quarterbacking the ball out of his hand and you eliminate their biggest threat their home run hitter one of the bigger difference makers in all of college football in Dalvin cook Everett Golson five four five on this drive make it six four six over the middle he's got one of those redshirt freshman tight ends and Ryan is though to the 15yard line and n2 is a trust borough it's not just when mavin was covered with the guy in the hip pocket that is a vertical right into the safety he ever to see in the to safety look there and I'm a little surprised he didn't check run because usually when he get that look with this running back you check into the run but instead he trusts his oats uses big bonnie to absorb the hit here's where FSU struggled on saturday though in the red zone against miami and the red zone struggles continue here at least a start pressure came from true bailey so it will be second down intent last Saturday night Florida State was in the red zone four times and scored nine points three field goals and a failed fourth down conversion a thirteen going into that game closer to the percentage that you're seeking you want to be over seventy percent red zone touchdown don't ever look at field goal and touchdowns and red zone percentage it is about one thing when you get inside the twenty it's about scoring touchdowns and you're right that game a week ago got awfully close and they were even trailing in the fourth quarter for the inability to get six down here acha collapses again he escapes all the way back to the 35yard line and unloading it is Everett Golson he did well to avoid a sack of unitless Trayvon young it was Trayvon Young but it was the corner blitz that ever could feel that gets picked up but immediately that blitz from the short side of the field started to speed up his clock and that's what you want to do in your pressure package even if it does get picked up and in both cases really brought secondary pressure Dalvin cook in that running back room has done a good job picking it up but it's sped up the clock and forced another throw away in the third and extra long third down and 10 21 offensive players run for FSU and only a couple of touches for Dalvin cook and now on timeout called from Florida State sideline so we'll step aside as well big play coming up and Louisville tries to get a red zone stop big play here Papa Susan Brock Huard Shannon spake in Tallahassee the Knowles trying to keep the drive alive third down and ten in the red zone 11th player to drive and again pressure rock they show blitz five man rush Golson put a goal line incomplete again an errand throw through it behind Whitfield so now it will be fourth down and another field goal coming up for Aglaia yeah that one actually is in the spot here in a condensed red zone where it's got to be and you're going to see Burgess on the corner of your screen that if he throws at another yard in front Burgess who picked off Winston a year ago may have a shot at that one that is just a little bit that continuity when everything is sped up and happened faster the Wilson's got to trust the golson's going to put it to his on shoulder instead not settle for three once again glial has never missed under 40 yards from 32 here to make it a onepoint game and he's 2 for 2 let's take a look at our winning traditions driven by good year last year Florida State with a school record comeback they were down 21 to nothing in a night game at Louisville and they came back and won 42 to 31 Dalvin cook obviously played a huge role in that win for FSU it's the biggest comeback in the history of their program and it's part of an unbeaten streak against ACC competition that snaps to 27 games deep I had a lot to do with it absolutely Jameis it had such a will just never believed he was going to fail and using other programs who have lost their Heisman quarterback in their franchise quarterback really struggled over the last ten years so you go back Tim Tebow at Florida and Colt McCoy Vince Young at Texas Marcus Mariota right now up at Oregon and the nice thing here for Jimbo and whatever goals who walked into was a pretty route well built and ready built defense and run game and that's why they're five and OH returnable for Corbin lamb from the to misjudge nip it gets up the sideline and not a bad return at all but there is a flag down at the 15 yard line and you had the note Bob that Corbin the only senior but it touched the ball off every third illegal block below the way number nine at the distance to the goal first down so that will back up Louisville after we check in with that man Bob it could be up a lot more by the time that games over Louisville right now with the onepoint lead they've gotten two stops against Florida State and we talked about it yesterday Brock 50 struggles that the Noles have had in the red zone even if you give up your between the 20s if they're getting seven did not freeze that's a win for the little video but do with a young quarterback between 15yard penalty zone on a facemask offensively and that one on the shot clock set you back a run to Brandon Ratcliffe and he moved the pile for 4 yards Radcliffe a redshirt junior and that makes him a great beer on this offense for Louisville Layton the only senior that touched it offensively freshmen all over the plate that the line scrimmage wide receiver right under Center the most important of them all number 8 off to a good start very poised in this environment they can reach the line one the job has been a thrower more than he's been a runner so far in this day Lamar Jackson again in the shotgun this time straight throw to the sideline have sat it down at the line by Maya Lawrence temple now it will be third down and six from the 11:50 line does a really good job with this mountain passes down they did it to Miami a couple times a critical third down situations a week ago you can't get home get your hands up it sucked down faster we put him once again now near his own goal line in a third passing situation play clock at 10:00 and Lamar Jackson still looking over the sidelines now he's set to go over the middle easy pitching catch for the first down Jaylon Smith that's true freshman to true freshman a big third down conversion as we go down to Shannon well Bobby I saw Trey Marshall being taken off the field back into the locker room the team has confirmed he has a left arm injury and will not be back in this game you guys can certainly talk about it second straight game without Marshall and as Louisville continues to commit to this happy and gay magician Miami would be able to create matchups last week that they loved with Marshall off the field we'll see if Louisville can do the same now that he is out fourman rush so all the cloud in the world for Jackson now the pocket collapses and he's dropped down back inside the 15 that Florence sampled again at some of that play clock that is a young quarterback when you're an empty set you have got to know I got to get the ball out of my hand that's a fourman rush and you would love to see him play to victory fight line and he's going to walk throughout his career of am ia Runner is that my greatest skill set or can I sit and read and do full field reads situation like that is you feel that coffee klatch you would sure love to see him utilize his greatest gift and that's his speed runs the option here brought down behind the line again Nile Lawrence samples everywhere on this drive another tackle for long if I go back to that sack on first down and take a look at this into the sidelines here press coverage from one of most physical quarters in the league Jalen Ramsey and that is right into coach Petrino he bounces back up heat up gone Louisville three four five on third down but certain 17 that's something different all together and they will not get it Jacob Pugh brought down Jackson before he could even get back to the line of scrimmage Louisville goes backwards and I'll have to putt from deep in their own end that's a little bit of dangers when you've got such young people in front and that's why that first down past and it's a little bit what Bobby's talking about not second or third that's first down when you did have time to do something you got to make something happen and there's Garrick McGee ving a really good mentor for the freshman as well because if you get into third and ten blood this line cannot hold up against the size ruf wobbly kick from Appleby caught in traffic and taking a lick as Wilson at the 47 yard line of Louisville timing it perfectly with safety Thomas will step aside Florida State down a point but on the Louisville side of the 50 last night Midnight Madness here at Florida State they have the dunk contest you could see Shannon spake there you know Brock when when you're in town for Midnight Madness they ask the big celebrities sure to come out and judge the dunk contest were you asked to be enough I really no I was not I was at I'm part of the contest I said I don't need to show up my dunking skills anymore Shannon spake was asked by a judge well you want the star yeah you guys you guys should have an appetite just dunking I could have seen your whip/nae nae skills that would have been fantastic from midfield a false start offense the right guard fiveyard penalty first down I think it was nice of Shannon as well to just allow the highlights that we showed to focus on the FSU players right obviously they had the celebrity dunk contest later she hung from the rim but she didn't watch how that to be the flow they were all about her he wanted the focus to be on FSU and Shannon we appreciate well as I transition the best I can I'd like to focus here to be on Dalvin cook and I would like him to carry it if not three times in a row at least early in this possession first and 15 after the penalty and it'll be another false start I would think let the play go everybody cooks silk every golden sling was surprised to get the snap and he somehow gets back to the line of scrimmage where he touched down by Jair Alexander but Jimbo Fisher trying to calm down a discombobulated SSU offense second in fifth or there's no false starters the ball snapped it's just off the team has no idea that the ball would snap to what the count was and obviously that went a little bit early some revolving door it's center here hopeful making now his third start in a row for the guy banged up through training camp mysteriously part of this season still very much working progress another flag drug another false start both are often seventyseven five yards second down guard first down center second down tackle third down it's a noon start lat Saturday night this place of course is going bonkers because they're playing against their archrival in Miami this is a different atmosphere I don't buy into that very much especially not once you certain get hit and once you know that this defensive line you're going up against for these linemen are pretty good you want to come out and be a little sluggish on your opening possession that's one thing to me I just don't buy much into that much therefore sounding to tokens he picks up two maybe three yards James Burgess made the stop and it will be third down and at least 17 for Florida State to me it's more about some of the execution of Louisville defensively doing exactly what they wanted to do they wanted to come in here and be able its best they wanted to get Florida State and the quarterback on their heels a little bit to me those three penalties are more about a no line thinking than oversleeping you don't think this team looks a little sleepy and not quite as sharpen it as they had on Saturday night we watch the BC game we have seen this offense we saw him against South Florida this is a work in progress it looks like Louisville will cost themselves five now as James turns jumped into the neutral zone did he make contact with that offensive line or did he get back inside both sides defense 99 jumped into the neutral zone and made contact fiveyard penalty third down that's the difference if you make contact then it's a penalty if you get back without making contact I'll let that go now it's third down and a long 12 close to 13 chef's game continues the Cardinal showed blitz now they drop a couple extra players back in coverage and rough for Golson still caught behind a line he is still sack Trayvon young does it again he has been an impact pass rusher so far this afternoon for Louisville one the most startling numbers on the stat sheet I always like to watch the tape first before I read any stories or look at any stats and Young has been all over the place and he beats the redshirt freshman Kelly out of his stance I mean this guy has been a nightmare and you have seen him affect quarterbacks he had zero sacks coming in a lot of hurries but finally getting home and for him junior college transfer got imagine this feels pretty good to get after Golson and bring them to the ground white about for Florida State starting at the Louisville 48 yard line and now punting from their own 40 what a huge win that is for Louisville defensively and this punt from Beatty goes right into the end zone so it gets even better for the Cardinals that will bring the ball out to the 20yard line Florida State and their fans hoping the Noles wake up they're down by one as protection and penalties have been a problem for the Florida State offense they trailed on wanted Rock did the moment ago Everett Golson coming over to talk to the offensive line and he is told to get away and that is Rick Trickett he's been here a long time and he says I need to get after my guys first when Jimbo reaffirms that right over to Everett they don't mind that I promise you they'd love to see him engaged in that way but that is a veteran owe line coach it has had enough with the selfinflicted errors preach now first down straight handoff to Brandon Radcliff may have picked up a yard one of the rare times we've seen Lamar Jackson under center it'll be second down and long and let's barek well he made the stop let's be clear about this as well that's how they communicate from the top down Jimbo is emotional we have seen that through the years handle ball his quarterbacks LSU and Florida State that's the way he is good a coach and all of those guys on the sidelines have a little bit of room to be emotional and trickers trying to get that group on the same page they fake the screen go up the seam and it's complete out across the 40yard line the tamari staples a gain of 24 Louisville is an excellent job of Jackson actually coming off number one and to try to fake a little bubble screen up the sidelines to the outside and actually has some room to breathe some air around him in the pocket and a tremendous hands cats right there from Staples it was fun talking yesterday to Bobby Petrino about his read his true freshman quarterback lamar jackson as it goes back to work here gets outside chinks and bakes and picks up a couple marcus brutus made of some for infants you Shannon well Bob you know it might be a young Louisville offense but they're certainly on the same page and I think a lot of that starts with when they're on the sidelines Garrett Magee the offensive coordinator is down here on the field so he can address the entire unit as one no one headphone no one's on the telephone they're all together listening and adjusting all four coordinators on the field which is interesting Lamar Jackson to the sideline incomplete brings up a big play to try to keep the drive alive third down and nine Dylan Ramsey was all over Jamari Stapleton coverage we have been pressure in these they're down the last couple snaps the little zombie look no hand on the ground of the defensive lineman could be a very good time to draw or screen a little bit of highrisk but can be some higher return as well instead of trying to sit in that pocket and protect beautifully against some Blitzers coming from everywhere you dictate it and you set the tone with your offense at all only a threeman rush on third down Jackson tried to scramble and dug but get stood up three yards on the first down their wind genes another true freshman and about as goodlooking a true freshman as you're going to see he is an athletic freakin safety for Florida State can I back that up 6:32 12 benches 405 squats 555 inverts 44 that's why you're a fivestar kid and oh by the way posted a 35 GPA in its first semester at Florida State after nearly a full row in high school that is the quality kid they are about as excited with him as they are with about any recruit on their roster Applebee's punt forcing a fair catch inside the 10 yard line by Bobo Wilson 44yard punt Appleby get the job done as dinner with James Laura state ball that we return together with the ferocity they are incredibly impressive cook trying to turn the corner and a pretty good job of pursuit by the front seven and the edge players for Louisville Heep round made the stop but there were other white jerseys in the area still picked up a fuss set the edge in build walls and I love that I just love that picture I think it's so easy for everybody to understand set the edge defensively get your hands on these forward estate linemen and then build wall stay square trying to condense those creases as much as possible against the home run hitter like cook another handoff Dalvin cook close to the 20yard line looks like a first down for Florida State and go back to admin all right Bob Thank You Iowa and northwestern 6no versus 501 respectively kins earrings out so Akram Wadley comes in it is all Iowa right now 16 and nothing at ABC head espn2 Bob alright add man four minutes to go in the first half and Louisville keeping this game lowscoring and holding on to a onepoint lead Albin cook finally turns into the workforce not a lot there as he picks up the yard to hand and rock when you have a running back that obviously the quarterback wants turn around a handle the ball he can can you dictate with your personnel and your schemes and is Louisville doing this yeah a way that Everett Golson says you know I can't be given the ball to Dalvin cook her if you're calm laser Jim Bohlen I have to go to I think there's two conversations there defensively you start to bring enough numbers around by the line scrimmage that you say boy we're better off constant for Jimbo as well to control it and say if they're going to blitz then I've got these blitz beaters in this passing game to go to here's cook about a yard and a half shine numbers down it will be third down and two joy here Alexander made the stop and it's our Aflac trivia question Dalvin cook second running back in FSU history with multiple games of 200 or more rushing Yahoo who was the first to do that what does that taking place at the team season third down and two and under pressure again get the block let's get right the Dalvin cook this is where he's so dangerous in the open field Dallben cooked down the sidelines and he didn't seem to have that same first he's had in the past he's got the hamstring injury that from two weeks ago forced him out of the game against Wake Forest and he felt it Brad last Saturday night against Miami as well and it looked as if he slows up on this play a bit yeah it's a very very in there you see him and that is the great challenge with me answering injuries in worldclass athletes those things could be incredibly just nagging throughout the rest of the year I'll pass thrown to Travis Rudolph he's cut down the loss of a yard Jermaine Washington maple stop here's Dalvin cook this is the hamstring injury from two weeks ago against Wake Forest and then on Saturday night he was about to run for a second touchdown he jiong against Miami but gives himself up because he felt a grab again even talking to Jimbo he said hey I stopped there before I fully blew it out that he knows his body so well in his preparation that he can feel that tightness and know how to avoid some of that major catastrophic injury but it's obviously bothering him throwing it away is Everett Golson with pressure coming once again the win will be in third down and 11 were Florida State after we answer our Aflac trivia questions a plaque the Dalvin cook the second running back in Florida State history with multiple games of 200 or more rushing yards in the same season who was the first I have to go back aways to Greg Allen back in 1981 his freshman season for Florida State and we have an injury on the field Kyle Shortridge is in that rotation on the defensive line for Louisville is down and hurt so we'll step aside for just a helmet check in with that man again all right Bob thank you coming up on the Lexus halftime report Joey Galloway Danny canal and myself next man up for Iowa Kinser he goes out but no slowing down the hot guys right now also Corey Coleman makes history for Baylor highflying offense against West Virginia and the Saturday showdown Alabama against a.m. and how much fun is Michigan State versus Michigan going to be in the big house also we took a vote Bob we want to see you in the dunk contest well anybody would well I've got but this is what the hoops can't go down to six feet no ions let me tell you something not only do I have mad ups but they better check the breakaway that it's not gonna hurt the backboard because when I hang on that RIM it's violent I couldn't are you singledigit Bert I'm going to good I couldn't jump over the yellow pages I I could be dunked on a nerf hoop on my son's bedroom door third down and 11 Everett Golson empty backfield with Alvin cook maybe with that hamstring to worry about again fourman rush pretty good pocket golson extends to play well short of the first down he finds Bobo Wilson but now it's fourth down in four at the Louisville 40yard line now there's only a minute 11 to go Florida State has a couple of timeouts what do you do here yeah I think I think if you feel good about your group up front you do go for it but I think right now we saw conversation earlier on the sidelines with old line coach and head coach and Dalvin cook out with a little hamstring injury I think you trust your defense couple timeouts a young freshman quarterback that you hope to backup and trust that more right now than you do you group up front Louisville guarding against any fake as they has a very safe defense out there baby we'll send it down inside the five and it takes a perfect hop for Florida State they'll down it finally in about the 9 yard line but that gets the job done so now you've got a true freshman quarterback you have a lot of true freshman skilled position players you have a onepoint lead but a minute on the clock and three timeouts starting deep in your own end how do you approach this from a play calling all about first down play is it always is you get good execution you get a positive play you get a chance to start to set your tempo up go for it this first down play is always so critical in these situational football opportunities tre Marshall done for the rest of the game and you can see statistically that had an impact on the large accident and the offense they'll hand it off and this is going to be the type of play that will convince you you know what we should aggressively play call a bust right up the middle for LJ Scott so the clock stops for the moment now it starts coming up on 50 seconds to go Louisville with all their timeouts but now not nearly as deep in their own end we on this first down call there defensively had me scratching my head on three or defensa sake I mean he as if there was 10 seconds in not a minute 10 and no urgency here from Louisville on the other side at all boy did they let a lot of time go off the clock now they'll run it will they now call timeout or just try to go to the locker room very surprised with a big run up the middle you wouldn't get up to the line with a little more of a sense of urgency oh they are playing this conservatively well this all comes down to what you feel best about you feel best right now if you're Louisville about your defense that had been in a lot of command it's gotten after Florida State that may not have Dalvin cook or at least they'd been DEP Dalvin cook now they're going to throw it a hospital ball thrown to midfield hauled in by tamari staples with four seconds to go LaMarcus Brutus with a big hit on staples he did very well to hold on to the ball and now Louisville will call the timeout Wow like a very odd way to play this to show no sense of urgency and then with only a few ticks on the clock now throw the football but they've gotten themselves in a position where they can try a Hail Mary with four seconds to go yeah very odd is what happens when you've got a lot of people that are really inexperienced when you just don't know when you don't know about your freshman tackles when your young quarterback is still very much climbing that learning curve so yeah not particularly shocked on either side I'm a little more shocked about maybe the offensive line of Florida State not being on the same page because that was a situation that Jimbo felt would be a step ahead and I think a step back here in the first thirty minutes so this is just a Hail Mary for midfield yeah yeah this is just a little kid running around a little bit he's got a bigtime arm you're not just about four four four day yield you'll throw it and you can throw it 60 65 70 yards you hit this ball into the end zone and give your big receivers six six six four six three on this roster in the gym ball by playing it conservatively Louisville all but guarantees themself the lead at halftime and Lamar Jackson really be able to get a pass off he will not drag down by the Marcus Walker for the sag and that will take us into the break it have done the Florida State will start the third quarter with the football but Bobby Petrino's team will start the second half with the lead at man Danny Joey the Lexus has been welcome back to ESPN college football presented by cars.com surprising score at the end of the first half just about set for the start of the second half only nine touches in the first 30 minutes for Dalvin cook as a result this team only had two field goals they trailed by one to Louisville Bible shoes and Brock Dewart shannon's big here in Tallahassee we talked her in the first half about canid defense dictate whether or not the star player touches the ball well that might not only be the only thing that did Louisville dictated in the first right there's more physical I thought they played a step faster in the factor forward state sit here at halftime because of a couple sacks wouldn't zero rushing yards is absolutely to the plan the Tom Ransome defensive coordinator wanted to see execute they brought corner books at secondaries listed Trayvon Young got home twice for big negatives act on the flip side this is going to be a bit of a work in progress baby steps of the freshman quarterback but you love Bobby Petrino running in his vertical passing game which is always been a component and he goes back to back with the exact same way in that touchdown the only touchdown in that first half number one point lead Florida State starts the third quarter with the football and you'd have to think there's going to be an emphasis early in the second half if Dalvin cook hamstring is okay to get hims and touches and get him more involved in after significant him because III don't see the worldclass finishing speed that we have from him earlier this year we thought a week ago as he pulled up just a little bit against Miami now he's old Jimbo that hey I didn't want to fully pull that hand string felt a little tweak we saw one earlier where you get down on a scramble play and instead of just down shifting into the home run gear in fact I went into the idle mode and just trying this the same with a hamstring that's obviously still bothering them Kermit Whitfield from the goal line looking for some room and not finding much ran a long way just to get to the 12 yard line looking down to Shannon well Bobby Bob Bobby Petrino who said that because of the youth of his offense he absolutely has to play with the lead and he's right where he wants his team to B's and it lead on that offensive line a little bit more in the second half he wants to see the run game develops but as far as this freshman quarterback he likes his development he likes his decisionmaking skills that he's making and he certainly like that he's hanging on the football it's very interesting the play of Lamar Jackson in the first half up until this point this season Brock has been all about his running ability he played very well from the pocket in the first half he had ten rushing yards in that first half Whitfield a little smoke screen out to the edge gets out to the 20yard line maybe the 21 so that's a good start to the second half offensively for Florida State eight yard gain and Dalvin cook is out there to begin the second half with his teammates but seven carries two receptions in the first tab so nine total touches for a player that averages 172 and a half allpurpose yards per game 13 rushes twenty pastas not the kind of balanced ideal for this team and their front as well here's his first cut to the second half and he picks up four and a first half and that's a little better movement right well you're seeing so much pressure from Louisville it's about targeting if you're that offensive line and not from the penalty standpoint but making sure you target your block you got your man you've got your movement less thinking more reacting on that offensive line control zone push there even cook the opportunity to find the crease play action for Golson pressure coming back pedal and just play stick to the sideline the past pressure has been a huge factor so far for Louisville in that defensive front it continued there with Sheldon rankin's in Devante fields and they felt good about it they like that matchup Todd Grantham did and that sound that's just a fourman rush and out on the edge you have beaten the redshirt freshman Kelly that time Robert Johnson is feet off spit snap meet with the quickness and the technique in the hands at this front for Louisville not just been the Blitz best it's been them and their oneonone matchups they've won as well here comes the Blitz on second down Golson beats it out to the edge there goes cut Dalvin cook takes a man miss and he's out to the 45 yard line for his bump down got to the 46 chunky Williams came on a Blitzer help push up and cook out that was danger zone we ever played zone blitz teams especially professionally you tried to diagnose and run away from that zone pressure in that time in essence that's what they do with Galvin they get him out on the perimeter in Louisville is frankly a little bit thankful that that wasn't even a bigger play Alvin cook turns the corner inside the 40 thousand cut to the pie for an FSU so this handbag this is the first time all afternoon 15 is you got a flow aggressive defense and you show that zone one way in you can allow cook through the different connector you knew he was going to get more than seven touches in the first half that eventually being the closer than he is he was going to get 15 or 20 here in the second half or he shows you why he's number two behind Leonard fournette freak show that's his ninth rushing touchdown of the season the average length of Dalvin cook touchdowns this season 44 yards he is the definition of a home run hitter he hit one right there we are back with a look back at our Panera trot Panera Bread Drive recap and rockier this was finally Florida State getting Dalvin cook involved and he made the pledge it's why Jimbo's crew has been so good in the third quarter forty one to seven now forty eight to seven on disease and out story people and it's good at the play call was and his excellent as the run was Betty is for rendus tackling a pitiful that's something you do not see in the first thirty minutes you want to talk about sleepwalking you once they forward of state did in the first half of this game well that was feeling good about yourself with first half execution and not bringing your stinger defensively to finish five missed tackles from your best players on that cook touchdown run it's an NFC battle week six Monday Night Football at 8:15 Eastern Eli Manning and the Giants make the ride down the New Jersey Turnpike to take on DeMarco Murray and the Eagles coverage begins with Monday night countdown insects also streaming live on watch ESPN afive play 87yard touchdown drive now has to be answered Lamar Jackson and this young Louisville offense in the stadium that's awake now Brandon right slit right up the middle and turned back no gain on first down Nile Lawrence temple we've had a terrific game so far for Florida State another tackle the best game in the Seminole that he had ever blade he's a fifth year senior that is a workaholic way behind some NFL studs himself in four years one Drive earlier about his ass technical loss in a sack and that time just only the point of the pack and it's most of last season when he thought of pectoral muscle against Clemson so good for the knoll to have him back the cost of Bonifant quarterback the quarterback and he leaps for about three maybe four yards but third down coming up for Louisville Jacob you made the tackle third down and seven the old position and taking care of the football expert critical in a situation with a third down just like this fourman rush Jackson eats the play alive uses the stiff arm maintains his balance and runs for a first bound that really is the first time that you've seen Jackson really being able to break the containment just a fourman rush there from Florida State and Josh sweat for one of the first occasion he made his own freshman mistake coming up the field losing contain given Jackson the opportunity out in space where he is most comfortable and most dangerous the ACC Rookie of the week the last two consecutive weeks he has run for over a hundred yards three times this season and it's time he'll pull it under and turn the corner the Marcus Walker chasing him but he pumps into LaMarcus Brutus and picks up nine he doesn't mind sticking his shoulder in there we saw it earlier is well in a little zone Reid he's not just going to duck out of bounds they actually gave him 10 and a first down he got right to the first down marker Florida GaN Florida guy and don't think the dead Florida background doesn't come into play here Seminole players knew about him knew how dynamic he was in high school bigtime player out of South Florida look at these guys he's very familiar with low snap play action Jackson wide open at the sideline but for a gain of only a yard maybe to Charles Stanbury makes his first catch it will be second down and long well Jimbo Fisher told us he tried to recruit them our Jackson and recruit him as a quarterback not as an athlete and as a player that was going to try to bring in and make a slot receiver or some type of an hback that he believed he could play quarterback at this level the most composure I've seen in six games out of him and he's got to do it most importantly for the final 45 minutes of this game when it matters the most over the middle wide open and running free in the secondary and get to the 30yard line is Reggie Boniface so the backup quarterback playing a role in the offense picks up 23 and once again some zone coverage year in Florida State just undisciplined with some of their eyes in that zone you know they claim a little bit more zone maybe been normal because they want their eyes in the backfield in the quarterback we saw another couple of the vertical touchdown pass was that time he backed out of that field they lost the feel there from the underneath what a response removal huh trying to answer the touchdown here's Bonifant inside the 20yard line close to another Louisville first down we check in with that man all right Bob thank you very much I want to tell you what's happening right now with Paxton Lynch and Memphis against Ole Miss Lynch to Anthony Miller here and by the way Robert candy cues out with a head injury so I'll blow there for the rebels 24:14 ABC and ESPN to Louisville needs a touchdown to retake the lead today they were 14 of 20 for scoring touchdowns in the red look they're looking for the end zone here wide open right up against the sidelines is James quick with a late flat throw and quick has his second touchdown reception I told you at halftime they're going to pick in this second half on Tyler hunter when there is an opportunity because James Coley in Miami did is a week ago score on the play after the play unforced enlike number one of the defense he's a guy that is a nosy defender he likes to play in the nickel and around the linebacker image will be enforced on the kickoff and he is much better going forward than he is playing in space and in coverage Miami picked on him and you knew the one stray Marshall is out of this game because that's normally going to be him and that's the right call the foolish mistake getting beat twice but he's a guy that is going to be tested here in the second half and in a chess match the Bobby Petrino and his crew for one heck of a response in this building but the true freshman quarterback lamar jackson after his team falls behind and the dope wakes up marches his team right down the field to retake the lead this is Louisville back on top by a point 1413 at number 11 struggling at home welcome back college football on ESPN courtesy of Captain Kent peril of the peril commandos that parachuted into Doug Campbell stadium before the game started at lit the crowd up Louisville though has quieted them down more than once and they are quiet once again 1413 the Cardinals on top of the Seminoles Bible Shuzhen alongside Rock Huard Shannon spake down in the field and now it's back rock on the Florida State offense to see if they can respond kicking off from midfield is Wallace so he sends it right through the back of the end zone after Tyler hunter picks up the personal foul on the touchdown let's take a look at our weekly rankings brought to you by chickfila and there are some games that will be played today that will shake this up separation separation Saturday elimination games ever you want to say it with the playoff committee looming here in just several couple short weeks November 2nd they will be being meeting in Dallas and this Saturday won't we remember this Michigan State take care of business encounter cook step up on this Florida respond to the loss of their quarterback in Caen Alabama play a spread defense Kevin Sumlin am am and can defensively they hold their own lay action forever goals and to start this drive flips a screen against that aggressive rush the Dalvin cook who breaks a tackle this time though he's able to be bottled up a point fought his way from 5 yards had to break a couple of tackles to pick up five James Burgess eventually helped wrestle them to the crowd but he is tough to bring down oneonone so physically strong means 208 pound loves the weight room and he just got that tremendous balance and lower leg strength that you try to wrap up high it's like Leonard fournette you're going to be embarrassed Dolson on a roll out second down and five again forced to throw it to the sideline to try and avoid a sack as we check in with Shannon spake well Bob you guys have mentioned Dalvin cook and that ham spring he's been favoring and nursing back they limited him this week in practice and during each time the offense is on the sideline they're working on him they're just stretching him out keeping him loose they didn't give him any therapy during the halftime it was just a little bit more of the same keeping him as loose as they can has to be such a difficult injury to try and nurse a player through when his whole game is about being explosive the one advantage is not having him strength and being athletic Tucker down Mikey Travis Rudolph is in motion Dolson look in that way starts to look at the rush once again tucks it under and put up a side line that's a blown coverage get the loose with Whitfield down the sideline I step to the end zone 17yard touchdown to put Florida State back on top what of all this beautiful coverage excellent initially but when you got a dialog every golsan who you just see it week after week is growing in confidence it's about that second round it's a scramble drill and this has really come into play the last couple weeks to the wonderful job determined to help his buddy out he's on the crossing rock and a peep over and he can feel upward straddling and he preps around he doesn't Nene DeWitt's around and he just answers once again the two big plays for Florida State here in the second half Dalvin cook with an edge rush and he's one of the best edge rushers in America and Whitfield got loose as Everett go that extended to play 70 yard touchdown and the Aguayo point after they could a sixpoint lead for FSU once again now it's back on the freshman quarterback and Lamar Jackson respond he'll be back out there when we return down by six welcome back to the ACCC on ESPN and welcome back to Tallahassee called tomorrow NFL insiders begins Sunday with the latest injury news and early breaking stories of n a.m. give a fantasy lineup to cent that's where you need to be next up it will be Sunday NFL countdown with boomer and the boys providing indepth analysis on every game it all starts tomorrow morning 10:00 a.m. on ESPN also streaming live on watch ESPN he's got the week off with Jameis Winston making his way back to his old stomping ground here and built a noble Stadium and once again the Seminoles have believed gravy on Samuel from about the one barely gets across the 15 reflect they'll mark them out at the 17 yard line with celebrating its 11th year is sponsoring the good and he'll donate all state makes contributions to participating university general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kick today allstate has contributed millions in scholarship fund in an offense where 58% of the overall production comes from freshmen answer again on the road here at fellas from our JAXA not a keeper a couple of yards retching Northrop held the edge we've had that aspect of the game pretty well control today and frankly Louisville you know it's been such a staple three 100yard rushing games already for Lamar this season that run game will fall quarterback run and their zone read his big big part of their playbook but not today been much more about the passing game and attacking some of the vulnerabilities in smoke and by the way number one Tyler hunter out of the game richard senior gving elliott in his spot in the nipple ain't pass incomplete on the slant to James quick I'll ask you the same question I am Bobby Petrino yesterday if you bottle up Lamar Jackson and if you take the run game away any mean win from the pocket from what you've seen so far today yeah can he win this game for Louisville throwing the football as a standard quarterback walk yes and I think some of that is also about that nickel vulnerability for Florida State they went right after the backup year Elliott Cardinals before parade on third down and they'll go conservative here trapping a handoff and almost reaching his way for the first down is Brandon Radcliff where do they put the ball down he may have gotten it with that last reach of the football he gets the favorable spot and a Louisville first down and that's why he's the captain Ainge is all about effort his role also a little bit this season been diminished monofin is going to probably take more carries away from him but he does not out much like he had a quarterback who knocked out it he's just responding doing the job Green going nowhere Jalen Ramsey well he sifts that one out fast and Jamari staples has brought down by Ramsey for a loss of the belief to James quick loaned his helmet and so now he has to go to the sideline he looks like he's shaken up oh I'm praying he fighting through the block written the helmet ooh quick off and he takes a shot right to the face production another swing path this one thrown behind Jaylon Smith it'll be third down and 13 and can he win inside the NACO box you just asked me that as you did Bobby yes I think he can but what he has to understand in high school you can get it get away for the bathro a little bubble screen and you can live for second down all of a sudden use your athleticism to make a difference on the road against the top 10 team and this deep end the way they run the attention to detail and sense of urgency has to be there every single family only a three man roster he has a pocket to throw from any convert third down and long Jaylon Smith comes up with a gain of 15 a terrific throw by Lamar Jackson well in that time and everybody's taking a little bite of the Apple here in his own defense that time it's the veteran north throat you you're right Russ tree dropped eight and his eyes get caught with the underneath round on third and 13 you got to know if you're a played at that second level you don't bite on anything underneath North repellers and Jackson makes them pay Jackson's been perfect on third down Louisville 6 / 10 now our little read option he gets popped after a gain of two and a half you how impressive the response and this is why he is under center he's not one of these early enrollees that came in January you see them working on quick on the sideline right like freshmen in other places around the country Josh Rosen's UCLA wasn't early enrollee had all spring he didn't he stepped on the scene summer school classes in June very quickly they realized in talking yesterday to Gareth McGee that we this kid gets it he absorbs it play as fast as he can run more than anything's got the gut to respond rolls out here on second down tries a cutback and get to the 45 yard line for a gain of a couple more Newton's a once again it will be third down Lawrence temple again need to stop for Florida State Louisville is six for 10 on third down and it's third down and five and this to me if it feels like pressure you've been beaten in zone on a couple of different occasions down you know there is some areas in Charles Kelley the coordinator doesn't necessarily want to see the ball go to in going to man but this just feels like an opportunity in this area of the field to heat it up if you bring a blitz though in this quarterback get loose that could be dangerous he doesn't see the pressure coming off the edge the Blitz works perfectly for Florida State Derwin James litup Lamar Jackson Florida State got the football all the way back in the Louisville 36 and that my friend is why you heat up a true freshman a secondary Blitzer not somebody within the natural tackle box nope it's at 44 freakish speed from James coming and he's not just coming to land a sack he's coming to knock a guy out and in the process knocks the ball out clean and that's to true freshman Derwin James creates the fumble Josh sweat gets the recovery and it's a turnover that really hurts Louisville and they are going to go to instant replay just to make sure that Lamar Jackson's arm wasn't coming forward and getting another look that looks like pretty black and white there that's the fumble I'm not even sure that he had completed pulling the ball back completely much less bringing his arm forward after reviewed and rolling on the field is confirmed fumble recovered by but Brock you called it you would bring a blitz there rather than play coverage on third down they had been burned they bring the Blitz and create a turnover eventually enough is enough you do yes there is some risk associated with lifting because they can hit a big play but after being bounced and after giving up a third and 13 and giving up a red zone touchdown pass time for you to also trust your athletes as Kelly does and Prince the coordinator winds up Jeff Macke so Everett Golson best field position to start a drive today for Florida State and they run a reverse Golson tries to get a block and it doesn't work Whitfield got nowhere to go and does well the tippytoe down the sideline and minimize the damage he loses only in yard Sheldon Rankin's helped stay home and blow up a trick play by Florida State that's you're anticipating fast flow you're anticipating a turning momentum the Louisville was going to bring one of their books is that they have brought all day and instead they stay home and they say with some discipline and do their job and how critical just a field goal would be here for Florida State get more than that one possession lead in your own building against the freshman quarterback Dalton who a triple team to the 30yard line Travis Rudolph make the catch and a plaque comes out me brown on the hit he tells he lost his helmet personal foul targeting number one defense missing our family the play is under review sokeep Brown hit with targeting you can hear the faithful in this building who watched ray Marshall get a jet through the week ago defenseless player yeah forcible contact to the neck or head area yes hold correctly on the field absolutely and more than likely you don't change your your strike zone and your your impact zone mr. Brown you can be lost for the rest of this afternoon and the start of the next one in the first half just got to do the best you can and is it completely as vicious as some that we have seen no but you just have to do what you can in that moment with your head up to change your strike zone that's one I don't see a receiver tipping and I know there are times and former defensive players he worked with Matt Millen last year and you can hear Chris Spielman and those guys get so furious because the game is so fast and to think in slowmo that you can change always where you're hitting on that thing the play is happening in front of you the whole time and you're looking at exactly what the replay guys right now on their video stream are taking a look at and they're trying to determine where that forcible contact is and I think this call stands and these are the actual replays that they are seeing in the booth communicating with the fields and here's the call after review the ruling on the field stands is called targeting number one defense position first down number one Louisville in to qualify let me be clear here I never hit a thing okay I was never in that moment of truth like these linebackers are aware it's happening so fast but I have seen enough change of course of players both professionally in at the collegiate level who know when that defenseless player is there is that guy was sitting there you do have to get through the sternum or the rib cage with your shoulder vest and you cannot go to that head or neck area you wanted to change a strike zone but no matter what strike zone Keith Brown was targeting there he was using his helmet to do it as well Calvin cook gets outside another gear for Calvin cook any bruises into the end zone with another seminal sunset junka that's what he does better than anybody else in the fence another court has more powerful and probably stronger but as far as Joe cotton once again outside the tackle right there liquid Alvin that's just a little hesitation and that's the best tackler on the team an SEC starter in Josh Harvey Clemens at Georgia a couple years ago and he embarrasses him that little subtle move that little subtle cut not one wasn't even the full jump cut it was just a little bit of that quick dead leg and it's over we hit lateral movement to explosion tell me a better back in the country in Dalvin cook now it's a two touchdown lead for Florida State and a big response needed now from this young Louisville offense we'll find out if they can do it after we check in with that man he's been to Bob at net thanks very much the Buckeyes live by their two quarterback astac Cardale Jones James Barrett take on Penn State's defense tonight at 8:00 on ABC also streaming live on watch ESPN we talked a lot about Dalvin cook talked a lot about center cornet Ezekiel Elliott needs to at least be in the conversation fourth in the nation in rushing with 835 yards he has run for a hundred or more yards in the Buckeyes six games this season he also has ten touchdowns is that right now not only the twoheaded monster and a quarterback for Ohio State but the three best running backs in America we've got one in our game today for Nettie Kelly oh yeah I think of Derek Henry and you go up against an A&amp;M crew that's a little salty in their defensive line and his opportunity to continue unfortunately sadly we lose Nick sharp a week ago yes this is the year the running back in college football it is not the year the quarterback corbin lamb from the eight he makes the move down to sideline and it took awhile that pumps them out at the 40 so the kicker the job when a good return and let's take a look at our AT&amp;T strong performance and fighting through a hamstring injury that sees the still be slowing him down at times Dalvin cook a so 50 is high player of the second half I mean you see guys just reaching it they're almost making business decisions on Dalvin cook and you're you're going to be embarrassed that's what's going to happen if you don't breathe the full force of what he's done at you you overbid in that first half and not here play action for lamar jackson he throws at the length of a field looking for James quick who had fallen down so the interception into the hands of JD and Elliot Elliot in replacing Tyler hunter getting a chance to play he runs under it and gets a pick and you signed the check who's paid Mandy likes to say on any interception because the ball leaves your hand but unfortunately here for quick he's a cosigner he gets bumped he gets knocked down and that ball is already out of the hands of Jackson when he makes that decision and by the way he's even when he when he throws that ball he is even and he's expecting the fastest Cardinal receiver to be leaving and unfortunately he stumble leaving the interception on mr. Jackson's ledger bad break for looool quick ball down Elliot there for the interception and after taking a twotouchdown lead Florida State right back to the office and right up the middle cook to the 25 winning another injured cardinal that's keep Kelsey so one of their starters at inside linebacker now down after on the last possession Keith Brown a starter an outside linebacker ejected for targeting let's go back to add man all right add net thanks very much see if Kelsey with the help of the training staff can shake off whatever this injury is Florida State with a two touchdown lead he's their captain he's the voice right in the middle of their defense we're not called his name an awful lot a bunch because Florida State decided to throw it in that first half a lot more than established the run but he's the leading tackler he is the captain they're working on the neck there he's just in the middle of that pit right now mr. cook is getting busy may it's become a really physical game and probably no surprise and I can't reiterate enough how impressive Jimbo is coming out in this third quarter 1st quarter on the season 44 to 6 because it his planning and his scripting you come out in third quarter 41 to 7 on the season that is making those adjustments in 20 minutes at halftime calming everybody down as you said to Shannon going into break and getting your best player involved known in that first half that mr. Grantham probably dictated too many play call pass you know out balance or imbalance you know the overall run game down here in the second half three possession three touchdowns second and sue with the second leading tackler in the ACC keep Kelsey on the sideline shake it up here's Alvin cook again to the edge hopped out of bounds by chunky Williams when he picks up another first down Dallben cooking averages 11 point one yards per run outside the tackle and over a hundred and four yards per game outside the tackle both secondbest in America 116 yards and two touchdowns now for Dallben cook this time he's brought down right at the line nothing here and there goes keep Kelsey back to the locker room for Louisville play action for Golson lifts it out to the edge to pretty Stevenson he's got him step to midfield I think you're going to see another penalty here Guinea Golson hitting him high the ball is too sweeping the same is no foul roughing the passer number 93 15 penalty added to the end of the play first Devante fields was once the big 12 Defensive Player of the Year TCU I don't know about that I don't like that goal okay I was on the receiving end at some of those and in that that was not vicious he beats rods Johnson once again as a sack around having to tough half ternoon at times and pass bro you'll beat him cleanly hits him with his shoulder a good acting job by Golson Olivet get deserve 15 so after all is said and done it's a 32 yards play Dalvin cook close to the 30yard line coming into today pretty fascinating and a real credit to our crew of putting this together miss Carolyn in particular look at the numbers here over the last 200 carries between Galvan cook and Leonard fournette I mean they are nearly identical in their overall production that's the one that stands out to me and that's going to be attitude after this afternoon and his long touchdown run about 45 yards of those after contact the rears again down to the 28 yard line three yard game brings up third down and about four and this will take us inside of a minute to go in the third quarter I don't think anyone right now would say that Leonard fournette should not be the Heisman winner he seems to be the clearcut favorite before you start to think about the other guys that are going to be in that conversation the rest of the season now the cooks going to be right there to stay healthy I had a little juice to that I mean the biggest voice in college football for perp Street said the same thing last week both start offense number 15 fiveyard penalty they're down Jimbo's said to us yesterday if you can hear him yell and some my job to promote it's his play will dictate that but they keep one independently they run Rudolph they keep winning because of him he will be in New York City now here's a huge play for the Louisville defense you've got an automatic field goal kicker just about in Aguayo and it would still be a two possession game even if Aguayo kicks a field goal but it's a two touchdown lead right now for Florida State might not quite be in field goal range yet if Louisville can get a stop defensively might still have a chance Everett Golson under some pressure throws it up the seam off his back foot Travie threw Thomas there did he zoom it up he did for a first down at the 20 yard line Golson along in as long as he possibly could to deliver that tack this looks a lot like certain days last week of sitting in the hole you have everything around you right you can feel that pocket being suffocated and you have got to stand strong and that words about 5 foot 11 use not your 65 prototypical guy but he's got the same heart and the same guts right there and much like against Miami a third down conversion engine steadily one May 7th same entering the court we return to Tallahassee where you're watching the ACC on ESPN we start the fourth quarter with Florida State having scored three touchdowns on three possessions in the third quarter and looking for a fourth and four straight possessions Papa Susan Brock Dewart Shannon's fake and the Knowles just about to enter the red zone although Dalvin cook get stood up and stop it about the 22 yard line by James Burgess let's check in with Shannon well Bob that last 13 yard pass by Everett Golson is a perfect example according to Dalvin cook as sort of the confidence and you've seen from his quarterback he said at the beginning of the season select plays like that would not happen he wouldn't sit in the pocket he wouldn't be able to throw downfield a perfect example of how he's kind of coming into this often I would agree with that she and I'll take it a step further it's not just confidence it's knowing where everybody is hey remember this isn't fantasy football where you just plug and play a guy he's got to learn an entire system he's got to learn a new language a new foe style system and have the ability to know where everybody is on the field so even if I can't see and I'm blocked in in the pocket I know where my guys going to be throws it away here it avoids the sack and why is Jimbo Fisher's so good for quarterbacks who that's a deep question at least historically his quarterbacks have always played very well for him he is a fantastic play caller first and foremost and that's why you know Mike Holmgren to me was the best play caller on side of my dad in high school that I had ever played for a stick number good cover Scott linning it was right there collegiate Lee I had the good fortune of playing with some really good play callers in Jimbo get guys in the right position secondly he instills incredible confidence in belief in that position because of that skillset you got this what are you afraid of go pull the trigger and get it on and Louisville get a stop though on third down breaking free and cook how about that effort right at the first down marker it looked like they had them bottled up at the line that's going to be it looks like without measurement of Florida State first down on third and 11 from outside the 20 well there's a little bitter a better picture of some of just that lateral explosion once again in that lower body Lake strength and why these guys do all the squats and cleans and everything else that play bottles down there is no panic and he just explode and a timeout called by Bobby Petrino from the sidelines I don't think he liked his defense as some of the big bodies were milling about a little bit weren't quite set when Florida State was ready to snap the ball so he called timeout from the sidelines and will step aside as well back and tell a see after the Louisville timeout and the only hope you would think right now for the Cardinals procured is to hold the field goals keep it a twopossession game but their defense is played on their heels and they look gassed first and goal from the 10 for Florida State empty backfield for Everett Golson quarterback draw for the six yard line with a flag down holding offense number 55 and yard penalty percent and that's the big guard getting inserted here my bet his second start with Kareem are out of the game he's pulling their little QB draw gets his hands outside the frame where it's a big physical man at 330 pounds clothes just too big grab the arm of Devante fields and spun them down so now its first and goal from the 20 I'll say it one more thing other than just settling for a field goal if you're Louisville and you've taken the ball away and 17 straight games that's also gotta be in your defensive mindset right here a little hit Whitfield inside the 15 to the 13 yard line before Shaq Wiggins another Jordan transfer of random out excuse me 21 straight games this defense has forced a take away and you get down here 13 minutes to go in the ball game and your offensive group is giving it away a couple times and I know you without a few of your defenders but this may also be a time where you are extra aggressive trying to get that first takeaway from the Florida State offense has played five games and three quarters without given to the way one goal sit on a roll out looking ends up throws it away boy he took another big hit Stacy Thomas came up and Wallops Golson as he exposed his sternum to throw the football save some real estate by taking that shot though now it's third down and goal from the 13th touchdown the check down to throw it away touchdown if you've got it and it's clear check down if it's not and then you throw it away and you save those three points he has built Blake turnover free football for the better part of six games fourman rush Colson to the end zone he's got a sec down credit through down in blue and Florida State add to their lead you asked me earlier what set them apart wire is quarterback so productive I told you play Colin and this is a beautiful little corner post you get into the red zone here and you show that corner around an awful lot Moodle the corner he comes back to the post and Harvey Clemens is inches away but it was all about the route running it was all about the play call in and then ultimately the execution for Golson who has been on fire in this second half and Jimbo Fisher Jimbo Fisher pointed out Travis Rudolph Shula specifically yesterday out of his wide receiver group he said he is becoming a really good route runner his true talent is starting to emerge now it's a 20 point lead lots of great places with the palm trees in the background to take a selfie here in Tallahassee on the campus of Florida State and it has been a pictureperfect afternoon weatherwise and a pictureperfect second half for the Seminoles for touchdown to the second half for Florida State to open up a 34 14 lead over a Louisville team that has the lead by a point at halftime Lyle with a line drive kick scooped up at the 17 yard line let's go to Shannon Bob Rock already told you how they monitor Dalvin cook at practice this week and they did so using a GPS catapult system now most athletes if you run or you bike your GPS is a watch but for Florida State players it looks like this it goes inside their pads and literally on the sidelines during practice on an app the head athletic trainer had all of Dalvin cook numbers his explosive plays how many yards Heat he went in that practice and as soon as he breached his limit they cut him off now over 90 players wear this during practice and the game Jimbo Fisher says cut down on injuries and overtraining it's a very interesting way to manage the pitch count for a great player as Bonifant on the swing path picks up a Louisville first down and for the rest of the season Brock that's probably what it's going to be about at times for Jimbo Fisher and that offensive coaching staff with Alvin Cook is we have a flag down on the play personal foul chop block number two number 74 the often that penalty half the distance to the goal first and goal wipe away the gain for Bonifant and that will back Louisville up to their own 12 yard line well my catapult really does two things number one it's acceleration number one is Shannon said it's every bit of your data to show your workload and win the back down but number two it also tells Jimbo Fisher when they're not working it when your heart rate is not up when you are not pushing it like they know you're capable of it winwin and many programs utilizing it in Florida State and it's apart of the prior back swing from the five double clutches down the sidelines it sails it over the head of Jaylon Smith let's go back to Edmund Burke alright thank you very much Bob this will not being you an old lady after a handful of Memphis here comes Chad Kelly but Quan Treadwell who earlier threw for a touchdown it's now a 10point game on ABC ESPN 2 and coming up cannot wait for this game in the big house marked in Tony on the Spartans taking on the Wolverines will happen for you right here Bob back to you that is going to be a war between Michigan and Michigan State second down at 15 little read option and a handoff to Brandon Radcliff maybe if they are but Derrick Hopkins first on the scene for Florida State it's a pretty remarkable turnaround here in the second half and just the energy level with which the Seminoles are playing defensively and that stinger that was just lost at halftime for Louisville they were the more physical team they were the one finishing tackle completely turned here in the second frame no quickly back to Michigan Michigan State how great is it in the big ten to have a game like that but doesn't involve Ohio State for one a long time just feels like the big pan is back to being so much deeper and providing those great matchups in third and 14 and it's about to get worse for Louisville at the false start both Florida often players moving before the five yards there down players multiple and you could see there and Bobby Petrino knew this coming into the game and a half time in salmon but you got to play with the lead to think that you're going to overcome right now with the two freshmen tackled the freshman quarterback getting this been you a touchdown touchdown and now a three touchdown deficit the predict from the goal line he's got a hookup all the way out to midfield and more Mickey crumb on third down gets to the 46 or check that fully completing has the completion what a throw by Lamar Jackson if you're going to do it you might as well attack their freshman in that time that was Derwin James had the enormous a fumble earlier but they're you playing in a zone coverage just a step late just a little bit in between there didn't know whether the collision or go for the football dipping in between and now an errant throw for James quick it'll be second down and 10 but the bomb a Louisville fan I've seen plenty through these last few games including even maybe in a loss today from Lamar Jackson to say I've got a young quarterback that can really grow and develop with Bobby Petrino's Kohi he's not deer in the headlights and he is going to respond but I think you also see right there a perfect pearl we call that a cereal box he had a cereal box to hit 40 yards down the field get it and then you come back on the very next play and you throw in a little plot route where your margin for error is enormous and he throws it merely into the ground now this ball sails on him and send it for tomorrow staples and there's a flag down in the offensive backfield on the parcel now rum and apat the number 16 of the defense 15yard penalty first half Jacob Pugh for Florida State picking up a 15yard earlier with Golson one that I thought was a little bit of a love tap but he slopped to the face you're going to draw 15 Jackson throws one up for grabs in the end zone back pylon for quest of the Abbott it looks like he does the officials confirm it's the Louisville touchdown what a throw from Jackson then James swing for the third time today that combination hooks up for a score that time that is on Brutus the redshirt senior safety and quick showing you that he has got the most speed of this receiving core and once again that is a cereal box file that one from about 55 yards in the air trajectory wise and couldn't put it in any better spot the ball can contact the ground as James quick goes down as long as they don't see that ball moon that he's got control of it and it certainly seemed like he had controlled through the catch and the officials say yes touchdown third touchdown reception for James quick well he responds to adversity and that's what you love to see that's what you have to see the true freshman not rattled moment not too big I turn it over make a mistake I'll flush it and I'll come back and keep shooting go done tonight after Arizona State Utah even locked into SportsCenter at night a full breakdown of the day in college football club highlights and postgame coverage of Jays Royals and Game one of Cubs Mets SportsCenter at night after ASU Utah on ESPN streaming live on watch ESPN a little light breathe back into the game by Louisville a twopossession game with a lot of time still on the clock Thurmond looks field we'll take a NIEM we check in with that man Burton well a lot better at man and the Louisville defense has been in the second half of this game four drives four touchdowns for Florida State now they have to have a stop to get their offense the ball back play action forever coasted on first down looking downfield under pressure flag down in the backfield as Golson throws it away Brock what's the impact that last punch down you have holding offense number 74 penalties decline second half on this Louisville defense well sir give them a little bit alive ago they were on the field to a degree and in a game that you look at with that last touchdown Florida State if you're a defensive member of Louisville and say oh man I just don't know I just can't imagine that's overcoming it and then BAM Sam supposed to play I just got to bring some energy I mean their energy in the second half it's been dumbfounded to me they weren't on the field the entire first half and it came out and endowment cook established the physical smashes and they just they haven't bothered that's like Florida State's going to handle the five yards and that will work out for Bobby Petrino it'll be second down and 15 false start offense number 13 five yards second down normally on a holding penalty seems like 99 times out of a hundred a coach will take the 10 yards this time Bobby Petrino's took sit down but then Florida State commits a fiveyard penalty the best case scenario second and 15 now them cook bounces it outside look out that might be a horsecollar tackle he was pulled down right at the first down marker by Josh Harvey Clemens no flag comes out at first blush it looked like he may have gotten him on a horsecollar tackle which is a dangerous life and remember we had to play earlier than B this has to be an immediate action to the ground that is where they define that fall is that grabbing the grab him by the collar it is it immediately in forcibly ripped in backwards not what is a judgment call and Jimbo wants a call but that is he intended enrolled area it's got to be the back of the collar which it was and it's got to be deemed to be immediately drawing him backwards and ripping into the ground it was a first down carry and Dalvin cook into the secondary again nine more to Florida stay in the unity illegally Thomas make the stop it with Delvin earlier this season when we were here and here waiting through the action it was it absolutely would Calvin come down the sidelines again South Florida and the defender had grabbed for him and just could not pull him down and that's kind of ran through to that act in that action that is a judgment call in that moment to that side edges referees are making him look at a forceful action to rip him backwards and rip him down and their estimation not Jimbo's they feel differently cook again it's time to tackle for loss and now what feels like an absolute must coming up for the Louisville defense they afford third down and four DeAngelo Brown made the tackle on down them cook they have to get a stop to have any hope in some credit there as well two by two Bay we're not said his name much meal right there defensive end you asked how would these group respond well Brown the redshirt junior to senior 44 Sheldon Rankin those guys are continuing complained Marv between tacos the damage has been done outside on the perimeter majority of its second half go to the throw on third down Bobo Wilson's got a first down at the 48 yard line remain Washington they're in coverage but it's a third down conversion from Florida State and that will allow them to continue to work on the clock anticipation Shannon talked about confident Dalvin cook and told her about in the growth that the anticipation watch just to fill in route they stack the receivers again and it's just a quick little hitch so watch when this ball is out the boats not out of his hand week number one or two that early it's simply not but the more repetition the more times he sees that the more confidence has to fold up trigger even quicker more this offense benefit hook stumbles and goes down right at the line of scrimmage Washington game aggressively to force him to make that move Florida State wins the ACC if ever golson's play continues to grow every week and grows to the talent of a Dalvin cook alongside of them I don't think he's game this is not going to be the number one pick in the draft he is a different quarterback in this is a different system but if he plays with this kind of guts and Jameis has got to love what he's seen in the second half if Deborah has really responded playing between the tackles playing faster with anticipation they could be Clemson and when the ACC if he doesn't and take some steps backward they won't wide receiver hitch appeal to the sideline highstepping with a safari and another Florida State because you know when you have seen in his claims he's gotten better each week at his best game I think last week against Miami and this one even better his elite quarterbacks elevate the people around him kermit Winfield is having the best season in his career and he can think every Golson for it and this is a career day for Kermit with B would be over 150 yards or darn near close to it third down conversions and just some of that you know relationship that's being cultivated and you're watching the merge week to week Alvin cook an extra here to the edge again and again he reached back I think with a hamstring he pushed it to the outside and that might do it for the afternoon for Dalvin cook who knows he reaches back to grab that left hamstring again as he got to the sidelines times have you seen this with running backs because I haven't I haven't seen three game tapes of someone that continues to force their way through them at the professional level you're out and you're going to be out until you are a hundred percent you could miss two three four weeks he's deciding not to do that to the benefit in the need of the team I mean he is continuing to fight and plow through an injury that keeps most guys off the field Chuck has Patrick a true freshman in at tailback now and this play blown dead at the line on second down and one you convert ball toy oven number 74 five yards second down that's going to drive Jimbo Knutson will tomorrow and Nolan coach Drecker we've already documented that but have you seen guys plan through hamstring injuries week after week after week after week no not not normally you will err on the side of caution especially as you know at the professional level and allow a guy to spend a couple of weeks out of the lineup he'll but the regular season in this sport is the most important regular season in all of sports and he plays like it here's the true freshman Jack as Patrick and his son he's got well behind the line to bay and Burgess were there for Louisville and Florida State right on the verge of field goal range for Roberto a while Matt Alvin cook continues to be as good as anyone in America especially getting to the edge because he's willing to do it between the tackles even if it's for 1 or 0 knowing that he's got that elite bounce to get it out on the perimeter third down and a long 10 close to 11 Whitfield down the sideline maintains and balanced wings the oneonone battle all the way to the pylon it looks like they'll say he's out at the 2 exactly 101 you're reaching you're ducking and that's been the second half story here and that's a good call he's going to be out at the two yardline the left foot steps out but that's a third and 15 situation you're there to make the play defensively as Louisville has been in position here in the second half and they're they're tackling has just gone from tremendous in the first half to a disaster here in the final 30 minutes Kermit Whitfield has been that onetwo punch with Dalvin cook oftentimes Dalvin cook is the weapon for Florida State but they had that complimentary piece and Kermit Whitfield timeout is called first and goal when we return FSU trying to score five straight touchdown to the second half about this doubleheader on ESPN we start at 3:30 in the big 10 pan Tonio Harbaugh Michigan State Michigan a huge game between number 7 and number 12 and then at 7 just as big an SEC showdown between undefeated number 8 and number 6 Florida and LSU both games can be seen on ESPN also streaming live on watch ESPN Chuck Hayes Patrick the true freshman is the eye back on first and goal for Florida State a little bootleg for Everett Golson flips it in the end zone for an evening sucks down to Ryan info and FSU's offense stays perfect in the second half now Jimbo feeling it he's learned his quarterback here through five or six weeks and Neiman said pretty explicitly this last week and publicly the David I found in his eyes it's on what I needed to see in that Miami game when you were down and he responded in the team responded around him not a pretty first half seven to six team is down and they come out and they play their best ball this is their best two quarters to play this year and I don't even think it's close and two second touchdown reception of the season for Ryan is though it is still a turnover free season for Everett Golson for an offense that in the second half looks a whole heck of a lot different than it did in the first half it's turnover free and it's the other side I enjoyed the conversation with Jimbo yesterday I hope you did too we're talking a lot of quarterback stories and coaches everything else play smart not scared there's an old Tom Moore line placemark not scared to make a mistake and when you're new on the scene you're trying to gain the respect of everybody sometimes just check it down he's not doing that anymore he is playing smart not scared and also policy here in the second half well there have been times this year for Florida State where it seems like their only real explosive weapon is Dalvin cook now he's dealing with a hamstring injury so I would think if I were Jimbo Fisher as the season moves on and we're two matchups away Georgia Tech and Syracuse all that separates Florida State from taking on Clemson November 7 that might be the game that decides the ACC if that is three weeks away where this offense needs to be he needs to probably have his quarterback develop the chemistry that there's some explosiveness at the wide receiver spot as well right and it's not just Alvin cook that they're depending on right alongside ever it is Thurman who has a career day today and right alongside are those two young registered freshman tight ends that you're excited about Ann Izzo with another touchdown today and all of those pieces around this is an entirely different team from a season ago you bought so many guys to the NFL and you've taken the appropriate baby steps through the month of September you're now in October you're closing in on November and you just want to get better week in and week out you play like this you're going to be Georgia Tech you're going to beat Syracuse and you play at this level you have in the second half that is going to be one heck of a knife at Clemson I'll have to do it at Death Valley again but last season they certainly did here's Lamar Jackson ball tipped at the line down by three scores once again to Marcus Walker we get into deflection sit on this side of the ball because that's the other part if you're going to be a championship team you're going to run play defense a good quarterback play they stopped the run today I mean Louisville came in here in this kid in particular lighting people up on the ground three 100yard games more rushing yards than any quarterback in the history of the program already for Lamar Jackson and they have made it a onedimensional theme wobbly pass and may have been deflected at the line as well if the Feeny can't haul it in it will be third down in tenth and there still is important to be done defensive coordinator Charles Kelly knows the Garrett McGee and Bobby Petrino can put together pretty good offensive system get him honored some few a few things deep down the field vertically there's still a work in progress in some of their zone coverage but he loves their front he loves how they play together as a group and they to do a lot of good things on this side of the ball trap a handoff to Radcliffe and it looks like he's going to get the first down by a couple of yards Road Eric Hoskins on the stop for Florida State but their offense has done just what their defense needed them to do in the second half and that was score points and a flurry and give them plenty of breathing room I give them in a lot of credit for avoiding a lot of negative plays there were a lot of throw aways today there were a lot of chests there were a lot of outlets to his hot receivers along with the game changing defining touchdown and his defense was done a pretty good job on Lamar Jackson as a rusher of making him play from the pocket we have not seen the scrambling against this Florida State defense axon that we have seen certainly last week against NC State or in any of the three games where he's put up 100 yards rushing since the play here down the sideline nice little plush throw Jaylon Smith he hauled it in no it was broken up Ramsey was there in govern he got some help from Darwin James Victor right there on the sidelines as well and I call his name much because I think like most opponents like most elite corners a Revis who you've been around a Richard Sherman that I'm around in Seattle you just don't pick on you just go the other ways in that time wonderful awareness of the scramble drill I'm getting his hand up and ripping it away he's back at corner for the first time in a couple of years there's a corner as a freshman but now after playing safety for two years his back at corner quarterback draw for Jackson and it'll be fourth down and four you think Jalen Ramsey is a safety or a corner at the neck left yeah that's a wonderful question I think for sure he is a physical the Seahawks would dress him tomorrow because of the way they play at the line of scrimmage that changed direction quickly it will be the only thing in certain systems that they will want to see there is no doubt about the physical play about the tackling about the edge support about the press man that that guy is capable of doing and you love the prototypical size that he brings to the table allamerican long jumper I mean he too is another one of these free trail athletes but I think you would want to drop them to play corner initially after the news value would be pricks are coming on fourth down Lamar Jackson running for his life and he will hoist one down the sidelines and this will carry out of bounds intended for Devante p223 to go and lourdes Dinkins it on downs there's a very conversation of head coach and freshman quarterback and relentless bobby is going to be relentless just like judo is on the other side that every single snap matter that's probably the thing that stands out to me the most about Lamar today like you'd love a lot of the arm town feel like you can spin it and they do do it just understanding against the league team you can never take a breather if you have to have the focus fundamentally the awareness on every single blitz on every single snap false start offense number fifty four five yards first down they're going to work on some presnap and lead rifles some of the cadence of Jamaican we already saw Richter kid on the sidelines the offensive line coach it'll be the animated earlier in that first half which is that communication and getting everybody on the same page free snap as Patrick just about gets back the penalty yards about three and a half on first down having said that though if you want to get your head coach your coordinator your offensive line coach off your back have the ball five times in the second half and score five Titus rights that's right that's pretty good performance from an efficiency standpoint for this Florida State offense and get McGwire in the game you only play it in the opener and these games have been tight and close for the last four or five weeks this is the first time you have really out distance yourself and you've done it against a pretty good defense in a really good front well Shawn Maguire could have transferred he's a redshirt junior in 2012 began his career at Florida State redshirting in 20132014 he's the backup to Jameis Winston so he's probably feeling in 2015 hey it's finally my time and all of a sudden Everett Golson as a fifth year senior transfer comes to Florida State and takes the job he's got one more year of eligibility next year at Florida State maybe it will be his job next season but other players would have left Sharpay and gone someplace where they knew they would have had a chance to make sure what up but he can also look at the situation and realize whatever is doing in his fifth year I didn't realize that even if I do get one year next season what Jimbo can do with this position right in the amount of talent that's around the quarterback position here pretty unique Freddie Stephenson stepped out of bounds at the 39 I'll say this as well about Jimbo there's also part of this I think they would have probably put up a little more points and had a little more productivity in the month of September at times with the comfort level with McGwire that he would have maybe operated a little more of that playbook earlier because of being here four years than ever it would have but Jimbo knew that if he was going to win a championship right in beating clemson team down the road or a Louisville team that you're down seven six or a Miami team that you're down in the fourth quarter to that you need the upside that Everett is going to bring and has brought to the table that makes sense the ceiling is higher for this office with ever gold even as they order back even if it meant a little bit of a bumpy road at times the first four or five weeks out 80 punted down to the 10 yard line well I remember the last time we were here talking to Jimbo Fisher back in week 2 so it was only summer camp at one game that he had seen Everett Golson at quarterback boy and we said you know how is it that it was that clearcut and he put it in terms I think that everyone can understand from the time you were you know seven years old going to the playground he said you used to go to the playground and play any sport about five minutes after arriving at the playground you could all look at each other and know who can play and ever golsan can play yep so it didn't take him long in summer camp to capture the backing in support of his teammates long throw to the sideline from Lamar Jackson floats over the head of jail and Smith and I found the same thing happened here with Bobby Petrino and Eric McGee they had four guys and they looked at and said will Gardner threw for 300 on Florida State and a couple other guys that have started games but the stage is different I mean this guy could really throw it and beyond that he's absorbing what we're asking him to do and I would say you know watching this game today it is much more about just a singular focus on every snap than it is about whether or not he can do it because I think again Lamar Jackson's favorite target today has been changed quick and we'll see if Louisville can hurry up and at another play or two off in the last 30 seconds but this will be a Florida State win and a continuance of their undefeated season they'll get to 6 and up and this going to get them in the top 10 seperation Saturday you've got three matchups with teams in the top 12 and with this win this is their most defining win for the seminole there's their best victory of the season even better in my opinion than a week ago against Miami control in the second half and we're going to see them in the AP poll somewhere probably seven or eight and they get a couple more wins set up that Clemson game that playoff committee could very well have them in that top four they keep getting better and they beat ones in a great way that makes it official so it's a 20point win for Florida State and a perfect second half from an offensive standpoint at least with the starters on the field they had the ball five straight times and scored five straight touchdowns and Bobby knew it was going to be a difficult to that day today you just just know that with as much inexperience you too had to be proud of some of the result but ultimately the better superior more veteran team one let's go down to Shannon spake coach getting the husband a kiss from his son coach when we talked at halftime there was a laundry list of things but you wanted to see differently out of your team in a second what was the difference I think they kept their poise when we had played in the first half we were jumping anchor the morning to do so well so bad it's got to relax and play a little bit you know I'm saying we kept our poise better second half 223 yards of total offense does not scream hamstring injury but what is your level of concern with Alvin cooks injury it is it's just a strain and we keep managing it we he knows when it feels we pull him at the right times we got to keep managing somebody something going to deal with all year but he knows if we know it then he who he is after this game ever golson's development is where gets better and better there's still a lot of things that he left out there but he'd learned to manage situations he's understanding else better playing disciplined football he's making he's made smart plays in other words the big plays there he's making them but then he ain't turn the football over and getting some bad situation ball away about four times they were huge thank you folks thank you Everett Golson still has played a very clean season turnover free at Florida State as a result they're now six addo undefeated 41 21 they beat Louisville it's time now to go back to the college football scoreboard
