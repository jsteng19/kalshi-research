by throwing the football on offense and they came out here today in their first series theyve thrown on their first two downs i fully expect them to come out in a three wide repeat receiver offense

position="DT">darrell russell</person> the rookie starting at defensive end at former allamerican at southern california jumped early and the raiders were all concerned about the crowd noise being a factor for their offense theyre worried about false starts now they get a defensive lineman jumping early that makes it second in the yard <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> hit by three raiders is taken down at about the 30yard line he might have enough for a first down mclaughlin it 320 pounds was one of the lead tacklers nodine you were

quarter 11:09 to play in it you know a little bit more about <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> john this is the first game this year that he has started he was their number three back earlier in the year he came in and had some outstanding games he he broke the game open against san diego to give him a win he had the two long runs like you mentioned against tennessee and today s start for the first time this year ill also see the tris warren in the lineup another theyre good runners <person player="lamar smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lamar smith</person> is out for four weeks with a leg injury on first and ten <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> stands in the blitz is coming he gets it away mone took a big shot as <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">mike morton</person> came from outside linebacker and slanted in making a hard hit on <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> as he released the ball here comes <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">mike morton</person> number 50 from the left side of your screen right there he s coming from the outside and nobody blocks them he s going to put the pressure on <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> there the raiders have not been theyre not really a big zone blitz team the zone blitz is so popular in the league nowadays the raiders dont do a lot of zone but they will blitz one linebacker along with their four defensive linemen to give you a five man rush but <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> did get it away incomplete suckin down a ten the middle to a guy they dont throw too much max <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> the fullback turning out of the backfield and he s down to the 25yard line again on the play of about six yards <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> told us yesterday don that because the raiders play so much mantoman defense that a lot of times what that does is it puts a linebacker covering a running back and theyll he likes the matchup of his running backs on the raider linebackers and right there they had a linebacker covering <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> and he hit <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> for about a five yard gain step on the line back here as <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> again puts it up on third down swings it out this is <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> making people miss james kristen he s down to the 10 yard line again were talking about 20 to 1 of your backs now this time they have a <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety number 37 trap right there that s covering <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> but he s a little bit behind a little bit late in his coverage and they hit <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> for a good game traps got to get on him a little bit quicker net he be trapped there s no question of 15yard gain on the place in our seattle challenges for the first score of the game kirstin go ready to throw again like lockton in pursuit <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> gets away launches to the end zone and raiders are all over it defensively and so it will be second down and goal you know bob brett kowski the offensive coordinator told us yesterday he said were doing everything well on offense he s pretty happy with everything theyre doing except our red zone offense when we get down inside the 20 weve got to score more touchdowns one of the problems has been turnovers in the red zone they havent turned the ball over a lot overall but when they get down inside the 20 theyve been fumbling the ball and throwing the interceptions and this is cost kept them from getting in the end zone theyre moving the ball well now towards the end zone lunas hit 4 of 6 passes for 49 yards on second down he goes to a drop layin taken down at about the 7yard line it looks like we might have a hold on the seahawks again you know what they want to do when you get down inside that 20yard line youve got to be efficient you cant fumble you cant have penalties you cant turn the ball over youve got to be extra pillows by both teams on the play offsides by the defense number 96 there was also holding by the offense number 38 the foul is offset replay second down seems like a push but it wasnt seattle s beneficiary of that not losing the additional yardage which would come with a holding call right there s no question about that down again youve got to be efficient down here you cant beat yourself in the red zone really important when youre down here you got it you know if you continue to have to kick field goals that s gonna catch up with you eventually when you get down here it s important get in the end zone if you have to kick a field goal then the defense has done their job defense dixie in this <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> on second and goal from the 10yard line that s his offense <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> with a he makes a connection that <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> again and good veteran <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> makes the stop at about the 5yard line ward <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> is interesting when we talked to him yesterday jim talking about the intimidation factor he says it s usually early in the game the raiders try to get to you right you asked him is it to the raiders still intimidate teens and you said yeah early in the game the key is to not get intimidated early if you dont get intimidated early then they ease up on that part of it he says they wont intimidate us it s a big down now as the seahawks looking to take it in on 3rd and goal from the 4 yard line rain for wide receiver set now long he gets the ball and <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> is stopped by the raiders their defense really tightens up like lockton slowed him up and then flying over the top was <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> number 42 who ran back that fumble recovery of elwes 65 yards for a touchdown last week that was an interesting call because the seahawks for the first time in that series are in the game they came in with their four wide receivers set this is the set they opened the game against last week against denver that was the first time then they you know which is primarily a passing formation and they gave the ball their two brassard tried to run the ball <person player="todd peterson" race="white" position="K">todd peterson</person> you see kicking well hits has hit seven of nine 21 yard attempt the seahawks offense moving the ball beautifully down the field and the raider defense titans and seattle comes out of it with a field goal to take a three nothing late it looks it looks like the seahawks here s here s a on the running play now the guy that does a good job right there is number 91 <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin the tackle that always lines up on one of the guards youll see him right there hell flop from either the left are to the right guard <person player="russell maryland" race="nonwhite" position="DT">russell maryland</person> number 67 will always line up on the center that time mclaughlin did a great job of playing the block the head of the block starting to the left coming off the block and making the tackle for no gain <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin is a player that has a tremendous amount of ability there s been some criticism of him of not using that ability all of the time being a little bit inconsistent last week i believe he played his best game of the season against denver he hustled every play he was all over the field made a lot of big plays which he is capable of doing when he plays hard he s a tremendous athlete lauren <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> called him a sleeping giant when he s ready to go he said he can be a difference maker one <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> al davis looks on after making some great free agent acquisitions <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> there s a lot of criticism the raiders were picking up <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> but the guy s been an allpro quality quarterback this year he s played well and he needs been a real good addition to the football team and talking to the raider coaches and the other raider players they all like his leadership his his team type attitude he s been everything that they thought that that he would be when they signed him another kick off and another return by <person player="desmond howard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desmond howard</person> who opened the breaks it for the moment he gets across the 25 yard line and out to the 27 paulo the nfl season online at nbc sportscom this week our pool s who looks like coach of the year at the halfway point of the season plus insider gil brandt picks his biggest plays of the season and takes an early look at candidates for rookie of the year it s all at nbc sportscom how about a coach morrow who do you love me is that possible because a lot of good candidates this year the three top candidates to mayor jim fossil with the giants tony dungy with tampa bay and bill parcells with the giants are with the jets and my pick would be jim fossil id vote for him leading unless we check here is a truck around his first catch of the day all pro receiver who has been brilliant season after season that was his 43rd catch of this year knocked out of bounds by <person player="darryl williams" race="UNK" position="DB">darryl williams</person> there s kim brown right there now one of the things that that <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> told us yesterday says because we ran the ball so effectively last week against denver we feel that the seahawks will really be playing the run on defense so what were going to do is use more playaction passes where we fake it up a run to the running back and then throw the football and that s what they did there rarely do you see two teams as emotionally charged as these two teams were only met with him yesterday looking on this almost like a playoff game here s a breakaway rod <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon kaufman</person> the racism he s gonna zoun goes <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon kaufman</person> and bader s take the lead well be marker down both sides by the deep end though with gobiz decline cuts touchdown raiders what a homecoming you know after looking at the film of <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon</person> coffman play against the broncos last week at replica turin familiar because all you could see was him breaking big play that s his eighth run of the season at over 40 yards that s outstanding a lot of teams dont even have a run over 25 or 30 yards by their team al <person player="jerone davison" race="UNK" position="RB">davison</person> two gals de locas sale the longtime raider executive who talked yesterday about the difficulty when this crowd gets into it here he said it s it s a 12th man unlike no others that s right the denver s probably in rivals it it s the point after and the raiders hit the big play and take the lead seven to three well take a look at the pull back number 34 derek <person player="derrick fenner" race="UNK" position="RB">fenner</person> he s going to block <person player="chad brown" race="white" position="LB">chad brown</person> right there puts him right

that great speed and burst to take it the distance so seattle was moved the ball impressively down the field throwing you hit four of six for 49 yards in the opening drive that led to the field goal now misfiring an interception series of penalties and the seahawks find themselves set back to their 22 yard line one of the things you want to do don when you come into a hostile environment with a sellout stadium is try to take the crowd out of the game early and one of the daytime ways you do that is just courts who touchdowns in the first border that quiets the crowd down theyve done that wide receivers in the game with double tight ends max protection tight ends in the block in the throat of treacher who was a questionable starter earlier in the week trouble by annie bruised but he practice well the last couple of days and he s been a very important player the former colorado allamerican makes his 31st catch of this season the raiders are normally in a mantoman type coverage with their secondary that time they were in a zone <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> says hey im going to see mostly mantoman he said because i can eat up his own defense here now he can do it mainers come with a blitz they go to the ron and <person player="aundray bruce" race="UNK" position="DE">bruce</person> artists stuck hard as <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin has been a wall in there three hundred and twenty pounds some speculation that the raiders were looking to trade him before the deadline he expressed his great delight that he was still a raider there s mclaughlin there playing over the left guard <person player="pete kendall" race="UNK" position="OG">pete kendall</person> and what he does is he slants to the inside on that play he makes a good guess with that slant a good defense he called by the defensive coordinator and he makes the play he s a very physical player in there he feels like playing he is extremely difficult water black man you <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin third short

theyre ranked 30th in the league which is last they havent played either the run or the pass very well last week they played a lot better against the broncos and for them to be a playoff team this year and to continue to win theyre gonna have to start playing better defense and they have up to this point so far today it looks like they got things going pretty good well they first gave up yardage in that opening drive gym but then they really tightened up when they had the first hood goal on the 10 and kept him out of the end zone so a short yardage try is stopped by mclaughlin and the raiders in rick tooten comes out to punt the ball is joe pugil well pleased with his raider defense today joe told us yesterday he said you know when in the year when we were not playing good defense especially against the run he says i was shocked the first game they played against the oilers <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> had a great game against them <person player="eddie anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie</person> <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> and he says i was shocked that we played that poor lisa because coming out of training camp he says i thought we were gonna be pretty good against the way he said good run defenses usually go hand in hand with a team that has a good run offense but you practice against each other here s to hitting the ball down it has been powered at the 26 that s back nearside ran into one of his guys and again a mocker comes in every kick we turn has seen a

well also in the free agents and he says <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> throws downfield the balls on the field that was a catch waiting it up it looks like he had it as <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> who picked up a fumble and ran it back 65 yards last week against denver thought he had another names <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> had the ball for a moment you right im a little bit surprised that the seahawks are not playing more with their feet three wide receiver and four wide receiver sets that have been so successful for him here in recent weeks again that time they came out with two running backs two wide receivers they are throwing the football though these guys win by throwing a football <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> to those whitehouse they are doing that and a good call by the official is he did not get both feet down in possession that s fully at possession so it s an incomplete pass warren boot time pro bowl runner for seattle who s playing time has been limited by the much better play of <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> and <person player="lamar smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lamar smith</person> gets his first carry of the day and gets the ball to only the 11 yard line so that puts the pressure on the seahawk offense and particularly on or and <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> third down and nine right you know <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> has has been their starter this year they get a little bit of a running back controversy with <person player="lamar smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lamar smith</person> <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> and enmund <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> started doing so well he entered into that controversy but last week against the rams <person player="chris

is able to wait a little bit for place to get open and make the throw for a completion the key there was that was the protection yeah mon had time to trigger it they talk about the three qualities of a quarterback being able to get rid of it quickly having something on it when you throw it and then being accurate for all these years <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> has demonstrated all three attributes of a top passer history the league racism <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> trying to court to see hot shows his stuff youre going to see calloway come from the left side of your screen right there the guy that the seahawks normally run there reverses to they like him doing that they normally do it about one time a game the raiders said hey he s the guy we got to watch for reverses that time they didnt do a very good job of watching him they werent ready they got sucked in the longest play of this game for the seattle seahawks who trailed the raiders 14 to 6 a 44 yard play on the game 44 yard gain and now it hockley the referee wants to take an official s timeout as the ball is positioned at the 30yard line of the raiders only to an eight point lead and as erickson s team going to a very diverse system of play calling also jim right and you know they got to do that again i was like i said earlier im a little bit surprised that they havent come out and shown that three wide receiver four wide receivers set against the seahawks i use sprint against the raiders if you can spread the raiders out by deploying those wide receivers it makes a little bit easier to run the football the game of momentum swings opening kickoff taken by the seahawks they move the ball down the field to picked a field goal dont take a three nothing lead 55 yard touchdown <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon kaufman</person> as the handoff goes to <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> and he s inside the 30 down to the 28 yard line and there s a gain of only two yards on the play with 8:15 to play in the half the raiders as we mentioned earlier the raiders have had a difficult time this year stopping the run their run defenses ranked 28th in the national football league today theyre doing an excellent job i think those intense practices that they had during that bye week where they emphasize running the football stopping the run has helped them both offensively and defensively are you rushing for seattle ten rushes for 58 yards 44yard gainer here is a throw to the end zone and it s off the fingers receiver theyre very fast seahawk running the fly on the far side and the 10year veteran <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcdaniel</person> right with him yeah <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcdaniel</person> does a nice job right there see him look back for the ball as long as you look back to the ball and you make contact with the receiver and less long as it s not really a drastic type contact grab anymore pulling him down or something like that theyre not going to throw the flag and that s something you can coach a defender to do you see a lot of defenders they dont look back for the ball to be coached to do them we talked yesterday jim also about how athletic the veteran corners are for the raiders beeping here throws nearside back of the ball bartowski the offensive coordinator told us that <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person>s timing on throws like this this out wrap to <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> is as good as any quarterback he s ever been around and he says what <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> does he works extra with the receivers after practice hell grab the guy like <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> and hell say hey let s work on that out route four five times let s spend some time with it he works on that timing and it s paying off jacksonville building a 10 nothing lead in the first half at pittsburgh at first down <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> stands in throws it against his by the <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety games trap this is a screen to warren and it s an inside screen you can see him fake the block and then he turns around right there behind the line of scrimmage and warren gets him the ball that s what happens on a screen pass that the running backs steps up fakes like he s going to block then releases and then he s got those offensive linemen that form a screen in front of him and go downfield and block the linebackers in secondary is a first down first end goal by eight <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> phases of blitz makes the throw around <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> the hand down the ball the pressure again came from the outside linebacker number 50 <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">mike morton</person> right number 50 <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">mike morton</person> is going to come from the outside theyre from the right side of your screen again he comes untouched nobody blocks him and <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> has to hurry the throw here he comes right there nobody blocks him he came inside the defensive end number 94 <person player="anthony smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anthony smith</person> load comes in with six touchdown throws into this game and eight interceptions this season of 76 quarterback rating is dennis erickson says one thing he was sure about with horn when he drops back the boss he has to skip it in as one of the linebackers made a hit out and it looked like rob frederickson came from the outside and got a shot on him that time rob producin came from his left side right there here he comes you can see all kemp s on the right side there number 53 normally he lines up on the left side that time he came from the right side what the raiders do they normally rush with four defensive linemen and one linebacker it s not an allout blitz like six or seven guys it s just five guys but theyre doing it very effective the raiders dig in down and golf for seattle raiders leading the seahawks 14 to 6 this critical play <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> wants to be sure everybody s got it right so he calls a timeout back at the soldout kingdome in seattle the veteran quarterback <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> who stabilized the seahawk offense they talked about the confidence he exudes and picked up by all his teammates in the huddle unflappable eight points 14 six <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> just before he was hit and hard red s a tight spiral the only place he could put it to get a completion in the stood for six looks like gym theyre going to go for two at that time the raiders just came with a fourman rush they were trying to double blades there with number 42 <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">turner</person> and 29 <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> and what he did a lot of times when you double a guy from the inside and the outside he just kind of stopped in between both of them and mood hit him with the touchdown you know the ball now positioned at the 2 yard line for the twopoint try dennis erickson who knows about winning coaching too miami of florida his team destroyed the first two weeks of the season both at home first by the jets then by the broncos this season was a this play hits they will tie the raiders at 14 off makes a look against the blitz he throws it s not close the defense was all over my <person player="mike pritchard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">pritchard</person> he could not get free and nana s eriksson wants a flag look claims from up here though it looked clean from up here and i think the thing that their work that the raiders are doing well theyre getting a good pass rush today on warm food especially up the middle from their defensive tackles conversion twentyseven the 25yard line and let s watch now jim mora blades touchdown fire the touchdown play <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> and <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> are supposed to double <person player="brian blades" race="UNK" position="WR">brian blades</person> <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">turner</person> takes them if he goes inside <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> takes him if he goes outside but what he does he just goes down and he hooks up in the middle of both of them and mood hits them with the touchdown pass there it is easy as that the twopoint conversion tried was not good so to see how scoring and down in to <person player="todd peterson" race="white" position="K">peterson</person> field goals yards and now the hand up is to <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon</person> and he is out to the 26 and that is is knocked down so both these teams riding a wave of emotion coming in they both felt that this game was critical to their chances to make a run at the playoffs particularly jim with kansas city and particularly denver doing so well right now in the afc west right if one of these teams want to make a run at the playoffs and it s getting to the point the season work you can start talking playoffs this is a critical game and especially for the for the raiders the raiders cant be three and five and think they got a legit growing this time the seahawk pants the quarterback here comes kennedy from the tackle position he comes around <person player="sam adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">adams</person> <person player="sam adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">adams</person> goes first he comes around it s a little game theyre a cross game by the two tackles the raiders failed to pick it up watch <person player="sam adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">adams</person> go inside youll see youll see kennedy come around from the right side just a crossing between the two tackles the raiders dont pick it up <person player="lincoln kennedy" race="nonwhite" position="OT">lincoln kennedy</person> in the raid is one of the pass blockers as the handoff goes and it s was last in possession of the raiders founder so theyll keep the ball well sure now the third fifteen play they have to punt the ball back to the seat on the radar drock way to thinner the seahawks because he vo so it s a good game but they make a good hit <person player="shawn springs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shawn springs</person> 24 makes a good hit there on the tackle knocks the ball out of there no matter what kind of a hit you get as a running back you got to find a way to hang on to that football the ox almost coming up with a big turnover you recall the raiders head the interception at the seattle and appeal inside the third day that they serve soon turned into a touchdown their second of the day our team to 12 is the peters lead the seahawks to get the ball

make the lead eighteen to forty nelligan gym driver that s right theyre gonna go for two here they want to tie it up there down by two if you look at your chart which most coaches used ive been trying to make a decision as to whether to go for two of go for one most most coaches have a chart okay in this situation youre down by so many you go for one if youre up by so many you go for two when youre down by q in this situation the chart says go the seahawks are doing it look at and they score the touchdown a moment ago please theyre actually up now by four but it s the last time it was down by two and go forth theyre up by four now the chart also says go for two in this situation coming out to power set the triple tight ends stronger his receivers to the right and play his whistle death before new line defense and get some people free as receivers have always kept time out by the defense that s our second charge team timeout on the touchdown play <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> does a fantastic job because he s got pressure on him from 91 mclachlan and there s <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> running a deep route he s going to do a little curl route right there when moore when <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> stars to scramble those receivers have to make adjustments as a defender you got to stay with them it s important that you exercise discipline and stay with that receiver when that quarterback scrambling around that time at night lost trapped the <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety he got free for the touchdown heck of a throw by mode there s mclaughlin beaten bd number 63 the right guard look at that throw by <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> that s good arm strength right there kind of throw it across his body but knight made a good adjustment when mode had to scramble heck of a play especially by <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> the quarterback bob brandt casca the offensive coordinator told us the other day and he says warren seems to be getting stronger he says there s no no letup in the strength of that arm and he says every week he seems to be getting stronger he showed it there zota <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> who played at little liberty college for the former nfl coach <person player="sam adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">sam</person> rutigliano right were agreed very fast <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> and also very agile as he stayed inbounds sona s for the second time in the game to extend the lead to 20 to 14 now <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> has to burn a timeout well the first time they came out and decided to go for two that as you mentioned dawn they lined up with their goal line personnel they line up with their goal line personnel and they tried then to spread out the radar defense and catch him off guard so the readers called timeout because they were ready for at that time the seahawks came out lined up in the spread offense and they called timeout apparently they saw something by that raider defense that they werent quite ready for this tennessee oilers team jim weve seen that after a midseason slump he turned to roll again you know we talked earlier in the game about candidates for coach of the year at this point of the season i think that <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff</person> fisher in tennessee has done an outstanding job he s bad to battle a lot of adversity down there with the move playing the games and memphis practicing in nashville every game is like an away game getting on a plane every week i think he s done a tremendous job of holding that team together and not letting those distractions bother the play of his football team theyre rallying back now they were a winner last week decisively over the redskins winning again today to wide receiver seven i bet formation as the seahawks after much reflection two timeouts won by each side go for two in complete is an 18 to 14 score <person player="rob fredrickson" race="white" position="LB">fredrickson</person> was coming hard on the play putting pressure on this gives us a chance to remind you that dont miss this week s mad about you coming up on nbc and about you and the raiders mad about the way their season went earlier this year when they lost to gays by a single point but it easily won both of them and they lost in overtime to the oilers that was an opening day they were devastated by three losses by a total of five points right both these teams have started out you know started the season out and with some very tough losses the raiders were some close losses the seahawks top floor to the players and the coaches right now being able to talk about possible playoff first the back of one of his own guys down at the 24yard line coming down to make the tackle on special teams was linebacker <person player="james logan" race="UNK" position="LB">james logan</person> of seattle ive already been impressed by the way the seahawks have battled back in this game don down 14 to 3 the raiders really came out and got them in a hole there down the raiders kind of took the crowd out of the out of them out of being a factor here in the game but the seahawks have maintained their poise and bad luck now theyre back you have to believe unity way up top pretty soon he throws down the field and hits <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> and brown is out all the way out to the 48 yard line they do as the raiders call it go over the top the vertical offense a big gainer up to the 48 yard line again <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> is going to fake the run to kaufmann and then he s going to hit number 81 kim brown on a crossing route right there as i mentioned earlier when you fake the run it makes those linebackers step up into the line of scrimmage and it really opens up that intermediate area for a crossing route as brown ran on the play on the reception by brown his fourth catch yes she done receiving yard today here s a side on fire rising young star a tight end ricky <person player="rickey dudley" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dudley</person> makes the cat the former ohio state basketball starter mother first down he got 12 see <person player="chad brown" race="white" position="LB">chad brown</person> coming from the right side of your screen but watch <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon kaufman</person> put a good block on him right there <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon</person> s gotta get that head up or he s gonna get a neck injury but he does a nice job of stepping up and blocking <person player="chad brown" race="white" position="LB">chad brown</person> riki <person player="rickey dudley" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dudley</person> with his 22nd catch of the season theyve done a good job so far today first catch of the day go again before they do a marker is thrown or the snap of the ball before the snap close to art by the offense number 72 yard penalty still first down one thing you dont want to do when you get in these situations but a little less than three minutes to go in the half youre moving the ball down the field it s important to get some points here before halftime you dont want to beat yourself with penalties the raiders have always been hurt by penalties in previous years this year theyre doing a lot better theyve only got 50 to penalties coming into this game which is in the super bowl there s some time thrived with a high penalty team and here is the throw at derek center 37yard last fall start on <person player="lincoln kennedy" race="nonwhite" position="OT">lincoln kennedy</person> who s also a former <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> husky and a big reason that <person player="napoleon kaufman" race="UNK" position="RB">napoleon kaufman</person> went to the university of <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> he came up here on a recruiting trip he said they introduced into kennedy this is gonna be one of the guys gonna pass block for you at about 350 pounds that should make my work easier the huskies have always had big offensive linemen and when youre a running back that s what you like to see right now a timeout on the field with two minutes to go in the first half literally three nothing well behind 14 to 3 now lead 1814 and this is a computer rendition of what the beautiful new stadium for the seahawks will be like when it s constructed good look in place theyre gonna put it right where the kingdome is now theyre gonna implode the building were in you know theyve done today yeah theyve got the new baseball stadium going up right next door that s under construction right now there s paul allen with guess monica seles to your left looking on raiders getting downfield throwing the ball ending up with second down green as a receiver yes <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> is looking at him johnny depp s it often makes the catch but he is quickly stucked by a former teammate with the raiders <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston moss</person> outside linebacker for the seahawks well jorge was looking for one of his wide outs on that play but the seahawks had good coverage back there so he had to dump it off the <person player="derrick fenner" race="UNK" position="RB">fenner</person> underneath and now he still got long yardage third and about eight to go for the first down for one target of <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff</person> the slot back second receiver in <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> takes a look at him steps up shuffles of all the thinner and again the seahawks east has slammed for the the seahawks only rushed three people they rushed three dems defensive linemen which meant that they were covering with eight so they had five underneath playing the zone the short zones and three deep he had to drop it off to the back the seahawks came up and made a good open field tackle kept him from making the first down good adjustment there by <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> and getting the ball off to derek <person player="derrick fenner" race="UNK" position="RB">fenner</person> good hit by penny blades very physical defensive player penny plays he s been a a real spark and one of the the main new guys to come into the seahawk defense job you go see weve got to account for blades in every play they list him as a <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety but he s really an extra linebacker way comes up and makes hits on the run he plays up close to the line of scrimmage on first and second down and then when they go into their nickel or dime defenses he s like the nickel linebacker so he s a cover guy but if people are gonna run against that defense he s the main guy back there as far as defending against the run right behind the defensive lineman now <person player="cole ford" race="white" position="K">cole ford</person> ready to try a long field goal he struggled a bit this year has hit six of eleven field goals the picking problems against the jets in the meadowlands in new jersey cost the raiders a game there but <person player="cole ford" race="white" position="K">ford</person> has been a good kicker youll be tested here it will be three yard attempt this wand is so far gone is 49 yard <person player="cole ford" race="white" position="K">ford</person> gets into it nicely throws the ball hard and true and right down the middle another former trojan from southern california delivers tickets a happy guy dennis erickson is <person player="matt labounty" race="UNK" position="DE">matt</person> and it s a onepoint game seattle 18 the raiders 17th got a good oh excellent snapped there by the center nice timing wellexecuted good kick by four that s his longest kick 54 yards longest this year longest in his career that was a big kick that that just puts them within one now of the seahawks gives them a little momentum here going into halftime one minute and nine seconds left so gal davis looking on as his raiders beginning to make a move while riding up the wave of optimism they came with and they said a joke bugles one of the team one of the big reasons this team really held together <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> said we know he s been there he was really the top assistant to joe gibbs on two super bowl winners with the redskins when we were down after those close losses he told his team were a good team were working hard were going to be back and that they came last week with that resounding win over the broncos and now they trail the seahawks in a backandforth game 18 to 17 right you got one of those coaches very upbeat positive got plus he s one of those guys that gets down in the trenches with his guys he chose from pecos from you know unity unit during practice he s involved with all phases of the team offense defense kicking game <person

after a short game <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> covering on the play right <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> does a nice job of coming up there and keeping <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> from getting very much up again it looks you know it looks like the seahawks say theyre going to try to get some points here they got a minute left they got about 75 yards to go but theyre not going to sit on it theyre going to try to get some points here before the end of the first half dennis erickson told us yesterday what he knew about the raiders over the uses you know does a college coach la it was what i saw in sunday s net was they used to win all the time prasad turns it upfield breaks it and there s also a marker down at the 30 and the signal is against seattle with 54 seconds to play in the first half that s a costly penalty for the seahawks because they had a good gain a first down got out of bounds and stop the clock holding by the offense number 87 10yard penalty repeat second down well 87 is the tight end car lester <person player="carlester crumpler" race="UNK" position="TE">crumpler</person> top of the screen right there he s going to come out and he s going to block <person player="lorenzo lynch" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lorenzo lynch</person> the stock safety what he does there as he grabs him right there as as <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> comes by he gets a little hold there on <person player="lorenzo lynch" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lynch</person> an official saw made a call im not so sure that that was the best call in the world but he made it an official call that has been made in the fastest seahawk <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> s in the lower portion of screen go to the run again as they do to <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> and he gets out of bounds at about the 32 yard line then theyre gonna run it out not wanting to risk a turnover with a down field throwers <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> and a pump and go deep well i think now with with 48 seconds to go in the half which is you know a little bit of time here they got the ball on about the 32 yard line i think they take a shot well we give them a huge advantage if they get in long field goal range and go up by four at halftime i think you take a shot right here 114 two three coming back with two quick touchdowns everyday trail three nothing need to take a shot for buyers near sabot comes in low look in the <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> the ball was tipped and running <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> it s a life plan and the signal is touchdown was tipped up in life she comes up with it about a turnaround right the hit up well i thought it hit i thought it hit the ground from up here but a musta hit his foot this shoe is right there looking at it watch this so <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> s foot either there s <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> s covering him got excellent coverage <person player="joey galloway"

moon</person> was a guy they were going to go after today well he goes after them and runs it back into the end zone and the raiders take the lead yeah <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> cant believe it cannot believe unbelievable ive never seen anything like it of you no i havent and you know <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> just kind of stood there i think he thought it hit the ground i thought he thought it was an incomplete pass i think a lot of the seahawk often see players did they just kind of stood there they made no effort to go tackle <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> nbc pros might be the replay of the year there as the boss gives us them the heel of <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joey galloway</person> and <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel washington</person> runs it in for the goahead touchdown so the raiders again take the lead now 23 to 18 theyre up by before the snap false start by the offense center fiveyard penalty retry theyre going for two don and again looking at the chart here that coach is used as to when you go for two as opposed to when you kick the extra point my chart here the one i use when i was coaching the saint says up by five which they are go for two and theyre going for two one of the great ones of all time on the right <person player="willie williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie</person> brown a raider cornerback the free agent from grambling in the <person player="tim hall" race="UNK" position="RB">hall</person> of fame <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel

race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> is there to take it in and the raiders and a spectacular defensive play got in front down 25 to 18 that s an excellent throw by <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> because he was getting hit and was going down when he throw the football good pressure there from the two defensive tackles <person player="sam adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">sam adams</person> number 98 putting a good hit on <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> i dont think <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> even saw the receiver he just threw it up there <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> gets open there in the middle it s behind those defenders good play by <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> if in doubt that s a good place to go to number 81 he s the guy he looks for down there you know we asked him yesterday we said hey dont you kind of look at youre tied in down there in the red zone he says heck no the guy i always look for no matter where the ball is is <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> i look for him first if he s covered then ill go to somebody else people forget the <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> the heisman trophy winner notre dame in 87 now it s come back to have a series of years that have been some of the greatest in modern football history for receiver every year he delivers the goods and i think this year with <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> is the quarterback i think it might turn out to be if the raiders continue to win i think it might turn out to be kim browns most productive year because he s got a quarterback now that can really get the ball to him and wants to get the ball to him and brown as you know jim moret talked to his team he said we cant play down to the opposition anymore last week s win over denver doesnt mean a thing unless we come up and back it up in seattle here s <person player="ronnie harris" race="white" position="WR">ronnie harris</person> running the kickoff back for the seahawks he breaks into open field for the moment and is finally taking town that s why you cant see this play enough the seahawks never want to see it again but watch this these are this is one of these places as an offensive football team like to see out there s not a whole lot you can do about it it wasnt a wellthrown ball i dont think most of those seahawk players just thought it was an incomplete pass that had hit the ground so they dont respond and get over there and try to make the tackle the only one that did there was <person player="pete kendall" race="UNK" position="OG">pete kendall</person> the left guard number 66 it s also some good officiating work as the side judge that was looking right at the play it s a skip up as did our nbc cameraman who got it and there they go into the end zone with <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel washington</person> on the page get some room and he is stuck and hard by <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> a former ucla bruin after

race="nonwhite" position="DT">russell maryland</person> so i never knew he knew he was that fast and one of his teammates said to <person player="russell maryland" race="nonwhite" position="DT">maryland</person> that s why he was picked number two and the whole draft after you back in 90 <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> said 37th career interception is pretty impressive first half s been pretty impressive it s been like a highlight reel as the raiders with a 142 3li then fall behind and rally back to take a 2518 halftime lead and now were going to go to new york where right young will is standing by 25 to 18 the raiders rally from behind a second time to take the lead at halftime down quickie with jim mora two seahawk turnovers bizarre as they <person player="deems may" race="UNK" position="TE">may</person> have been have led to 15 raider points them taking the lead in the game that both teams feel is critical that s right don you know there s not a whole lot you can do about some of those plays like that last play where <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> gets the tip ball off the ankle it s as a coach and as a and as players that you say well what can i do you cant do a whole heck of a lot of about it <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> could have had a better pass but from then on it s just the luck there that the raiders were lucky and the seahawks were unlucky big time and so now were ready to start the second half of play as lauren mood he was shaking his head i mean he s seen everything and his many years in the nfl 14 years here this is his 20th year in professional football youll remember he played six years in canada he led edmonton does five grey cup championships and i dont know anybody there s people talking in the press box here at halftime has been watching a lot of nfl football for a lot of years nobody s ever seen any comparable to that i havent ive seen some crazy things happen here is the kickoff by <person player="cole ford" race="white" position="K">ford</person> hit downfield coming back with the ball now is <person player="ronnie harris" race="white" position="WR">ronnie harris</person> dos caras at the 22yard line a couple of markers are fired in lead tackler on the kick coverage was <person player="lorenzo lynch" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lorenzo lynch</person> youll remember had an interception one of the two interceptions earlier tip ball at the led to the raider touchdown it always hurts to get a little a decent run back they got a run back here and they cook the kickoff back to the 20 and now it s gonna be set back either at the 10 or inside the 10 because of the because of the penalty here on the seahawks it just makes it that field a little bit longer makes it a lot longer as we look at the coors light halftime stats seattle with a decided advantage in overall yards over 50 yards more and much more passing yards but the yellow 2 is the number that s right there s the 1 that is the difference in the score and as it happens very often the take away giveaway ratio has a direct impact on the outcome of the game those we want to see who won if you dont see the score it s back to <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> and he runs higher to the 21 yard line is good for ten they came out with a power run behind the house our baler the right tackle power one run with <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> starting the second half instead of <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">steve broussard</person> but number 75 right tackle there howard fowler does an excellent job just malls his guy pushes him way to the outside big hole there for warren you dont see that happen very often you dont see an offensive lineman totally dominated defensive linemen on a particular play like ali did that a turd a former buffalo built a huge tackle it gotten good tackle play rookie <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jones</person> and the left sided from battered this season here s a nice throw but i dropped 29 yard line as the <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james mcknight</person> who s been in the end zone once today look to run before he made the catch you know when you have a play that like that that the seahawks happen to the seahawks that interception for a touchdown you can see <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> theyre reacting to the drop ball right before the half it s important that the seahawks put that behind them they cant be worried about that play and say oh my gosh look what happened to us how are we gonna survive again i gotta get it cooked otally out of their mind come out the second half with a totally fresh approach by 7:25 18 the raiders leaned back to the rod for <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> and a marker comes in groaned by the umpire who stands behind the linebackers and that s almost always offensive holding <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin was fight enough to people make the tackle the sleeping giant awoke here today holding it is against his seattle seahawks this hasnt been a good series here to start off the second half they had a penalty on the kickoff return theyve had a drop pass and now a holding penalty here which is going to set them back so not a good start hopefully that interception has not upholding a bloody offense number 66 10yard penalty it s still second down was the the left guard keep <person player="pete kendall" race="UNK" position="OG">kendall</person> a former number one draft choice out of boston college dennis erickson sees his seahawks now set back to their 11 yard line but you mentioned mclaughlin be in the sleeping giant i think the sleeping giant has awoke in the last two games he had an excellent game last week mclaughlin did and it seemed like he s playing extremely well today he s made a lot of critical stops there down stops rushing the quarterback on third downs in second and ten or a <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> with a deep trap looks too both near sideline the by <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joey galloway</person> but he didnt the official again my head linesman right on top of the play rules it no catch well as you know when you come down with the ball youve got to have both feet inbounds and he has one there but not to it was a good throw by <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> yeah it was close he tried very hard as a receivers and coaches of receivers do a lot of drills in practice they throw the ball theyre close to the sideline and the defender works on coming down with both feeds that feed inbound youll see receivers always try to get those two feet inbounds from those grills that time <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> wasnt able to get it done steelers inching closer against <person player="grady jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jackson</person> now <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> on 3rd and 10 again under duress as the heat was on put on

about him being traded by the raiders but once the trading deadline passed and he was still with the raiders he became a very happy camper he s glad he s back with the raiders ball change jackets down rares the reefers fires a bullet 60 yards into the endzone it was 49 yards in the line of scrimmage and all of a sudden the big play offensive the raiders is alive and well and they extend to a 3118

george</person> and james jet combine again our parents snap the ball is taken away has whistled it dead brown ripping the ball away got a long way to go in a lot more touchdowns to be scored take a look at the touchdown play here and what this is this is poor execution and poor discipline but a seahawks secondary because <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> fakes the reverse to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> and obviously the secondary players by the seahawks go with the reverse fake they dont maintain their deep position in there deep zones and gin trunks right by him he s wide open not good secondary play by either gerald williams who had the deep middle or <person player="willie williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie williams</person> who had the deep outside on the right side so the olympic sprinter the gold medal winner from barcelona is in the end zone twice today for the

big plays and so does james yet he likes it during the return holding by the receiving team number 26 west virginia i think those eight touchdowns this year which are a lot more than he had in previous years can be attributed a great deal to the acquisition of <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> a quarterback who s got the kind of arm that can hit a guy like jed who s got that tremendous speed downfield as he did on that previous play for the touchdown <person player="john henry mills" race="nonwhite" position="RB">john henry mills</person> was

twentyone yearold rookie jarrett wright goes tonight for the indians that s right and im sure he s nervous right now although he s had a whole season to get rid of that nervousness but when youre playing for the whole ball of wax in the seventh game of a world series that s a lot of pressure to put on a rookie linebacker patella high school down in anaheim he hesitates and is lost at the 10yard line swept under by mclaughlin and <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">morton</person> but seahawks left early they jumped offside the raiders left early offsides by the defense number 91 lined up in the neutral zone fiveyard penalty repeat first down as the first thing ron <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin said all day who s been a dominant player in this game in in previous seasons done that the raiders who have many times led the league in in penalties the most number of penalties a lot of it has been their defensive lineman jumping off sides or lining up in the neutral zone theyve really cut down on that this year i think joe bugle has done a good job of emphasizing that to this football team they seem a lot more disciplined in that regard than they have been in the past their penalty counters youre playing out earlier jim is way down this year as <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> runs the ball and gets it to about the 25yard line raiders keeping people real deep to guard against the long ball that could come anytime to <person player="joey

player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> pitch back to <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> warren s inside the 20 these to be 18 about 16 yards in a first down this is good running just a quick toss to to warren he s got patience back there he waits for the hole to open up and then he hits it right back up inside good patient running by <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> that time and pretty close to good patient holding by one of the seahawks who held <person player="martin harrison" race="UNK" position="DE">martin</person> plain block so and it play goes it is a 17 yard gate and the seahawks in need of a touchdown down 31 to 18 challenging he s <person player="joey

thought it would be when they signed him here in the offseason but right here he gets a good opening right there shows good upfield running to building he takes that thing right up the field which is important that you do on kickoff returns you dont want a guy back there that tries to go side to side you go out and you want a guy to catch the ball and hit it straight up field that s the best way to return kickoffs and <person player="desmond howard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desmond howard</person> did at that time 4:45 ert did at the levi six the spreaders blocks twotime california 100

tackle run game for their elusive little back at 57 185 pounds well they feel that if they can get him straight ahead and get him into that secondary and that s the quickest and best way to get him into the secondary if they can get him past that line of scrimmage he s got the explosiveness and the quickness and the speed then to take it all the way he s thirteen times four 96 yards fires hard

the house 11 brown usually comes to the outside that time he came inside grabby brown is playing a heck of a game today very intense holding bloody offense number 31 10yard penalty repeat second down take a look at here youll see brown coming from the right side on the rush see him come inside when he comes inside leavitt has to grab him with that right arm levitz expecting brown to come outside he s in position to take him by the quarterback to the outside brown messed him up by jumping inside he had to hold him and he got the penalty now what do you go to jim mora with second down in 19

times people can be in position to cover but they cant make a play on the ball their <person player="shawn springs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">springs</person> is in great shape and he goes up and makes the play that s the key for a defensive back make a play on a football john <person player="shawn springs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">springs</person> third player picked in the entire draft

position="DE">michael sinclair</person> number 70 and the omnipresent <person player="chad brown" race="white" position="LB">chad brown</person> number 94 as the defensive coordinator greg mcmackin

coming in from the right side so jorge had a run to his right and right into <person player="michael sinclair" race="UNK" position="DE">michael sinclair</person> who was rushing from that left end spot jimmy s kick returners are certainly winning their letters today harris he s had a bunch of horrigan guts im <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff</person> on the ball he has to ferry at this time at the 30yard line the seahawks have it with a onepoint lead with jim mora this is don ricky back at seattle and from here were going to send you to south florida game seven of the 97 world series will be coming up there s the cleveland indians of the florida marlins go head to head for the world championship right after this game concludes that weve got a long way to go here 1026 left to play in the fourth quarter a onepoint game seattle leading the raiders 35 34 <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> wants a lot he s got <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> he s open the 24 you coops running supply i think this is great play calling by the seahawks by bob pratt kowski controlled by mode hey dont sit i only got a onepoint lead with him and has to go you got to keep throwing the ball the best thing the seahawks do is throw the football do what you do best youve got a long way to go in this ballgame the seahawks need more points i dont think theyre gonna win but 35 they need more and they stand out rookie techo <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jones</person> is now down <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> from florida state is shaken up he came into the game with a sprained ankle he s been playing on a an injured ankle and up that s the problem here but <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> is down and <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joey galloway</person> with 45 yards on that reception now has caught five passes today for a hundred and ten yards and two touchdowns he s had a tremendous day this has certainly been a game of big plays you know the team that was supposedly the big play team in the national football league was the raiders but the seahawks have certainly made their share of big plays today primarily in the passing game i went down the stretch they could be headed to ooty at three rivers stadium in pittsburgh where jacksonville the steelers are tied the vikings with a win go to six and two today tennessee closing in on a victory at arizona and as official now in the books at san diego the chargers bounce back from a lopsided loss at kansas city to go four and four as the colts battle on in this winless season for them theyll trapped well help the afc west the two top teams were winners today the broncos winning in overtime and buffalo 23 220 at kansas city a victor over the rams at st louis allen oakland in san diego all in the hunt for a raider lost with senator three and five would send them to the bottom of the division yeah that was that that s why this game is so critical to both teams with the way that denver in kansas city are playing in their records if you want to stay in the hunt in this division you got to win this football game today especially oakland though if they lost would go to three at five big game and it s been an exciting game tremendous game so far almost in that unbelievable category as a <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joey galloway</person> having one of his best days five receptions over 100 yards to four touchdowns his last cats for 45 yards setting the seahawks up first and ten at the raider 25yard line pingo rose <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> calls signals the pits back and look at that head on hit as rob frederick s ended out of michigan state along with <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">mike morton</person> combined on the stop there is no gain maybe a loss of a yard itll be second down in 11 that play was designed to go outside a quick toss to <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> but the left end that darrel russell was up field and <person player="steve broussard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">broussard</person> had to cut it back inside right to number 53 rob frederickson he was in great position the seahawks now break with a four wide receiver set of trips formation three wide receivers to one side of the top of your screen second and almost 11 slanter gets his guy always the former raider darryl <person player="daryl hobbs" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hobbs</person> is down to the 15 yard line and very close to a first down well this is hobbes and he s covered by number 37 <person player="james trapp" race="nonwhite" position="DB">james trapp</person>ed a <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety by putting three wide receivers to the left side and <person player="daryl hobbs" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hobbs</person> out to the right what they do is they man up a wide receiver <person player="daryl hobbs" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hobbs</person> on a <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety theyre trying to create mismatches here normally when you have a wide out and a <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety it is a misset mismatch in this case it <person player="deems may" race="UNK" position="TE">may</person> not be because trap is so fast he s got the speed as a <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> safety to cover a wide receiver yo google now looking to his defense which came into the game ranked 30th and last in the nfl theyre put to stop on nine different receiver that <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> is him with a throw today the ll broaching the 500 yard mark in total

position="K">peterson</person> now comes out so it s a stop of sorts for the raider defense as <person player="todd peterson" race="white" position="K">peterson</person> comes back out one of the best field goal kickers if he hits it will extend the lead to four just been informed that <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> the rookie offensive tackle for seattle was just taken in for xrays on his left lower leg you know one of the things about that dr donna as they did eat some clock up up it s a time up off the clock and it got in position or they didnt get the touchdown but it looks like theyre gonna get three points in the field goal and the raiders come to bat 25yard field goal is pounded through so <person player="todd peterson" race="white" position="K">peterson</person> has delivered time and again as 38:34 game of seattle control wednesday nights on nbc and they do here in seattle at sunday afternoon back in 14 full of plays itll be a highlight reels now find themselves down 3834 but they get the ball back his debts and return very good return is out to the 30yard line almost to the 31 where <person player="fred

player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> was fouled as their penalty there is stunned because he was hit hard while the ball was in the air on his way to him im not sure about that call and look to me it looked to me like the seattle defender was going for the ball he s got as much right for that football as the receiver does well well see it again tim braun one of the most valuable not only raters but players in the league is up take a look at this now what <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> is doing he s trying to hit either kaufmann her browndown that left sideline he had rolled out to his right here comes the defender i dont think that s past interference at all he s going for the football he s got that right you got about seventy thousand people here to agree with interference by the defense automatic first down dennis erickson says no way or words to that effect i agree i think that was a poor call i already do youll see <person player="willie williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie williams</person> number 27 he s the right corner he s the one they call it on he s just jumping up for the football yeah i think i think maybe <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> might have been more guilty of interference than weightings was the penalty goes and the raiders have a first down as they trail by <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> he s hit from behind to live fall seahawks haman the wills comes up with the ball the middle <person player="michael sinclair" race="UNK" position="DE">michael sinclair</person> got there first and knocked of all three and well recovers the fumble <person player="michael sinclair" race="UNK" position="DE">michael sinclair</person> comes in from the top of your screen the left hand position right there it s right by ricky <person player="rickey dudley" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dudley</person> too tight in there trying to block him <person player="michael sinclair" race="UNK" position="DE">sinclair</person> makes a good hit <person player="dean wells" race="UNK" position="LB">wells</person> makes the recovery good hustle that ball awareness by that seahawk defense well jarek she was ready to get in there and hit somebody he s fired up at whole seahawk teams fired up right now especially that defense that defense is playing great right now this is the defense as you pointed out jim moret the absent allowed 38 points a game through the first two weeks and they shut it down since then to less than 14 again they are excited theyve played an excellent fourth quarter most of the second half they played well theyre coming after the quarterback theyre putting a lot of pressure on <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> if the seahawks are going to run no theyre gonna go firing again here s the throw in the flat and he breaks a big play for a gain of 11 years in a first in town as the final numbers are starting to come in from the late games these are the early games you know again i go back to what i said earlier in the game the seahawks are trying to take advantage of that raider man coverage where theyve got a linebacker on a back they did that again right there <person player="mike morton" race="UNK" position="LB">mike morton</person> was covering war no contest it s for wait ahead carry by <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> and the carries down to the 36 yard line virtually no gain on the play itll be second down in almost 10 his <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> came up from the free safety position to make the hit i believe the seahawks have got to keep throwing a football that s what they do best that s how they score points they cant get conservative at this point to catch at there s four wide receivers in the game there s a blitz <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">turner</person> comes tremendous throw by <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> against an allout blitz he just went to the hot area the very area vacated by a blitzer and he made the connection to <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james mcknight</person> <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> s coming on the blitz is he 42 right there right between this center guard gap gain on that play of about seven yards is going to be third down and a long three to get new downs the seattle seahawks have to advance the ball to the 26 yard line of the raiders 5:18 to play in the game seattle trips warranty princess and he s down might have been the play of the game they got third and three if they dont make it theyve got a tough decision do we kick a field goal do we cut do we go for it on fourth down now they dont have to worry about that good play calling here good execution this drive initiating after the fumble recovery ball not free from <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> and recovered by middle linebacker for the seattle seahawks <person player="dean wells" race="UNK" position="LB">dean wells</person> hell go would give seattle sevenpoint lead theyre going for the touch and get the ball inside the 5yard line first and goal inside the two <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> you talk about a wellthrown football this was perfect take a look at citing a screen running the slant route partners doing all he can do he s all over it but move puts it in there where it s impossible for <person player="perry carter" race="UNK" position="DB">carter</person> to the convicted knock it down that s where you got to put the ball right in there where <person player="perry carter" race="UNK" position="DB">carter</person> cant come around and knock the ball down perfect throw by <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> were on bonus now pants for over 400 yards in this game 27 to 40 grain for 407 yards and four touchdowns chris warning knocking on the door is he and he is not but he s down close to the white line to the goal line and the game pluck now becoming a factor for the raiders as its down inside of three and a half minutes to play that s why that last third down play was so important god because it gave thus the seahawks another four downs more time off the clock at this time as you say it s very crucial this is the third best seattle passing game ever by a seahawk quarterback <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> just putting up the numbers 410 yards passing by date craigie also hit for 418 degrade prey and now we here might have a malfunction there jim in the offensive line of cif let s set them back before the snap false start by the offense number 63 fiveyard penalty it s still second down <person player="frank beede" race="UNK" position="OG">frank</person> pd the right guard 63 pd boost bucket <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> who doesnt like that that could be a huge development the raiders could hold and force him into a field goal theyd be down by 7 then getting the ball back just cant make mistakes in situations like that now beatty is not normally the starter right guard gary <person player="derrick graham" race="nonwhite" position="OG">graham</person> is beatty started today because <person player="derrick graham" race="nonwhite" position="OG">graham</person> is has been hurt and has played pretty well but you cant make those kind of mistakes in that situation that s a killer right there but the seahawks continue just put overwhelming pressure on the raider pass defense with four wide receivers in there all good crossing routes running circuit warned used to run at houston the middle he s down to the two yard line itll be third down and goal from there to seal the ruling the play was dead <person player="eric turner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric turner</person> a week ago wasnt dead and he went 65 yards with a fumble recovery against the broncos he thought he had another one there trying to catch him in a draw theyve been successful with this is a little sprint draw or <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> kind of half sprint he gives it the warrant on a delay he got back up to about the three yard line four yard line but kept him from getting in the end zone good time jim to call a timeout as dennis erickson the son of a high school coach here in the state of <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> and in football his whole life used to have to play against his dad when he was a quarterback he went to a high school different than one his dad coached at the same town he s played twice a year so those friday night dinners before the game were interesting mom had to kind of keep the peace as we look at the miller time game summary 13:34 are the numbers at the bottom line so far with two and a half minutes to play <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> with 203 yards passing <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> more than doubling that with 407 yards nine receivers with catches for the the seahawks today as the final is in from pittsburgh kordell stewart s second half stewart they have to call him as he threw for a touchdown which to the drôme dennis s the way this card reads in it anyway it s a 2317 win the steelers rallying back and beating jacksonville you know you mentioned on the we noticed on that staff there the unexpected stat that <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> had completed passes the nine different receivers i already believe this is one of the strengths of this football team they have a lot of receivers a lot of pitt receivers <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> spreads it around you really cant gang up on any one guy if youre a defensive team 30second timeout brief respite for a <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> at age forty nearing 41 he s going to move here to seattle tina s wife felicia the poor children they love seattle <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> and seattle <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> loves the <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">moon</person> s is coming up next here on nbc sports game seven of the 97 world series what a night it all comes down to this final game in verse the violence will be on the home field but that isnt meant a whole lot in this world series it s been a great series i know the series has taken some criticism in the media for not being a good series but this is the first time i believe this is true that the world series has gone to a seventh game since 1991 i think it s been a good series i do fit to good baseball teams and not division winners in their division during the season but made it through the playoffs and now tonight are playing for the the world s championship i think what stands out almost more than anything everybody gets excited about people jumping up against a wall to get you long fly ball that s not hard major leaguers but the plays that this kell of the indians has made it shortstop are just beyond belief some of the fielding plays charging the short hoppers glove to hand then the throw up an 1/8 to the step an absolutely exception of some of the fielding place third down triggers it throw its cockpit is no signal think about it shows both concurring and they both got together with what they saw <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> delivers again his fifth touchdown throw of the day his third to <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joey galloway</person> you know you can talk all you want about all the acquisitions the seahawks made in the offseason to improve their defensive football team and they certainly did that but in my opinion the key guy to the seahawk football team these last five six games has been this guy number one <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> he s been the glue to this football team the leader made it happen the extra point by <person player="todd peterson" race="white" position="K">peterson</person> is finally cracks his smile has led this team coming in here really expecting to be a backup again this is a perfect throw to calloway he throws it exactly where it has to be thrown the only place it cant be it to be defended and mastered the outside of <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> the receivers lined up inside there s no way he can stop it you have two officials right on top of the play both looking at it and both concurring yes his feet were in he had possession the ball it s a good call all the way perfect throw good call by the officials both feet were <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff</person>

rush of the seahawks now has no choice but the drop and throw and every down his team down 45 to 34 running out of time now so he monica seles the dentistry the guest of seahawks owner paul allen soula facility go very loud though raiders were concerned about that it s definitely going to be a factor in this there kick returner <person player="desmond howard" race="nonwhite"

<person player="bennie blades" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bennie blades</person> knocked him down as <person player="rickey dudley" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dudley</person> one of the rising

successful place coming at 53 seconds to go here comes the rocky throws and makes a completion to <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> wait he s touched the ball all day and williams gets out of bounds at the 47 yard line he gained about nine yards on the play <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> was the guy they moved to tight in from running back in the offseason and earlier in the season he was playing more the last few weeks he s has varied a little game time but now they feel that throwing the football theyre gonna theyre gonna probably get him some work think id still rather have <person player="rickey dudley" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dudley</person> in the ballgame that <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> the devil in these wide receivers <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> is sometimes looking at three people cheating over coach change the cut prism yes to our stands in sin place got him side on ball is it taught brilliant complaint the battefield made a play on the ball good move by <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> just to get rid of it right <person player="michael sinclair" race="UNK" position="DE">michael sinclair</person> had a good rush he beat <person player="lincoln kennedy" race="nonwhite" position="OT">lincoln kennedy</person> the right tackle for the raiders <person player="jeff george"

kennedy</person> <person player="michael sinclair" race="UNK" position="DE">sinclair</person> goes right by him i dont blame him for being mad at kennedy so claire s been on fire down to the raiders they need one for first down no it s about as close as you can get if he got there it s going to be by the nose of the ball as they went to <person player="tim hall" race="UNK" position="RB">tim hall</person> first year running back from <person player="robert rosenstiel" race="UNK" position="TE">robert</person> morris getting some work today and dennis erickson seahawks if they got a stop there well have slammed the lid on the raiders and the game theyll take over with a minute and 31 seconds to play so an official timeout on the field is were gonna have the sticks come out here it s gonna help a coach grow organic rye i know how job you go and i know how dennis erickson feel right now both of them they got that their stomach is turning upside down theyre sweating there are no easy sundays in this league people dont appreciate how tough it is to win in this league and the stress on a head coach so the seahawks take over the ball and take over the game as dennis erickson is vol ellen leading the shears up in the owners box with 131 left to go and now if youre the raiders gym really a stunning defeat that drops them to the bottom of their division well you know joe bugle has had to bring this team back so many times this year from some tough defeats and he just got one more time he s got to do it now you know three and five is a very very difficult situation especially the way that this division is shaping up and like you said theyre now at the bottom but hey as a head coach you got to keep your head up you got to set a good example for your football team you got to do everything you can to bring them back because it is possible theyre not out of it game seven of the world series is next as the seahawks now will run the clock the raiders use a timeout stopping the clock with 1:25 to play jim <person player="tim hall" race="UNK" position="RB">hall</person> and the raiders didnt get there on fourth down and the seahawks take over the ball leading by 11 coming up next for the seahawks it only gets tougher next week as they head into mile high stadium to play the 71 broncos who made the long trek to buffalo and won in overtime 23 to 20 today they go to 7 &amp; 1 bitch back <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris warren</person> his job now is to hold out and stay in bounds which he does raiders just used their last timeout with 1:18 left to play in the game you know talking about going into denver and playing in denver next week going in at five and three you know theyre gonna feel that they have a real shot they might be playing for a division maybe a possible second place or championship down the road no question theyre very much in the hunt back in the race the seahawks and upcoming for the raiders theyll go to charlotte next week to play play carolina then they come home to oakland to go against new orleans a team that was shut out again today by the 49ers and it s off to san diego that s the team you have to be wary of you dont know what youre gonna get with them they won today easily and are four and four yeah the raiders have got three more in their next four games they play one at home and three on the road so theyve got their work cut out for especially now this was such a big game for both teams it s gonna be tough for jhope you gonna bring this team back and get him ready for next week s game but he s got to do it you got to find a way <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">jeff george</person> walk in the sidelines now powerless to move his team while the seahawks have the ball they have two downs and the raiders have no timeouts 1:18 left to play back to warren and he s down to the 47 yard line where mclaughlin stops him and that brings up fourth down so the seattle seahawks as the clock winds down theyll use every tick of it theyll be punting the ball as we look at the afc west through the halfway point of the season denver 7 1 kansas city now up to 6 and 2 after beating in the rams today at st louis seattle with five and three record coming out of this game san diego at five hundred at four and for the raiders will drop to three and five as were down to 38 seconds left to go and then off to world series game number seven i believe the seahawk franchises got a bright future theyve got some good young football players done a good job with personnel theyve got some very good people in that defense randy muller is the vice president of football operations he s primarily the guy in charge of selecting people both in the as free agents are in the draft theyve got good young players theyve got a good coaching staff theyve got a nice facility theyve got a new owner a new stadium being built form in a few years great place to live i think things are really looking up for this this football team ive been looking up the last six weeks is after that awful start theyve really started to cook wins in the last six games as <person player="desmond howard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desmond howard</person> fair catches the ball back at the 10yard line and the raiders with send out their offense to fire away but it s far too late now to get back in this as the celebration has begun for the seahawks the anticipation this game was enormous the first seahawk home game sold out sometime and warren bone who was brought in here to be a backup quarterback behind john freeze when freeze went down a fractured thumb the required surgery in the opening loss to the jets the ageless one <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> stepped in in the every week he s been getting better and his team has he stabilized the whole offense he is the leader of this team and he led the way today with a phenomenal performance 409 yards passing for <person player="warren moon" race="nonwhite" position="QB">warren moon</person> 5 touchdown throws tied a team record if <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> dumps it off to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> looking for somewhere to go he dives out to the 25yard line as the raiders now powerless to stop the clock theyre out of timeouts that should do it <person player="jeff george" race="white" position="QB">george</person> another quick look to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> fighting til the end and it s the seahawks who prevail in an afc west shootout of real big plays weve ever seen like the buffett character <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joey galloway</person> foot into the abs the defensive back <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel
