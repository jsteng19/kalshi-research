============================================================

heather hello al well it s been two weeks since <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> dislocated that pinky in his throwing hand since then every snap he s taken has been out of the shotgun or pistol formation car did tell us that that finger is healed well enough to grip the ball like he normally does and that soreness is now the only issue and he said he does feel comfortable taking stamps under center tonight if the raiders choose to do so now for some injury updates oakland certainly compromised on the defensive side of the ball two tackles are out <person player="stacy mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="DT">stacy mcgee</person> and <person player="darius latham" race="UNK" position="DT">darius latham</person> as well as safety carl <person player="karl joseph" race="nonwhite" position="DB">joseph</person> who is second on the team intact you all right thank you heather let s take a look at the standings oakland at 10:00 and 2:00 so they would have identical records if kansas city wins but they will have the tiebreaker because they will have won both games in the season series <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> eight and four right now they play sunday against tennessee san diego five and seven so were ready to go jack del rio in his second year in oakland and you saw and agreed fourth year in kansas city chiefs won the toss they defer you so arrowhead stadium as usual packed to the gills in kansas city and up the go on thursday night football nine yard line with rashard coming up the middle and to take down at the 23yard line by <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> and let s take a look at the oakland starters <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick</person> are fresno state <person player="latavius murray" race="UNK" position="RB">latavius murray</person> central florida to missoula wali university of north texas <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person> dallas native takes us to <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> alabama claw walker the youth <person player="donald penn" race="nonwhite" position="OT">donald penn</person> utah state dogs and lsu <person player="rodney hudson" race="UNK" position="C">rodney hudson</person> native state game jackson mississippi state <person player="austin howard" race="nonwhite" position="OT">austin howard</person> northern iowa now that the doll alexander a rookie at arella so that s been antennae talking about assembly ills and he s not starting tonight he s inactive and slipping his <person player="latavius murray" race="UNK" position="RB">latavius murray</person> as he took the handoff at the 23 yard line <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> makes the tackle there are the numbers on car fourth in the league in yards and that s a terrific touchdown interception rachel anytime youre close to 5 to 1 that s great 24 td passes 5 interceptions and again he will as heather said will see if he goes under center tonight but miss going shotgun since the injury against carolina and that pass is caught in a 26 yard line that s <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person> holding it in up there and that will set up a third down and seven all right there s <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> and youll see that he really does not want to put that pinky on there he gave us a heavy sales job oh yeah no problem at all the pinkies fine i can take a snap under center there he is back and shotgun and im sure it s good enough the play we saw him throw the ball very well last week but im just too sure that things still sore that he said by far the most pain he s ever been in when that happened third and seven and he throws deep downfield and it s incomplete intended for <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> along the sidelines terrence mitchell back there covering and so the raiders start with a three and out well this kansas city defense can certainly make plays and on that very first series here they came out played straight mantoman coverage theyre gonna challenge these young talented wide receivers and play makers of the raiders now youve got one of the best punters in the league and one of the best young returners in the league tyree killed the rookie <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette king</person> to send it down toward him a king with a high not particularly deep food that is dropped at the 38 yard line by hill and he should be at the bottom of the pile with it but well take a look and see so hill came running up into traffic the kick was knocked that long hills not a very big guy he might have had a tough time hanging on to it at the bottom of that pile and indeed that s going to be as soon as terry maconie tells us terry mccauley has not made the call yet and now he does so hill bumps it and turns it over no question of the buff but it looked like you fell right on top of it and what happened from there went right between his legs until youve had a couple of plays out there in this kind of weather you just are uncomfortable and that s the rookie james couser had a sack last week in the game comes up with that big bumble recovery at the 38 yard line so after stopping them on a three and out cows or another big play that sack is chris sent last week back they come out of the pistol this time lori is the back split <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> out to the right <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> to the left under pressure that s hit as he throws those into traffic and it s incomplete and intended for set the <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> put the pressure on the rookie number to pick out of mississippi state yeah and right over fidel alexander here who is replacing coletti assembly absolutely one of the best that there is and there at the left guard position is fadal alexander and he was beaten quickly by <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> let s give <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> some credit too he s been playing fantastic football over the past month yeah he went the mississippi state he played with a guy by the name of that prescott who were going to see on sunday night and the cowboys they got the giants pretty good pair to draw to second and 10 murray patiently around the outside to the 33 and well take a look at the kansas city defense for our team new year s roach s of a minute repoll memphis tennessee first off mississippi state just in <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> george <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek</person> chops in texas and make lawson george d for offering university <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> oakland california <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> tennessee <person player="ron parker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ron parker</person> duper high school began but a big names on that defense and afford not one of the bigger names necessarily but he has ten sacks becoming a bigger name and the pass is caught in bounds that s <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> making the catch with <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> covering on the plane thatll be a good match up all night long boy no question about it <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> already with eight takeaways on the season top of your screen just a little quick out we all know about <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> all the magic he provided at the university of alabama and for <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> ive never seen a young player beyond much better a role in that young man has both last year with eight interceptions already five this year he takes a lot of chances for andy reed and andy reed is going to challenge that last play it was third and five obviously is going to challenge you to the spot or whether he caught it and held it inbounds rag that back foot he did i not sure im not sure take a look that s one foot down so the foot was down initially but not on the second one i think that s what andy reed saw could be challenging that could be challenging the spot regardless mcauley will have it for a week come back <person player="jeremy maclin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeremy</person> kohli with the coal receiver got two feet down inbounds with control it is a catch the spot stands first down oakland kansas city is charged with their first so in effect when you challenge that you can challenge two separate things number one was it a catch number two what about the spot andy loses both i think andy may have seen that second foot sort of fly out of bounds there but he did not see right at the point of the catch that first foot down and then the second one easily down so here we are with 57 and a half minutes left in the game and reed is down to one chance it s a first down the ball is at the eight yard line and this is murray taking it to the 24 murray had a toe issue and did not play in that first game between these teams in october well one of the major things that youll see up front is six offensive linemen playing often for the oakland raiders they are a big run team you just have to wonder tonight whether or not with coletti assembly out who is probably the best guard or one of the two best guards in all of football if all those great power runs that we saw when they played <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> are going to be in play again here tonight very interesting if you see 71 of the game that s normally the sixth offensive line that meanwhile the pass into a lot of traffic and if it s a completed pass it s going to be a fumble and a recovery the question is with kansas city contending they had it so youve got another interest income situation coming up here as the field judge and the line judge get together and another official comes in if a call is going to wait for how they are going to assess it before he makes the call a catch of completion and a fumble recovery <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> steve notion took it away and of course well take a look at the replay to see if it stands well it looks like he lands on the belly of nelson and then the balls out before anything touches down is it possible the shoulder touch down is he have control over the ball and a couple of steps and i think it all happened while he was on nelson s belly rolling over so yes that would be a fumble unless they just say that he never had control the ball which i guess they could but all turnovers are reviewed so it s an official review they check it out upstairs back after this after you receiver did not please complete the catchup right was going to the ground and lost the football it is an incomplete pass they refer today when step resent to 11 minutes 43 seconds so watch this in a real time and this is what they were looking at here and that s the ruling from headquarters you know it s interesting i think the key phrase there was making the catch walk onto the ground i think you could also argue that he had the catch and was not going to the ground it was the tackle that took him to the ground so very close call there so they lose a challenge do the chiefs they lose a recovery kansas city still has another boy throws and that pass is juggled and intended therefore <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">seth roberts</person> and that s going to make it fourth down and it was a third down an hscene i even got fourth down and janakowski coming in to try to make it a three nothing game well for the kansas city chiefs after all that to hold them to a field goal try they have to feel pretty good about this when they had a couple of strikes against them and still held firm as they often do on this defensive side of the ball 44 yard attempt for one of the best of all time mark and <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> bangs it through so three of the head minutes into the game the oakland raiders leading three nothing the kansas city you know that means barbecue you know the news tailgating and normally the wind blows from the parking lot toward the stadium and that s why it always smells so good in here doesnt be they love it i mean hey especially the night games around here because it gives them a chance to go at it all day 22 degrees 3 nothing is the score <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> x kick will go through the end zone and let s take a look at the chiefs hoop to get the balkan 25 <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> utah pencil were lsu <person player="chris conley" race="UNK" position="WR">chris conley</person> georgia <person player="jeremy maclin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeremy maclin</person> mizzou <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> cleveland heights ohio <person player="demetrius harris" race="UNK" position="TE">demetrius harris</person> wisconsin milwaukee <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">eric fisher</person> central michigan exact cool to see mitch morris missouri larhonda vernon tardive middleton university <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> account so the kansas city chiefs started the year 2 and 2 and then rolled after that by week 1 5 on our own they want 7 of their last eight on the loss in that stretch was to tampa bay here running back is <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were gonna start with play action smith is going to that away because <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> mak was right there witnesses so <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> completes 2/3 of his passes good tp interception ratio of course quarterbacks dont like game manager that s what he s been cold ever since he came into the league with san francisco as the number one overall pick back in oh 5 at the he s really blossomed under the sandy reed offense here over the past four seasons second down and ten complete intended therefore kelsey let s take a look at the oakland defense <person player="jihad ward" race="UNK" position="DE">jihad</person> warfighting out on the knee coauthoring mississippi state <person player="dan williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">dan williams</person> tennessee a little mac buffalo <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> almost heaven <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> virginia university <person player="perry riley" race="UNK" position="LB">perry riley</person> and then shoot <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">malcolm smith</person> usc david addison north carolina state <person player="reggie nelson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">reggie nelson</person> florida <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person> south florida <person player="sean smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sean smith</person> passed him george smith came over as he freaks she s it from kansas city third down and ten from the 25 smith pressured throwing downfield 35yard <person player="chris conley" race="UNK" position="WR">chris conley</person> makes the catch each david emerson on the coverage so on third down they get it downfield for 39 yards so many teams on third and ten these guys will just sit waiting for a comeback a back shoulder and the kansas city chiefs felt like tonight they might be able to run right by these guys in some third and long situations maybe a couple of double moves and on the very first try they hit it big and there s the guy you have to stop <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> well done by <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> coming his 35th catch of the season his longest reception of the year as well now back and at hole closing quickly on the right sides for <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were taken down by <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> the former seahawk dean of a couple second down one of the things that theyre always going to try and do is run away from <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> mak and run at <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> now he s not a horrible run player but he certainly is not <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> mac on the outside so a lot of the formations youll see a lot of shifts from kansas city like they did in the first game to try it out blank this raiders deep end to work well in that one see how it goes here tonight second down and seven through the middle those <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where to the 30yard line welcome or years and years <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jamaal charles</person> has been the guy but he could hurt last year and then he was hurt again early this season so where has been the man third year guy was a free asian played at lsu the supporter back in high school so from time to time tonight youre liable to see him lining up in the shotgun do you do a lot of things and one thing he could do chris is catch passes for almost 14 yards per reception by fourteen point six yards per catch in the nfl these days is a remarkable number for a receiver much less it back and speaking of the wildcat with where here we go and he needs love almost on cue to tyreke hell lose about a yard short of the first down so and you read now on a fourth down is one gonna have to try to tie the game or go for it for the moment keeping the offense out there anytime you leave back on into the line of scrimmage you better account for him because he is simply too athletic gonna come down and make that play well see if they truly go or not of course andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> with the fake punt for a huge play last week <person player="albert wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">albert wilson</person> took it to the end zone against atlanta so when they snap it they do on 4th and 1 trying to quell for the first down dispenser where see when the forward progress gets marked here terry mccauley says stop the clock let me take a pete move out of the way i want to check the official sticks and they are short and kansas city is going to give the ball back to the oakland raiders here <person player="perry riley" race="UNK" position="LB">perry</person> and allen converge on the tackle it s the breathing farm for the budweiser clydesdales and occasionally of course that chris and the boys may run of keeneland ours arent quite that fast so john <person player="jon feliciano" race="UNK" position="OG">feliciano</person> comes in along the offensive front so theyve already made a change theyre out of the pistol they give the ball to murray were about a six yard game so with assembly ill tonight and inactive they started alexander but now <person player="jon feliciano" race="UNK" position="OG">feliciano</person> number 76 comes in along that offensive front there we go right here these two right out here going to take care of nunez roche as theyre sort of get spun around and there goes the back right by him <person player="latavius murray" race="UNK" position="RB">latavius murray</person> so they are fishing for an answer at left guard to replace one of the great s second down and five from the 32 yard line and nothing happening there that line cant open up any kind of a hole murray stopped for no games itll be third down and five was 740 to go in the opening frame <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> coming back from an injury took him a game to warm up and then of course he had that big night on sunday night against <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> in that dramatic overtime win claire for a lot of years 35 car pressing states a sack at first but not the second time <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> the first guy in there he spun away from him for the moment then rakim nunez roaches came in to finish a poor poor town around the outside against the weak link of this offensive line <person player="austin howard" race="nonwhite" position="OT">austin howard</person> and i was told by the raiders they would never leave just in <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> one on on the outside they did saw why they shouldnt have now youve got hell back there hell muff the punt and that was the turnover that the raiders cashed in for three <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette king</person> most snap gets it away saved it in this time hell maybe a little gunshy goes to the fair catch at the 31yard line there s the sack kansas city has the ball at number 99 is gonna get full credit for that one with the empire state that s where our crew will be going sunday night for the cowboys and the giants from the 31 casey begins this drive and were over the right side takes the ball mount to the 35 yard line let s call it for second down and six well if youre chiefs man you know about <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> he wants to get the ball out of his hands as quickly as possible and it is the fastest in the nfl two point three six seconds and the average depth of target seven point seven so of course with all those stats so far tonight he has one completion for 39 yards right if that wont pass to calmly down the sideline hell split while the rightest fast as they come second down and six and the bass is from underneath right away is the anthony <person player="deanthony thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> she spun out of bounds like the linebacker <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">malcolm smith</person> itll be third down and five one of the things the chiefs would like to do tonight is to get after these inside linebackers <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">malcolm smith</person> and <person player="perry riley" race="UNK" position="LB">perry riley</person> in coverage they have terrific athletes inside <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> at the tight end position <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where an excellent route runner coming out of the backfield but on that one it was <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">malcolm smith</person> up to the challenge they bring <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">charcandrick west</person> into the backfield as they normally go on third down all right i got clear him out spins fires over the middle by his favorite part <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> to the 50yard line and a first down tonight the raiders were going to try and make contact with kelsey so watch how quickly this ball comes out that back foot and just fires it after looking left kelsey one of the best if not the best route running tight in in the national football league and those two guys together have been magic some of the numbers they put up astronomical leads the team has sixty six receptions this season that was good for 15 and got a whistle and a full story allstar for 87 family these chiefs and six guys to the pro bowl last year five of them on the defensive side and the only guy from the offensive side was <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> but that s a big deal here to this chiefs offense because what it does is it now brings those pass rushers of the raiders back into play now the raiders dont have a ton of sacks on the year but the two outside guys <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> tulio mac account for 15 sacks and you get into first or second and long situation here they come kansas city doesnt give up a lot of sex with boys museum gets rid of the ball so quickly as he does here that goes nowhere as tj kari is there to take him down less than four minutes now left in the first quarter defensive coordinator right there ken norton jr spectacular career and he was up in seattle was under pete carroll and jack del rio brings him down last year to run the oakland defense yeah you see a little seattle influence sometimes you see a little of jack del rio s defense that he used with the <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> broncos maybe a little more jack del rio at this point than what they didnt seattle but it s a little blend second down and 14 take the inside gear and extend it out and complete were saying right windham was <person player="perry riley" race="UNK" position="LB">perry riley</person> the linebacker itll be third down in 14th for casey and this time weve got matt coming out here and working on <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">eric fisher</person> and <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">fisher</person> jumps out on him quickly there you dont want fact getting out of that stance too early but now if youre <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> youre down here and we talked to alex about this situation he knows these pass rushers are tough theyre going to be occasions on third lord tonight he s going to settle for a check down and just go ahead and punt the football two days here on a third down and 14 on his own 46 yard line now youve got a flag and they stopped the play it s offside and smith argue that they should have let that play go and it would be free play jehan ward came across the rookie from illinois second round draft choice and smith wanted that free play but doesnt get it and i think when <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> got up out of his stance that s when they decided to go ahead and blow the play dead it just there was too much reacting and was this real football and all that sort of thing here you get the flinch across the line than the flinch and then they blow it dead i cant disagree with that one today i know i oakland side of the field at the 49 yard line third down nine battle for first place in the afc <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> smith it s incomplete that wouldnt have gotten the first down anyway intended for connolly and it s fourth down one of the things we havent seen <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> running much this season in general and especially after the head injury that he had a few weeks ago he s also committed to basically he s not sliding anymore he feels safer going headfirst but tonight could be the night with these two edge rushers we see him run the football a little more <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">dustin</person> cole good his dad craig has two super bowl rings punted for the steelers in the 70s <person player="tj carrie" race="UNK" position="DB">carrie</person> makes the fair catch for oakland at the 9 yard line tick less than three minutes to go in the quarter 3nothing raiders so sunday night 72 hours since the cowboys it s the giants dallas 11 straight wins the giants remember the mark of under any circumstances none of the great rivalries in the lincoln particularly so on this sunday night sunday night from the nine yard line open begins this drive as they go five wyatt under this set and the pass is a short one for <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> makes the catch <person player="connor cook" race="white" position="QB">connor cook</person> is an act of the night he s the number three quarterback how is he relevant here let me think about this he s picked in the fourth round dallas wanted to pick him but oakland traded up and picked him which left prescott still on the table and that s how they wound up with that prescott they wanted to kind of <person player="connor cook" race="white" position="QB">cook</person> in front of prescott oakland donovan how does that work out or cowboys got stuck with dak prescott is that what youre saying yeah yeah theyre stuck with him see him telling the whole gang on sunday night second down and eight here and exploiting it for a gain of a little bit here is jilin rashard went to change the pace mari is 63 and 230 then they go to shows 58 little over 200 pounds now <person player="jalen richard" race="UNK" position="RB">jalen</person> rashard quite a story a young man that had to go through a tryout camp just to get a chance to go to camp to be one of ninety guys to try out for the team and then made the team there and they all say the minute we saw that guy in practice and were all going how did this guy not get drafted a lot to make the team once they saw him third down and four only a twoman rush that time in the pass is low and incomplete so they dropped mine into coverage <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> <person player="mychal rivera" race="UNK" position="TE">rivera</person> the tight end is the guising was going for so it s fourth out we talked about <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> and all that guy does in rushing the passer that time in coverage in the perfect spot watch him drop out of here and run right underneath revere and force <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> to throw in just a little wider than he wanted to so so far as expected a great defensive battle and that s borne out by the fact this is the third pot already brigitte 48point hunters who s in the hall of fame this one is a beauty not only deep but my buildup to the 32 yard line he s going to bring it back out to the nice luck back there that was a 53yard punt and a late flag is down at the 40yard line tara mcauley to go ollie family first out let s <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> so go back to last season run the chiefs difference ran a table at the end of the year nineteen and three during the regular season over their last 22 games allowing less than 17 points that game hold at the seahawks have been better and take a look at that 48 takeaways the most in the league and that the turnover margin is plus 30 youre a plus 30 over that period of time youve got to win a lot of games and that s what affords them the ability to be conservative on the offensive side this is sort of andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> s pedigree he is a firm believer that you drop back as a pass or hit that back foot you get one hitch and then after that youre on your own the belief is that those outside edge rushers cannot get there in that amount of time and nobody to better operate that system than alex beth brandi read is 18 consecutive years a head coach 14 of course went to philadelphia and now the four here so for the 30yard london jet sweep with hill the betters based motion in the fact the pass is caught by <person player="jeremy maclin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeremy maclin</person> who has missed the last four games with a groin pole speaking to read and philadelphia of course he get macklin there then he brings him here since the game is 16 but you know 9th length tonight coming off a groin injury it s really cold gotta watch him you know and this offense changed a little bit in those four games that he was out tyreke hill took a bigger role <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> had three 100yard receiving games and so now theyre going to add that extra element to this offense picks up the big first down there up to the 46 yard love it final minute of the quarter work his way through is <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were up to the 48 yard line second down and that s really the challenge tonight for the schrader s defense they did not do a very good job stopping <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> wearing this running game the first meeting between these two teams and a little extra work because carl <person player="karl joseph" race="nonwhite" position="DB">joseph</person> their outstanding young safety back there is out morgan jr on the defensive side and he really simplified the approach tonight thought they made too many mistakes some of those gap fits in the first game and that really cost him power handed that big day on the wet grass in oakland s the gray was caught at the 40 yard line and it s kelsey making the grab to the 36 yard line thatll be a first down and that will be the end of the first quarter with a score oakland 3 kansas city nothing thursday night football back after these messages from your local and to material coverage is provided by tyco missouri now michaels cris collinsworth heather cots all of the chiefs who were born as the dallas texas in 1960 lamar hunt started the american football league three years of the cotton bowl then came here and moved into this ballpark in 1972 first down from the 36 yard line with oakland on top three nothing intended for <person player="albert wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">albert wilson</person> <person player="perry riley" race="UNK" position="LB">perry riley</person> for the past five years in <person player="deandre washington" race="UNK" position="RB">washington</person> coverage seeing the speed of tyree kill having an effect here he comes across fake in the jet sweep and you can see the safety <person player="reggie nelson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">reggie nelson</person> come out of centerfield and that s what opened it up in behind it for <person player="jeremy maclin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeremy maclin</person> so some of those fake jet sweeps and handoffs and reverses the hill has a major impact on how you have to play defensively tonight for the raiders that s more like a prop sweep right there is not on the right side to engine it s not going deep how many engines going on this one now yeah that s that may been a property turned it into a chick at least the jet proper food very lease here we go quarters coverage and that means the inside safety is going to sit down on the tight end coming up the field and it is the jet down the middle of field who has been recorded as the fastest guy in the national football league this year and you see some of that speed there and what a difference he s made for this kansas city chiefs offense that is the sixth touchdown of the season receiving for the rookie it gives kansas city the lead nine seconds into the second quarter and a souvenir and kiro <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> to try to tack on the extra point and so the kansas city chiefs that didnt take very long 70 yards five plays of course you go back to the sun tonight game a couple of weeks ago when he did something that hadnt been done since gale sayers did it a receiving touchdown a rushing touchdown and a return touchdown so 51 years apart and when you can be up on a graphic and a panel with that guy youve done some pretty good oh my goodness and he is just a difference maker you know forever you think of the kansas city chiefs as being this short ball control kind of offense and teams come down and play the run and already tonight weve seen a couple of deep balls and big plays had <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> who is continuing to play so well against the oakland raiders hills played a major part in all of the scoring tonight because he bumped the punt which was recovered by open that left at the <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> field goal now at allen s with the touchdown 7 to 3 is the score again if the chiefs win the game theyd have the same record as the raiders but well have swept the season series didnt be on top if the season ended right now which of course it wont but if it ended right now the oakland raiders would have the number one seed in the afc bees they dont a tiebreaker over new england patriots would be number two cheese to now the first night of jaguar in the end zone by rashard so the raiders they have been to postseason since oh but in 2014 they got mac in the first round they took car in the second round they bring del rio and his the head coach last season marc <person player="knile davis" race="UNK" position="RB">davis</person> does that with his group they draft <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> they signed <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> you take a look at a team that two years ago started on a tent with par as the rookie quarterback there s marc <person player="knile davis" race="UNK" position="RB">davis</person> son of al team a team that has not been as nice a to bow season since oh when they lost to tampa bay in the super bowl from the 25 and away they give the ball to the tavia slurry who picks up seven yards to the 32 yard line the venerable <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> makes the tackle yeah it s so interesting when they drafted <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> and <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> they basically called those guys into a room and said listen you guys are great players you know or we know what youre gonna do on the football field but we need you to leave we need you two rookies to be the leader going forward of the oakland raiders which had to be a little startling for those two young guys on draft day but both of them have stepped up and done a great job with that as well but if youre a sixyear veteran going home listen to these guys right that s juggling that s caught by <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person> but no theyre gonna wave that one off and itll be third down and complete third quarter you know the the matchup you always watch in this kind of situation is with <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> out here number 22 he s a guy that probably takes chances in any corner i have seen in many many years in the national football league and he s a big believer that if you know it you go thinks he smells something he s going to take a shot for an interception 22 is also the temperature at this moment bar is going to take off trying to get the first down reaches forward with the football but it s about a yard short of the first down <person player="donald penn" race="nonwhite" position="OT">donald penn</person> is arguing the case and theyre gonna spot it a good yard shy in the first down right in front of the oakland bench and that s gonna set up a fourth down well he stretches the ball out but he did go out of bounds first yep sure did it s a challenge it s almost impossible to win you rarely see that overturned there he s he s out of bounds where s the ball and they were to shut king out so king already punky for the fourth time who s back there he could go nowhere dr by d now with a minute and a half into the second quarter she s up by four oh oh that nobody catches bow tacoma bo jackson as you look at both stadiums here and the foreground is kauffman stadium was royal stadium when when bo was playing there of course so good as as a baseball player phenomena as a football player just a truncated career that hurt and a playoff game against maybe in that did it but what he what a career it was amazing to on the play that he got hurt it looked like nothing well and it just just so unfortunate if injury did him in he was able to actually come back from that play some baseball but not for much longer he no one there so it s second down and nine where as carry the one has six times for fourteen yards so that raider defense was susceptible to the run doing a good job on the ground of the through the air is where the chiefs have done the damage smith has already thrown 424 yards of scrimmage there and alec smith i think winds up with his own pass so it s an attempt and a completion and a reception well no quarterbacks gonna hurt their completion percentage by knocking this down act with that let s grab and go see what we can get here third time in his career he s pulled this off <person player="dan williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">dan williams</person> got his hand on it and even picked up three yards third and six my god it s with buyers and that s good to be another first down tell she territory what a combo platter these guys are it s a game 228 tell she s already caught three for 60 tonight watch the move coming off the line of scrimmage and this is one fantastic throw by <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> just had to trust that <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">malcolm smith</person> was not going to see this ball you can see he never even saw it but there was maybe three or four inches of opening in there drilled it in there perfectly huge third down conversion calmly is the potion man one ear takes the ball just inside the 40yard line and there s a flag down at the 15yard penalty second down laron duvernay tardies smith and constable you look at these guys since the beginning of the 2014 season nine point three yards per pass 12 touchdowns and no interceptions and it s the catch and run that most worried the oakland raiders and ken norton the ability of guys like <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> and <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where to catch a short pass like that and turn it into a big play that is what has been beating teams for the kansas city chiefs go see three straight games over a hundred receiving yards and on his way to a fourth tonight first and 20 smith under pressure he can but he comes up short of the lies we think timely makes the jack and he gets taken down in the 25yard line <person player="david amerson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david amerson</person> tracks him down remember it is the back foot the back foot never did cross that line and because of that and despite the fact that the front foot stepped over the back foot did not and i think this is going to be okay well this off i got off sign here theyre trying to run the play before a challenge can be made so oakland is offside cost him another five so the red line watch the back foot now valic smith the front foot definitely over the back foot on the line but not across the line so that pass is still considered behind the line of scrimmage a legal play and calmly with some good yardage after the catch so smith brilliant start tonight tena 1586 yards kansas city has out gained oakland 202 yards to 27 first and five at the 21st and go that s tyreke hill well he s really spreading it around beautiful well now theyre going to this to deep shell look here and theyre coming in between as they separate those linebackers and coverage under nathan just so hard to try and stay with tyreke hill oneonone so they had help down the field but nobody so far has been able to follow him the smith has already thrown a for over 200 yards he said six different receivers and its first and goal from the four <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where it s about the distance mac is there for the tackle little over nine minutes to play in the half itll be second down and goal hey <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> is putting on a show out here tonight you feel like youre watching aaron rodgers the way he s distributing the ball and not just little short passes either these driving balls down the field taking advantage taking chances this has been some firsthalf for <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> it s no game manager tonight i think jack del rio got under his skin a little bit with some of the elements after the last game he did second down and goal from the tour it opens up their check and request but a flag is now so <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> for the moment flag is at the 6 yard line an urban so they go 78 yards another long drive seven plays three runs four passes 13 three and they come right off this edge and that is a gaping hole where shark can request but this has been for the kansas city chiefs and their fans maybe even a little startling for them this was a run run run kind of gained in the rain when they played oakland in oakland they turn around here on a better night for throwing the ball and theyre throwing it all over the park <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> has five touchdowns last season that s his first this year mero <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> and were they have to go in the hands the kansas city chiefs leave the oakland raiders 14 to 3 on thursday night football thursday night football being presented by bud light beer with your team on it an 11point lead as the kick is fielded by a rashard at the goal line brings it back to the 26 yard line so go back and finish up what you started to talk about about the dissing in effect that that del rio did with with <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> but you know andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> said it wasnt that big of a deal but you know it s done it was the alex yeah so after the last game it basically said hey you know i think alex missed a good player and you know he can do this but when he has to drop back and throw the ball that s not really his thing theyre a little bit more of a gimmicky offense and for <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> we were talking to him and he got a little fired up about that he said that s kind of making excuses for a loss we won that game big in a physical way it was disrespectful to our team it was disrespectful for me and you could tell how expenses a little fired up walking out the door there s no question about that here s a flag that a false start you know then i asked i said what s worse so what s worse being a game manager or gimmick is gimmicky yeah and he also said i noticed as well that jack del rio threw a touchdown pass to a tackle in the next game so gimmicky goes around a little boy does oh it makes you good middle do we copy this we love it especially on short wait right dont forget first and 15 graders cant get anything going here because mushara is going to be taken down at the line of scrimmage used to do the raiders on their first five possessions four of them have been throwing it out it s just a different team you know i hate to say that and i dont want to slide anybody else that s in the game but without collette you simply at left guard this is not the same overwhelming powerful run team on the left side of this offensive line theyve been all season and without the running game now theyre having to just get into this drop back mode that s not healthy either <person player="jon feliciano" race="UNK" position="OG">feliciano</person> s you know they exist by this time far has some time but the coverage is great that back end is terrific yet <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> chasing him will be third down and 15 very strong on the outside donald pin one of the great tackles in the game out here against d ford who already has ten sacks on the season coming back off of a hamstring injury but once all these guys finally get healthy i mean tom and youve got just a <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> and d4 come playoff time these chiefs are going to be a lot to handle havent even mentioned <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> s name tonight goodness what a game he had about that big hero last week in atlanta third at 15 more throws bought underneath but it s gonna be will shy of the first down here oh lobby the fullback makes the catch and again it s another three and out and <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette king</person> is gonna punt for the fifth time in the game i tell you i really think that defensive coordinator bob sutton of the kansas city chiefs one of the real underrated coaches in this league it is just year after year we talked about the offense theyre not wide open theyre not this and that what they are is a great defensive football team king averaging 44 yards per boot this is a line drive kick that hill is going to field at the 33 yard line it goes down almost always against the receiving team in tyriq once all the way back away town tearing of a koolaid looking for the options here i think youve got number one get a false start against oakland player out of bounds when the pump went out of his own picking team number 82 fiveyard penalty replay fourth day right that s also the signal for the false start here but the player goes out of bounds comes back in were gonna read kick it meanwhile a week from tonight were gonna go back to seattle we just came from there back then the seahawks will be taking on was a rams when going on with a ramses days that a lot of it is particularly good but some interesting stories obviously rams against the seahawks and the one thing about the rams they beat the seahawks three times in their own house so for whatever reason it has seattle s number you can say whatever you want about the rams on offense on defense donald those guys can play next thursday night back to the northwest and now you have a slightly winded raiders punt team kicking for a second time the tyree kill hill is angled to the other sideline and this time king bunts it away from that spot the bright and hill is off to the races and he s good do not see a flag touchdown kansas city then is a 78 yard return and then there s a flag down in the endzone for the celebration but tyriq hill has done it again you cannot leave the ball in the middle of the field watch all these defenders going that way theyre thinking theyre going to try and get him into the left he floats it to the middle of field they dont have coverage that side against one of the fastest if not the fastest guy in the national football league huge mistake first the penalty second opportunity and it was over tyreke hill takes it to the house and as you said a slightly winded oakland unit trying to chase him down good luck <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> set the table with a good block there and then no dancing on that one for <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette king</person> oh but kelsey gave him a little right back at him that is one of kings favorite dances yeah <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette</person> acknowledged it tyriq chant going up yeah that s the new chant here and here that a few times extra point attempt this year they are the the comeback kings and theyll have to do it again tonight he sits 21 to 3 celebrity apprentice monday january the second on nbc visa made after the regular season springboard to the president s expected mo flag is down on the run back here by <person player="taiwan jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taiwan jones</person> speaking of the presidency and the flag is down on the play that special teams group for kansas city is really something as mccawley all bundled up gives us a signal at two fouls against oakland which is during the turn holding 15yard penalty first down <person player="cory james" race="UNK" position="LB">cory james</person> there s dave toe he was with andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> years ago and fill it off he went to chicago did a great job there at devin hester and a bunch of outstanding special teamers take a look at that his his special teams 13th season 19 punt returns 11 kick returns blocked punts missed field goals pretty good look at the average how much better he is than the average and then the block kicks as well it s no accident ladies and gentlemen wherever dave toe goes great special teams fall of course it doesnt hurt any to have tyree kill on your side either or devin hester the telus been doing it for years and years so now the raiders trying to get something before halftime in the seven yard line fast throw and they first down to <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> and then for oakland that would be only their second first out of the game well a little double whammy going here out as well we talked about no coletti assembly in it left guard for power running and for the second straight week now we have <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> taking every single snap out of the shotgun so some of those runs that we saw against <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> not really possible i should get back in the pistol and so you split this offense a little bit work last week for them and that was another big cutback talking about comebacks it would have a 15 to buffalo on the game carr is able to for the moment escape and there was this run out of bounds avoided the sack but itll be second down and nine you got <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> who was taking a moment on the turf and a great player through the years they picked him the number one out of texas back in 2005 so 12 really good years for that guy well im not good at all for a guy who s had issues in the past few seasons with achilles and foot injuries and they take his shoe off and <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> has to come up and take a look at this it looks so innocent at the beginning the end result is not so innocent just as he pushes off to go chase his play he just simply goes down and he toward the right achilles in 2014 and week one immediately took his helmet off just sort of sat there it came out take off the shoe and there have been some reports that his left achilles have been we wont speculate beyond that but my goodness gracious the heart has sold for so many years of this kansas city chiefs defense that s tough their leading tackler and their alltime leading factor as well the show so second at 9:00 a little is murray theyve done a really good job of bottling him up was leading ground gainer has carried the ball seven times for only twenty two yards three yards per carry one of the keys for this chiefs defense is the ability to play man coverage with their linebackers and <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> one of the best cover linebackers in football great anticipation reading and without him in there now you just have to wait and see but were going to see some confusion theyre already missing just to march lillard another inside linebacker so theyre down to positions down third down and five bart throws and that s going to be caught for a first down up to the 40yard line to climb wolford the tight end covered by the strong safety ronald marker i can remember climb wahlburgers did miami university of miami and just was such a good route runner i thought he would be a really good pro maybe hasnt quite exploded as much as i thought you can see that pinkie barely off the ball there now they picked up the pace here and this is murray up to the 48 yard line would be his longest run of the night that s a seven yard pickup second down to three they were in this same position a week ago and went to the no huddle offense and perked up and just right through the second half the unstoppable campaign unanswered points against the buffalo bills it s close to a first down murray herring you in with your guy on the university of central florida and they spot him a little bit short of the first down third and inches well here s what made coletti assembly so great when these two guys got a push right here they would push him right back into that linebacker now theyre running the same exact play and there s just not the same movement backwards that you had when he had <person player="donald penn" race="nonwhite" position="OT">donald penn</person> and collectio assembly but in the same exact play offensive lineman here on a third and thatll pick up the first animal hole more s murray springs forward to the 39 yard line tackled by parker looking ahead to the half you still have open all of its timeouts supposed to doom in a warning just there no matter what you do when you come in and you bounce this thing to the outside when you dont have your middle linebacker right now theyre playing a safety <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> in there at the linebacker position he jumps hard inside to that gap now it s hard enough to play linebacker on an ongoing basis but youre filling in for <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> who s so dynamic stopping those kinds of be the star something for the try to exploit it for him to drive the passion by <person player="mychal rivera" race="UNK" position="TE">rivera</person> the number two tight end and he takes the ball in the 28 yard line and that s going to take us to the twominute warning so the raiders on the move but down 20 1 2 3 in kc plexis halftime coming up were gonna get mic toning and <person player="rodney hudson" race="UNK" position="C">rodney</person> out of their heated trailer maybe to break down the first average ice and then the interval network rule take a look at the sunday night game that youll see on sunday night football cowboys giants okay two minutes all their timeouts available for open best drive of the night and bar is gonna go for it all and to deep rashard cutting down the sidelines he had <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> covering itll be second down <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peters</person> taking another chance watch him he looks at the quarterback he thinks he sees something and there goes a running back right by him and you cannot miss that that s the way the night has gone so far for the raiders in for <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> that was a layup that hit the rim bounced away quick pass before taking it to the 20 is <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> he s tackle there by terrence mitchell seeing a lot of action divided the arc shy of the first down as they line it up third down and one they have to take advantage of the backup terrence mitchell number 39 and the which they will do here to the 14 ton of time with all of those timeouts murray takes the wall to the 14 yard line and theyre just getting after the interior now and because the kansas city chiefs are being forced without <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> to stay in their dime defense so now number 49 <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> who is in that dime defense forced to play linebacker so if they want to keep running it up the gut they should have opportunities a drive that started back at the oakland under a minute now and the bass is high and it s caught no game there <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> covered by nelson s car looks over and says do you want to climb out and they do 30second timeout here ever since car suffered that dislocated thinking in the game against carolina he s not taken a single snapped under center none last week none tonight on the 33 snaps bobby wants you on all night second down and 11 fortyfour seconds two timeouts for the raiders for and taking the ball to the 4 yard line is <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> greif tree that s right over the middle pass right on the money no real looking at the clock it still have those two timeouts he doesnt leave kansas city any time on the other end right here it s a little dangerous here they throw a little fade now and that s lucky that it wasnt intercepted because mitchell with a flag down intended for a mari <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> and they have found their spot now the balding place with the oneyard line automatic first down let s check this out and see who pushed who at the tail end of this there s <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> a little piece of the facemask yes who knows let s call it football bringing the extra linemen here first and goal from the one from the pistol sorry tryin to slug his way into the end zone and they say he s sure nothing better take a timeout which they do and it s gonna be second down and we can quickly tell you thursday night football game brought to you by subway try the new reuben stack with corned beef limited time only by macy s by usaa and by lexus wish you happy holidays with pal john madden so the great stars and coaches of what has been through the years a great rivalry take a look here again does he get in that you thought he did everything has to be reviewed by the officials it looks like comes in its gonna be reviewed there s no challenge within the last two minutes so in new york they can stop it and the kohli will go under the hood and it looks like this could be a touch that you could see when murray was coming away from the pilots going i got in there s no question he got over the line now did anybody blow a whistle that would have been a conversation i would have had before i came over here for review probably not or he wouldnt be going over did look like that ball crossed the line as long as nobody blew the whistle it s where is the ball where s the knee it s obscured there it all happened before that so as long as no knee is down and it doesnt look like it but you cant really see that knee so you might have to see that knee from another angle right i think is they getting off on this i think they can stitch it together right when they look at this you can stitch the replays together and that way you get the compilations of pictures and you can determine it that way tell you what if he doesnt get in youve got 10 seconds on the clock we think theyre gonna give him the touchdown i mean it looks from what we can see from those multiple for you it is a touchdown all right summary call is reverse you go back to 14 seconds and boy did they need that because not only did they need a touchdown on that drive kansas city s gonna get the ball when we start the second half and there s you have to say it when <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> went out of the game defensively it was different for the kansas city chiefs so hold on to your hat here for the second half gigantic as it turns out that s that drive 191 yards 14 plays took a little bit more than six minutes and <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> with the extra point as the raiders get right back into the fray let s go to heather allen update for you on she s the veteran linebacker <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> who went down with a noncontact injury moments ago it is a left achilles injury the same achilles he had issues with in week 12 he will not return to this game guys know they can only hope either that he s back before the the end of the season you speculate im sure they will check it out thoroughly and for <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> oh well see down the stretch here theyve got tennessee coming in here next week then <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> comes in here and well have that game for you on christmas night on sunday night football and then they will end their season at san diego so the statistics waited to kansas city if you had to throw out that last driver they had done the raiders had done nothing and the turnover was when hell muff the punt and oakland recovered and that led to the <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> field goal well it is it is going to be an interesting second half because right now either you go with the safety <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> to play in there number 49 or you go with <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> who came into tonight the leading special teams tackler but with only five defensive snaps or go at errant snip snap terrence smith who has no snaps there we go something to drink it half done well if theyre not going to well now going to send this one down to hillock and be getting a chance here on a bouncing ball it would have been the oldtimer well tonight after the postgame show the moment the nfl s future was uncertain and the season that revived at the time on 1984 the season and they say saved football tonight after the most gay moment on nfl network you never know what football get saved right until you snap let me just read up tonight look at me say smith with a kneel down here that s going to take us to halftime with kansas city on top by a score of twenty one to ten so stay tuned now for the lexus halftime report for highlights and analysis plenty more ahead on thursday down the street for <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">charcandrick west</person> these chiefs are going to be a lot to handle touchdown kansas city tyree kill takes it to the house and on we go and kansas city to the third quarter al michaels cris collinsworth and heather cox on thursday night football an 11point game <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> 202 yards through the air in the first half and he spreaded around six different receivers loaded by tire we kill 53 receiving yards a touchdown the 70 yard punt return for a td the radar offense 92 yards 34 yards on their first six and then the last drive got into the end zone and for <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">mack</person> 24 pass rushers tonight but no sacks so the third quarter beginning in the game in which the winner of the game comes out of the fray in first place and if the raiders win theyd be two games up if kansas city wins it at the same record but with all the tiebreaker bouncing ball was fielded in the end and this time it is <person player="deanthony thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> so on this back and not hill he takes it out to the 19 yard line let s go to heather all right i had a chance to catch up with both head coaches andy reed said the key to alex s success was getting to six different receivers spreading the ball and being aggressive by going deep as for the raiders jack del rio he said the tempo in our last possession of the first half really helped us we kind of came to life he said you know what it s a long night were here for 60 as for how they slowed down the kansas city passing games it s simple we need to do our job or win matchups and yes they will try to avoid kicking the tiger ii kill jackson easier said than done good idea thank you heather as hill makes the catch here taken down by david emerson after a short game take one of the keys really for the kansas city chiefs is they have been able to keep <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> and <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> back basically off of <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> now some of it is because <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> gets the ball out very quickly but some of it is the fact that these two tackles have done a nice job <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">eric fisher</person> who struggled with back the first time around doing ok as is <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> and he was brought in to do exactly this second down and five theyve got <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> in the backfield flanking smith 32 yard line this is carey running it back to this 16 yard line so how s that for a turn of events between the end of the first half in the beginning of the second as kerry sets them up deep in kansas city territory right there s tj carey and watch him as this bunch unfold t is just gonna break sharply in front of macklin and make the play so all the good that kansas city did in that first half that final drive and now comes out with an interception the schrader s team has been doing this all season long they do not go away an indication point last week down by 15 at home the buffalo and wanted going away by 14 from the 18yard line every snap out of the gun or the pistol go into the end zone and it s busted up at the very end <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">seth roberts</person> looked like he was about ready to hold it in and steve nelson backs it away not exactly sure why <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> floated that thing like that but it was a great play by nelson to get it out of there i mean it was <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">seth roberts</person> running wide open across the field and <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> threw him a little lollipop and it allowed nelson to recover spread them out they bring murray back into the backfield they give it to murray and he works his way down of the 14th moving third down and six for the raiders and theyre staying inside with sorenson in there that has been a successful defense for them to sit effectively playing then dime defense with sorenson in there at the middle linebacker and you just wonder if maybe somebody over on the raider sideline said hey why dont we go to six offensive lineman stay in it for a little while and see if we can just overpower them they go three by one the three receivers to the left side looks that way car goes that way and that s incomplete intended for <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> so the kansas city defense was able to stiffen and limit them to a <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> field goal attempt ok let s give some credit to terrence mitchell coming in there and getting the job done there s no question that with <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">phillip gaines</person> out of there the terrence mitchell in they were going to test that young player and so far he s been up to it sebastien jakosky made one from 44 yards this is the length of an extra point here and that will make it a onepossession game so ten unanswered points by the raiders to make it 2113 high school in kansas a championship where s the kansas border not far from here good halfhour drive arrowhead western missouri we are on this 22 degree night 21:13 is the score the kick is fielded by <person player="deanthony thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> and anthony <person player="deanthony thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> gets chased to the boundary and chased out of bounds at around the 25yard line well until that last series <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> had been right on target and he had been sort of reeling him in with some of these short quick throws and moving the sticks and making plays and feel deep to hit something big yet exactly what he wanted the tiger ii kill unfortunately this is how the second half started so a little momentum changer to make it a one score game once again for the raiders that pass had been intended for <person player="jeremy maclin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeremy maclin</person> and pick brown line to a field goal now for the 24 yard line look after behind the ball comes loose it s taken by <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> ermac it s on the ground at the 18 yard line and sooner or later <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> was going to do something big and recovered by the niko <person player="denico autry" race="UNK" position="DE">autry</person> of the raiders comes right around here and for <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">fisher</person> that was a bit of a nightmare the last time that one arm stabbed that <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> does so well gets up underneath the neck or the shoulder pad area or whatever he does to get around and then doesnt go for the sack at all just goes for the football tried to score with it raiders lucky to come up with the play so backtoback huge plays for ken norton s defense that started the second half the second half is 2 minutes is 6 seconds old oakland has the the two takeaways and they start this drive from the 18 yard line that s what four receivers on the right side going for the endzone and he got action and contact but no flag <person player="mychal rivera" race="UNK" position="TE">rivera</person> the intended receiver the tight end and he s looking around for the laundry and she s not <person player="ron parker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ron parker</person> covering yeah i think they were trying to set it up like it was going to be a quick screen out there to the outside to <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> and then the guy <person player="mychal rivera" race="UNK" position="TE">rivera</person> who typically would be the blocker was going to go on the wheel route down the field but that one was well played by parker big opportunity here for this chiefs defense it that they can make a hold here it would really be a statement and the verdict made one fieldgoal after the last turnover can they do it again mental evasion it s in the back his way to it first down that stopped about seven yards into the run and then picks up maybe another four now this is something you see more and more as these backs get down the field didnt watch the offensive lineman come down for a push so he stopped at about eight yards and then here comes jackson to push him over the top then a first down gain of 10 first and goal niva again runs into his old man nothing happening flag is down <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">berry</person> came up to make the tackle tara mcauley gives cool yard penalty first down tight end <person player="clive walford" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walford</person> for a team the raiders who lead the league in penalties something theyve done 17 times since they came into the league in 1960 what was it the tampa game they had 200 yards and penalties and won the game 23 penalties and most penalties ever in a game and they wanted in overtime so jack del rio we were talking to him the following week he said you know maybe we can do it with 24 raiders do have a little history there bought the 17 grows and that passes behind the intended target shaylen rashard second down and goal well they do come out and had success when <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> went out of the game running the football theyve had a little success here albeit with a few penalties mixed in but they really have been much more spread here in the second half than just trying to pound the football cigar is old for for in this half center 22 in the game instead of a strain to the outside but bran tree has no where to run brought parker again involved in that third down and goal now from the 17th well just the juices going to secure anything here and then come out and get underneath this remarkable what he s done since he s come back for sacks in the two games played prior that huge night against <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> with three sacks and at a it but then tom bali is also had an uptick in his play since <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> came back playing some of his best ball that whole package starting to come together rush and it s a short pass and it s incomplete so that defence force now twice after those turnovers deep in kansas city territory able to affect a couple of stops and instead of maybe 14 points against them limit them to a six if janakowski field goal is good well that s just huge you know it s so difficult to have to answer the bell once on a turnover but backtoback and then hold them out of the end zone twice in a row that is how you go on and win championships with defense like that 35yard attend botanical sp and king is gonna run with it and canes going to be taken down at the 21 yard line so the raiders get two huge breaks that can only pick up three points out of them at a reach port and you can see what happened the city missouri or the chief since 1972 and you read the folks of the chiefs since 2013 watching his team turned the ball over on successive plays but the band snapped their king had no choice but to run with it and sidon takes over here everybody sees that the flags come in because there are flags on the tackle and this is meant to go against the raiders 15yard penalty automatic horse down serve and <person player="jihad ward" race="UNK" position="DE">jihad ward</person> me let s go back to the <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette king</person> what we thought might have been a fake but clearly not john <person player="jon condo" race="white" position="LB">condo</person> with the snap couldnt get it down and eat it and dont forget just before earlier in the first half when tyreke hill fumbled that punt they ended up holding him to a field goal there as well so three turnovers now just two field goals out of it right first down after the penalty and got <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> handle one <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person> makes the tackle and were starting to see a little bit more man coverage now out of the raiders trying to bring that safety down be more aggressive on the front end and just counting on these corners i talked to ken norton about how you might end up playing this thing he said hey our two quarterbacks are two of the highestpaid guys on this team theyre gonna have to lock down play some oneonone i dont want to hear it theyre gonna have to make plays and it looks like now at least on first down that s a style play theyre gonna try hey and on second 290th at far camp and a flat again would delay a game fiveyard penalty down so that is the sixth penalty tonight oh the raiders meanwhile eight penalty 70 yards so theyve hit a milestone the raiders have now had a thousand and two yards of penalties to susan and congratulations kaleo mac though now s when this guy starts getting cranked up second half of the season second half of games that is <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> back time he already has one that s something going to work here second and 14 pass high for hill but he s able to pull it in and take the ball up to the 39 yard line now there he is the discourage season what a player he is it s hotter as the year gets colder a dozen sacks in december when the regular season is over into january and he also gets hotter as the game moves along 14 sacks in the fourth quarter or overtime lavon miller has more at the end third of ten now oh oh see but he will come up a little bit short of the first down at the 46 so they started with that delay of game and they wind up with a fourth down and two now we talked a little bit about mac but here s a guy now with age straight games at least one sack and during that stretch 10 sacks and that eight straight with at least one the longest active streak in the league so he has a tendency to take over when it matters most whole quick to punt shard collects at the 17 brings it back to the 23 and a penalty at the 18 yard line and it will go against illegal block in the back the raiders 10yard penalty first down timeout 8:10 remaining in the third quarter kasey fi8 at home the walter payton nfl man of the year award presented by nationwide recognizing and about players who mate pack up of the game and communities some of the in the past were honored tonight he loved <person player="dan williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">dan williams</person> is the raider nominee and <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> is the casey nominee with the winner to be announced at the nfl honors program during the super bowl week february the 4th so the readers now as the back come up in the crystal and they get to the table yes marie who picks up three yards to the 12 and we go to heather cox now the walter payton man of the year pretty cool recognition so <person player="dan williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">dan williams</person> biggest focus is diabetes awareness because his late father suffered from the disease he works closely with the american diabetes association on funding kids diabetes programs and <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> he started his own foundation to get foster teens the sources they need to succeed he said we found that with just 1% of foster kids graduate college he was motivated to do something so heather it s a grant award that wont repaid the warden the guys who have wanted to say it s as big of tools that they could possibly have here s murray taking it up to the 19 yard line and so now one of the raiders come out and finally end up doing just attacking right at those linebacker spots i think that is the strategy you know youre here the game is well within your control one score game just dont get away from the weakness now of what kansas city is defensively valid <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> in there as the other linebacker with or i picked up enough for the first down and they feed him again and he gets russell down as it crosses the 20yard line alexander and wilson converged to make the tackle well repeat wilson right here make no mistake this guy he has the strength it is playing the run so now it s going to come down a line to whether or not they can try and take advantage of <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> in their peak wilson missed a few tackles week ago ders bill musgrave the offensive coordinator i think trying to pick his spots with a few back in the safety second down and nine over six to play in the quarter bar links to the outside as his errant intended for <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> the no hemic check for the most part the night for cactus war but for only twenty six yards philip gains out tonight with that knee injury wendy i get wally pipped parents mitchell on one of the hottest receivers in the game a guy that went for 129 yards against the chiefs last time and more it has been mitchell doing right in his face car tonight 11 25 77 yards leaning he s averaging a little over three yards per pass attempt is incomplete here and it for crab truth and that s for town i mean this is a bad fish right here im not saying this would have even gone for a first down but anytime you float this ball this far over a receivers head it just makes you think i really i think <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> thought he was throwing to somebody else he pulled his hands down that has to be intended for somebody else dont want to float another one of these in the middle of the field market king now for his sixth punt of the game kill is back there he s gonna pin him against the sidelines and beyond as it s punted out of bounds at kansas city will get the wall okay at the 40yard line i said well the raiders have had a lot of chances but theyve been limited to three yards per play tonight 148 total yards 77 passing yards for carp and on the shoots begin this drive from their 38 yard line while needed on the <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where to the 43 watch <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> back here in the first half working against <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">eric fisher</person> watch this staff move the that left arm extended which sort of makes it so hard for the tackle to just reach them but i really thought fischer played pretty well in the first half and then the second half as he always does here comes back the raiders didnt take advantage <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">fisher</person> the number one overall pick in 2013 this is quarterback smith is neither one a wolf bit back in oh five a lot of draw didnt the first down here is it good <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were taking it just shy of the 50 and you wonder if andy reed on the flip side might be thinking the same thing as well you know we had a lot of success running for over a hundred and thirty yards with <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were in that first matchup let s start reeling this defense in making them play a little bit tighter see if we can get that eighth man down in the box from the safety position get some oneonone outside and hit another big play down the field like we did in the first half bring the fullback in <person player="anthony sherman" race="white" position="RB">sherman</person> and garbage and alec smith will play checking give it to where back inside good run there to the 44yard line ward making the tackle gain a seven second down and three kansas city here s the big difference out is that over here <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> cannot block kiliel mac he can block <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> you saw it time after time in the first matchup so anytime they can get that matchup bring the fullback in the game now they have the ability to start getting something going with the running game theyve the fullback in here pretty much the same play that just ran and this time he s gonna come up a little bit short of the first down under four minutes not a play in the third it s going to be third down and one who s andy reed since to play it as they went a little different approach that time they brought kelsey down inside and brought <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> out on a little trap power play to the outside but all of it is sort of designed now to go after <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> in the run game smith is going to spread them out a third down and a short he goes 5y and fires into traffic and is as kelsey is he s smith comes away with it but kelsey doesnt come up with it he wont forget about what smith is doing here yeah well smith look like he had it but you knew he dropped it because he didnt get up and do anything and the official from the back started calling incomplete so no academy award at all here for smith ball went right between his hands and his on the ground he knew it but he didnt even try and fake it interesting you know said that they came up with on third and short come up with an empty backfield go five wide and now it s fourth down i thought they were gonna run like a quarterback draw something like that splitting it out that wide if they come back with an offensive lineman in the backfield snap it ja riyadh is the fullback trying to get the raiders to jump for and that was that was much ado about nothing this is much ado about ive got the members in motion shifting putting the guy back in the slot sena newsy they couldnt have snapped it there well im not the way your defense is playing right i mean you definitely in this situation want to keep backing the raiders up because your defense is simply out playing the raiders and really <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> has been missing a few opportunities here in this half this will be <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">colquitt</person> third punt dj carry back to receiving boss for a fair catch at the 15 that s where the raiders will go to work with three minutes to go at the third pc up 21 13 many of you know the <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> story leukemia fighting for his life a couple of years ago recovers comes back and how good has he been this year interception return for a touchdown at atlanta and then that twopoint conversion which would have good atlanta threepoint lead turns into a boy victory for kansas city what a player open up from the 15yard line short pass caught by <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> and the 18 years all barry did in the georgia dome last week picks that one off and then of course that the big play came to the mpm there or is his folks because he is from atlanta that s where he had his treatment and then this course the rule change in effect for a couple years now you run it back on the conversion they can bob and daddy up with a football scored three teams last week but if he did kind of scripted reject because it s too forcible and what was amazing about that story was okay he was diagnosed after a raider game in 2014 goes through the treatment program comes back his comeback player of the year and the whole thing and then he has to go back to his home in atlanta where he received all the treatment has that magical game with his parents there gives each of the game aha come on amazing infirmary first down throws and that s going to record before going out of bounds <person player="mychal rivera" race="UNK" position="TE">rivera</person> the tight end to the raiders on the move now to the 40yard line now here s <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> who has so many different throwing angles weve seen him do so many things aaron rodgers his favorite player and just sort of floats that one in there just in time but really the raiders desperately needed a first down just to flip the field position of nothing else here then ahead left in the quarter let s go no were taking care of <person player="mychal rivera" race="UNK" position="TE">rivera</person> in the line of scrimmage so <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> just 14 429 on the night now but youll see him not put this pinkie on the ball in the difference with <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> clearly wrapped around but he is doing everything including backhand and handoff to make sure that that pinkie does not get stung and you can imagine right it s so cold out here you brought it up earlier you dont want to play catch without some gloves on or something on that pinkie im sure it s hurt them and probably making a difference in how he s throwing the ball tonight 22 night his car this time hangs in there and it s tipping almost intercepted look like parker got his hand on it from meek wilson almost had the interception and that s going to make it third down and nine but here s what has been the difference for <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> tonight i mean this is one of the most accurate young throwers in the game and he is missing high he is throwing behind you just just have to wonder he probably would never admit it in a million years but if youve seen him play all year accuracy is one of his strong suits final minute of the quarter there for the raiders our and that is incomplete short pass over the middle intended for rashard he was covered by wilson and <person player="marquette king" race="nonwhite" position="P">marquette</person> came with another pun i tell you what this repeat wilson is playing a great game anytime you get the quickness of <person player="jalen richard" race="UNK" position="RB">jalen</person> rashard coming out of the backfield he s running he s right down broadway atra make wilson and be able to stay with that guy on a twoway go one of the quicker players in the league fantastic series that time by remic wilson so king and this time theyve got hill back then ffunny <person player="deanthony thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> had it back there the dangerous one sets up back at the 10yard line it s a line drive kick and hills going to feel it at a 20 yard line is a flag down cuz itll come to the outside and out of bounds at about the 43 yard line but there s a flag down all the way back at the 37 yard line and with 26 seconds you know we talked about it at the top you go back to the original american football league years this was one of the great great great rivalries and then in the 80s in the 90s one team was good but the other wasnt so there were a lot of years when it was a rivalry but it s not like it is tonight it s back you know there were just so many great men for me it was from my childhood im sort of junior high high school and coach madden s teams and all those rivalries and it just seems sort of mythical a little bit they were all largerthanlife characters and all the stories about the raiders at the superblock will go into all of them but it was just a fun era in the national football league no doubt about it kansas city was in the first super bowl launch the green bay then in super bowl for they won it s only the third meeting everyone ball teams have been five games over 500 go back to 1969 twice schilling s great players versus daryle lamonica kids stabler when dawson flag on that last day oh first time so all the way back over here on <person player="eric fisher" race="UNK" position="OT">fisher</person> it s almost window dressing anytime theyre running at allele back it s not what they want to do it s not what anybody wants to do and that s one of the reasons i think mac is probably one of the strong candidates for defensive player of the year theyre going to be other guys that have sack numbers that are going to match him but when you watch him play after play against the run that s where he is he separates from the pack really with the clock running that is going to take us to the fourth quarter in kansas city 2113 and 2/3 anderson tonight s aerial coverage provided by geico as you look at the country club plaza rich city great job shopping and restaurants and always in the holiday season beautifully lighted a great place to visit now michaels cris collinsworth heather cox arrowhead stadium 1st place at stake in the afc <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> and a 1st and 13 for kansas city from their own 7 yard line from the endzone at the 40yard line that is kelsey <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> gets him out of a big hole you know when you could take your tight in split him out send him down the middle of field and throw a back shoulder that he can turn and so easily make the catch on onehanded or otherwise he is an incredible threat for the kansas city chiefs and for so long he was the big play guy now theyre adding in a dose of tyreke hill down the field and it is becoming more dynamic almost on a weekly basis from the 41 yard line and spence aware so for kelsey he ties an nfl record held by a former team and also by jimmy graham four consecutive games with a hundred more receiving yards for a tight ends and he has a chance to have that record all by himself next week so gonzales graham and kelsey four straight games over 100 receiving yards i had a careerhigh hundred and forty yards against atlanta a week ago he may be chasing that one too exchanges is where is forced out of ours just to update the playoff picture right now there your division leaders oakland and new england baltimore and <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> the wildcards would come out of the <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> at the moment casing in <person player="denver kirkland" race="nonwhite" position="OG">denver</person> and as we mentioned before right now if oakland were to run the table they would cement the number one seed because right now they would own the tiebreaker over new england and so the road to the super bowl would go through the <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> coast but oakland the number one seed today they lose this game kansas city goes into first in the division knox oakland into wildcards and they would be the five seed at this point so one to five if they list third down and four smith wouldnt try to pick up that first down believing a and alex mantha weve seen him do that in the past and some big runs in a playoff game for san francisco a few years back picks up the first down and dont forget <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> can run any plate for utah urban meyer out there and for five speed and we havent seen it much this year but when he turns on the jets this guy can go it he this was a angle that it looked like <person player="perry riley" race="UNK" position="LB">perry riley</person> was going to get there first his pitcher on the outside slinging <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> by to give him a chance nakaoka 47 yard lines spin to the outside that s rare making the catch and he s taken out of bounce by schmidt and we go to heather well chris was just talking about urban meyer who coached alex lip in college the two are still very close and smith totally there are a lot of things he learned from meyer but there s one thing he uses every day which is if you want something you dont have you need to change what youre doing alex said i recall those words constantly to remind myself not to be afraid to adjust it s just so important to analyze what s not working and not be worried about changing it he said both in football and in life thank you so an interesting career with the more took my san francisco here whove just made his first catch of the game and up and down theyre the 49ers werent very good for a while then he came to the fore then he got hurt then colin kaepernick took his job and he winds up in kansas city he s played very well obviously frame do you read and everybody has a million different reasons why you know <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> is this and he s that and he s a game manager and all that kind of stuff but andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> was ahead of the curve when he was a throwing 6040 pass ratio to run and everybody thought he was crazy and now he may be ahead of the curve again with this getting the ball out 25 seconds it s keeping his quarterback healthy and this team has been on one big hot streak for quite a while down smith on the third floor incomplete looking for a flag as <person player="jeremy maclin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeremy maclin</person> smith looks as well youve got kerry covering on the play and that s gonna make it 4th down and four nicely played again by tj kerry were gonna go right out and hear a lot of contact moving down the field not enough for the flag and but the one thing that they did do with that <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> catched down the field was flipped the field position so now once again the raiders gonna have to go the long way absolutely is the sin <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">colquitt</person> since his fourth punt of the night into the air and a fair catch is called for and made at the 13 yard line by tj kerry with 10 15 in regulation an arrowhead in the us in the 20s here in kansas city at some adapter okay from the 13yard line they start healing we just want to clean up something on barry i think i said leukemia before he had hodgkin s lymphoma is what he recovered from a couple of years ago we were ready here in fact that hit the week after he was diagnosed and you know he was just praying that hed survive and here he is playing in a pro bowl level two years later probably for the past month playing some of the best football of his life second in ten man stunning and murray now and murray got off to a real slow start tonight has picked that up and his numbers are looking pretty good right now after a 12 yard gain he has 95 yards on the ground 19 carries right out here were gonna have some key blocks nice job <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> gets up a little too high as he sometimes can and dave jackson everybody forgets that <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> was then that same draft with <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> back but a very significant player their right guard gave jackson came in that draft as well so that was a heck of a trio in 2014 marie ticking up the cover morrissey approaches a hundred to the raiders come back to english this year and a lot of that has to do with that man who has flown 11 touchdowns and only one interception in the fourth quarter or overtime and five game winning touchdown passes which is an nfl record and they still have four games to go pending this one two deep safeties in the field they cant get him out of that second and seven that s a low throw and that s incomplete nelson covering <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> on the play and a third and seven you see those two deep safeties at least in the past what this raiders offense would have done will simply run the football behind coleco simile and donald pin and <person player="rodney hudson" race="UNK" position="C">rodney hudson</person> on that left side they havent been able to run it consistently enough tonight so once again here they are right animal appeal they said of about 15 to 17 yards behind the line of scrimmage and coverage across the board everywhere else had to ban that s away going deep <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> turning around goods collected fourthdown they had such a chance they caught him in that one work coverage that time one of the safeties came down and then they had wide open down the boundary here and once again <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick</person> card just cannot connect on this is going to be a walk what happened to <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> he looked like he lost his balance or something on this throw and just sort of stumbled at the tail end of it didnt pick it up so i know big missed opportunity drive spinner hill 36 yard line and a good run back with 14 yards to with nine minutes to go in regulation but good field position for the cheats but by eight to the northwest we go or the los angeles rams against the seattle seahawks coverage starting at 7:30 thursday night football a week from tonight so came to sitting them up by hey bald the 50yard line or play action smith changed just close that one jennifer macklin outofbounds second down and 10 go back and watch this release by <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> and almost the grimaces he throws across his body here but this is the second time now that they have gotten behind <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> and simply unable to hit on the play and i just dont know what happened to <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">cooper</person> at the end of this one it looked like he just didnt pick up the ball early enough where it got caught in the wind or caught in the lights or something but there have been big play opportunities in this game missed by these right rotten a bunch of second and 10 no game here or were and there s no question i mean you can tell the car is just not right and you saw the way that hand stayed wide open at the end of that pass and you look at the numbers and they speak for themselves here 14 of 34 but 95 yards and it s not often you see a quarterback complete passes or wind up with an average per pass of less than three yards and theyve gotten three turnovers on the night they havent turned the ball over themselves this is the formula for how kansas city wins games and for the raiders they just have not taken advantage 3rd down and 10 that s hill who spins away but can only pick up 4 yards and it s fourth down so with less than eight minutes to go the raiders are gonna get the ball back after the <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">colquitt</person> fist putt but once again assuming a decent punt here theyre going to be backed up and their defense gets yet another opportunity im just tonya this game is completely different and i hate to wear this one out but colette you assembly in there theyre running it all night at that to safety look all night offenses a left guard make that much of a difference but this is that game theyre caught at the 14 yard line with 7:25 remaining in regulation sitting in the distance here on a 20minute drive from here and who s driving the 15yard line that s what the raiders read long drive at the end of the first half and they start here by giving the ball who are deemed rashard and we go to heather as you guys know arrowheads always been known for being loud and electric tonight even more the same might have something to do with andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> still better salute or doctor s note <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> tweeted out a coaches note to fans that they can download fill out give to a boxer teacher to excuse them for half the day so they could contiune andy filling every role as <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> makes a catch up at the 29 yard line is one of the great guys in the league theyre just a question about it so much fun we gave him a little fitbit as a gift to others things you work out in whatever he says all thatll be great ill let it measure my laps around the buffet these tremendous car just went over a hundred yards took them back get the three figures through the air and a hole through the middle is rashard goes through that one up to the 34yard line and now they get back to the running game as long as they stay in that to safety alert and the one thing that you notice with this doe huddle the only other time they did it a 92 yard drive right before the half since then the longest 26 yards are long as well adjust despite missing june or theyre one of their inside linebackers is rashard takes the ball up to the 37 yard line to make it third down and two and theyve been much more balanced than their running game a they run more to the right tonight that weve seen that typically with those simile in there theyre more than happy to just power it off that left side of an epistle but murray back in the game you could third down here for these guys he gets very close to the first thing that lines them comes in here s to habit right on the yellow line checking out first down <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> had a chance at him here just got a little bit off balance and give credit to murray for powering through one of the better tacklers in the game so that gives murray a hundred yards that s big what a they did not need a ninth pun from king at this point in the game and elique <person player="menelik watson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">watson</person> in as the extra offensive lineman they car looks back and he s going to take a timeout timeout raider tomorrow 9:00 pm eastern nfl network realize the trophy winner to lock down and defender a couple what <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> woodson the spotlight so after the timeout from the 39 beep dropped fires over the middle grant reflex steve nelson says he wore and he saw indeed <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> coming into the shot as well right in front of the chiefs bench and andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> giving the officials an earful the question is always does he have a fair chance to catch the football does he jump on his back before the ball gets there and i think the answer is yes as the ball is coming in he is moving his body forward with landing on the back it s close i would say had a definitely an impact on his ability to catch the ball short game titan is wolpert factly by wilson second down second down eight its <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> miele cram tree king lucky was grasping his fingers or his hand and they worked on him so one of their top receivers is on the sidelines now on second down let s call it seven at the 40 number extract respond they can get to the 35yard line setting up all third downs now becomes critical third and three with 3:40 to go an entree <person player="andre holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> is a big receivers on a couple of touchdowns already this year but a 64 guy so maybe if you want to throw it back shoulder or something up a little high give him a chance go get one it s hit as he and that s just in <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> who came in and hit his arm sets of a fork and four most can come believe that offense out on the field <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> so good smacking the hands away this time of <person player="austin howard" race="nonwhite" position="OT">austin howard</person> there he is get your hands off of me come around and make the play so it is <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> when the chiefs needed it most to go for the 36yard line and coverage at the bottom against receivers bass caught underneath pink but the first found is <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> to the 23 yard line santa <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> he s their number three wide out of a boy he has made some huge catches this season gonna get a double pick coming across this way youll see other offensive players coming over here just creating traffic lanes trying to force <person player="steven nelson" race="UNK" position="DB">steven nelson</person> underneath in a work for a huge fourth down bar that s incomplete rashard off his hands second down with 240 to go plenty how they just have not been able to take advantage of those running backs coming out and i think that <person player="derek carr" race="white" position="QB">derek carr</person> is sort of trying to direct traffic with the way that theyre moving and theyre just arent moving the direction sometimes that he thinks that they will second turn a draw through the middle nice game nine yards that s the rookie or shark he takes it to the 14 yard line 12th play of the drive coming but it looks so easy because it is i mean there are only five guys in there to play the run and you have five blockers so when you see that as a quarterback no matter what you have in you just run the football no more now six in there in the box walking it to the engine by <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> intended for <person player="andre holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre holmes</person> and one second until the twominute warning well he s the guy <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> a takeaways on the year watch him get his head around and make the play and that was the play of the night if they can make one here the play of the night right now for oakland <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> is back in the game the pistol for the twominute warning oh man see me can be both store cause it on the tackle <person player="austin howard" race="nonwhite" position="OT">austin howard</person> just a little flinch by howard then gave jackson reacted right there is going to be the first flinch so back to the 1910 penalties tonight against oakland and it s 4006 stamping its feet and rush down the left sideline terrence mitchell big night for him intended for <person player="seth roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">roberts</person> that takes us to the twominute warning and gives teens assited the ball with 156 left in the fourth all right right after the games stick around for the volkswagen postgame report heaven are on the field interviewing the star of the game coming up right after this contest kansas city cannot run the clock out they can take it down to under a minute though remember oakland had to use a timeout with about four and a half minutes to go so they have cue the 19 yard line to get the ball away and were with a nice little one here and that puts open in a box theyve got to take a timeout but they also have to stop kansas city from getting a first down and for the moment with the real looking up at the clock he figures he will save those two timeouts to see what happens after the second down play but boy youre taking it down to 110 right now before they have to snap it well one way or another the clock had run on one play of this series so he just chose the took thing in there second and two from the 27 yard line they have to stop it with 107 and clearly what you have to do here first down would in effect in the game and if you can stop it then you take your timeout and you will get the ball back well what should have been a fourth down and one turned into a fourth down and six and instead of coming back to the crossing routes or the pick routes underneath they try for the fade one more time and give credit to terrence mitchell who had to come into this game and start for <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">phillip gaines</person> i thought he was terrific for the most part all night he has he s done quite quite the job she thought he was terrific too freeagent it was a freeagent third year played his college ball at oregon been all over the lot tonight 67 seconds when it comes down to this stop okay she s gonna get the win is going to was he picked up the first down he does it s over the measure kansas city thinks they have it did they stop the clock from the trip in time had they stopped it very very quickly so there s were backing where s that mark mark is going to be at the 29yard line and there you have it folks so the kansas city chiefs who were down three to nothing twentyone points in a second quarter burst withstand two turnovers early in the third quarter leading to only three oakland points hold them off at the end and the chiefs will have the same record as the raiders 10 and 3 but will have won the season series and will go into first place in the afc <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> look at that one win and last 44 years for the three nothing turnover differential they take it one more look at the spot nothing is challengeable inside two minutes so new york just wants to take a look and make sure and so mcauley will take a look himself under the hood after view the ruling on the field stands horse down canvas that makes it official just about lesly fumble but dont count very disappointing night tonight for the oakland raiders to have a 3o turnover advantage to miss the opportunities they had in the passing game and to simply not take advantage of the kind of game that kansas city typically does not play they dont make mistakes like they made the raiders unable to take advantage of it and they find themselves dropping from a one seed to a five seed on one night in kansas city well when you look at the numbers car tonight through 41 passes 117 yards that means the raiders tonight averaged two point eight five yards per pass attempt in a game in which a quarterback has thrown 40 more passes that is the second lowest in the history of the nfl topped only by and i promise brent must were going that would get jesse palmer s name on the air so jesse was the guy with the giants and oh three against carolina two point six jesse probably wishes you had not yeah but you know what can i tell you were here to serve were trained journalists congratulations the andy <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> and the chiefs that was a monster win ball twenty one point second 40 and had a hell run back smith got redhot and all 21 points for casey came in eight minutes six seconds coming up next a surrogate must be record thursday night football presented by wide life you
