============================================================

that s downtown san diego on this early sunday evening and the shores of the pacific the balmer from west to face the chargers on sunday night night sunday night where are you 58 degrees clear skies in san diego regular season or the chargers <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> will lead his club against rey back after missing four games with a toe injury and the baltimore ravens on nbc s sunday night football now michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya welcome to san diego lengthy at stake tonight first the baltimore ravens come in with the <person player="mark levoir" race="white" position="OT">mark</person> of ten and three and no matter what happens the rest of the way if they went out if they go to 13 and three they will be the number one seed in the afc after playing seven playoff games on the road the last three years so the road to the super bowl would go through baltimore on the afc side they won four in a row now the charges have won their last two after a sixgame losing streak they are 6 &amp; 7 at the moment but right back in the race theyve got two presidents today new england beat denver detroit beat oakland so here are the san diego chargers in position to try to take advantage of that and kristen i cant remember ever talking about a team having a sixgame losing streak in 40 years this decision that he bengals intoduce emiti and being in position to get to the playoffs but here we are here we are again and as usual phillip <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> and the san diego chargers saving their best football for the month of december this is a team that s hot theyre dangerous and if they get in the playoffs you think maybe they can make some noise problem is to get in the playoffs theyre probably going to have to knock off the baltimore ravens were playing as well as anybody right now and that s a tough task on the afc side there s so many good teams right now someone is legit super bowl contenders how do the ravens stack up in your monitor right now i think the baltimore ravens are the best team in the afc and they would be my choice to represent the afc in the superbowl and as you look at their schedule the rest of the way this is without question their toughest test so if the ravens could come out take care of business tonight i didnt really think were gonna see them an indianapolis for years a great defense in baltimore we know about lois and all that reed <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> having a fun he and his ravens against the <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">antonio gates</person> could be a recordsetting light for him on sunday night football nbc sports home of super bowl 46 welcomes you to the following presentation of the national football league on this 18th night of december the race for the number1 seed the patriots have already won but the ravens as we said at the top if they went out they are number one period the steelers and texas also involved in that scramble for the number one seed in the afc west here we are because the chiefs knocked off <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay today and with everything else that happened every one of those teams could still win the division the broncos on top then there the raiders the chargers try to get to 7 and 7 and if all four teams wound up eight and eight and that s possible the chiefs would win the afc west go figure north turnin is this season as the san diego head coach on the field with michele tafoya el thank you coach with denver losing youre now still in the race for both the division and the wildcard so what are your priorities tonight as you face a very talented baltimore team well weve done some guys back the last couple of weeks and were playing as good with them playing were playing a great team s home you know we just gotta play our best <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> went through a tough stretch during your losing streak but the last couple of weeks he s looked like himself what does he need to do to get you in the end zone tonight well we need to protect him we need to run the ball and then he needs the plate within themselves and not try to make something happen that s not there thank you injured his toe a week ago is active tonight not sure if hell start not sure if theyll return punts but he is active and he is concerned al that he might not be able to last the entire game and that would be big michelle because <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> the rookie would take his spot and the chargers would figure to go that way a lot john harbaugh has really done a magnificent job in his four seasons with baltimore getting them to the playoffs in each season they have clinched a playoff spot by virtue of what happened around the conference today <person player="nick novak" race="white" position="K">nick novak</person> will kick off san diego won the toss and elected to defer so they didnt want their offense going against a baltimore defense at the outset there s tons of ikaw speed to run it back for the raven so this crowd is fired up now because of what happened earlier today in the afc west and here we go from san diego and so the caste will balance in the end zone and let s take a look at the ravens office <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe

you see big runs there are people on the ground right here antonio garre the nose tackle is going to get cut on the backside by marshall yonder and here we go the chargers with some banged up inside linebackers and you have to believe that the ravens are going to come out tonight and force the chargers to prove that they can stop the run chargers basically thinking what s left <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> beat us and that <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> but <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> already with a big dean on first down now he runs into his own guys here and gets taken down through so on <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> will get brentd for the tackle <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> picked in the first round out of delaware originally enrolled at the university of pittsburgh were tyler powell on the job so joke transferred fourth year in the league take a look at his numbers here the numbers are okay but all things considered when he talked to anybody around the ravens they will tell you the clock was having his best reason well and he was the guy that orchestrated that 92 yard drive against the pittsburgh steelers that has put these ravens in position to be the number one seed when the ravens knocked off the speeders twice the season in the pocket dumps it off the highway let s take a look at the san diego defense university of western

position="QB">flacco</person> protected it s holden who takes the ball inside the 32 the car presents in the pockets <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> hanging right in there they shoots one over the middle for a gain of 34 just come in with that bunch formation but really the protection key <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> able to step up in the pocket and this has really been one of the major issues in my estimation were so used to so many of the great pass rushers coming through san diego and guys with ability to get pressure but right now this chargers secondary has been under so much pressure simply because they cant get that same kind of fat picked up in the past in complete a little underthrown casein is there in the leeevans who s been on the shelf injured a good part of the season former buffalo billy intended receiver okay sign a little bit late getting his head around <person player="lee evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lee evans</person> of course the guy theyre hoping is going to help break it out but if caisson gets his head around maybe a fraction early there might have come up with a big interception so it s second down and ten when the four games that he missed or turner the head coach second on 10 from the the cash is knocked away at the last minute by <person player="eric weddle" race="white" position="DB">eric weddle</person> whose time for the league lead and interceptions was seven that was intended for evidence whenll got paid big this offseason and this time it pays off right here a lastsecond dive he is tied for the lead in interceptions and just enough on that one to save a big touchdown whittle from southern california has about a hundred friends and relatives at every game fortunately they have some money because most of them have their own season tickets george the defense s head some 1/3 down this season <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> dumps it off to rights again white in the middle of the action to stop at the 19yard line and bring on the field goal to you well if you watch the ravens

off boy that he almost picked up the first down <person player="billy cundiff" race="white" position="K">billy cundiff</person> had a sore left cap and there was some question as to whether hed be

different starters on that offensive line this year s north kearney said the other day we have on our backups backups playing and theyre gonna get fresher right off the edge their allies that s a it one thing that the baltimore ravens are gonna try and do tonight is stop san diego s running game with just seven guys they want to be very protective on the back end allow these great receivers to make these big plays down the field so theyre hoping they can stop the run with just seven up front third down a matchup the ravens great at getting off the field best in the league and the chargers were third best with converting the chargers who in the first third battle of the night as <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">mcmichael</person> <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> makes the catch so spot the ball at the 51st on san diego nice job by <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> that time a loading nod it was going to come right at him right here it s running right for his nose and he stood in there and made a very difficult delivery pickup a big first down l <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> on the outside getting a lot of attention and <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> able to get a piece of him and still pick up the first down we put a fullback in that s history that fuses the tailback injection injection was looking to cry and paxton images man <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> bishop the ravens sideline by <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> well norv turner i can leave anything in the bag here tonight they go motion across the way to help protect on trial <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> and run away from them that is the hardest thing in the world to do right there out is youre a wide receiver to not throw that ball and difficult tried to get it deployed down the field but guess who was right there <person player="ed reed" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ed reed</person> there working against thrill <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> trying to stay away from him and boy has he been happy that would have been <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> s first four were finished second one in the middle in losing the ball but the chargers wind up recovering it is ryan matthews and that has been the issue with him the ravens are indicating they have it gator the former raven is saying im wearing a different uniform no and that s that s the fifth bundle of the year for matthews and that was the issue with him last year in his rookie season there s no question about it matthews has had three straight hundred yard rushing days he is a guy that they have huge expectations for but no running back in the league bumbles a higher percentage of his balls then does brian matthews you can see why the ball gets away from his body and it s easy to knock it out terry william mcnutt could have forced it and then <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gaither</person> who s a witch story playing left tackle leads in his paw and this is <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> by the rookie <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> and let s take a look at that raven defense james <person player="terrence cody" race="UNK" position="DT">cody</person> album boy reading university of texas garrett <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> alabama <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> universal mind jenelle mclain stearic use university says ball so hard university <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> cool night school <person player="bernard pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bernard pollard</person> v boilermakers the uk williams washburn then you go to boston hard university arizona s youre wondering ravens not allowing an opponent to score the first drive of 21 straight games so you go back last year through october and this is brought on the outside and then <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">mcmichael</person> would have been taken down for about a fiveyard loss and four seats to get back to the line of scrimmage really like what san diego is doing so far theyre anticipating the rush and the pressure that of course baltimore applies on a every single game and so all theyre doing is theyre acting like theyre chipping these outside pass rushers and then sort of turning around and taking screen passes or flare passes just a way to slow these guys second down and ten matthews out to the white for the and throws it underneath it s brought there by freud and now the son of a first down and gold we talked about the fact with <person player="lardarius webb" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webb</person> missing and the show mentioned at the top that your turn er said the one guy they would go to work on this smith and that s what theyre doing yeah and theyre using motion that time they moved the back out of the backfield and by doing that they saw <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> move with him so he knew it was man coverage came with the pick route underneath it which is the perfect play for man coverage that s norv turner and his best buy motion by shifting he knows exactly what the defense is doing five of six in this opening drive well be out of bounds second and goal well for <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> he has had plenty of issues in the red zone this year throwing interceptions and not making plays that he typically does you think back to this offense in the past and of course darren sproles was such a big part of it <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">antonio gates</person> catches so many touchdowns <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gates</person> was early earlier in the year hurts so much of the time so now that he s starting to get matthews involved they starting to understand what he s doing theyre getting better down second dose from the truth gonna take a timeout five and a half to go opening frame those stories san diego in some measure that speaks for the problems that <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> has had and the charges have had with mistakes three red zone interceptions this year yet for his first seven seasons second down and is there short yardage guy and he takes the ball just inside the 20yard line let s a <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> stuff that once i wrote a dream coming around the corner right here is <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> comes right up here and just takes on the offensive linemen and buries them excuse me that was jamil <person player="jameel mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> who s been filling in for <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> who made that play letting things out triangle he goes in me <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> and my clover takes it into the end if san diego to leave coming down with a doubleteam and pulling around they do a job on <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> inside and able to get <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> crews say that is huge the missed field goal for the baltimore ravens take it the length of the field the other way the san diego chargers continue to roll in december lock <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lewis</person> out of the play <person player="nick novak" race="white" position="K">nick novak</person> bobberts also a great special teams tender a lot of times the cherries were to touch that an amazing attack though on the kickoff will watch when we come back seven of it youre lucky to check it out nbc sportscom /sn eps extra to enhance your enjoyment of the game one of great feature of the logon vii oh nothing the san diego chargers been a perfect day for this team so far denver loses oakland loses at the end and they were showing that on the board here take a seven to nothing this is a bukowski they won back the kickoff and he gets taken down off at the by <person player="jacob hester" race="white" position="RB">jacob hester</person> then the ball comes out you got a helmets flying off from the rookie <person player="andrew gachkar" race="UNK" position="LB">andrew</person> gats car and get things in order here cause tempers is the referee and it s the first action he s had to take care of tonight <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> the offense runs through him in baltimore leading the league in yards from scrimmage coming into the weekend he s being more than a third of the ravens yards from scrimmage since all nine second highest to chris <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> of tennessee and needs to the last 25 games he s been their leading rusher so that s more than a season and a half and <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> on the referees down at 7:00 and more here tackled by the safety speed <person player="steve gregory" race="white" position="DB">gregory</person> and it would be second down and three for the ravens and it was really that week nine lost the seattle that seemed to change things for this ravens offense and that one <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> had five carries for 27 yards and there was an outcry that he wasnt getting the ball enough and now when you talk to these guys they said believe me <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> is gonna touch it at least 25 times in every game and maybe a reception and maybe a but this guy is <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> will cut it back / left guard and comes close to picking up the first down <person player="donald butler" race="UNK" position="LB">donald butler</person> makes the tackle and they do signal first down baltimore these own schemes so many times it comes down to where are these interior lineman and then when does <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> cut it back it s taken him a long time actually vontae <person player="vonta leach" race="nonwhite" position="RB">leach</person> came over as the fullback for this team and he s been teaching <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> a lot about those sort of so he was and if anything <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> was cutting him back too or the season now he s pressing a little more that s worth invited than a nice job along that defensive front number 92 to make the stop charges lost at least casteel on opening day so theyve had to mix and match the one that defensive front as well as the offensive line yeah <person player="vaughn martin" race="nonwhite" position="DT">vaughn martin</person> right in here and this young man has come off the bench he was a reserve and he s played more snaps than any other defensive lineman for the chargers this year a very pleasant surprise for them second and ten redman sp is the defensive coordinator was at san francisco brought to teo spunks the linebacker with him as well and <person player="travis laboy" race="white" position="DE">travis</person> will boy second down and ten like <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis pitta</person> theyd love to go to the titans the ravens beat addiction and pitiable they big part of that passing offense well and what you do is you take these big receiving tight ends were seeing it around the league right now flank them out wide at for <person player="steve gregory" race="white" position="DB">steve gregory</person> the safety to come over and essentially play like a corner in a lot of space and when you get that big body it is almost impossible to try and break up a throw like that it is without question been the year the tight end and the nfl in fact they have three of them in the game right now and twenty chris <person player="kris wilson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">wilson</person> is the man and all across the 50yard line to the 49 ways tackled by <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> yeah marshall yonder is a guy that is just a nasty guard on the backside we have seen it since day one some of these cutbacks over here watch what they do here and alignment next to them and i mean those are just blocks that offensive linemen love and defensive linemen hate but that is a legal block because it s an adjacent line this time <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky</person> 11th year heisman trophy winner left football for a while he s gonna become a massage therapist and back he comes areas and he s closing in on ten thousand yards third most among active players yeah and <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky</person> waves what is the 34 years old now and still turning it up and you know he looks good running the football he runs with power he runs with authority and he s been a nice changeup for <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> and back on hill at the <person player="patrick crayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">patrick</person> henry high school here in san diego for the 41 and then <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> under pressure he has to throw it away nobody was she s phillipston will be sickened down in 10 and it s been such a luxury to have <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">shaun phillips</person> back in the lineup he is the one real difference maker on this chargers team missed a lot of time so far this season with injuries and we saw minh a very similar play in the game last week not being fooled by a bootleg and <person player="steve gregory" race="white" position="DB">steve gregory</person> was the beneficiary of it ended up with an interception return for a touchdown <person player="louis vasquez" race="nonwhite" position="OG">louis</person> on the ravens tribe won and his team down laya touchstone final minute opening quarter second down and ten intended kotori spent the working is good to catch we third down and ten that was one weirdlooking throw im not sure exactly what happened if <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> maybe thought he was in danger and saw it late who tried to regrip it but that baby sailed about ten it just like slipped out of his hand third and ten to fourman rush blaka escaping wanna pick up the first down and <person player="quentin jammer" race="UNK" position="DB">jammer</person> so <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> avoids the sack takes off to his right converts on third down on what figures to be the final play of the opening quarter <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> is as mobile as any quarterback playing in the game right now on some plays like that he has simply been tremendous making big plays for the ravens takes it to the 29 that s where the second quarter begins into one the san diego chargers seven the baltimore ravens sunday night football resumed zach aerial coverage tonight is being brought to you by

just does not get enough credit for what he does watch him take out the outside linebacker here and just create a massive hole so you talked to <person player="cam thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DT">cam</person> cameron he says this guy belongs in the hall of fame i like hall of fame he said absolutely he has been around some good fullbacks in the past but this is a guy that has made a difference for the ravens and counter the offensive coordinator to miami for years he had coached and then on to baltimore <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person>

to send that one to the back of the end zone and berbers and the chargers would begin their second possession of the night at the chargers another bizarre season normally they start very slowly but this year they start fast they went four out of five then the roof caves in lose the next six there s a bye week in there as well they went almost two calendar months without a win then they win the last two games oh be it it s jacksonville and buffalo that knocked off by a combined 75 to 24 here they are right back in the race with losses today by the broncos and the raiders we have seen teams get hot late and have those runs carry right through into the playoffs last six seeds have won the super bowl in the last home year matthews picks up to go back and look at some of the things norv turner is doing using motion to his advantage by taking matthews and flanking the amount <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> had to go with him at that point <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> now knows he has man coverage so he s gonna go with the picc route use <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gates</person> on one side force <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> to run over the top hit it in there to mount employed that s what norv turner does about as well as anybody in football he can help his quarterback figure out exactly what theyre playing and what theyre doing on the other side and that s an tonio gay the first down so chris perhaps you heard kansas city beat <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay today and how about the the division race though in the afc west where every team is still alive including kansas city yeah and you have to give romeo crennel a lot of credit where they didnt blink at all in that game we saw their defense play so well earlier in the season against the pittsburgh steelers so who knows but i tell you when you watch <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> start to play and throw the ball the way he is right now it s hard not to like what the san diego chargers are doing to and this is why and i really think you could almost take ryan matthews rushing yards at the end of this game and i can tell you whether san diego is going to win or not so much of this offense is built around play action and unfortunately in order to have success you have to beat guys like hello de nada inside now he can just physically take your guy and move him backwards and all of a sudden it s a lot tougher to try and run the football second down and nine fortyfive is going to get buried back at the 25yard line and there s a penalty while scheffers has not had to make any calls tonight here s <person player="corey liuget" race="nonwhite" position="DT">corey</person> reading this would be the first penalty of the game personal foul head slapped number 55 defense big penalty on <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> having the kind of year he could be the defensive player of the year in the nfl yeah but this one hurts you go from sack to 15 yards the other way and boy <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> had no chance and ryan matthews trying to clean him up you saw that but inside inside it was a pretty dominant rush that time by jamil <person player="jameel mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> who distracted <person player="luis castillo" race="white" position="DT">luis</person> <person player="louis vasquez" race="nonwhite" position="OG">vasquez</person> just enough to set up the sack it great for the charges the more is it the mid felix strike poor ereading it is there to make the tackle it will be second down and nine <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> right now has a big assignment animal as we speak he s getting beat up on the outside by <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> he s turning his head he s looking a little nervous he has got a plow his way in there he s not a huge guy sucks as a much more physical guy but you can see right now <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">mcmichael</person> is flinching just a bit on those hits and he is a key blocker tonight in this game both teams totally balanced run pass to this point pressure coming <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> kitchen away julio s <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gates</person> who makes the catch and gazes mouth for two and he s two away from tying charlie joyner as the alltime san diego charger reception leader that s a 20yard game it again north turner using motion this time they moved to a zone gave <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> a good look and <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">antonio gates</person> who is getting healthier this guy has had a bad fourth the entire year has not been able to practice much practice the entire week and right now theyre thinking that he could be a major factor in this way and there s charlie joiner assistant coach with the chargers who leads <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gates</person> now by two of all time the legendary to a man the raymond s bring the <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> have superstores theyve got <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> and hello dean lava and theyve got a dream but they will tell you this guy is right there with everybody on this defense jarrett <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> just doesnt get the pub and what he does better than anybody is stuff anybody who wants to try and knock him out <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">antonio gates</person> had no prayer that time when you talk to some of these coaches about <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jared</person> <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> they say when other coaches approached them before the game one of the first names they bring up is garrett <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> theyd havent seen a sand backer set the edge not allowed guys outside any better in the league than what he does the injection laser for containers winston <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> had gotten the step with the pan saloon just cant miss this youre going to get cover zero back here no free safety whatsoever it s going to be a free shot no pressure on phillip <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> and that s one theyd have to hit they want to go against <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> the young wookie brilliant route missed the throw stick that one in your back pocket if the chargers dont come up with a win tonight that was a huge opportunity and <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> knows it the tigers takes a crack from <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lewis</person> and the chargers to center for a field goal one of the reasons you dont cut back is you dont want to see this when youre whoa and remember helmettohelmet is off when it s a runner in the open field not that defenseless player welcome back <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> 45yard attempt for <person player="nick novak" race="white" position="K">nick novak</person> he had to take over the second week of the season they launched their pro bowl kicker <person player="nate kaeding" race="white" position="K">nate

one where he was and he s been on a couple those uso trips and the one remember more than any other was jeff fisher there s one of the coaches that went along finally found a way to escape and go fish caught a fourfoot fish and to think bit him in the face so this is but for the so many of the were in women alone here in san diego big charges for to swing it out to the by <person player="eric weddle" race="white" position="DB">eric weddle</person> third down and four after a pickup of one here the old harvard die in the middle the center matt burke still finds a way to get it going here i did youve seen have some great days the past were talking a campaign like they have the best center in the division balancing company there s some pretty good ones in these now let s see third down and this is where the chargers had trouble all season long had trouble on the way drive touchdown was poured on the third down play it s 35 in a fourman rush wakko escapes again to be the class damnit s<person player="cam thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DT">cam thomas</person> who for the moment well get the shack pending the flag start number 78 well so that was whistled dead and the crowd was so alive that nobody heard that <person player="brandon mckinney" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mckinney</person> at the fall story you know one of the things that brian <person player="brandon mckinney" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mckinney</person> still has a tough time with is any kind of a speed washer on the outside ravens have basically eliminated seven step drops because they feel like as with that baggage with speedy running game to third and ten briefing up corner blitz coming fast on the outside is bought for a first that <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> makes his first catch of the night rookie out of maryland who broke in with a spectacular rumors against st <person player="louis vasquez" race="nonwhite" position="OG">louis</person> his first three receptions this season their four touchdowns the blitz over here off the lefthand side and nicely picked up had time by the back and <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> that s a tough catch on the outside going to the ground you bobble that one at all which he did a little bit but i think made a clean catch <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> now back in of another third division and in the third and ten filled by <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> and we check in with michelle chargers linebacker <person player="travis laboy" race="white" position="DE">travis laboy</person> has gone to the locker room he is questionable with a knee injury so <person player="antoine cason" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antoine</person> <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> in well let you know if anything changes but right now questionable with aniele <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> a former raven played three years theyre leading soccer on the team now and really not that huge of an injury because <person player="antoine cason" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antoine</person> <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> and <person player="travis laboy" race="white" position="DE">travis laboy</person> usually alternated anyway now that shawn <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> will bat second down and eight 11 and the charges come across the line who did what to whom encroachment number 71 defense fiveyard penalty remains second down to race first across thatll make it second down and six we would be willing to circle that but i think everybody saw that paul sighs that was not that big a deal chargers no they have a great opportunity tonight though boy and not often when youre struggling through the course of a season do you catch a day like the day when everybody in front of you loses they know what this opportunity means tonight the top of that show is life steps of a third down in about three that the only team in the history of the nfl to have a sixgame losing streak at any point the season and get to the playoffs would be the 1976 90 bengals and what was amazing is that was in a 14 game season here s john <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip</person> sousa to make a difference for this team despite the fact he got double release able to find yeah they throw it has a little too high for ray with a stop and this will be the first punt of the game my what a blown opportunity we saw the chargers have won this is a layup this is kobe <person player="bryant mckinnie" race="nonwhite" position="OT">bryant</person> missing a layup out here weve got a pick action coming in here <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> by himself in the flat for a walk in first down and they cant get it completed jason in the opening half with sandy baltimore 10 december one of the solid and steady guys in the middle <person player="nick hardwick" race="white" position="C">nick hardwick</person> the center and a big weekend for him because yesterday his wife presented him with hudson harold <person player="nick hardwick" race="white" position="C">hardwick</person> born last night just before seven oclock the couple s first child congratulations to the hard way 40yard line on first down the middle goes ym he talked about <person player="nick hardwick" race="white" position="C">nick hardwick</person> and certainly congratulations to their family but what remarkable story a guy that never played high school football he was a wrestler throughout high school wrestled at a hundred and 71 pounds walked on after his sophomore year in college was hoping maybe to play on the punt team someday and now as a pro bowler in the national football league that 171 pounds is now up around 300 pounds and he s been so vital into you when they lost marcus but nearly early was a couple of pro bowl guys along the left side of the line eleven different starters on the offensive line juggling and outofbounds is not complied along the sideline right in front of the raven coaching staff <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> covering 3rd and 8th for <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> he s seeing a lot of action tonight or turner really feeling like that this young corner was confident to the point maybe a little overconfident he said this guy hasnt experienced in the national football league yet they can kind of scare you they thought they might be able to get deep on him first round pick out of and hang with the big guys is 6 2 includes in himself burden aid get away by <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">vincent jackson</person> and catching gets pushed down from behind at the 20yard henry williams able to chase him down and knock him down 58 if youre gonna go with the double move on the outside you have to be able to pick up the blitz on the inside here they come nice job on the outside by <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jared gaither</person> picking up the linebacker allows enough time for this double move to happen there you go there s the chargers twominute warning they tie the halftime show the patriots beat the broncos in denver another big day for true breeze what else is though <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> will talk about the packers going into kansas city and losing for the first time this season now with two minutes to go <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> throw ease we fear of <person player="bernard pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">pollard</person> covering second down on the long play it was <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jared gaither</person> the tackle that they picked up from the kansas city chiefs he played one play for the chief jumped offsides they cut him but he has made a huge difference here that time getting <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> and giving phillip <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> just enough time remarkable that he s been able to come over here and have the impact that he had had nothing at left tackle he didnt know what they were going to do when <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gaither</person> has just been in beautiful the guard tyrone <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> over there and he wasnt too thrilled about that <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> 2nd down and 10 from the 20 these days inbound some of these first down and goal at the north earner is really getting them with these motions it s allowing <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> to know exactly what s going on and this one when the motion comes out this way youre going to see <person player="brendon ayanbadejo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brendon ayanbadejo</person> go with him the linebacker <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> right now knows it s man coverage he goes to his man coverage corner route and hits <person player="malcom floyd" race="UNK" position="WR">malcom floyd</person> down the field this has really been a masterful game plan to date against a very good defense in baltimore was again chargers have two timeouts left and theyre not thinking about that right now theyre thinking about taking as much time off the clock and getting into the end zone obviously watch <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> come across their stop right in the hole right in his tracks and <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> is a huge man locked out of 40 seconds they want to leave nothing at all for the ravens on the other side chargers three drives tonight touchdowns field goals is the third drive well see what the end result is squash back to the outside map the charges taken sits down the officials look at each other and then they do signal it easy aulani goes itll be reviewed upstairs for the moment it s a touchdown seven play drives a big pass of course was the 58 yard interjection and i just told you how hard it is to get outside <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jared</person> <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> it was but the key block was <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">antonio gates</person> on the outside what a matchup that is and <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> flanks out there wide so the chargers take advantage of the size differential and allow <person player="antonio gates" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gates</person> to block on reed just enough to get it in there that s duncan for the extra point and that s good so that worked out perfectly for the chargers as they took a little bit nineteen seconds and san diego already with two big presents today then for losing oakland losing and theyre up by ten against the ravens sunday night football from san diego being brought to you by verizon your holiday smartphone destination it never needs a battery unstoppable and my old navy come fun come all old maybe the uss midway the retired aircraft carrier nellie museum here in san diego fans third in the league will be our diesel a third and points allow giving up 17 on 19 seconds remain the charges three projections and all fruitful tonight the two touchdowns and a field goal and san diego will get the opening kickoff of the second half as well because they deferred after winning the open and coin toss you know really the strength of the ravens defense is that front seven and their ability to stop you from running the football so what noah turner s done tonight said basically right were gonna do that a little bit so were gonna open this thing up were gonna go empty backfield were gonna take our backs out wide and force them to adjust and so far the charges event ahead a nightmare get it deep enough to set up at the two seconds left and timeout is taken here so time for one play barring a defensive foul here and you can see how the chargers are gonna line up defensively cover 12 nega san diego taking the time out you know it s so significant though for the baltimore ravens we talked about theyre still battling with pittsburgh who plays san francisco tomorrow night in this game and there is a huge difference that between minor provo balloting you can go to rediffcom send your favorite guys to back in hawaii working now toriel convoy aloha aloha and a bottle to you that <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> spinning away spinning around the sack of the 37 having everything breaking their way today and try to take advantage of it look at the second half hitler 177 diego welcome to the toyota halftime show brought to you by toyota moving forward intent on capitalizing on losses by the broncos and raiders the chargers lead by 10 at the half as we go cross country to dan <person player="patrick crayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">patrick</person> all right <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> with <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> dungy and rodney harrison thoughts on the first half well im glad north turner was watching us on the pregame show when we said throw the ball deep to <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">vincent jackson</person> baltimore s got to find a way to put some pressure on <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> and the charges must continue to spread the ravens defense out and forced him to cover these six four and six five weapons across the field by the way ill pat you on the back because that s what you want north listen to him let s get to the week 15 highlights a couple of surprises on the afternoon the marquee game patriots at the broncos tim tebow got the broncos on the board first of his two touchdowns but the day belong to tom not tim chad ochocinco on the receiving end of this brady fassett threw for 322 scores patriots clinched the afc east jets eagles eagles keep their division hopes alive against the jets michael vick a touchdown through the air and this is first rushing touchdown of the season redskins giants tough day for eli manning no touchdown passes three picks giants still in the east if they win their final to lions raiders down six under two minutes ago 98 yard drive matthews got a state deep on him <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> stafford to calvin <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> and then stafford to <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> stafford fifth career for touchdown game lions approved at nine and five saints in the vikings drew brees leads 305 yards over the final two games to break dan marino s singleseason record he threw for five touchdowns no picks for 212 yards packers chiefs shock of the day sheep sin to the packers pursuit of perfection tomba holly and the kc defense manhandled <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay three sacks for holly pick up the victory more than just a loss for the packers <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> well i think it was we were ready to concede the lombardi trophy to these these guys and i think romeo crennel and time of holly gave us the blueprint how to get after him rush the passer and now with these injuries to the offensive line i know mike mccarthy has to be worried and if he s not worried aaron rodgers should be worried yeah you got bearspackers coming up next sunday night here on nbc what about you the patriots secondary much improve didnt blow any coverages no miscommunications big balls over there big throw balls over their head much improved in wheatley they were gonna get tim tebow it s a starting point it s not that we couldnt get any worse but it got better samantha when we come back <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> costas on the packers losing the colts winning but before that time to announce the winner of toyotas halftime handoff between 12 summer on the networks of nbc universal back in san diego so for yet another year the 72 dolphins are safe they remain the only perfect singleseason team in nfl history this of course because the packers a huge favor to kansas city couldnt make it to 14 and oh at roughly the same time the indianapolis colts who were 14 and oh two seasons that now seem like an eternity ago avoided oh and 14 by notching a win against tennessee so the packers will not match the o7 pats at 16 and oh and the colts will not match the oh eight lions at owens 16 beyond these statistical coincidences the colts and packers are perhaps linked in a more significant way with two weeks to go indy still has the worst record in the league and unless they have the poor judgments to conclude the season with a mini winning streak they can still claim the number one pick of the draft the question is what to do with it if they get it and for the answer they might look to <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay where aaron rodgers sat for three full seasons behind brett favre before emerging as one of the league s best what s wrong with that scenario for indy peyton manning will be 36 by next season even if you were completely healthy the colts would need a plan of succession it s extremely unlikely but over the next few years theyd have another shot at anyone nearly as good as stanford s <person player="andrew gachkar" race="UNK" position="LB">andrew</person> luck is expected to be so take him and let him back up manning that s no hardship that s an honor plus if manning should go down again the colts would be left with a viable option unlike this year when they went from a playoff team to utter ineptitude when manning hit the sideline yeah we know there are contract issues here but creative organizations can figure their way around that it s also true that other key colts are aging even so when manning returns they can be a decent team again and at the same time they could have a quarterback in waiting who might someday do for them what rodgers is doing the packers now tomorrow morning on today an interview with bill oreilly and also actress rooney mara on her new film the girl with the dragon tattoo mara is nfl royalty a direct descendant of two prominent nfl families the mehra s of the giants and the rudi s of the steelers back in san diego for the second half after this this has been the toyota halftime show brought to you by toyota moving forward this telecast is

diego full star store and a bill to get into film a wireless service provider of the national football league now michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya on this middecember sunday night in san diego chargers wrapping up their home schedule two games to play at detroit next saturday christmas eve and then at oakland ravens 18th street rolled losses trailing at the half second warriors free hit not the company you want to keep when the rams are there in your second but it could be well go out of bounds but after it crossed the goal line so a good break there because pontiff is able to save 20 yards go back and look at some of the things that the chargers are doing offensively when the motion comes out you see them just take the defensive back and move him out but in this case now zone when they emotional <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe</person> is in man coverage on the outside so that s when theyd like to back inside to their man route out to the corner if malcolm <person player="malcom floyd" race="UNK" position="WR">floyd</person> on the big play and so far this little motion game plan has been worked to perfection started mike over to the back deal if he stays in the ball and then it s caught on the outside but incomplete incomplete <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">mcmichael</person> gets popped and we checked with michelle i spoke with john harbaugh at halftime and he said theyve got to get pressure on <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> and he also said and i quote the officials have got to call holding once in a while and if they dont were not gonna be able to get anywhere but north turner said the key to protecting <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> has been changing things up on the offensive line using different personnel groupings and he said were just simply blocking better two interesting perspectives michelle one guy thinks there should be penalties being cold the other says were blocking better but it s that offensive line of san diego that battered and bruised and mixed and matched wine is doing very good job than i after the 23 yard line whether it be inpatient theyre trying to stay with this running game but inevitably it is going to be <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> that has to win this thing there just hasnt been anybody really this season able to consistently line up and bang it in there and pick up first downs running the football so <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> who has been hot lately seven touchdowns no interceptions in the last three games and here s another big third down against the best third down defense there is faso 424 rushing yards at 170 passing yards for the chargers who gets it away caught up at the 39yard sort of read and fairy move the change well one of the problems with bringing pressure the way that they are and theyre bringing everybody here is you have to play single coverage on the back ends and so far <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> has been able to get it out before <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> can get there and this oneonone coverage with these big wide receivers one of the things the ravens had hoped to do was take their bigger taller quarterbacks and match up against those guys but so far it s been malcolm <person player="malcom floyd" race="UNK" position="WR">floyd</person> and <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">vincent jackson</person> winning the battle boy took a shine has taken on for the moment ventually brownie rookie out of sandy takes a ball crossed before the yard line gain of a couple second entities everybody understands what s at stake here <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gaither</person> knows plenty of guys on the other side having been a baltimore raven even though one of the guys he s pushing and shoving was wasnt there when he was there pollak second and seven just outside the 40yard line that is juggle the hill on truth by vincent grounds a third round draft choice to plan his college football in this very stadium oh really it was a nice job bag <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">mcmichael</person> getting a little chip on the blitzer outside and then brown who is a guy that had to pick up a little bit of the roll this year but you see <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">mcmichael</person> getting just enough of <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> who has really not been much of a factor so far in this ball game he is a guy that had three sack palm ties a week ago was a game wrecker in that one and really has not got to go on here tonight to the outside the states except the first down by <person player="dannell ellerbe" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ellerbe</person> it s 18 yards to the baltimore 28 here s the battle going on right here <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> setting down inside and really that was supposed to be a gap filled by the wide receiver malcolm <person player="malcom floyd" race="UNK" position="WR">floyd</person> that time came and made the big crack back block and <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> is able to bounce it outside of doing that effort at a cannot free a couple of plays after taking his shot and interception secondhand matthews stop by reading it the court webster who doesnt get a lot of credit i mean <person player="cory redding" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cory</person> reading it doesnt get a lot of credit inside occasionally is one of those guys kind of like a <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">jarret johnson</person> is what really makes this defense go these big defensive linemen inside they protect <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> they dont let offensive linemen get down on their linebackers which is what allows <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lewis</person> and reel <person player="jameel mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> and some of those guys that go sidelines sideline goes off a little slowly <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> is in the backfield in <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> that s pregnant coming to the inside second down and ten 28 yards stays inbounds and the chargers open the second half with an 80 yard eight play touchdown drive against <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> number 22 they said he was a little jumpy for a wookiee a little overconfident they were going to try and take advantage of it and motion down inside so they switch so they end up being able to run that one on <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> and for having a big for the confirmation so he s holding of the extra point he gets it now touchdown is good <person player="nick novak" race="white" position="K">novak</person> to the extra point and the san diego chargers have now score every drive tonight that makes it a 17point game and ill say who s enjoying this right now is sitting at a hotel in san francisco but this burg steelers play the 49ers tomorrow night 247 san diego sunday night football next week it s the only game on sunday night as chicago takes on <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay s only game on sunday period because all the rest of the teams except atlanta and new orleans that play on monday night will be in action on saturday so christmas night pull up a chair get down in the end zone so the ravens would have the ball for the first time in the third quarter down by 17 points in san diego three weeks ago the fan base here going crazy want aj smith the general manager fired they want more turn of the coach fired so here you are three weeks later you beat <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> will you beat buffalo you get denver to lose you at oakland to lose your leading baltimore by 17 different game first down that s <person player="cory redding" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cory</person> smith making the catch but that s not the sacred that either or both guys keep their job unless of course they have a miracle run and go all the way to indianapolis you know it s just hard to watch san diego play like this because you feel like this is the way they should have been playing all along there were some significant factors though in this whole thing so many injuries that offensive line to blowers on the left side so theyre not without excuses the ravens to try to change the matis quarks were first down by addiction meanwhile the afc playoff picture just to refresh here right now there your division leaders pittsburgh and the jets would hold the wild card spots at the moment but the important thing is here that the number one seed is still up for grabs baltimore controls that but only if they win out and didnt need any other help well especially this year for baltimore they have not been good on the for the average days and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is going to go down and that is tommy <person player="tommie harris" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harris</person> sparingly playing here but the longtime chicago beer stalwart there number of years ago who comes in to get the shack well one of the reasons they cant get the ball to <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> s <person player="antoine cason" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antoine</person> <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> is hitting them before you can get out you know we always talk about backs chipping on outside pass rushers now theyre chipping on the backs it s kind of the reverse of that that is exactly what their plan was in san diego tonight they said any body other than <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> touching the ball were happy second down and 18 when the 34 the pocket is a very for gain finnick gets taken down like <person player="dante hughes" race="UNK" position="DB">dante</person> use and it will be third down and 14 for the ravens you know this is this is the uncomfortable time obviously for the ravens they think theyre a much better passing team they have <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> down the field threat but now with this lead the chargers they were played soft back there in the secondary and there s nothing to check down sirota that s it again look out and he s going to go down again and it launched again that s <person player="antoine cason" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antoine</person> dollars the extra raven team in sacks just recorded his eighth <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> gonna be the beneficiary of some really good coverage down the field they tried to get the crossing route in there to <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> and nogo bank juan bolden who s been very quiet tonight and no goalie <person player="lee evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">evans</person> covered that ditch them inside taken away meanwhile you got a late flag because were going on after the play facemask and so all of that for north it would have been four thousand twenty one and norms game why borns had his hand on it let go and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> s signaling to the official he had my face mask i didnt see the flag it didnt happen in the smoke afterwards right did not black in whoo territory by <person player="donald butler" race="UNK" position="LB">donald butler</person> where it s really just amazing how this offense seems to jumpstart when they find a way to start drives and get the ball in <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> s hands <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> kind of gets upset whenever youre talking about you know oh you know the games that weve lost is you know we havent gotten the ball to <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> and i said when we got behind you know we got to spread it out you got to go no huddle you got to hurry it up but i think the point that should be made from the critics standpoint is that s fine but make sure <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> still gets his touches second in injuries williams in the backfield next to <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> in the door decades ago has he first down 36 yard line the one guy that s made an impression on me tonight is <person player="marshal yanda" race="white" position="OG">marshal</person> yonder the right guard he is a guy that is not only big and strong and physical but really has sort of a nasty edge to him but also the ability to block to here he s going to come up and then get the second guy hit right there up on the linebacker level those kinds of blocks are what allows some big things to happen down the field send around the pattern incomplete because the camera couldnt hold on <person player="quentin jammer" race="UNK" position="DB">quentin jammer</person> headed right there off the deflection and couldnt make the pick second down and if you have a criticism of <person player="quentin jammer" race="UNK" position="DB">quentin jammer</person> during the course of his career it s just the inability to catch the ball in key situations not any easy catch by any means but here s a guy coverage wise more often than not gets it done but just has trouble in his hands around the ball he s such a great athlete you just expect to catch although you would think both here in the league firstround pick back in bow to a really good career but that is the albatross second and ten this little picture to the 27 yard line <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> strikes across the samer couldnt handle it and <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">spikes</person> his outfit care of it honestly dont know what <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> was watching on this play spike s doesnt do anything unusual it s obvious <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> never saw him for a second and after the interception and after the play was over bill legal demonstration on the intercepting team 15yard penalty so instead of at the 25 they go back to the 40 because of nonsense and <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> is bound to determined to finally make a playoff isnt he this guy has played 200 games in the national football league no games zero nada zilch in postseason the san diego chargers fans are starting to sound like the san diego charger fans theyve been waiting a long this season to see this team play this way spike s cincinnati and san francisco he goes to philadelphia one year what happens they dont make the playoffs 14 years in the league was at the 42 yard line parts of this game i believe is the fact that ladarius web one of the ravens best cornerbacks is dressed for this one but really has not played very much and <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> the young rookie who s a good player is going to be a good player but he has been the top target tonight they have found ways to go after him consistently and <person player="lardarius webb" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webb</person> just has not been a factor at all section two the 29 and another san diego first down and <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> is 15 at 75% for 238 against the baltimore ravens well it doesnt look like much but <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> on the outside just gets a little piece of <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> which is allowing jeremy <person player="jeromey clary" race="UNK" position="OL">clary</person> just enough time to keep them off his quarterback and really when <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> doesnt get home for this ravens defense they have issues other than blitzing trying to get there this has sort of been a mass attack against 12 sides and it is worse sitting there game playing and youre thinking what were gonna track that s exactly what theyd watch this all night long we have seen various ways that get after man really <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> has been one of the primary guys on the outside they motion him to his side sort of wherever he is it s not always a devastating block he gets in the way and then releases out into the pattern which buys those tackles a little time and that head slap right there took away the only sack the ravens had tonight and there s a big turning point were 20 to go is the courier the passage the outside but nothing and again they go to work on <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> so the plan is were going to attack <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> on one hand and go after <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> on the other and it s working for perfection the only winners phillip <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> with a great audible he sees and <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> leaning this way he gets oneonone coverage against the rookie on the other side no way he s not going there you could almost hear he couldnt get the words out of his mouth fast enough that audible edy reed leans no problem there you go <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> another one coming right at you first and goal divac touchdown name you got a lamp every year towards the end of the year people will start to say hey what s the team you dont want to face in the playoffs sometimes it s a team that might not even get to the playoffs but the way san diego s playing the night theyd be one of the things they sure are and weve talked about it a little bit wasnt a devastating block by <person player="randy mcmichael" race="nonwhite" position="TE">randy mcmichael</person> but let s give him credit here s a guy that has been in motion he s taken on the toughest blocking assignments throughout the course of the night and his ability to catch a pass occasionally forces those defenses to cover in two ways he s made a difference in this five possessions against the haunted raven deepest 317 sunday night football being brought to you by mcdonald s im lovin it by bmw the ultimate driving machine by the htc rezound the only phone with builtin speech audio and by bud light the official beer sponsor of the nfl here we go <person player="patrick crayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">patrick</person> henry high school is where <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky williams</person> went to school during a senior year in 94 san diego high school player of the year theyve had a few down here marcus <person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> grew up here reggie bush is it a couch me two yard line a chick less than four minutes to play in the third quarter and the chargers they try to make a of a big january the second itll be the rangers against the flyers it s the nhl winter classic at home nhl hockey there s weiss on first down taking the chargers doing something that hasnt been done since the ravens came into the league as the ravens in 1996 first team to score on the first five drives of any game and that would be 254 total regular season games for tds and a field goal tonight and you can only get to the 27 yard line where he s taken down my reform work dekes you know this is the first time all season this ravens defense has given up over 30 points 31 points down were still in the third quarter you wondered coming into this when you go okay the chargers offense is hot they scored 38 it s 37 points but what could they do against this ravens defense defense at six rushing touchdowns all season intercepted it is confirmed intercepted at the 28 yard line shawn <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> let s see if he caught it good this was a national hockey league it would be gold by <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> and the assist of <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> had it <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> helped him secured and then <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> winds up with the ball at the very end so he gets the interception charges have a first avenue 27 yard line a 30round the shuttle so rizzoli one of those cases where your offensive line block to well theyre gonna have a stunt coming here but because they pick up sean <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> coming from outside in he s a veteran player realize the not getting to the quarterback get your hands up and now the juggling act starts and there s the assist there s the interception there s all the things youre talking about with <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> has been picked on the last two possessions two turnovers of the game twentyseven <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip</person> goes down and <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> makes his acquaintance that was some shot there my <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> coming back inside and he has a direct shot that <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> watch this one that s one you dont get up so fast and that s really what the ravens have been missing tonight they havent been able to get pressure on robert and he didnt get up so fast they kind of bent over as we were showing you the replay taking an extra moment third down eight in the 27 yard line a lot of speculation around the country that <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> was hurt earlier this year loser duane barry was throwing a lot of interceptions distant wolf right and <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip</person> said absolutely untrue i appreciate people trying to make excuses for me it was never an issue ever and <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> told us some said i listen we have lose effect for this guy we appreciate his toughness in there and <person player="nick novak" race="white" position="K">nick novak</person> second stint with the chargers had to take over when katie tore his acl on the opening play of opening day 37 yarder and it hits the upright so if my old partner john madden used to call a donk well you know sometimes funny things jumpstart you you catch a break you turn it over you dont give up any points so <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> gets another shot it went inside it just been going over the point back there s your drink do you think john came up with all those perfect words well you know you think about when you listen to that sound if you had a spell that sound that would be like do i nk point yeah it s pretty good wonder if john has a dictionary or anything you know that he s got the boom in the way doing the ducking and he s got the double cut wasnt that one he s got everything he had everything but the big ugly s ever speak <person player="vincent jackson" race="white" position="WR">jackson</person> he had the turducken timeout taken here you cant underestimate the importance of what s gonna happen in the afc north especially the ball or ravens theyre in the position right now it could be the number one street but if then not the number one seed they gonna wind up as the number five seed in all likelihood and you just wonder how this might impact <person player="ben grubbs" race="nonwhite" position="OG">ben</person> roethlisberger s decision tomorrow night nitori smith is able to with the ravens help above the offensive lineman yonder keep possession of it well we know that the baltimore ravens understand i got a little tv timeout of that that s good he deserves it he s been playing well out here tonight they just needs a breakout play they need something theyre down 24 that s conceivably two three touchdowns and screeching point conversions but they havent that fast dangerous were winds up in the arms of <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> and that s a first down yeah i tell you <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> s been close on a lot of them now they can start chances defensively almost got there on another one but they really havent taken a shot down the field because basically because of this lead now the chargers sitting there with those two deep safeties down the field that that s the ole miss gonna take us to the end of the third quarter and san diego or the chargers lead the ravens alerting seven and aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by geico as you look at belmont park that s called the great dipper that roller coaster there was that s the belmont park without paramutual windows not a place that wed necessarily frequent would you get on the great dipper and back we come into the stadium which was opened in 1967 it s second down and you know all of the charges somehow keeps controlling the ball but nothing but those powder blue shirts and their barns ron <person player="shaun phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillips</person> and there s another sack well there was plenty of time on the play there s no question about it pocket sort of just squeezed closer like eli manning is that super bowl for ovid that time another sack and for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> you can tell he s getting frustrated with all these dump offs he wants to work the ball down the field they just cant the chargers are playing 14 the charges it s for saks tonight for the chargers plus one that was negated by a penalty and none for the ravens this has been some performance and i think the interesting part about this thing is that this banged up chargers defense has played tremendous football tonight which great go out of bounds beautifully the oneyard line beautifully iego well this is a familiar refrain for charger finch take a look at that since oh seven when north took over here 19 and two in december in january <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> 24 and 2 versus 1950 when december in january and again this year theyve done such a hole for themselves normally they dig it early and then come out the rest of the way this year they actually got off to a good start at four in one and then had the sixgame losing streak now theyre on the verge of making it a fourgame winning streak fashion breathing space taken pester fix it up to three good a flag yeah nice job by <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> going with the hard count off his own goal line really have nothing to lose if your guys jump first and five from out of the six now well and <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> is thinking what i was thinking it s time for this defense to step up and make a play there are superstars on this ravens defense and the superstars have done really nothing tonight <person player="ed reed" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ed reed</person> <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> trial <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> bode nada you know this is the time theyve got them backed up if youre gonna make a move this is now it s got to happen miss <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lewis</person> you could see grabbing <person player="jacob hester" race="white" position="RB">jacob</person> mr bringing him to the ground with some metal it s really been the story of this game there s no file for a face mask on the playa be second down to unofficial it looks like one when he got talked off of it well and you can put the hand and tackle the facemask if you dont grab it and twist it and turn it there s a either on that helmet and you could almost see <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> s hands sliding across the visor he couldnt have done a face mask if he wanted to go and get his hands in there turned out to be a good coal second down and one for the tag <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> well this stadium has been around since 1967 is jack murphy stadium for a while man qualcomm bought the naming rights and then qualcomm as a new product believe it or not called snapdragon so for the next couple of weeks this stadium will actually be known there it is snapdragon stadium snapdragons one for one so far well last night im trying to think about howard cosell saying hello again everyone and welcome the snapdragon stadium in san diego california the end of civilization first down <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> man that <person player="bernard pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bernard pollard</person> comes down he makes some hits that make you just sort of cringe watching him coming out of centerfield gets down there so fast to make this hit and when he hits you you stay hit he is one of those guys that just fits the mold you know there s some guys that just looked like ravens players when they walk on the field when he is saintly when im not the cover guy <person player="ed reed" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ed reed</person> is but he s a hitter number one graduate for the 22yard line traded up to get matthews damn you think about you know the recent history here obviously they had lt ladainian tomlinson and then they had michael turner and then had to make a choice a few years ago do you want to bring lt back or whatever with turner s turner winds up going to atlanta guilty that goes to new york and they have to draft a new back and that s 999 yards for matthews diffusion but here s the difference unlike lte ryan matthews comes out on third down he s not the protection guy and he s not the receiver that helped however who was a <person player="cary williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cary</person> s 32 yards and that yards for toby well one of the problems when you bring in your nickel and dime defense you dont have as many guys so here s <person player="luis castillo" race="white" position="DT">luis</person> <person player="louis vasquez" race="nonwhite" position="OG">vasquez</person> coming around with a trap well there goes <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person> basically whatever norv turner is called tonight it has been good and rain <person player="louis vasquez" race="nonwhite" position="OG">louis</person> s first game back from injury has not been good well that s norms pedigree in a way it s offense he s always been extremely highly regarded as a play caller and tonight is born but that s the frustration among the charger things they go why cant this team looked like this all the time how do you go into kansas city and look like that how do you blow a lead in new york to the jets and look like that how do you lose to denver in overtime you know how do you set up a 50 someodd yard field goal instead of working the ball down the field against denver and that s why the fans are so frustrated well i understand that and i also understand that when you lose to pro bowlers on the offensive line and marcus mcneil and chris <person player="kris dielman" race="white" position="OG">dielman</person> without question the great that has to be the most cohesive in the nfl is that offensive line and when you start mixing and matching inevitably often meanwhile here s <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gaither</person> former raven left there who had lost the way wasnt in shade that a contract issue winds up in teens i said let s go back to a couple of weeks ago we are in kansas city and kansas city shouldnt have even been in this game and all of a sudden they give him the steelers all i can handle they bring <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gaither</person> in because of an injury to the starter it occulus his false start and that got <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gaither</person> in effect the trip to san diego yeah he was cut and when you talk to phillip <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">rivers</person> he said this guy is the greatest waiver wire pickup ever i mean there s no question to plugging him in it has made a huge difference on this office <person player="luis castillo" race="white" position="DT">luis</person> and pick up the first down everything is working the powder blue i think that sort of says it all that s been the night tonight superstar players on this ravens defense not playing like superstars <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> sorta has <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> dead to right / almost as big as <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> is spins out of it picks up the first down and here we go toller waves in a 243 in lewiston 250 is drive eight minutes to go well the pittsburgh steelers have a chance now do a position to move ahead of the ravens just not the ravens back to what would be in effect in number five seed and if youre the five street you know what it means you have to go on the road for a wild card game youre definitely on the road from the next game and the only chance you have to play a playoff game at home is at the sixteen advances from the conference championship game which doesnt happen boyle this team has not been a good under they canaan 3 will also send the tightening jags and seahawks i mean that s there goes matthews first down and more and force got a bad this is a tour de force for the san diego offense light that is 401 yards against the ravens well youre gonna end up with just a nice jump cut to the outside here <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> is going to have a pretty clean shot at him again but it s matthews who now is starting to feel more and more comfortable he had a fumble earlier in the year and north turner had a chance to sit down with him and say listen i was around emmitt smith for a long time everybody fumbles this happens relax let your natural ability take over fortunately for san diego was recovered by manager dean to <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> s 23 attempts for 84 yards that race for the number1 seed now all of a sudden becomes even more interesting the patriots at 11 and 3 if the ravens lose to go to 10 and 4 if the steelers win tomorrow night they go to 11 and 3 the texans are 10 and 4 so the steelers with a win since they beat the patriots in pittsburgh would be with two weeks to go in the season the number one seed there s your afc west where all of the teams are still alive crazy that the steelers are limping in the san francisco niners have the incentive of just trying to stay into that the two slots so they can get to by the first week of the playoffs on the saints so many times you see it is the healthiest team going into the playoffs they can make a run i can remember its burg a couple of years ago as a six seed right running through and going on to the super bowl we have seen some low seats some wildcard teams make <person player="lee evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lee</person> runs unfortunately you got to get there then for the chargers that is still a tall order but the <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay packers last through bay packers last year exactly didnt even win their division third <person player="nate kaeding" race="white" position="K">nate</person> im <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person> so this is a drive that s consumed eight and a half minutes plus starting at the one but has been like this all night i mean it has been long drive after long drive and was very proud defense really hadnt a into tone tonight then it is unexpected to attempt a twentyeight yard field goal the only time the charges havent scored on the four to seven san diego shocker jay leno this week the tonight show sandra bullock will be there carrie bradshaw or with jay this where you can lead those folks nicole eder those rain i wouldnt have done my impersonation of bradshaw i know he s coming on there it s right two yards 10 dbm halsy run back 19 left till the celebration at snapdragon next sunday night it s christmas night at lambeau field and aaron rodgers leads the packers towards the playoffs against brian urlacher and the bears in the only game on christmas sunday night is football night only on nbc the ravens defense so stellar coming into action tonight and you can see the story in the righthand column what the chargers have done them on a night with san diego scored on every possession except one from the 45yard line destroy <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> and company have been dominant in almost every area of strength for the baltimore ravens this baltimore ravens defense came in number one in the nfl with 45 sacks they had none tonight they came in ranked number one third down defense san diego goes six for nine on third down number two in rush defense and the chargers end up with 136 yards rushing they beat them at their sprints the ravens will go home and theyll get to baltimore in the wee hours and then the sixth week saturday is their game the next game christmas eve against cleveland and then theyll finish at cincinnati meanwhile pittsburgh has san francisco tomorrow night and then the rams go to pittsburgh below and they end up at cleveland so tomorrow night is gigantic for the student to think if they win tomorrow night theyre gonna win the division and knock the ravens down the 40 are my meanwhile the new england patriots will be wording very hard for the 49ers tomorrow night because of san francisco wins that game then with two weeks ago new england would be the number one seed and in the afc west and so crazy all four teams have a chance to win the only team that controls its playoff faith is denver they won the division the 39 im sure there has been can you remember a throat down the field tonight by the ravens no not a single one in it s mostly because of the lead and so they were able to sit back in coverage but this is a team that really is prided itself on the ability to get the ball down the field and the chargers have simply taken it away from over and over again and look at the numbers that reflective of that <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is 32 for 182 yards not a good night for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> had a couple of balls couple of easy reads through interceptions the guys that were really standing right in front of him you go back there was one played down the field it was his first completion of the night that s so long ago we forgot about it was the bolden the 33 yards that was and here s addiction 27 the <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> knew he had to come up with a big night tonight then he was going to be challenged by this defense and he made it look easy and every once in a while somebody would come along and just take the two ravens it was shocking to watch it san diego s sack and thatll thickest in the twominute warning let s pray and that is philips and that is five times tonight that he s hit the deck meanwhile that s philips down on the ground they stopped the clock at 2:07 now philips able to smile through a shot in these hitting the helmet from his own guy antonio grey goes down for a moment but works his way to the bench at second down and his core and that smith <person player="cory redding" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cory</person> smith and he s going to go to the end zone with 155 to play so we finally get it down the field 36 yards for a touchdown and after a nice run back by <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> they go 55 yards honey please yeah you want to say where s this bin they clear the middle of the field with the receiver sprinting down the middle to move those deep safeties back and then hit the crossing route underneath you can see there right down the middle the field clear it out work underneath there you dont have to always just take the dump downs if you have the safeties that deep but just a little late getting to it point which he does and with a million 55 to go wendy s postgame report coming up michelle will be on the field for an interview <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> and mike will take a look at the updated playoff picture a lot of changes in that regard today and chris and i will take a look ahead to christmas night a week from tonight covered by singing diego might have been illegal touch early on as the ball was kicked down the field and you get a little extra skirmish ring going on scheffer southern eye football brought to you by geico 15 minutes could save you 15% of car insurance by the new action fill of the darkest hour in theaters christmas day by parental football no limits only from sprint and by toyota chargers on the tuesday visited the doris miller elementary school surprising the students with bicycle was purchased by the san diego chargers team its own has been owned by the spanos family since the mid 80s once super bowl appearance for them and miami following the 94 it s it s that i felt about does gay what the heck yeah hey why not it has been that kind of a funky day today in the national football league against the ravens obviously and so baltimore scoring a meaningless touchdown meaningless except to some friendly degenerates that we know to make it 34 to 14 and the timeout is taken by baltimore but it was that kind of date with the packers getting beat by the chiefs and the colts getting their first win against the titans really hurt you the titans chances the texans now you got that question what s going on with them the giants getting knocked off by the redskins after being working so good against the cowboys the eagles now appear back hitting some kind of a hunt the eagles are kind of like the san diego chargers boy if they got in youd say maybe you know maybe which theyre certainly talented enough ive got a kansas city philadelphia super bowl city chiefs the kansas city chiefs are still alive philadelphia is still alive you and i are barely alive i want to thank you for paying the toll on a toll road the other day going down to five bucks thank you guys and merry christmas to all of you and well talk to you next sunday night for breathing itll be interesting to see what the packers now do you know theyre in a little bit of a world of hurt at that tight tackle position there having lost three guys now and so all the talk of the undefeated season and the perfection now you just wonder first of all they got to go clinch the number one seed which you would think that they can probably do against the chicago bears but who knows they certainly didnt look very good today no no they played detroit last year in san diego this is the end of their home schedule they go to detroit that s a big game next factory and then san diego ends at oakland and what could be an enormous game the last night of the season who knows denver goes to buffalo next week buffalo nothing well obviously but it gone and on the road at buffalo who knows and the kansas city goes then denver dan the season and baltimore we talked about this i mean the rest of their schedule not you know prohibitive obviously cleveland and cincinnati but pittsburgh right now pittsburgh controls not only its playoff fate but where theyre gonna wind up in the seeding well it s entirely possible that cincinnati could be playing for that last playoff spot in that final game and you know then what do you do who knows where the baltimore ravens are gonna be at that point but the two wins against pittsburgh thought we all thought was going to be the definitive moment of this season for the baltimore ravens and yet with this loss today now if it s burke and went out were right back to where we have been over the past several years with pittsburgh is the division winner and baltimore having to come out of the water well what s really nuts too is that arizona and seattle are still alive kansas city stole clinking what the two weeks to go welcome to the nfl hub fourth and two after the ravens spend their final timeout large john s does not draw the flag but youve got coming up short here which is gonna result in a change of possession so they cant run the clock out in north santa he s everything singing that but im trying to make up some stuff i think nor was happier than he s been in a while you know theyre on a threegame winning streak now you know youre talking about we did that sort of rollercoaster ride at the beginning of the show but after six losses you come back you win three in a row and no no yyou know the chargers offensively seemed to have pieced together an offensive line now and who knows make a <person player="tyrod taylor" race="nonwhite" position="QB">tyrod taylor</person> who is the first was really interesting through the ray when the season started the ravens had one gigantic goal and that was to take care of pittsburgh and they did they beat him on opening day they beat him in pittsburgh so that was the thing they had to do that was their hunk to get over the hump and now all of a sudden here comes pittsburgh again pittsburg despite a lot of injuries a lot of issues and that s continuing now with <person player="ben grubbs" race="nonwhite" position="OG">ben</person> roethlisberger go were under the assumption okay baltimore comes in here takes care of business pittsburgh might lose in that game tomorrow night and all of a sudden the ravens are in a perfect position and just the opposite happens sure for john harbaugh this is a major disappointment as their road woes continue and as you think about what the wildcard path looks like it is all on the road and we can see no evidence that the ravens rhodes this year for sex tonight that s gonna be the end <person player="antwan barnes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnes</person> who have four sacks tonight including one just a moment ago you could have got a hundred thousand to one odds that at the end of the night san diego would have seven sacks and baltimore would have none 34:14 saying diego still very much alive at the wendy s postgame report coming up on the other side of this break welcome to the weenies postgame reports here now <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> costas so the chargers back from the brink of oblivion now to the edge of contention with a big win over the ravens now as for baltimore and these situations obviously are fluid had they won tonight they would have been at this moment the number one seed in the afc as we speak they are the number five seed that would be significant for any team maybe especially so in their case because to this point they are seven and oh at home this year and three and four away from home and obviously if they wind up as the five seed or lower theyre hitting the road meanwhile well send it over to michele tafoya who has <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip rivers</person> and <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip</person> the chargers seem to become a different team in december i explained this i dont know weve just you know good teams finish strong it s a shame we went through that six week stretch but we got two left and were going were going to finish like champs and see what happens youre head coach norv turner said that this baltimore defense was potentially the best in the nfl so how are you and your front your line able to do what you did against them were pretty good too on offense but we probably play our most complete game the defense kept giving us the ball back i dont think we planted tonight it was a good win for us you know every time we win a game everybody says we didnt beat anybody so this is certainly a team that s going to be around in january hopefully well be around in january we obviously need some help but leigh said were gonna finish strong denver and oakland lose you in kansas city win how do you like your chances now for the postseason weve had worse odds were four and eight so we got a chance we got a tough to tough road games in detroit in oakland but well be there congratulations phillip let s turn to <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo</person> like i said north turner said that the baltimore defense was probably the best in the nfl how do you think you guys measured up tonight i think we played well tonight we came out we understood already we came out we understood what we had to do we had to get turnovers and we knew that as the defensive the owner we had to outplay their defense to even have a chance to win this game it has to be mentioned again youve played in over 200 regularseason games not made it to the playoffs yet what do you think now how do you like the view from where you stand i still love the view my the way that i feel michele it hasnt changed even throughout the sixgame losing street we had i still believe that we can get there you know and i think everybody puts so much weight on or you go to the playoffs you go to the playoffs i didnt i didnt i dont play this game just to go to the playoffs i played this game to win a wing so you know a minute im proud of this team because we we never let nobody else opinion become all reality so im very proud of very proud of the guys tonight <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo</person> thanks but a very passionate <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person> <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> costas nice michele and thanks as well to <person player="philip rivers" race="white" position="QB">philip</person> and <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo</person> here s the afc playoff picture four of the six afc playoff teams are known with only the west champion and one wildcard spot up for grabs baltimore s loss tonight means the steelers would be the number one seed if they went out if the jets and bengals win their final two it would come down to strength of victory between them that gets complicated and all four afc west teams can still at least theoretically win the division let s bring in <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> dungy from new york now <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> a huge win for the chargers tonight and thus theyre still alive they really are and ill tell you <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay got in on the last day of the year last year and i think if san diego gets in they could be just as dangerous but this was also a big win <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> for the pittsburgh steelers they were sitting behind baltimore and now they know if they win tomorrow they can control things and i believe mike tomlin will tell his defense you know our quarterback <person player="ben grubbs" race="nonwhite" position="OG">ben</person> roethlisberger wont be a hundred percent defense you may have to win it and i think youre gonna see guys like troy polamalu really step up for that pittsburgh defense and make some plays because theyve got so much riding on this game the difference between being the number one seed and then number five seed okay as al mentioned earlier chargers might not make it but theyre a team you dont want to play right now so in the nfc that team is the eagles perhaps you can still win the nfc s if philadelphia new york s and dallas both somehow wind up 88 if atlanta and detroit win one of their next two theyre both in and it s important to note if san francisco beats pittsburgh tomorrow they would retake the number one seed from new orleans that if both teams should win out i said number one see that meant the number two seed if both teams should win out the 49ers would get to by now now that ive confused half a nation <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> which nfc team stands out to you well to me <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> today it was really the detroit lions theyre on the road theyre down to scores and they need somebody to step up and it was their leaders <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> stafford and calvin <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> really making those big plays they needed two scores they got a big one too calvin <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> that gave him a chance and then stafford took them 98 yards and won the game with this throw to calvin <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> here and the the thing that that did for them now they can clinch their playoff spot next week at home against san diego rather than having to go to <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay on the last day of the year so this was a huge huge win for the lions <person player="tony moll" race="UNK" position="OT">tony</person> as always thanks well turn now to mike florio of pro football talkcom well have all the big news from week 15 tomorrow afternoon on nbc sports talk on versus mike a number of injuries today but first what s the latest on <person player="ben grubbs" race="nonwhite" position="OG">ben</person> roethlisberger status for tomorrow night well <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> officially roethlisberger is questionable which means he s 50/50 with that sprained ankle but the thinking is that now that the ravens have lost and the steelers have a chance to take control of the division and get the number one seed in the afc playoff field roethlisberger is more likely to play despite that injury in <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay right tackle brian belaga has a knee injury and his backup derek sherrod is lost for the season with a broken leg so issues on the offensive line for the packers in chicago scary moments today when receiver johnny knox was bent backward he will have surgery tomorrow to stabilize a vertebra the longterm prognosis however for johnny knox is good for the patriots defensive end andre carter injured a left leg multiple reports are that he is out for the season with a quadriceps injury and one last point eagles quarterback michael vick he missed three games earlier this year with broken ribs he s played the last two the thinking is the ribs have healed we in reality the eagles had decided in those three games he missed to not give him a pain killing injection they were concerned that he wouldnt be effective with that medication he decided the last two games he wants the injection he wants to play he s played he s been effective and theyve won and theyre still alive in the nfc playoff chase mike great info as always wednesday night on vs nfl turning point with dan <person player="patrick crayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">patrick</person> takes you inside the week s pivotal plays including <person player="matthew lawrence" race="UNK" position="RB">matthew</person> stafford and calvin <person player="jarret johnson" race="white" position="DE">johnson</person> leading the lions to another big comeback win welcome back to san diego in just a bid the chargers beat the ravens tonight 34:14 <person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> are back to wrap things up right after this join our team become a fan of sunday night football on facebook and for live reports throughout tonight s game follow michele tafoya on twitter best an f on nbc until this bearspackers next sunday night only on nbc welcome back to the wendy s postgame report here now al michaels week fifteen you had seven games in which a team of the losing record beat a team with a winning record including this one tonight of course it was kansas city against <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay and off we go to <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay next week so the perfect season is gone but still <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay still trying to make sure the road to the super bowl goes through <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay and chicago what 7 and 3 but right now 7 and 7 so jay cutler gone matt forte gone and theyre up against the wall here and who s good you know i mean who s the team and weve seen it before weve talked about it before but you almost have to wait until the regular season is completely over and youre starting the playoffs to say all right who s healthy who s playing well and more often than not that s the team that ends up making noise in the playoffs and it s crazy because we talked about all of the things that are happening the fact that kansas city would still be alive in them in the playoff on seattle would still be alive arizona would still be alive it s kind of funny the way this has all worked out and how theyve constructed the divisions and im sure even when the architects put this whole thing together nobody than the idea it would turn out to be this dramatic but they made a plan and they decided were gonna go to <person player="tyronne green" race="UNK" position="OG">green</person> bay and hopefully we have a little snow on the ground and itll be a merry christmas for everybody and cant wait to see it a little contrast from san diego yeah there you go a week from tonight christmas night sir part of your christmas night with us stern and for pacific san diego nbc sports home of super bowl 46 thanks you for watching this presentation of
