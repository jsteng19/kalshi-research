love watching the best against the best right and this bears defense has just been tremendous all season long and tonight they get the highflying rams offense but believe me this bears defense has every bit as much talent as do the rams on the offensive side so tonight we find out about these bears are they really legitimate super bowl contenders what would you say will most determine the outcome tonight a couple of guys mister biscay coming off missing a couple of games with the shoulder injury and running is such a big part of his game is he really going to be willing to cut it loose out there and then on the other side <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> can they get the running game going tonight because when the rams run it they can throw it when they throw it they can run it that balance is awfully tough to beat removi a lot of guys will be vying for top billing it s the rats kiss the bears it s sunday night football next you something like football is brought to you by untuck it shirts designed to be worn untucked untuck accom by hyundai official sponsor of the nfl and by the new netflix film triple frontier stay tuned

beat tampa came from behind bears come in eight and foreign the cowboys within the hour beat the eagles in overtime to go to eight and five and take a twogame lead in the nfc east right now we go to the field and check in with michele tafoya michele well al this was the play three weeks ago when <person player="mitchell trubisky" race="white" position="QB">mitchell</person> chu biscay was hit by harrison <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> late in the minnesota game sure miss ki told us his right shoulder was driven into the ground and immediately went numb as it was partially dislocated the injury didnt take him out of the game but the next morning sue biscay could not move his arm and he said what came next was a lot of hard work to get back he didnt touch a football for ten days the longest stretch he s ever gone without throwing there was icing massage even a recovery shirt everything you could possibly think of he said he returned to practice this week with no discomfort and we watched on as he was able to make every throw and as far as any limitations tonight he said there would be none and he plans to be quote super aggressive out i dont doubt it he s their second leading rusher well see what s in store tonight on a cold night temperature right now is 30 feels like it s 24 fortunately not much wind and you know normally in this stadium we can see a lot of wind on a night like this but right now the rams trying to stay warm they won the toss they have deferred brick sir line will kick off ramps have great special teams <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony miller</person> is back to receive for the chicago bears as he dances around on this cold night and what a matchup for sunday night football a game that we have flexed into there s a poor rams best record in the league trying to hold on to that numberone spot if they went out the road to the super bowl would go to los angeles in the nfc bouncing ball then well scoop it up from the 2 yard line and prints it back out to the 23 yard line tackled by <person player="blake countess" race="nonwhite" position="DB">blake</person> compass and take a look right now at the chicago offense <person player="mitchell trubisky" race="white" position="QB">mitchell</person> true biscay north carolina georgia howard indiana university of colorado c v penn state university <person player="taylor gabriel" race="nonwhite" position="WR">taylor gabriel</person> abilene <person player="marqui christian"

race="nonwhite" position="OT">bobby massie</person> ole miss so too risky back after missing the last two games true sales took over for one win one loss <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan howard</person> s running back the the name comiskey look at that feel and there he goes slides it s not close to a first down i mentioned the second leading rusher on the team over 350 yards rushing this season and he starts here with a good gain of 9 second and 1 well the game plan tonight stop one guy right there donal number 99 and theyve got the double team early and that answered my first question which is would mr biscay be willing to run and it s such a huge part of what he does great at the quarterback position it s a good sign for bears fans second and one as he takes this snap out of the gun howard blanks in the backfield initial first now tripp miskeen the number two pick in the draft overall last year his numbers this season 20 touchdowns and 9 interceptions that rating is a little higher than the league average and that maggie who was in kansas city and philadelphia before that 10 years with amd reed taking over for john <person player="morgan fox" race="white" position="DE">fox</person> this season the record is in the back there he s puts out line to the right now to the right tune explosive <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> cannot get free <person player="john johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">john johnson</person> makes the stop and let s take a look at the la d√©fense duncan su nebraska and air <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> pittsburgh yarmulke ever become eastern washington corey <person player="cory littleton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">littleton</person> washington <person player="mark barron" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> brown how about <person player="dante fowler jr" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dante fowler jr</person> florida <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> west oakland california <person player="john johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">john johnson</person> boston college the margins on a flowing state i came to leave kansas mccarroll of the coleman us see those two defensive touchdowns in the crazy ram chieftain about three weeks ago just be good protection shoots a <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> power with taksim right there in the open field by <person player="lamarcus joyner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lamarcus joyner</person> who wears the franchise tag itll be third down well one of the new additions dante fowler came over from jacksonville and he really has added a bit of an outside pass rushing presence for this football team for so much of the attention inside talking about <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> adamic ensue they can get so much pressure in there that anybody on the outside could make a huge difference during this playoff run played well since the deal with the jeff forster s down and 11 escaping here he goes again but first down to the 49 yard line neville cant put the heat on but he got away and so already tonight true biscay has rushed for 22 yards on two carries not a big blitz team the rams arent but this time they do bring the pressure trying to play some man coverage on the back end the problem with man coverage if you do it and the quarterback escapes nothing there and of course <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> is we will be saying all night long it s the doubleteam and really the bears like the rookie <person player="james daniels" race="nonwhite" position="C">james daniels</person> numbers 69 they give me the best chance against <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> man flag is first of the game but would have been about a seven yard pickup for howard through the middle craig roll standish tonight s ref will hear from him for the first time bears are backing up so it will be against chicago in illegal shifts offense number 17 46 both moving at the same time it s a five drug penalty still first down first and 15 burton and miller moving simultaneously there he is the youngest coach in the league 32 got the job before his 31st birthday second year as the head coach <person player="sean mannion" race="white" position="QB">sean</person> mcveigh and every team in the league needs a new coach is looking for the next shawna gray believing go find him in the 42 yard line versus 15 teabiscuit fires over the middle that s incomplete <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony miller</person> was there and it s second down in 15 were talking to coach nagy the other day chris about scripting like a lot of coaches do his first 15 plays yeah they do and the chicago bears and in particular <person player="mitchell trubisky" race="white" position="QB">mitchell</person> true biscay his best numbers come in the first quarter and so i asked the question why dont you script the other series as you get later in the game and he says we do that a little bit fortunately that guy right there reed phillips is his own script of how it s going and really it s just been too true biscay runs so far the only sign of office it s the defensive coordinator they go 5 wide here deep down feel that s going to be intercepted in the 37 yard line in front <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> down the sideline is he a nevadans yes finally that looks to be inside the 20yard line and there s a flag down on the field at the end of the play so <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> who came over from kansas city and they trade ends that chicago drive with intercepts of play number 10 was trying to make the tackle when he went low first down los angeles pick up the flag rams will have the ball deep in chicago territory well <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> ever since they started playing him more in zone coverage has been a huge difference this is just a severe overthrow here really wasnt that difficult to throw maybe <person player="cory littleton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">littleton</person> underneath there the peters had been burned a lot early in the year and he was one of those they traded for him paid him some money and all those sorts of things a real history of interceptions they played him much much better 22nd in a section of peters career in the first rams offensive play stuffed at the line of scrimmage as peters takes a seat on the bench along with the key to lead <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gurley</person> leading the league in rushing in his first total here s four one yard that s tough you know you come out and youre thinking your shoulders going to be fine and you run it a couple of times and then you sail the first one we did watch him in practice and he looked good faith rose going to his left but that was not a good start that peters return was good for 48 yards <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> whipsnap fires over the middle that s caught inside the 10yard line that s <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> with his third team in three years new orleans new england and now los angeles having a great year third down and four one thing youre going to notice about the rams is how many times they use multiple people in protection even their star running back <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> out there on <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> back just like you dont want to let aaron donnell get going on the bear side same is true <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> back third down and four three receivers set to the left side play clock at 1:00 preacher and he gets in the way the littlemack foresee issue what else is new and he was outside the pockets and there s no grounding is fourth down well you know you want to try and get a chip so so does mac he s going to loop back inside a rob haven stein and just beats him so cleanly no choice whatsoever for golf that is a heck of an inside move and he has been amazing this year briggs airline one of the best at a groin injury earlier in the season the cost of a handful of games but he s been back on target since his return 27 yard attempt theyre trying to get the rams on the scoreboard which he will do right down the middle 9fo remains in the first quarter as the rams draw first blood that shows were beating <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> the monster but not of the midway weve seen the scenes of him pitch pressing almost 500 pounds and you can sing why once he takes his shirt off holy smokes graham s trying to clinch that first round by so they wouldnt have to play in the wildcard round last year they got a home game against atlanta but lost to the falcons <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony miller</person> drops back the sir line descended skyward little sealed take a lead into the end zone talking about true biscay and naggy stripping those first 15 plays and how much success he has had early on in the first quarter tv interception ratio 5 to 1 the passer rating is excellent but tonight he begins after an interception he takes a look at the other three quarters when his passer rating goes way down so the question tonight is he starts slow can he finish quicker chicago bears were here three before he is gang tackled to be second down it really is amazing when youre talking about the talent on this ranch team and you hit all the marquee guys but have in dominic ensue at playing nose tackle almost an afterthought inside because of all the things that <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> has done pretty amazing second down and six firing in that batch incomplete <person player="taylor gabriel" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gabriel</person> was there but he cant connect with him and it s third down in six well the bears defense did a fantastic job getting off the field after that last interception let s take a look at this motion see if we see anything hard to tell because he s rolling to his right i did see him in practice make a good strong throw a rolling to his left which is usually the tougher throw so dont think there s an issue little cooler out here though threw them behind <person player="taylor gabriel" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gabriel</person> the five wide on third and six the pass is complete and that will be a first down hey look <person player="taylor gabriel" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gabriel</person> makes the catch peters with the tackle moves to change one thing the rams will do throughout the course of the season is they will rush five and the reason they do that is they want every offensive lineman to be oneonone again rush s that time the bears up to the challenge and true biscay has started three of six through the air but for only seven yards bears gonna snap it on there like the rams to reclone raise around the left side ill tell what he had some game last week in new york great player can run great pass catcher can protect well enough certainly a pro bowl candidate and the bears could use a few the bears and the jets last year were the only teams in the league that did not send it out of the pro bowl thatll change this year and for <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> he gives them those cheap yards you know where you can just dump the ball down into the flat and he can make a couple of people miss and keep these chains moving as the bears can strut off brake roll snap and after checking with the purse without chop lock offense 15 15yard penalty replay second down that s josh miller im sorry <person player="josh bellamy" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh bellamy</person> who would be their number four receivers yeah he s going to come across the formation here and youll see while engaged with masse the wide receiver <person player="josh bellamy" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bellamy</person> is going to chop down <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> and he gets it from a lot of different angles and that is obviously a foul probably just not used to doing that probably doesnt fully understand the rules inside that makes it second down and 21 from the 26 yard line that s the 40 yard line by trade burton he of super bowl fame the phillies special last year came over in the offseason to chicago trade burton hasnt been a whole lot of a factor here lately and yet he comes out early in this one it makes a play he s possibly their most consistent weapon along with <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tarik cohen</person> and yet for whatever reason the first half of the year he is was on fire and sort of settled back out of that here late gain of 17 to make it third down and four its motion the inside for this rollsroyce finds his man for a first down so from second in 21 they moved the chains to lead covers on the play first down arent many running backs in the league that youre willing to leave them oneonone against a firstrate cornerback like to keep to leave get out there and if there s a concern at all with the chicago bears as they rely so much on to read coin said it s amazing how quickly that <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> man can process things they could just throw something at him during a game he can pick it right up do exactly what they want many folks has to figure out a way to stop him tonight the rams territory the 49 yard line tversky keeps and it s taxing to the line of scrimmage the safety <person player="lamarcus joyner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lamarcus joyner</person> comes up to make the tackle true biscay this year averaging rushing 36 yards per game i wasnt sure wed see these intentional runs here youre gonna get the read option and just reading this guy as he comes up for bisque ease gonna just gonna take it out there now there was discussion that maybe if they do that they would have some sort of a lead blocker in front or a pass option off of it or a pitch option but i think after those first two runs they opened up the rest of the play board second down and nine <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> is opposite number not the number one pick in his draft too risky number two in his dread few years ago after the races to rakuen puts in deposit about the 15 yard line by <person player="lamarcus joyner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">joyner</person> gain of 32 yards and the bears in business make these kinds of plays go you have to have good down blocks and once you get that the center can pull out and around and really nobody there the rams on the defensive side and now i think if youre gonna beat this football team this is the formula you come out you run the football you be patient you milk the clock you frustrate their offense but you cant run the ball on this rams team these are true biscay fires at the feet incomplete the intended receiver should eat second down and ten i was interesting talking with the biscay a little bit and of course you all know what social media is about but there were a lot of people that thought he should have played in that giants game last week they were giving him a hard time and but he knew and the staff knew just how valuable he was longterm through this franchise and they were not going to take that chance one of the reasons that too risky at the beginning the season says im also familiar period from the 16 year in line but it starts to assemble then <person player="danny trevathan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">danny</person> goes the 11yard change direction as well as anybody in the league third down third and five well it is frustrating because you see on those sort of outside zone looking plays the responsibility of the defensive line is to move with them so theyre all sprinting that way and then here comes this guy back across the field this time he kind of got last monster got him on that one now we go to third down and i think that now you go from <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tarik cohen</person> the runner to <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tarik cohen</person> the receiver he would be threat one for me along with <person player="trey burton" race="white" position="TE">trey</person> burke this is the 11th play of the drum five runs past me krispy under pressure starts to get away and then can it was founder who got there first founder creates the issue and <person player="john franklin" race="UNK" position="WR">john franklin</person> myers comes in to clean up and it s fourth down that was clever that time by dante fowler working against <person player="bobby massie" race="nonwhite" position="OT">bobby</person> massey watch fowler come up and under goes right underneath the hands of massey up down and runs right past them to get the initial pressure their entre biscay bori parking and that horrible day against detroit at the upright four times a settle now since the 39yard field goal and he does 240 left in the opening quarter the rams and bears and bid on their custom design pleats at nflcom slash my cause my cleats jerry thought some of the bears are see what their causes are the designs there <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared</person> got as his offensive line on his cleats spinal cord research is his cause shortly after the kickoff here and this is returnable this is joe joe matson and swing to the left and trying to get around it s bump that about and shoved out of bounds almost into the heater at the 26 yard line by <person player="benny cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benny cunningham</person> as we take a look at the rams offense <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> cal targer lee george <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> oregon state <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> usc joshua rose takes to say <person player="tyler higbee" race="white" position="TE">tyler higbee</person> western kentucky <person player="andrew whitworth" race="white" position="OT">andrew whitworth</person> lsu roger <person player="rodger saffold" race="nonwhite" position="OT">saffold</person> indiana university <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> notre dame boston boy iowa groton hidden stein wisconsin wife kind of an unsung guy pick them up labor s from indianapolis rains on the fence story in the first quarter leads to the last 15 regular season road games thises street mean with <person player="james daniels" race="nonwhite" position="C">james</person> s girl makes it for about nine nine and a half see where they spot it <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> leading the league in rushing and this is the bread and butter play this is the stretch zone and then he can do whatever he wants to offer that will talk about that all night long you dont stop that play the way you beat the rams anything the right side and it s incomplete and it was <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle fuller</person> diving for it <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> put the pressure on daf and its third down in one yeah that was some move that time by <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> he was little inside jump move and got right to the quarterback and when <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> can balance the pass rush watch this inside move by <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">floyd</person> right inside haven stein and almost graded a turnover there nobody creates more turnovers in this defense 30 on the year they have also scored six touchdowns on the defensive side anyone by interception nine on fumbles it s third down with a flag thrown a rams big pool time they just third in one when we come back three have kept the columns v1 that timeout was called youll see it right here there s mcveigh looking at the play clock realizes they cant get it off calls the timeout so now third and one from the 35yard line mrs headband picks up that hard yard and it s a first down like he picks makes the tackle rams first first down of the game very difficult to get these three and outs against this team just twelve times three and out all season now they snap to the line of scrimmage as they do after first down and love to control the tempo they can come up in a hurry but let the play clock go all the way down topic over the defense even get into a little sidebar dear this entire time until 15 seconds on the shot clock they went right to the line but they take the play clock retreats fighters over the middle in the traffic and reaching down for <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> who makes the catch close to a first down well they had success on first down throwing it with <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gurley</person> now they come with a playaction off of that same look and hit the hook and behind that is the style of this offense and then you will see the bootleg off of that and you will see all their offense basically kind of look the same it s all going to look like that initial outside zone and then that all the action starts to happen off of that buck kind of a throwback to that quarterback under center who sees that it right now fun to send more than any quarterback in the league loss of a yard maybe to price <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">callahan</person> comes up for the stop itll be third and a deuce down for the rams is the center that s <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> well theyve had a good offensive line but not much depth the interior five so this would be big <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">sullivan</person> down for the injury timeout take a look here what happened to <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> during the commercial rating able to get up and youre going to look at him in the medical tent presumably for a concussion it s hard to imagine unless youve ever experienced than what it does it is very dangerous he asked to come out for at least one play youve got <person player="brian allen" race="white" position="C">brian allen</person> looking for michigan state who has played a lot on special teams but this is only his eight offensive snap and what <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">goff</person> is going to do is let the clock run out to end the quarter to give <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">sullivan</person> that much more time to presumably get ready and come back in the end of one three three sunday night football back after these messages we get set to start the second quarter inside the rams offense through week thirteen ninetysix percent of the formations with three wideouts 63 percent under center which is about double the league average to play action 37% much higher than the league average and players on the 75% of the stats theyve stayed pretty much injury free look at the rams offense how they operate me while <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">sullivan</person> is out of the tent and theyre going to take him back to the locker room so <person player="brian allen" race="white" position="C">brian allen</person> will be the center they think he s their guide for the future and this is only is eighth snap of the season coming here fires over the thatll make it fourth down in the two atoms that was an open target right there <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> had leverage on the inside and just missed the throat so cold weather you can talk about anything you want the california kid whatever you want to describe it as but really there was nobody on the inside part of this coverage to that <person player="johnny hekker" race="white" position="P">johnny</person> hecker their play games and i was pretty good on fake punch as well especially around this good arm jump up it s almost blonde freud almost got it and the pic will go out of bounds somewhere on the 20yard line so youve got two studs here a little mac will came over in that trade with oakland you got <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> mac fifth overall in the 2014 draft <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> was 13 <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> the defensive player of the year two years ago aaron last year and get a low from each of these guys very low interest rate to 141 million six years for mac so <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> signed for 135 they got him into camp and he was the highestpaid player defensive player in the league for one day dont need any charity event too risky outside theyre disqualified picks up another five or six yards before he s tackled by peters second down that was a great play there on the part of gay bro to get up but there is the pass rusher he s extraordinary we have literally seen him this year one armed stab move and lift three hundred and twenty pound offensive lineman in the air and throw them back at the quarterback it s one of the most remarkable things ive ever seen could encompass ernest was the raiders and the shipping here picks the ball up to the 40yard line and the chicago first down sack comparison for these guys erin <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> of the rams since 2014 fifty five and a half mac forty nine and a half in the month of december mac would be first with team sacks <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> second was 16 in the career sack comparison in the fourth quarter third second and third on the 40yard line fighting his way for a first out the guy who s gained over a thousand yards in each of his first two seasons wont get there this year but still he s their bread and butter guy on the ground averaging three point four per carry well here s what happens you blocked down and youve got this read option play go he s seen dante fowler had to sit and wait on the quarterback for biscay now you hand it off inside and it s one of the underrated parts i think if this bears team is the ability to play some power football with <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan howard</person> in the backfield instead of tirico 50 and that s incomplete peters of the coverage on <person player="trey burton" race="white" position="TE">trey burton</person> along the sidelines second and ten nice play by nicole roby coleman on the outside saw this quick screen to the right good job by true biscay pulling it down because he was going to be in trouble right around would have been picked and then it was just freelance time and pretty good by burton to turn up the field came close bears have run 22 plays and iran s just 917 yards for the girls was going on 25 for los angeles to the 45 which they had both learning faction in the game maybe third down in five well the one thing about the rams is youre going to see those guys rush the passer they play the run on the way to the quarterback so what do you do a lot of times you can work the run game inside of them as theyre trying to get up the field this is a team that much like the indianapolis colts with patron theyre used to playing and shootouts so theyre constantly rushing the passer you can slow it down and run the ball on them it really plays your advantage really why the sad thing is it intercepted no incomplete <person player="john johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">john johnson</person> could not stop it couldnt get hitting the ground and trade burton was the intended receiver to be fourth down take a look no clearly going to be on the ground there but that is the second throw now from true biscay from a set formation that he just missed high and missing high is very dangerous than the nfl leads to a lot of interceptions bachelor donnell is the punter <person player="jojo natson" race="UNK" position="WR">jojo</person> matching bouncing it bounces into the end zone for a touchback 11:45 left three three on sunday now michaels <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> cosworth michelle the foyer the game tied threethree 11:45 to the half <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> makes the tax and that is broken up for the flag at the end of the play <person player="aaron lynch" race="UNK" position="DE">aaron lynch</person> the linebacker makes the tackles here from creek roll stent in a moment illegal block block in the back number 12 10yard penalty still first down that s <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> cookson we go to michelle well rams center <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> went back to the locker room he s being evaluated for concussion he is back there with the unaffiliated neuro trauma consultant he s had two previous concussions back when he was with the vikings in 2013 and 14 so this would be his third if it comes out that it is a concussion out hell been around a long time as 11th year so he is supplanted at least for the moment by <person player="brian allen" race="white" position="C">brian allen</person> he had a michigan state rams address only six offense make it seven offensive lineman s theyre down to their final substitution if needed as <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">goff</person> fires at the 26yard line well juan <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> the ricky s in georgia that abounds inside the five pressure on top low throw and the bears will have a first and goal after the pick celebration there but this is really a poor throw we have seen some bad throws dont know if it s the weather the cold but it is you kind of gets a bump gets nowhere close to that really not been under pressure so the defense is starting to dominate almost looks like did he step on wit worse foot coming down so i made that ball flutter out of there like that looks like it first career interception for <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> the rookie who was the last guy to sign from the draft clash 4 yard line through piske on a first and goal fix up the yard to the three and another penalty on the far side at the line of scrimmage illegal formations offense number 70 was on the end of the line fiveyard penalty still first down it s the right tackle <person player="bobby massie" race="nonwhite" position="OT">bobby</person> massey yeah and it s really <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">allen robinson</person> s fault here so when youve got a tackle right in there you have to be down on the line of scrimmage so that was his mistake and not mask but of course <person player="bobby massie" race="nonwhite" position="OT">massie</person> gives his number cold he s alignment it s good attention good time these these cool guys get hit rookie all day yep stretch it out though this is a big moment in the game call a timeout yep take a timeout first and goal from the 9 yard line with that bear defense i dont know cold weather or whatever 25 yards of offense so the rams come in the highflying rams and this was gonna be the rams offense against the bear defense that bear defense looking pretty good to this point yeah we talked about whether or not the rams were gonna be able to run the football in this game because the bears defense has been tremendous right right the other thing that ive seen so far is that a lot of times sort of snapping out of the huddle for the rams offense gets defenses offbalance well vic fangio and the bears defense hasnt done anything they havent <person player="aaron lynch" race="UNK" position="DE">lynch</person> theyve just lined up in there nickel defense theyre used to playing that really one of the most talented coaches and all the nfl right there vic fangio has been doing a fantastic job 32nd year as a coach in the nfl for fangio back to the pic he gets bumped i no doubt about that really did step on what worse foot alright so first been going on collin swings to the short side of the field no place to go and another penalty illegal block block in the back offense number 12 10yard penalty snow first down so that s <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> it s gonna move them back to the 19 yard line and there is <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">sullivan</person> going over things with mcveigh and ill bet you he s almost giving him a bit of a mental quiz here because the sinner is basically the quarterback of the offensive line so as he goes through this if that s a normal conversation he probably says okay well get you back in there good son obviously is out of the locker room back there back on the sidelines for the moment from the 19yard and pressure caught at the 12yard line real to make it second down and goal now this is you know you dont get many opportunities and the game is going your way you make a huge defensive play you get down to the 5yard line and you do nothing but go straight backwards so a real opportunity for the chicago bears to put some pressure on the rams to go outside of their comfort zone and how they want to play this game then they line up with burden and mizell in the back view risky retreats and fires in completed third down and goal now let s go back to the interception for just a moment here and <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> watch <person player="andrew whitworth" race="white" position="OT">andrew whitworth</person> on the outside does he step on that foot or vice versa <person player="andrew whitworth" race="white" position="OT">whitworth</person> stepped on his foot and just completely threw off the throw and that s exactly what happened that ball came wobbling out we havent seen a throw like that out of golf all year is your evidence we shot it that has powered now flanks out brings him back in the backfield those true biscay got a third down and goal the biskits dancing cooling action in the end zone and in roby coleman was able to break it up intended for <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> there for 10 and goal goal roby coleman s had a nice game so far this is the guy who s really had the hot hand he s going to run this little dig route inside roby coleman all over comes you so a big stand to talk about the rams offense all the time but so far it s been the defense when they needed it most 31yard attempt pakodi parking and he s to four to six to three bears on something like football there s the wrigley building got the other way to train you got chicago cut you got a lot of good stuff is it take a cruise down the chicago river getting pretty good at this down yes you can bounces into the end zone for a football being brought to you my visa everywhere you want to be by pepsi the official soft drink of the nfl and by walmart light up christmas and walmart we pass over a million people attention congress largest openair christmas festival beach holiday season <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> is back in the game good news for the rams evaluated concussion city veterans center but it is back in grant s nothing doing on offense so far and ive got tries to make something big happen throws into double coverage is lucky it wasnt picked off brandnew <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> the intended receiver he almost turned into a defensive back as <person player="prince amukamara" race="nonwhite" position="DB">amukamara</person> nearly had to pick well communication such a huge part of it for the rams mcveigh is going to get the play into <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared</person> golf he has all the way down to the clock reached 15 to communicate with him a lot of times theyll snap to the line of scrimmage and youll see mcbay continue that conversation trying to give them coverages or possible audibles second and ten raise and that s almost intercepted wow that <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> who comes up with it that it s incomplete ammo tomorrow is there that s intended for <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> third and ten it s the shakiest start the rams have been talked to all year in a couple of years it s one of the great things the mu camara here is going to have the ability to really play this tightly on <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> because he has deep help so he s all over that because <person player="adrian amos" race="nonwhite" position="DB">amos</person> is right behind him and that was close so saw our second pick third and ten flag is down and he bumped back his <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gerald</person> every forward progress might then on the first but it s all about the penalty now it s the rams illegal chefs offense number 12 five fnally scope there down third and 15 you know the rams come into the game averaging six and a half yards per play which is huge tonight 21 yards per play now what is it the sixth best in the history the nfl in just the third pass this season to think this is some idea the kind of offense but in chicago they love their defense they almost get more excited about defense in chicago than they do often chiefs in the chargers for playing in the rain they even stymie tonight 12 ways for 25 yards stirred in 15 well short of the first time and the punting group will come in again roy robertson harris with the pressure that time on god fourth down well if you only rushed three guys that s not good news for <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> number 52 one two three load up you may beat him with somebody else but youre not going to beat him with him decker s first boat was almost blocked there s <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> back to accept the kick the fake and it s going to be cold and it s going to be a first down they werent good sure with the naked eye it looks like he had picked it up the lime juice comes in as receivers down by contact shortened line to gain first down that knee is going to be the question when did the knee go down whoo wow i mean the ball is clearly across the line at the knee let s see i think that s the first day oh i do too i thought it was at the time i saw it and so that falls under the challenge <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> why the game so the rams figure to win this look at the official after here the runner did make the line to gain at the 35 yard line and will be first down in 10 los angeles timeless please reset the game clock to 8 minutes and 14 seconds los angeles will not be charged with the timeout so a big gamble you go back to 2012 when hecker came to the rams in st louis at that point and john fossil was the special teams coach that s 21 times now theyve executed a fake pie they do it here from deep in their own territory gives him the first down boy cough is way off to this point tonight intended for woods goth tonight is three out of ten for 22 yards that looked like <person player="danny trevathan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">danny trevathan</person> may have gotten a piece of that ball he looked like he was in man coverage on girly or read blitz on him enabled the opening half pressure on docket well pick up the first down before he spins out about the early leading the league in rushing he s just a tremendous player leads the league in scrimmage yards as well might have won the rushing title last year had the lead going into the last game of the season with the rams had already secured a spot in the playoffs and couldnt be moved up or down so they left them out of the game he only played 15 and that enabled kareem hunt of kansas city to win the rushing don last season ya know <person player="malcolm brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">malcolm brown</person> has backup tonight so it s going to be a lot of <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gurley</person> not much rest which that that slides away from the pressure fires caught inside the 40yard line that s <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> coming back to make the cat s in another first down and it all sort of starts with <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> if they can get the running game going then theyre gonna go play action off of it now you see them snap to the line of scrimmage much like the patriots do after a big first down communication coming in from the down to two seconds ago that communication snaps off at 15 seconds on the play clock im very important at the 37year in mind again that is <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> when you think about <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> he had drew brees he had tom brady and now he s got <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> i need a bitch right back then yeah he doesnt have anybody within 10 yards of him and now the guy that was guarding him luca mehra is down <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> one of the faster players in the national football league look how far off they play him and really the only coverage at all was an outside linebacker dropping back there so theyre basically willing to give courts that kind of a throw underneath and not let him get over the top but just hard to imagine those thousand yard receivers getting away from those two great teams this speaks to the narrative in chicago especially before the season <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> the truth is me stops first overall pick and 16 to risky second overall top is rocky oh and seven and christy was for nathan to their second seasons with mcveigh coming to los angeles 11 and 4 and at the second season 7 and 3/4 true biscay here so a big difference for the new <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> punks in the quarterback and got throws and that is caught was going to be a first half <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> who see where they give him forward progress it was second down and five spotted at the 32 and that moves the change but theyre finally starting to get into their offense a little bit which is that stretch run bootleg or playaction off of that because what it does is it really protects your offensive line as theyre moving the defense is moving with them so you have the great pass rushers like akeem <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> and kaleo <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">mack</person> moving sideways your quarterback going the other way so it takes a lot of that pressure off the offensive line youve had nine plays on this drive all passes the coldest way for no gain so you have mcveigh coming in boy that was it was a shocking move the rams elected to hire a guy who hadnt even turned 31 at that point but my offensive guru and he s turned out to be exactly that on the other side nag he was a guy who worked for andy reid for a lot of years aimed little call plays at the end of last season gets hired here has got off on the second day throws that nowhere the third down to ten when weve seen this rams offense just look so incredible at times and tonight they just looked a little out of sorts and you know it s always the question right does pitching beat hitting and all those sorts of things and we saw the dallas cowboys do such a great job against the saints offense and now were seeing the bears do a little bit of the same thing and get since rams offense maybe defenses for coming back in the nfl big second half comeback second end of the season wildomar is back in the game he s up on the line press back into the 32yard line rope on <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> makes a stop and <person player="greg zuerlein" race="white" position="K">zuerlein</person> and company come in to try to tie the game broke want <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> can look like a tailback sometimes watch him step up and still fly out there to make this play that s just fantastic linebacker play we see him do that in coverage all the time yeah that s why weve drafted fiftyyard attempt coming for sure line to do the holder before and the timeout taken by in church timeout the bears chicago bears with a win would maintain at least a game and a half lead over minnesota the vikings will play tomorrow night on monday night at seattle tough one their rams of course in thinking about not only that first run by which they clinch with a win but making sure the road to the super bowl goes through the coliseum yeah and there s it s really tough to imagine isnt it that it s not going to either go through la or new orleans right so youre not going to get your rams team probably in any coldweather games that mean anything obviously the super bowl be just fine so this is a sort of a oneoff but it s a good test to see what the rams are all about and theyre going to play in la obviously the one place they launched this season was fiftyyard attack xur line good 57 and he needed it were tied sixsix were back in 30 seconds after this ray ws we didnt dream up a new way to find the best ramen we never thought you know what mars needs a dune buggy we didnt decide you should be able to share your home let s travelers from around the world were not the ones who imagined one day wed all be streaming movies or whatever she s about to do but when asked if these ideas were possible were the only cloud with the capabilities experience and knowhow to make them happen aws is hot i have a soldier field in chicago there s the first part of their existence played at wrigley field at one point that more games have been played at wrigley field than any other venue but then here over the decades now papa bear of course george halas founding the team forty years as the head coach at 14 from touchback so naggy this is his razzledazzle offense he names the first one papa bear left we saw that an opening night against green bay this one willy wonka against the buccaneers freeze the left last week where the key mix taking it into the end zone with beluga last week against the giants to tie the game at the end of regulation on a willy wonka references announcer price some of these players have any idea what that is the golden ticket from the 75 yard line you know we have two <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> dynamic coaches it s like it reminds me when <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin won the super bowl in pittsburgh and owners would say gm s where do i find the next <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin that was a long time ago now theyre gonna go around and say where do i find the next mcveigh where do i find the next <person player="matt longacre" race="white" position="DL">matt</person> nag you tell me will you find im not sure about that but good luck but the one thing that both of them do is make the game fun like using <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> on the goal line down there and so now every defensive player on the team is volunteering to play some offense and it just is creates this atmosphere that sort of anything goes like lining up with his door there by johnson on burton and they will spot the ball just a little bit short of the first down yeah that s what maggie was telling us they all lived for that knock on the door that goes into the defensive meeting room knocks on the door and that basically means come with me <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> man we now have a play for you on offense and they all go crazy the training game of course you dont want the knock on the door that s the turk you want no part of it i need your gun howard is the back and a first down im really impressed with the chicago bears tonight i just have to say that this is the way if youre gonna beat the rams this is the way you beat them because youre not seeing that enthusiastic flying off the ball pass rush that theyre so good at and there is a bad sign there brice <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">callahan</person> who has been tremendous as their slot corner over the past couple of years now and he s going off back to la he goes top looks over plays on the tablet and from the 37 on first down a little swing pass out here at atlanta what benson performer jaguars it was picked on ages we ticked down to the twominute warning in the windy city on this sunday night braham six bears metesky who will turn 96 next month principal owner of the team eldest daughter of papa bear the orders meetings this year she got in front of some panels wild everybody that was really fun very lively very spirited looks like martha firestone ford rallied the troops in detroit a couple of years ago second down and two at the twominute warning and the pass is thrown behind david <person player="taylor gabriel" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gabriel</person> so it s third down and two sir biscay is now at 50% 9 of 18 for only 59 yards and those passes all seem so easy but you dont have time to get your hands on the laces and sometimes they just come squirting out weve seen all kinds of quarterbacks you can tell it really doesnt have a natural grip on the ball and it just on this cold night the ball gets a little slick you know even though theyre able to work the football now still gets slick in the cold 28 degrees but barely any wind there are two years a little bit short of the first down <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan howard</person> <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> has been held in check the night in on very few tackles but right there he provides the stop and it s gonna be fourth down all right what snaggy gonna do here now you asking me im going for it i defense is playing great now he did say in some key situations this year he is punting the football because his defense has been so good they want to play to it but i dont think that s the case here i think you go for this timeout taken by the rams well a look at <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> tonight to this point now theyve done okay <person player="james daniels" race="nonwhite" position="C">james daniels</person> the rookie has really done decent against them as long as he s had double team help with it which he sees all the time i mean <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> i think nine of his 16 and a half sacks have come against double team so he s used but now here comes the bears and theyre punting and then here s the one that he made right there to get his defense off the field a huge play and now the ranch off it s going to get back to the fun unit on the other you and the offense is coming back out putting a time on the play clock officially stopping until everybody says table that gives the rams a chance of saw if they want theyre saying officials are basically saying we get down time to substitute maggie s out on the field going crazy terramax kolya rules endless terry what are you seeing here yeah absolutely in a bunt situation when there s a late substitution you give the defense a as much opportunities they need to call an attack he said the official on his new sideline was knocked down so as they change that they all went running on the field the official got knocked over and so what happened is they called timeout to allow him paul johnson get back there he goes he s down absolutely does it now the officials have to let him get back on his feet earl johnson used to be the head of the offense and he was the back side of that play she said it was smoother in the office on park avenue <person player="patrick scales" race="white" position="LS">patrick</person> <person player="pat odonnell" race="white" position="P">odonnell</person> in the punt bearcats tofu made the 15yard line by <person player="jojo natson" race="UNK" position="WR">jojo</person> an accident that s what it sounds like when you hear a blue from 57 thousand fans collectively all right the one thing that the bears i thought could match up in this game because they have this nickel defense that has played great all season long now price <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">callahan</person> is going to be out of the game well see whether or not they try and go after his replacement here were going 7 sherek mcmanus will now take over that spot minute 38 one timeout this is naggy filling telling carl johnson that s on you meanwhile got four treats fires caught up at the 28yard line start with a first down here catch made by <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh reynolds</person> and here s what i dont like about this from the bear standpoint now youre gonna let that rams offense go no huddle and sort of get into gear here a little bit before the half let s go spins around to the left and then is caught along the sideline by <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> and that s mcmanus who they worked on it makes the tackle here in a five second and five but from the fair standpoint now playaction kind of goes out for the ramp so now this is their opportunity to rush the passes well see how <person player="andrew whitworth" race="white" position="OT">whitworth</person> and haven style fly that those guys can hold up without the playaction having to block some of these guys we havent heard a whole lot from hakeem <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> tonight either and he has been fantastic this year second and five that flying up outside boyd inside and play whistle dead against the rams second out the veteran <person player="andrew whitworth" race="white" position="OT">andrew whitworth</person> longtime bingle 13th year in the league buh buh four times and i think he was one of the real keys to the rams turning everything around a season ago not only a great guy in the locker room but a cornerstones been a tremendous pass blocker for a long time in this league made a huge difference he and <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">sullivan</person> eats older than their head coach ninetytwo career starts at second down in tanana <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> hold on third down and ten again big pressure put on me while <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> is hurt as he comes limping off the field there he is that is not good news because <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> has been fantastic here s back on the outside he s been getting oneonone opportunities against these tackles pushing him back in the gulf now let s take a look at <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">floyd</person> tried to spin move there and sort of hyperextended with that step comes in for him third down and ten that s incomplete pressure was put on again early the intended receiver robertson harris and mac both put the pressure on its fourth down screen game so big tosh early and they had an opportunity there but it was the pressure there by roy robertson harris that made the difference so once again this bears defense that has been tremendous tonight just tremendous makes another stand after they did at the punt that s why they put because they have that kind of defense thicker twoputt going back in zone 25 line drive kick returnable tariq from in 18 yes you can he said rumba with 51 seconds it s <person player="johnny hekker" race="white" position="P">johnny</person> hecker who pushes him out of bounds rams o bears d coming in rams second in yards per game bears fourth ram second in points bears fourth in points allowed passer rating their bears best in the league and the most takeaways in the league yeah i think this is a decision there s no question right where you see another half to go but bears defensively if definitely want the first half against this great offers fill the rancher to 92 yards you have the bathroom that time was tareka <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> dante fowler over from jacksonville rustles and down so second down and ten now committed now remaining onetimer two whiskeys flush down shades down and complete outofbounds <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> closest to it will be third down in ten i dont think ive ever seen more attention paid to one player especially an interior player than aaron donnell i mean he is sometimes he gets three guys on him here he is right down there watch the left side of this offensive line one got by another one there s three theyre just kind of camping out for him and that was their plan they said coming into this somebody else might beat us on that rams defense it will not be number 99 <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> 16 and a half shaq s michael strahan biting his nails every time <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> appears on the field that s the 8bit record of 22 mm 49 yard line with the interception with 19 seconds so the rams with one timeout will have an opportunity to at least get into field goal range wow sure biscay that is not good this is just a very simple zone coverage in which you drop the nickel right underneath that everybody s seen that a million different times but for nikhil roby coleman what a half he s had looked for a game ball early for the rams defense there he is so the rams could pick up maybe 15 yards can set up field goal to take the lead first things first from the 49yard line and as he flag down nobody was ready for the snap here motion again everybody was moving on the ramp yes offense number 35 dog kennel me still first down so girlies moving and so is <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gerald everett</person> number 81 everybody s just moving around and if that s happening you have to reset and they clearly were not snap that time there s our line hopefully he can get a chance they get nine to six at the half but right now the rams are backed up first in 15 with only 14 seconds forget sheriff mcmanus 27 in the game let s see if they go out they can work every part of the field with that timeout <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gerald everett</person> and theyll take a timeout here with eight seconds and now theyll have to work the outside with no timeouts so wednesday night hockey night on nbc sn and sidney crosby and the penguins coming in to chicago to take on the blackhawks at 8 oclock eastern time went to the hockey on nbcsn youre gonna have a do i bring this at this time of year in particular rolling down michigan and a little crowd of this yep a lot of shoppers around here would be nice wanna lamination going off a few credit cards dont we know you got now for the chicago bears defensively obviously one strategy just keep it in the field of play and there s no way they can completed a pass that doesnt get out of balance theyre unemployed back into the game simply a threeman rush and god s gonna go for a roll a jump on the enzyme picked off at the goal line and then well take us to halftime and that s <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie jackson</person> having a tremendous year six six at the half third a half time next <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tirico what s up that <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> all right now coming up toni rodney will joined were gonna look back at the wild finishes from what s been if he s good as sunday as we had all year including some more mahomes magic kansas city comes back for an overtime thrilling would be stunning walk off everybody s talking about in miami what was up with the pats and the cowboys in control of the east thanks to amari cooper toyota halftime right around the corner one disdain to thee hey siri show me football stanwood revealed chicago illinois a view from lake michigan here comes the buzz tonight s game 66 who could have figured that <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> 50% only 50 yards and two interceptions that s true biscay 45% 59 yards to fix 23 rushing yards they all gain early not alden max well to get doubleteamed and triple team so not much happening for either guy tonight 90 yards total offense time for houston in the first half under <person player="sean mannion" race="white" position="QB">sean</person> mcveigh rams will get the second half kickoff so in this game weve had no touchdowns weve had four interceptions and that four field goals in the second half begins with the kick there will cooperate in the 10yard line when to the pro bowl let us return to the 26 and we have a flag down on the run back creek roll stead is the referee during their turn holding return team number 42 it s a 10yard penalty from the spot of the foul first down to the field we go in michelle yeah well the six points of offense in the first half uncharacteristic for the rams <person player="sean mannion" race="white" position="QB">sean</person> mcveigh telling me they have to do a better job sustaining drives but he is really happy with the way his defense is playing meanwhile <person player="matt longacre" race="white" position="DL">matt</person> nag he said mistletoe risky was doing okay but then his offense has to get back to basics meanwhile cornerback <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bryce callahan</person> was doubtful with a foot injury out michelle and that is big so much a part of their defensive group so if <person player="eric kush" race="white" position="C">eric</person> mcmanus is going to see a lot of action seven to the second half the 13 barely is going to be taken down for a loss back to the three <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> tracking him down and girl he cant get on track tonight they really didnt even block him that was sort of bizarre on the end of the line of scrimmage youll see that really there s no wide receiver and the rams use their wide receivers to block the edge as much as anybody that was just a blown to simon and it feels like weve seen a lot of those out of the rams office very uncharacteristic fiveyard loss <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gurley</person> tonight six carries for six net yards look at safety <person player="eddie goldman" race="nonwhite" position="DT">eddie goldman</person> comes through the middle to plant top in the end zone and the bears taken eight to six lead the defense picking right up where they left off in the first half i think everybody in chicago is going to be thrilled with this when <person player="eddie goldman" race="nonwhite" position="DT">eddie goldman</person> who does so much of the dirty work inside rarely gets credit all the coaches love them though and he is the guy that comes up with the big play along with team <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> on the other side they sort of meet at the quarterback and that is bigtime <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> could not block him it has been one of those kinds of nights here and in some strange way im enjoying watching defense i mean this this year has been off the charts with offense and you come into sort of one of the homes of defense than the national football league and here we have this defensive battle and the defense taking the lead for the bears you know anything were running up score is like a pinball machine of the first half of the season which to think about that at ram s chiefs game 54:51 then you get this thing goes even though he bunts it you can onsite it from her it takes a good bounce for him and it s taken there by home at the 19yard line well here s the first half hero for the rams on defense nicole roby coleman he s shut down that play right away smelled it out on the goal line or not so fast and then the inter one more chance that didnt work out it s still a tremendous half by their and that nicole roby coleman he will a decker kick was not a thing of beauty but it results in a 61yard freekick goal of the 19 <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> could shove that up as every pixel her first now buy i keep to lead i was really wondering when they were going to go after to leave because he came back off of that ankle injury last week he put out basically the whole season for the better part least the middle chunk of it and you could see last week in that game against detroit that he literally wasnt comfortable on the field yet i dont think in the first half they went after him one time let s see if maybe that s the shift in strategy here he was on a pitch count last week be cool and a 14 and another first night not to the 45yard line for chicago theyre playing their linebackers and safeties so wide if you get these two guys blocked and you have angles on both of them there s just nobody left in there it s not like somebody s missing the tackle or anything i think i would just wear him out with that until they came out of this here s that russian game he said not quite there yet but it is tonight 114 yards rushing 61 finishing okay ask caught up in sin the 41yard line <person player="john johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">john johnson</person> makes this table for biscay has been tremendous tonight when under 25 seconds he is a first read quarterback at this stage of his career when he can throw it to the first guy he sees he s great the entire first half that was when he had success you saw it just in with the throw to <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> off of that rpo and there you go so if they can stay in that mode and run the football you start to like the bears chances three plays on this drive three first down 41 shutting his way to the 36 yard line but chris brought up of course is 25 or less he s 9 out of 13 in the first half 26 or more over 7 and all the interceptions are three of the 4 interceptions have come when they tried to throw the football down the field so a very cautious approach on the back end youre going to have to be able to win at the passing game underneath and being able to run the ball really helps the bears playaction and that s going to set up a third down and two flower making the tackle but this is an interesting part of the field here this is one with the way youre running the ball well now theyre taking howard out of the game and brain and going in to where if you wanted to leave howard in there and say im just going to run it twice here it would be a pretty good option wade phillips looks over his chart you saw that sign on mad maggie start either you the coach here so far in chicago it s a big turn around please for the record there he goes inside the 22 to the 10yard line man oh man is he quick in a 23 check out cody white hair going to come the center around here s the angle block again and then you loop the center around and they are just nobody in there and you know this is the sort of balance that weve seen out of the rams offense all season run it run a run a playaction and tonight it s the bears turning the tables on the rams getting into the end zone <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> across the goal line it s going to be real close obviously well take a look at it on a replay did he get in or not didnt look like it here it is the previous play is under review here he s out of bounds at about the 2 yard line so they rule it a touchdown dont have to challenge because it s ruled a touchdown scoring play under review theyll take it back and well be back you after review the runner was out of bounds with the ball at the two yard line itll be second down there please reset the game clock to 10:25 so clearly out before he gets into the end zone itll be second down and goal now from the 2 yard line bears up by 2 early in the third to the red zone for day to get in this time to this panel as a dart incomplete it would be third and goal sort of interesting isnt it that theyve been running the football so effectively and now sort of pencil yourself in here at this point see well theyre gonna bring in a yeah here come sticks here comes <person player="bilal nichols" race="nonwhite" position="DT">bilal nichols</person> as well we got all kinds of defensive players in the game right now like rockers is in their pics in the backfield a tailback and here we go he next scored a touchdown last week and they give it to him again to dispel jeanette s car by <person player="bradley sowell" race="white" position="OT">bradley</person> soon so that s something they bring at hampton defensive unit they make a tackle eligible so then it s the first touchdown of the night crazy never been to a magic show they make you look in a thousand different places and then the one guy you never think about he declares himself eligible what would have the team on the field said nobody pays attention to it and <person player="bradley sowell" race="white" position="OT">bradley</person> sold with the touchdown catch and a first touchdown of the game parking for the extra point that souls 97 career game it s his first catch as dennis miller might say you couldnt keep that forever touchdown bears it s 15 to 6 now on saturday at 11 am eastern on golf channel and 3 pm eastern on nbc what a crazy place on so many levels it s omitted i think of a cache on top of it 15 to 6 you can go on top third when he gets ticked by <person player="josh bellamy" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bellamy</person> up at the 19yard line thanks to the td well first of all you have to make yourself eligible if youre wearing number 79 yeah that s me im eligible but everybody was running on the field was doing the same thing but here s the illusion got <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> back there everybody knows youre gonna go there not so fast right out here you sneak out with an offensive lineman who s now a legendary receiver and he s gonna let everybody have a pretty good dance that is clever play calling right there they couldnt have planned this celebration with that group good thing i dont know but that s what you hug your head coach and play caller let me catch a touchdown pass i have loving life so youve got for the rams that s dominik hasek material coverage being brought to you by geico so an injury on the return <person player="dominique hatfield" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique hatfield</person> was being taken back to the locker room special teams guy undrafted last year started the season on the practice squad to have his leg up live in a cast their fans take me back to the la saloon from the 18 the rams begin this drive down by nine i think there are some people in new orleans paying attention right now whose bet because iran s loss would move the saints back in to the top spot drop the ranch the second <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> makes the catch sheriff mcmanus with the tackle peter six second and for the rams gonna pick up the pace here a little bit and see if they can get this offense going what they have not done is established the running game not done that and it bertha s office early six carries for six yards da pond approach of the ball comes out the ball is loose still loose it was <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil</person> mak who came in and the rams have recovered at the 20yard line man third down and eight boston blight the right guard who eventually winds up with the ball another inside move here by <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">mack</person> and it s a pretty one two gets right through gets the ball out no question about it and that ball was on the ground unrecovered for about five seconds everybody had a chance there was white 66 he eventually winds up with it third down and eight rams going backwards on both drives here in the second half short of the first down is <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh reynolds</person> to yours and makes the tackle there where they have to go in the third fourth down now this isnt very good by realm they bring everybody on a blitz going to hit him right out here and a pita just caught it and turn right up the field i think the first down he sort of and <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> who is coming out from the defensive tackle position ended up making the play that is not very good when you get in those blitz situations you see those linebackers cross the line of scrimmage catch it and turn up the field tonight not here <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> is gonna let it bounce stays inbounds so a good ram bounce finally stopped at the 13 yard line let s go back to this bearish touchdown i mean this is something you never see well the great running backs like hakeem <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> they know how to sell a play fake look at that face im kai got it i got it i got it yeah that s great i love it when the big guys get to actually touch the football you fake it to a defensive tackle and throw it to an offensive tackle that s beautiful football look at all those crazy numbers in there too old and lame these and seven dz and the catch made by soul the game is fun it s a 62yard five the back wheel this is take one my cell and number three back stop at the line of scrimmage unique touchdowns last two games <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> the oneyard touchdown rush <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> the one got touched that fashion of course tonight the capper yeah tonight that points a bit sport by cody park e <person player="bradley sowell" race="white" position="OT">bradley</person> sole and <person player="eddie goldman" race="nonwhite" position="DT">eddie goldman</person> if you had them on your fantasy team youre a really bad fantasy player there s no way and im sure there are some people who have all kinds of rams players on their fantasy team that are just going what the heck let them as a trifecta it s about 500,000 to 1 in the tone brick wall yard line the time put the pressure on and it will be third and short it s pretty amazing to watch is i need to just catch the ball so elusive five six or seven and just out there it almost disappears sometimes behind that wall of blockers in front of them but he is a magical guy weve seen him doing backflips and catching the football he was sort of a youtube sensation before he became a superstar nfl with one of those human joysticks 32 the protection to this new fires caught and that s another first man to reach <person player="tarik cohen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cohen</person> this guy could win a gold medal in gymnastics look at this we debated for five minutes whether or not that was some kind of trick photography or not i mean look how far apart his arms were spread just to catch one of those balls without a flip was pretty amazing that one as you would say how you and your social media friends went viral just did <person player="allen robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">allen robinson</person> banging down my <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> as he makes the catch second 11 was interesting talking with wade phillips a little bit about <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> and he said you know we got him and i kind of knew what he could do and we put him in some really tough situations mantoman coverage against their best receiver to leave was out and then we found out what he really does great is look at the quarterback he plays his own defense looks at the quarterback and comes up with interceptions like we saw in this game second whistle here and ama concede came across the line was he induced second out he was not so in battle can sue you know he s been around through the years made a lot of headlines for various reasons detroit miami and then the rams picked him up in the offseason he s in his ninth year in the league and he and <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> second and fourth on most snaps so those guys really dont come off the field very often at all second down and five protection too risky i intended for robin ching crowd wants a flag my mother uncatchable anyway peters with the coverage gonna be third and five well there was definitely some hand fighting going on tear it was it was ruling on catching where you see official downfield giving the uncatchable signal as uncatchable because he couldnt jump in the head of the hands it is jess there it is i used to hate that call they used to come over god it s uncatchable yeah if he wasnt fouling me it wouldnt be uncatchable generally should be blatantly untouchable im just getting some things off my chest he is third and five took a lot of years and that pass is incomplete and now you got a flag coming in late nikhyl roby coleman saying not me defense number 23 the ball we play from the spot of the foul automatic first down that s a shame for roby coleman he was in perfect position he s going to jump inside and just sort of set a wall and he really did not have to get his hands on him he i mean he really anything that should have been an interception impossible pick six but that was a big break right there for the chicago bears to keep that drive alive bears along the time of possession tonight almost 26 minutes to 1450 play for the rams 32 number 51 to your <person player="deandre houstoncarson" race="UNK" position="DB">deandre</person> <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> power through the middle check on the division leaders again rams come in at 11 and 1 saints 11 and 2 bears and then the cowboys the redhot cowboys so the saints of course would be the number one seat if the rams loose tonight at least heading down the stretch and you just get the feeling that if somehow these playoffs run all the way through new orleans i dont know who s beating that team in that stadium iii just dont ive been in there i played in there before it is tough and this is a good team and i dont john johnston to run it back at a good run back all the way down us otago 26 yard line through misty s third pick of the night that one intended for the tight end trade burton there just been a ton of this throws tonight by these talented this is the oldest play they everybody with a single safety you just run past some everybody in the nfl runs his play right and it s easy just drop it right in but he dropped it way over the top and almost all of the bad plays tonight by travis key had been overthrows i dont know if it s a shoulder i dont know what the issue is that he is missed high and long tonight johnson s fourth interception most on the rams that came into the game of only 11 pick so youre the and the rams in business at the chicago 26yard one ah south <person player="taylor gabriel" race="nonwhite" position="WR">taylor</person> six interception of the game for thee in pick drink and ride your horse by progressive insurance handing on thick savings to you and by your local lexus deal to make this december 1 youll always remember it that s 1958 the la coliseum rams bears 4135 city owen george halas the coaches the crowd that day a hundred thousand 470 honor i kid you not i was there i was there my passionate shopping on my biggie but i was there from the 19yard one this was <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan howard</person> after the interception picking up nine well one thing we know about <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> quarterbacks is they tend to stare down the target a little bit and youll see it here out of golf polar was looking back at him the whole way and got a pretty good jump on this one and you have to be happy for the year that for is having the last two years he s had eight interception opportunities last year he caught two of them this year he s caught seven of them the only one he dropped was the one against aaron rodgers in the green bay game where they could have won that thing that would have cemented the game meanwhile you got <person player="ethan westbrooks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ethan</person> westbrook s coming across the line tonight rodgers got hurt and green bay encroachment one more luck as we go back to check out got on that glow take a look and see if nix gets a little noggin shot sure does it s amazing it s like this it s like a golf swing now you start to get hot and you catch them and we told you listen no junior from the 32 yard line to the outside said that about the bench by <person player="mark barron" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> baron you know well be in la next week at the comma scene philadelphia against the rams i love when people say well you know can la support the football team two football teams as it is right now southern california 1958 was about half as popular as it is right now you put a hundred thousand four hundred seventy people into the stadium before that year was done they put another hundred thousand against baltimore and <person player="johnny hekker" race="white" position="P">johnny</person> unitas had two good teams right now in los angeles we had a chance to see the chargers beat the steelers last week one again today beat cincinnati forth to get to the place the top seed this howard takes it to the 36 yard line football in la lights camera action so combine the season 21 and four for the rams and the chargers rams coming in with the best record in the league the chargers the only thing with them right now is theyre in the division with kansas city which has the best record in that converses could wind up maybe with it the second best record in the afc and still be a longhorn the thursday night game this week is charges the keys is sydney is true misty retreats and steps up gets hit but gets away and hell go down to the 38 yard line and sue was there thatll make it fourth down i tell you i we talked so much about this bears defense tonight but the rams despite many mistakes and really poor play on the part of their offense tonight maybe it s more dominant defense on the part of the bears but they have hung in there they have kept this team alive and keep givin the offense opportunities that they have done nothing with tonight <person player="patrick scales" race="white" position="LS">patrick</person> <person player="pat odonnell" race="white" position="P">odonnell</person> the punter his third kick <person player="jojo natson" race="UNK" position="WR">jojo</person> and that s for me back at the 15yard line mine s gonna let it go it s a good chicago bounce to the pot with 32 seconds to play in the third quarter brooklyn ninenine making the jump nbc this january and the most spectacular way sees the explosive brooklyn nine line trailer later to make during the game the rams meet in almost three quarters tonight have 93 total yards 93 compared to the average before 40 35 points per game six tonight thus far and three turnovers tonight all on picks i used to play at the university of florida i can remember going into the cold weather are acting like they hate the cold as well they have not been effective throwing it for a first down <person player="tyler higbee" race="white" position="TE">tyler higbee</person> you know you know youll wonder how much you can blame the winner i mean this cold it s 26 degrees but there is no wind at all no it s really a perfect night no matter how you want to put it but the story of this game that i dont know if weve said it enough is that my girlie hasnt gotten anything going whatsoever i mean nothing and this offense is based on balance it s based on running play action but he doesnt get going this office doesnt get going into three chicago 15 the rams six sunday night football back after these messages were talking about <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> stymie tonight last year led the league in scrimmage yards and 19 touchdowns was the most this year leads the league in scrimmage completely in total touchdowns the only guys to do it in consecutive seasons to the alltime greats don hutson of green bay jim of cleveland but tonight next to nothing second in inches now michaels cris collinsworth the point start the fourth quarter at soldier field in chicago yeah it s a story in a game right picks up a yard here leads me to this picks up to in fact officially first down basically daring them to run the football right now because they have gone to that reduce inside presence and the reason they can do that as theyve been so stout tonight on the outside you see <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> and <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> just set the wall set that edge outside they not been able to get that outside zone working period first rams first down in the second half they have seven in the game winzip incomplete <person player="danny trevathan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">danny trevathan</person> came in that time from his linebacker spot second and ten now these are all the plays that work great whenever youre making the run work but right now theyre not fooling anybody with play action sure go ahead go play action and all you want weve got everything covered they are basically now sort of stopping at the idea that the rams are going to run the football rams came in averaging six point seven yards per play tonight two point eight play clock at 1:00 finally girlie breaks one to the 29yard line it s more on that run than he had all night long first downs you will see the rams and so many of those tight bunch formations and they use their wide receivers a lot to block inside that s the first time theyve gotten somebody down inside it was <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gerald everett</person> with a good block inside finally getting to those in 12yard run formation nobody outside the numbers they do that more some room to the 34yard line stop by broke montz with being a sixsecond and for now theyve changed now theyve moved to that inside zone play where theyre basically saying aye weve seen enough of <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">floyd</person> enough of <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">mack</person> let s now bring the tight end across and try and end it backed against the grain by correlation second of four under pressure wobbly pass incomplete and again these went on that time i sheriff mcmanus taking the spot of the injured <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bryce callahan</person> coming in from the corner dialed it up tonight and here we go with the communication until that thing hits 15 they can talk all he wants to his quarterback and now it s going to shut down so now the communication starts for <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> on the field and boy does he ever need a bigtime player right right here third and four that is a great catch at the 42 <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gerald</person> fair bring a lot of traffic to move the change now that was a good route theyre finally starting to take advantage a little bit of the aggressiveness of this bears defense the loot one of those little return routes you know we see all the time out and back in for the first down i think theyre going to stay with <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gurley</person> here theyve got but they need to reestablish who they are on offer very a times relax and go out to the flat that is no possession everything intended receiver <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> possum second and 10 <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> early in the year had that broken hand remember the big cast he had on it and his numbers were terrible and he is a high draft pick and a really talented guy but you have seen now in the second half of the season i want to say he had like four pressures in the first half of the season in the second half like 24 25 so now they have that double edge pressure coming and it s a big reason why youve been able to see <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> be so effective and mac verse runner out of georgia and 16 9 pick in the draft secondly ten sex should they he gets away breaks the tackle and <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> picks up the first down at midfield got away from <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> that time and it is <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">floyd</person> for the second time tonight down on the turf and hobbling off so <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">floyd</person> comes to the bench the rams are already up at the line of scrimmage at the bear 46 yard line have people forget miss how big <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">todd gurley</person> is he s 225 pounds fires and that s clark crossing route <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> inside the 30 and so that xx shut that by an ejection all the way down at the 17 yard line for <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> over a thousand yards for him out of usc and he is happy to be home out there working against mac just a simple crossing route getting his face inside and he has some special hands and he has made a big difference here without cooper cut ten plays on this drive so far three runs seven passes and on 78 yards started back at their own five and <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">goff</person> is going to take a timeout 1107 remaining in the fourth with the parents on top by nine you look ahead for these teams chicago would love to stay a game and a half in front of minnesota peace that would mean by week 17 when they have to go to minneapolis they would have clinched it schedules remaining rams next week against the eagles that s our game on sunday night at arizona and against san francisco to wrap it up chicago plays green bay next week it s their final home game then they go to san francisco and as we say week 17 at minnesota you dont want to have to beat green bay or minnesota maybe they went good under shows hilton on the left side that s andrew wit was second cuddly against em tonight offense number 77 fiveyard penalty still first down well you know when you used to run against the fastest kid in the school and you wanted to get out a little faster out of the blocks that s what happens when youre going against <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">khalil mack</person> on the outside first and 15 when the 22 in complete <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> he intended to see her and three bears are right there second down and 15 im gonna say that s that time i think <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared</person> golf was right and <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> was wrong theyre playing a simple zone defense and usually you want your receiver to sit down so you have somebody here and then you want that guy to sit when he sees the zone defense it s up to the wide receiver to read that coverage just like the quarterback does miscommunication sets up a second down 15 girl he comes in motion and the ran school a time outs are the rams have just taken their second timeout only one left called from the sideline he s mcveigh obviously not liking the way they were lined up im not so sure they didnt have a little something working on this play they had up a lot of shifts a lot of motions and if you had a sort of secret weapon play that might have been the time to see it and it just never quite got underway but what could be i mean he had to take it in his mind but it leaves you with one time i found the stretching youre down by nine plus were doing a warm plenty time for the rams here you like to think theyll at least get out of here with a few to cut it to a once the ransom two timeouts within three seconds second down and 15 great tackle knife and flu is <person player="danny trevathan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">danny trevathan</person> to knock him down to the line of scrimmage nathan sheriff mcmanus they were all there out there and let s give mcmanus some credit we were thinking maybe he wouldnt be able to hold up out there the way <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">callahan</person> did and id say it stopped in that outside zone you stop that you stop the rams mcmanus <person player="khalil mack" race="UNK" position="LB">mack</person> wants the crowd at full throat they comply third and 15 there s no again almost no clean pockets than i forgot everything is under pressure forth then in comes the field go through well they are so good and i feel like a broken record when they can go to their play action game golf though is still a <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> quarterback and he s not used to seeing a lot of pressure in his face they do that play action they drop back a lot of times he s standing there two three four seconds with enough time to throw hasnt been the case today 40yard attempt is irwin deckers the holder right those uprights are gonna fall down knows what that s all about this one works in their favor stays a ninepoint game chicago illinois on the sunday night bears on top 15 to 6 little over 10 minutes to play after the field goal hits the upright the bears will start from the 30 after a penalty ball start number 78 fiveyard penalty first down the guard which visitors let s go back to that hold on the missed field goal that s the laces always a little bit of a thing and he turned it the wrong way i dont know why he spun it back that way but sometimes i just say i used to hold a little bit my soul first and 15 well pick up 21yard roba coleman stops him along with <person player="lamarcus joyner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">joyner</person> verse down i mean this has just not been watch all the blocks here everybody is on somebody and they really dont have that sort of downhill play bori <person player="cory littleton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">littleton</person> those are guys put in there to really stop the passing game because theyre used to being in shootouts this is no shootout here tonight round yards those powered all right let s take a look at our next gen stats powered by our friends at aws of course again they come back to this play one more time all the defensive players in there and of course <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> with the brilliant run fake why not was oh so sweet when he got that thing football made fun again in chicago thank you guys pretty good what a picture everybody with a 60 or 70 an eighth over 90 in the shot second down and six only midfield strike starts to slip but does maintain his balance it s back to the 47 yard line still a launch their three yards overall third down and nine up coming you know how you can talk about all the rule changes and the advantages for the receivers and the quarterback and he cant hit them high and you cant hit them low and you cant henneman element and all that kind of stuff but tonight it has been not about the quarterbacks tonight the quarterbacks have not helped their respective teams it has been about the brilliant play of vic fangio chicago bears defense and absolutely the too many games you see six interceptions three for each quarterback it takes it to the 50yard line there s fourth down so the rams will get the ball back and sort of these nonbelievers in this stadium were uncomfortable with that call right and there are a lot of teams that you would not call that draw plague but the way your defense is playing out there tonight you say all right im going to give them a long field here and they burned those two timeouts on a drive in which they got no points i feel like the advantage has swung in our favor and ill let the defense do the job that is a perfect summation the rams just ranny a 74yard 14 play drive use those two timeouts fiveyard penalty work down they came up with nothing and bron occur not the worst thing in the world when youre ready to punt you get it fiveyard penalty from midfield im not sure you want to leave one hanging in the middle of the field here though i there was ever a coffin corner attempt it might be right now you dont want one of those rams special teams plays that they can come up with to knock you out leaving that play clock here takes down under seven minutes snap it up one go for and make a fair catch at the 18yard line 644 left in regulation 15 6 sunday night football being brought to you by macy s believe in the wonder of giving by hyundai official sponsor of the nfl and by tmobile whether youre home or away tmobile has you covered 85 bears held arendt scoreless in the championship game of the nfc that year and route to their super bowl 20 championship runs <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> ditka but a ryan that great defense jim mcmahon walter payton the fridge but a team that was best defense from the 18yard line burly i mean all night long that s <person player="leonard floyd" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leonard floyd</person> isnt getting on or off the field lifting the pig off coming back on right there for the stop yeah and i tell you these linebackers are growing up right before our eyes <person player="danny trevathan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">danny trevathan</person> a row quan <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> inside have become quite the tandem and this team you know you talk about in that defense you have to fill those gaps and theyve been brilliant tonight there have not been i can remember one play in which early broke out but this has been a really disciplined game part of this defense with maurice and very second but shy of the first down brought there by children everage to the third down and one you know maggie came in and he didnt have a defense accordion and i got a ram who was down here that s <person player="rodger saffold" race="nonwhite" position="OT">saffold</person> roger <person player="rodger saffold" race="nonwhite" position="OT">saffold</person> the left guard is not good in the rams the one thing they have had over the last two years is continuity in that offensive line i started to tell that story with <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> then he came back in but roger <person player="rodger saffold" race="nonwhite" position="OT">saffold</person> is the power player on this offensive line whenever they want to go to double teams or whatever he s the guy they used to take a look at what happened he got stepped on with like <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john sullivan</person> s the one that stepped on rams only two backup linemen weve already seen one denied <person player="brian allen" race="white" position="C">brian allen</person> the others a rookie as well <person player="joseph noteboom" race="nonwhite" position="OT">joseph noteboom</person> and there he is rookie out of tcu who was their third round pick you know out over all you have to say this is a pretty thin team wouldnt it s when you say i mean you got to talk about the receivers they lose cooper cup and so they played the three guys <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reynolds</person> and <person player="brandon allen" race="white" position="QB">brandon</person> <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cooks</person> and <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> but then after that really it s kadare all hot you would end up coming in who has two catches on the year offensive line running back is thin without <person player="malcolm brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">malcolm brown</person> now a lot of money to their stars which leaves a little less he reserves third down in inches clock running five and a half to go in of the faith first time tonight he has taken off slides to a halt at the 33 with the first down now theyre going to a little bit of playaction stop one thing we have not seen tonight is all the jet motion a little bit of it there on that one but that has been such a big part of their offense i dont know use a lot of window dressing but not tonight s game along the sideline is juggled and bobbled and incomplete bob johnson comes in to say <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh reynolds</person> did not have control of it check it down yeah that s that s too bad there that was a gimme just cant hang on to it of course <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh reynolds</person> got a chance to play because the injuries at cooper cup and then <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> took cups plays playing in the slot and has done fantastic this year and <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reynolds</person> has been a brilliant blocker inside as has <person player="robert woods" race="nonwhite" position="WR">robert woods</person> but so far tonight i havent seen those kind of play second and ten this woods tackled by abu kamara comes a four down territory here because of those two loss timeouts and complete is intended there for <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">everett</person> any <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> with the coverage and as you say chris you get down to that one time out plus the twominute warning it is four down territory and theyll go for it yeah i dont think you have a choice here at this point they are sensing in his defense workin for man that s an excellent point of entry you seen one fourth and four cant get the first date get out of his hands it s akeem <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> boy shades of 85 at least for one night im gonna dancing like it s 1985 did get impersonator <person player="matt longacre" race="white" position="DL">matt</person> maggie close to his length to 3 and 13 games appendix mantle making a mat get so much the attention you can forget about that it s tough to these days to the 23 well they tried to run a little pick play on fourth down but ro quan <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> sat right in the middle of field and youll see the receiver who they were trying to get the ball to coming right in that s <person player="gerald everett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">everett</person> when he wasnt there <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">goff</person> really had nowhere else to go and there s the cleanup from <person player="akiem hicks" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hicks</person> who is one funloving guy who is enjoying life right now scoring touchdowns getting sacks doing dancing and making quarterbacks wins milking the clock all the way bangs put it one howard stopped at the line of scrimmage so next sunday night off we go to the home of the righthander the la coliseum the eagles pretty much after today s heartbreaking overtime loss to dallas pretty much have to run the tables it gets a nine and seven and then need some help along the way miwa the rams now that connect with new orleans but if they lose this game tonight the saints they take over the top seed the rams will still be look at the clinching first round by will start at 7 oclock in los angeles next week last week in detroit <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared goff</person> did not have one of his better days 207 yards and tonight probably the worst game he s had since his rookie season which was a throwaway year yet fisher was the coach who took over halfway through the season did not and they brought in mcveigh last year and they went from last and points in 2016 to first i honestly wonder if somebody stopped the run and the bears did powered to the 20yard line he goes baron <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> coming into the game with those sixty and a half sacks all in his last nine games but barely called his name tonight we just have to mention a few guys names right and i think <person player="james daniels" race="nonwhite" position="C">james daniels</person> i asked which of their interior three offensive linemen would be in the best position to try and handle somebody like <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">aaron donald</person> and they said <person player="james daniels" race="nonwhite" position="C">james daniels</person> and yes he s gotten double team help and yes theyve done that but because <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> plays that three technique they can kind of dictate where he would line up and they chose daniel s in this game and he was certainly good enough here tonight timeout chicago as he gets it for the field goal attempt and we go to michelle well <person player="james daniels" race="nonwhite" position="C">james daniels</person> told me the plan for blocking aaron dogg tonight was to use fundamentals and technique on every single play he told me if you dont use your technique you have no chance of blocking him he said before every snap i have to listen to the play call look at <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> s alignment and do what i have to do it sounds easy but it requires focus and he practiced that focus all week out man and manifested it tonight his cody park he comes in 128 38yard attack no good let s think it was gonna hit the upright lady didnt think it right that maybe the first one he s missed that s up right right a clear miss claire miss so the rams get it down by nine but no timeouts left for la hmm let s take a look at a bounce i love that golf set for years a new piece of gum rams low in points this year to game 23 and held 179 yards 33 on the ground top runs for his life back and flip eddies <person player="eddie goldman" race="nonwhite" position="DT">goldman</person> put the heat on that time going who had that safety earlier in the game 2nd down and 10 what the heck is going on up front with the rams they dont even block any <person player="eddie goldman" race="nonwhite" position="DT">goldman</person> on the play check it out theyre gonna split and divides apple goes one way the center of the and coughs running for his life sampled who the hurt back in the game that s a bit of good news to the rams second and ten tires and out of bounds at the 44 goes <person player="josh reynolds" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh reynolds</person> with 234 and you brought it up before this vic fangio what a job starting to talk about when agee took over didnt have a defensive coordinator fangio had been on john <person player="morgan fox" race="white" position="DE">fox</person> his staff pretty good move to keep him the traffic and incomplete wood says where s the plagues this will say that he <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> with the coverage second down spent some year for <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie jackson</person> hasnt it i mean he has just been remarkable since five touchdowns in the nfl eight total in the last four years playing at alabama and here and he has just been phenomenal not just in coverage where he can play man coverage like a corner can but back deep and being a bit of an enforcer like you just saw there if theyre divas three picks tonight 24 for the season to the moon that s true man oh man it s been that kind of a night for the rams you know they can really do so many things with this bears defense because of the speed they have at linebacker so any the one of those guys rope on <person player="roquan smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> who can fly and <person player="danny trevathan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">danny trevathan</person> who can fly theyre not afraid of dodd <person player="todd gurley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gurley</person> in coverage or anybody else those two speedsters inside cover up for a lot of things that happen let those pass rushers cut loose third and tan <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">goff</person> a deep retreat fire <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandin cooks</person> intended receiver and there is the <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie jackson</person> we were just talking about for them <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie jackson</person> has some guts now youre talking about speed receivers watch him level off and work this way this is one of those boots maybe gives up one but through films thing else those are calculated risks and a lot of times he lands it in the end zone for his defense in fact they can end it right here with the stuff on a 4th and 10 and the ram stay alive another interception week tomorrow mcmanus came blitzing in defense one for the books tonight well one of those nice to forget for <person player="jared goff" race="white" position="QB">jared</person> golf this is a pretty simple zone on the outside of that play and there was simply nowhere to go that her four receivers on that play that would have been the last one i threw it to he was completely blanketed i want a knight though you know sometimes when great franchises have been down as the bears have been here to see them come back and then get back into the part of the matter now with this playoff race this place is going nuts only the twominute warning can stop the clock here the victory celebration is powered it s taken down and we go to the twominute warning one whale of a night in this toddlin town 15 six bears scam report michelle as always on the field stars of the game liam breaks down the playoff picture chris and i will preview next sunday night s eagles rams matchup right after the game for the victory formation here by the way you know what s happened silently night <person player="jordan howard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan howard</person> s gained 100 yards it wasnt too silent i mean he broke off some big ones standing is impressive meanwhile nikes gonna join this club halas ralph jones and paddy driscoll head coaches with the winning record in their first season with the chicago bears george halas found the team as first years the coach was 1920 and we talked about these two bright <person player="trevon young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> coaches one of them will be 11 and 2 after the game and the name you just saw will be 9 and 4 you realize they cant run the clock all the way down so there s really gonna have to punt this football not sure that s a good thing for the rams to me wow it s it s stunning in a way i mean you come in here and the whole thing is could the bears score enough points to beat the rams ah leave leader actually was 7 well and you think about how important that safety was yes because that really took it out of being a one score game and the pressure that would have been on this bears defensive team would have been even greater but im not sure they would have buckled underneath it that it is amazing and for the bears you know this theyre going to 9 i know now holding opponents under 24 points oh and for when they score more than 24 so they call it the mendoza line or something like that when i was in football that s what it is for this bears tape that 200 or better he won the bears you look at that their defense 25 interceptions this season for tonight over the last three years combined total 24 picks so the pun here <person player="aaron donald" race="UNK" position="DT">donald</person> seems the ball inside the two yard line of course so chris at the beginning of the show tonight one of the things you said was were kind of were gonna find out it if the bears are for real so yeah well you know the question was okay we know this defense has been really good this year but can they stop an offense like this and the answer has been yes just like we saw the dallas cowboys do and oh by the way let s give jerry jones a little credit you want to sure they go out and sign amari cooper when they look like they are dead in the water cooper today 104 217 yards three touchdowns theyve been all over them during the course when he s not a good general manager weve got it done in with a big movement mauri cooper put on a show today that s <person player="justin davis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin davis</person> secondyear guy out of usc he s the backup now that <person player="malcolm brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">malcolm brown</person> aserp not a bad run for him 19 yards but that will the chicago bears faced the team with the best record in the league and beat them by a score of 15 to 6 coming up next it s the volkswagen postgame report after these messages
