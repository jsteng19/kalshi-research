position="WR">robinson</person> for extra yardage gets it out to about the 20yard line tyler sig ten the chiefs quarterback originally drafted by the vikings coming off a tough week against buffalo but still has 11 touchdowns in just three interceptions in his last five games the offensive line they like the left side with the rookie <person player="branden albert" race="nonwhite" position="OG">branden albert</person> left tackle playing beside the global veteran brian watters the backs and receivers tony gonzales has thrived in the kc spread offense but theyd really like to

adapted to really feature <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> strengths johnson lined up they plan to a throw on first down able to get rid of it and caught by <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gonzalez</person> had 10 catches for a hundred and thirteen yards and a touchdown last week against buffalo well when <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> is flexed outside against his safety like <person player="gibril wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gibril wilson</person> you saw <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> sticking with him the whole way even though <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> was covered pretty well there the top of the route to grill <person player="gibril wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> getting nice and physical with them but tony is so big and <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> thailand think they knew hed give him a place with that football good solid first play for the kansas city chiefs first down at the 36 yard line just underway here in oakland johnson gets it out to the 40yard line brought down by the free safety hyrum <person player="hiram eugene" race="UNK" position="DB">eugene</person> is oakland on defense theyre happy to have <person player="derek lokey" race="UNK" position="DT">derek</person> <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> back healthy at defensive end linebackers are a speedy group with <person player="kirk morrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">morrison</person> and <person player="thomas howard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">howard</person> whoreson grew up here in the oakland area and in the secondary <person player="nnamdi asomugha" race="UNK" position="DB">nnamdi asomugha</person> may be the best cover corner in the league but <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris johnson</person> has also played well in place of <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> second and six here in the kansas city spread pigpen <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gonzalez</person> brought down at midfield she catches already for <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> that was good for 14 yards real solid design of the play again here against the raiders traditionally a very <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> heavy mantoman team <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> actually lined up behind the wide receiver on his side used him as a pick you can see right there that there was a lot of contact trying to create an opening for <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> to make the play again time i think they knew exactly where he was going good start for these kansas city chiefs first downs already in motion no room stopped at the line of scrimmage bill it s amazing how many teams have kind of but that did this wildcat or in kansas city s case they call it the i gun or who knows what their actual name for it is but they all go with this direct snap now with either a running back or a wide receiver in the backfield it s really kind of become the the flavor of the year for the nfl every offense has some sort of package feature in that if it works only in the game chances are team is going to stay with it until the defense shows they can adjust second and ten the tightend the wookiee was the motion man hip done the raiders on the blitz it cant get rid of an incomplete well bill right there we saw an example of what <person player="nnamdi asomugha" race="UNK" position="DB">nnamdi asomugha</person> told us he would do at times on occasion right there flexed outside on <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> you dont see corners matched up on tight ends very much mantoman <person player="nnamdi asomugha" race="UNK" position="DB">nnamdi asomugha</person> big enough physical enough to go outside and and go mantoman on <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> but youll also find that there are many tight ends that would even get a ball throw to it with <person player="tommy kelly" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tommy</person> awesome walked over nice shows tyler things ben s confidence in <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> so third and 10 for kansas city opening possession for the chiefs check sit down this is going to be well short of the first down will <person player="william franklin" race="UNK" position="WR">franklin</person> with the catch well johnny lee higgins will be back deep now for the raiders and he has a punt return for a touchdown in each of the last two games that was against miami 93 yards and last week in denver he struck again an 89 yard returns for a touchdown and that is brought in the secondyear player from the university of texas at el paso bill hed really been a disappointment in the return game until hed be splashes that he showed he thought little warning we need over and punt from pole quick then catch made by higgins at the 12 yard line and when we come back the oakland raiders will have their first possession after a 33 yard punt just underway here in oakland no score <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> now in his second years really managed the raider offense well over the last couple of weeks a quarterback rating of 114 point two and no interceptions in and out of the hands of <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley</person> lily up front for oakland john wait starts again at center for the injured <person player="jake grove" race="white" position="C">jake grove</person> the raiders will try to pound the ball on the ground against their young flat seven of the chiefs justin fargus coming off a 100 yard day last week in denver and remember <person player="derek lokey" race="UNK" position="DT">derek</person> <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcfadden</person> had the best outing of his young career against the chiefs back in september 164 yards and build this chiefs defense number 31 against the run in the nfl but not much better against you past number 27 good to see the confidence to <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> coming up throwing on first again on second down at top and we have a flag the pass was intended for <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> one of the most difficult lessons for a young corner to learn in the nfl is that the contact rules are so much different pass interference number 49 in the defender who s the <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> safety and his third year out of purdue well they called on <person player="bernard pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bernard</person> paul he was actually matched up on the outside on <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> you see that left arm too much contact out there no doubt about it they will not let that go but <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> one thing to point out right though he is truly almost considered really a rookie and his experience in nfl really looked hard to that left side pulled the safety over hard to complete a ball when youre looking at that receiver the whole time it was a 22 yard penalty they pitch it back too far does an ice pick up now close to the 40yard line kansas city coming off a game where they allowed the most points in the history of the franchise giving up 54 against the bills <person player="glenn dorsey" race="UNK" position="DT">dorsey</person> is the rookie the fifth overall pick of defensive tackle linebackers are banged up to <person player="mario henderson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">mario</person> williams starts again for <person player="donnie edwards" race="UNK" position="LB">donnie edwards</person> boy men in the middle and they are young as <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> mentioned in that secondary starting a pair of rookie quarterbacks in car and <person player="brandon flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DB">flowers</person> there are not any teams younger in the nfl that started the season with the younger starting team than the kansas city chiefs have averaging just over 25 years <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> who s developed quite a chemistry with <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> the readings leading raters leading receiver 32 receptions for 471 yards and a touchdown coming in good solid playoffs youre gonna see right here is <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> he s going to go up and run a corner route watch the anticipation <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> has on this throw he throws it right there you can see there s a defender coming over in perfect position but <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> confidence in <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> puts that ball out in front of him knowing that the knowing that the defender could not adjust back to the outside great throw and catch marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> is at the backfield we swing it out a little trickery to the inside the 15yard line made the stop a little flash from the raiders that was a craig nap right there you see craig now he talked about right here is <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">ronald curry</person> right here is there <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcfadden</person> the ball is going to come in the air <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">ronald curry</person> and then right behind him is going to be <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> getting the pitch missed the old hooking light or a new variation of it very well done executed by <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">curry</person> the former quarterback and then <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> coming around the raiders will try to get the ball in his hands ten from the kansas city 14 yard line down inside the 10 and driven out of bounds at the 7 yard line i mentioned and there we go the oakland raiders only one opening drive touchdown in the last 52 games theyve only scored one offensive touchdown this year in the first half of the football game they broke a touchdown throughout on offense last week on a oneyard run by <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcfadden</person> that had extended for 205 snaps over 15 quarters and gregg knapp the offensive coordinator for the raiders did say we would see some creative play call and early in the inside and picks up maybe one the latest only offensive first half touchdown this season was in week four against san diego <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> see three yard touchdown pass to <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> gave the raiders a drought nothing lead in the second quarter third of three on their first possession when the raiders not very saw number 31 in the nfl sparse touchdowns in the red zone just another area theyve really struggled offensively im so from the gun the chiefs tried to pressure the young quarterback incomplete too high intended for miller jarrett paige had excellent coverage on the play and that was jason babban with the pressure on <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> but really impressed with marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> youll see rush that babbage coming around the edge he gets the shot on <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> but <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> done a great job this year of not forcing the football right there he put it up high to his tight end zack miller and a spot where either he would catch it or nobody would catch it protecting at least a field goal for his team 25yard field goal try from <person

second game for <person player="ricky brown" race="white" position="LB">ricky brown</person> is out with a groin injury but you know last week bill <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> look very comfortable running the ball out of this pistol formation as the chiefs call it this is just a straight power running game but it s different perspective being lined up behind the quarterback the last week carried the ball seven times for 81 yards and today it looks very comfortable running out of that formation two interesting different but obviously number 27 getting more career made a good living off the oakland raiders in the past movement and aligned on third and short <person player="herbert taylor" race="UNK" position="OT">taylor</person> yep youre right guard right here watch youre going to see just a little bit before the snap that no doubt about it little antsy little aggressive trying to get up there that was herb <person

position="RB">charles</person> he said this guy has blazing speed and i dont use that term very often he can break it at any time he is a special athlete youll see right here when he catches the ball doesnt look like he has a whole heck of a lot of chance to do much but he s so quick and got such great instincts he gets outside and can make things happen he s a third round draft choice out of texas part of the package that came to the chiefs in the jared allen trade when they traded him up to minnesota now they got an extra couple of picks and boy it s paying off for the cheeks that was good for 15 yards the slanted gonzales and he cranks his way for another kansas city first downs in raider territory down near the 45 yard line you see <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> gives you so many options right there great job with the eyes you can see <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> looking up the field trying to hold the underneath coverage to create that scene for <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> then delivers a ball right on the money i would expect to see if if they keep going to <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> against anybody other than <person player="nnamdi asomugha" race="UNK" position="DB">nnamdi</person> awesome wah he told us that he would come over and stretch stop <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> himself right now you see him on <person player="gibril wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gibril wilson</person> again fights his way for a couple <person player="thomas howard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas howard</person> made the stop third year out of utep second round draft pick for the raiders in 2006 <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> one of the best to ever play the position there s brought sixty or more passes 10 straight seasons the most ever by a tight end in nfl history well with that catch two billets are most receptions by any individual ever against the oakland raiders 205 reception second attend the delay that johnson still on his feet bikes for eight yards curt <person player="kirk morrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">morrison</person> and made the stop take a look at where tony gonzales says stands consecutive 700 yards receiving seasons and that s very good company that is a pretty impressive list of names right there you talk about some of the greatest receivers in the history of the game <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> obviously earning his respect as his career go until you and i were talking about it before if there ever was a surefire tide in <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> of fame canon is gonna be <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> 33 with time gets rid of it wait down after he catches the football and that s exactly what you hear when you talk about <person player="dwayne bowe" race="UNK" position="WR">dwayne bowe</person> watch how <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> he is catching the football he s 6 foot 2 listed at 221 pounds but it s a solid 221 looking right now boom just guys just slide right off and then bounce right off him he s a big <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> receiver who loves the contact after he get to the football without a doubt the most impressive secondyear player at the class of 2007 he by far and away is the one receiver that really stands out already joining guys like brandon marshall and antoine bolden is difficult to bring down and big kansas got brown once intentional grounding so does top cable but no flag well they were trying to set up a screen pass over the middle rob ryan you see right there fantastic defensive coordinator for the oakland raiders but you see right there theyre trying to set up the screen pass to <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> number 27 he was right there <person player="todd watkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">todd</person> i think they did the right thing throw the ball to speak quarterback is told if it s not clean on that screen pass the ball has to go forward the best place to go it has drive defeat of the intended receiver second at ten swarming greater defense turtle sans led the charge boy ill tell you turtle sans was like a rocket shot out of a cannon right there in the backfield before <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> even had a chance to make a move good solid play on second to ten now they got third and 12 this is the situation where <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> who has done a pretty good job in the last three weeks nobody s done it better than him touchdown passes right here third and long in the red zone era 225 girl he definitely got a field goal shot here you got to be careful the football those numbers are coming into week 13 third and 13 get rid of it but they did not get the playoff delay of game offense fiveyard penalty remains morelli our referee today and there s herm edwards happy with the way his offense is moving the ball right here but not happy with the delay of game put himself in a really obvious passing situation with the young quarterback he s found he pretty much made the commitment for the rest of the season know that silas big fan and seeing what he could he told us he had a few tricks up his sleeve going to try and put a little bit of pressure on power to <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">thigpen</person> the young quarterback you could see rob s almost salivating yesterday we were talking about it weve all <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> in the backfield there s taught by <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gonzalez</person> shorter than 20 yard line and well short of the first down a good solid decision by <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> does not force the ball up the field may have had a shot up the field up the scene with another receiver but you know what he wanted to protect that field goal to make sure that <person player="connor barth" race="white" position="K">connor</person> barr didnt have that extra long field going to start this thing out rookie out of north carolina heating his rookie at a golf course in north carolina the chiefs called it to come in and be their kicker he has not missed the field goal tried since taking over in week 8 from 38 yards out and he is a perfect seven for seven chiefs are on the board behind the play of <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> were tied at three 107 left tonight absolutely spectacular late november sunday here in northern california bars after converting the 38 yard field goal kicks it off the deep man justin noah the homeboy return specialist with the jets has a little bit of a scene gets it out across the 25 to the 27 yard line that s worth <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> will go back to work raiders a heated rivalry that goes back to the first days of the old american football league and the raiders come out of the wildcat formation well get the snap actually article right there except maybe a yard and that i think in my in my opinion that was a miss read that <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> took us through his thought process on that wildcat we got a little injury in the field but <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcfadden</person> told us he s reading that defensive end defensive end really gave him a chance to give the ball inside and he kept it and then took a hit you can see that the defensive end number 91 coming off the edge tombo holly he crashes when he goes up the field at all you can give the handoff underneath instead of having to try and follow him himself <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> should have give him that ball up inside i would have talked a little bit quicker hooper <person player="cooper carlisle" race="white" position="OG">carlisle</person> the right guard slow going off the field the end of the opening quarter were tied at 3 here in oakland down hard short of the 30yard line by the <person player="mario henderson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">mario</person> williams that may have been the last play of the first quarter that was the good solid tackle there by the kansas city chiefs that is the end of the opening quarter were tied at three will return to oakland after these messages youre watching the nfl on sick ready to start the second quarter oakland with a dominating win over the chiefs in week two twenty three to eight at arrowhead the raiders have won the last two but kansas city has won the last five meetings here in oakland hasnt lost at the coliseum since 2002 <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> will throw you can see we got another good tight end on this football field <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> coming across he was out in motion on the outside <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus</person> rustling the gun knew all along he got the coverage that he wanted went to his big dependable young tight end <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> who by the way is the number one tied into the nfl in terms of yards per catch beverage in almost 15 yards of catch that one will do nothing but help his average that was good for 21 and spotted at the 49 yard line wave for seven yards and let s check in with jb in new york for an update bill and <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> after thomas <person player="adrian jones" race="UNK"

next week orchestra first down inside the 40 that flows through the 37 yard line and once again jp in new york with another update hey bill after harry douglas month the pump for atlanta lt well danian thomason of san diego makes them pay from 3 yards off with that score there san diego 76 over atlanta now in the second bill and <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> jb thank you very much and the raiders bill watching with interest obviously both of those games because with the wild afc west they still have a chance to maybe squeeze in the playoffs the raiders on the move another first down close to the 25yard line and you see the creativity options that these young talented players for the raiders give you in for the chiefs also <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> split out as a wide receiver running the slant route no hesitation in <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> to go to his rookie running back first round draft choice this year got to try and find ways to get the ball in his hands complete the raiders will move <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcfadden</person> all over the field against denver he lined up as the tailback in the i single back sets in the slot they split him out wide even took snaps in the wildcat as he did running the wild hog offense back at the university of arkansas and he has been known to throw the football out of that wild hog in arkansas i think he said he ball about 20 times in his career in seven of them puts up another win for touchdown pretty good quarterback rating right there second at 10:00 after the infantry class changing the play and incomplete <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> just level justin fargus let s listen to the hip yeah the last two passes <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> then the first two passes he s thrown today that have not really been very accurate the one is zack miller a little bit behind coming across the middle and <person player="derek lokey" race="UNK" position="DT">derek</person> johnson right theyre more than happy to take a shot at justin farkas with the ball behind him there johnson second game back after missing a couple of weeks with a hamstring injury recorded 10 oakland close it behind zack miller it complete that will bring up fourth down what we saw a good drive there by the raiders installed on those last three plays in a row were really a little bit out of sync marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> but we saw some good physical run in which youd expect out of the raiders against this very soft kansas city rush defense they came out got physical a little bit of play action in the last three plays three straight throws got a question while in the run of the ball so effectively down the field then well go to three passes in that situation since you had a cast in and kansas city touchdown <person player="maurice leggett" race="UNK" position="DB">maurice leggett</person> the rookie scoops it up and scores until youre exactly right that wasnt a fake field goal but in my opinion not a very well designed fake field goal youre getting a punter trying to get fancy flipping the ball to a kicker a lot of things can go bad right there let go tried to give the nolook little flip youre going to see right here watch legler tried to flip it up in the air and almost look out you put it between his legs and <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> you know he anyway you look at and he s a kicker and you cant expect him to be able to adjust if that ball isnt perfect and that sure wasnt perform f works more than willing to accept that charity right there and <person player="maurice leggett" race="UNK" position="DB">maurice leggett</person> has been an outstanding five for the chiefs playing the nickel back position he s a rookie free agent out of valdosta state and he has made the most of his opportunity in the national football league <person player="connor barth" race="white" position="K">connor barth</person> with the extra point and the crowd here in oakland is stunned the chiefs take a 103 lead after the 67 yard touchdown by <person player="maurice leggett" race="UNK" position="DB">maurice leggett</person> chief special teams touchdown since the end of december 2006 in kansas city has taken a 103 lead i just there s a lot of question about that call he had fourth and 10 the chancellor <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian janikowski</person> picking up 10 yards even if they do executed the play stopped short of a 20 yard line he brings it back to about 217 during the return illegal block in the back number 19 for the receiving team 10 3 kansas city 11:51 left and a half long field for the raiders after the penalty first attempt of their own 9 yard line so the 13 and shoot let s take another look at the botched fake field goal trial and even if this is a successful play right look at right here this is <person player="maurice leggett" race="UNK" position="DB">leggett</person> right there he s playing say fourth and ten theyre not worried about anything funky coming so theyre saying hey let s just make sure we dont give him a big play that s tom cable i think he s doing a fantastic job as the interim coach here with the oakland raiders but that s the kind of decision to get people in trouble going forward in a situation like that the tongue run plus 220 to the 21 yard line but wednesday on cbs be the first to know who the nominees are when <person player="herbert taylor" race="UNK" position="OT">taylor</person> swift and ll cool j the grammy nomination taught sir wednesday on cbs america s most watched network mungus 32 yards on six carries the deep back and another first down for the raiders and this is what we expected oakley to try to do exactly right now they came out in the first drive and did a little bit of the rise of that raizel down with the trick plays worked very well i got no problem with that but this raiders football team make no mistake about it they are a physical running football team that does not want to get in a situation where theyre throwing the ball more than 15 20 to a threegame theyre doing what we expected to do right now were right at this kansas city the power is way for a couple of tough yards and coming up jp dan shannon boomer cook our all the latest nfl scores foot seven of the chiefs has been beaten up they only had one healthy player the defensive line of practices week this is a team that has struggled against to the run there s 30 in the nfl have been unable to get to the passer in the wildcat formation again with vargas stopped after the short game we were talking earlier about the the wildcat formation everybody in the league seems to be going to their own version of it but we got to understand here is that these defensive coordinators on the different teams in the nfl guys and they will have a game plan and theyve seen it enough this you know the players out there are well coached they know how to make the adjustment from oak park third and seven the penalty flag <person player="todd watkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">todd watkins</person> we aged it out of byu brought it in but let s check the penalty <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> took a shot on this one really a good pressure from the cannon city chiefs but well see who the ti is on on this play something obviously up the field tom cable says it s on kansas city and you know what tom cable thinks very obvious question is whether <person player="todd watkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">watkins</person> pushed off in order to generate that advantage or not the illegal use of hands hands to the face number 24 nineteen of the offense the penalties will offset third down it seemed like at the end of the play that that <person player="todd watkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">watkins</person> did all of a sudden have a lot of separation between himself and <person player="brandon flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DB">flowers</person> look at the pressure on <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> here theyll come up the middle right in the face boom two or three guys got him you can see right there is lazy kind of rolled up funny also and <person player="todd watkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">watkins</person> just a little shove at the end negates um what could have been a big play for the raider kansas city they leave the lord six sacks for 11 games the nfl record was the 16 games each 13 the strike from tamarcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> what a nice throw and catch the more i see of this <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcfadden</person> and i got to see him a couple of times in college last few years he is so versatile coming out of the backfield right down the middle of field and what a great throw by <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> just over the outstretched hands of <person player="rocky boiman" race="white" position="LB">rocky</person> boy minh the middle linebacker right on the money big play at a big time for the raiders still searching for that first offensive touchdown since week four against san diego to a <person player="jarrad page" race="UNK" position="DB">page</person> made to stop after a pickup of 20 yards puts every bit of that 270 pounds into the defensive back branded car brandnew car the rookie fifth round draft choice she s playing very very well for a rookie he said i was in this big at grand valley state where i came from marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> round in the corner at about 270 pounds he told us yesterday and just said listen little fella i want to get a few more yards heat some of my shoulder here boom wow marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> liking that too back in the game johnny lee higgins was the intended receiver johnny lee higgins youre gonna see right down the middle of field if and ill tell you i put part of this on johnny lee higgins he should be breaking that ball inside where to marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> s throwing that ball he s got the read when he sees too deep safety s the middle of field open like that he is supposed to bend it inside and that s one of the the big issues the raiders have they dont have a lot of established veteran receivers on this team that should have been an easy throwing cash gain and again let s check in with jb in new york for an update dave bill <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> has to be impressed with the boys of the rookie matt ryan a quarterback in atlanta take a look here hooking up with justin peelle nice touch nice strike cappen an 8 play 46 yard drive atlanta on top of san diego 13 7 755 left in the first half bill and <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> charges ranked last in the league thank you jb in pass defense surrounded sepoys to have a good day against san diego and they need made to stop and that s gonna be short of the first down by a good couple of yards i dont think well be seeing the fake field and this time a shell bat for a while but as jb said though that that matt ryan has been very impressive this year for us for a rookie yet theyre getting there theyre investing right there on him raiders are gonna go for it on 4th and 3 five and a half minutes were bathing it to half largish the deep back a timeout before the snap called by the chiefs of 510 left in the half it s 10 3 kansas city and see if the raiders cant convert the 4th down when we come back were back the raiders have driven from their own territory cross midfield on all three possessions this drive started at their own 9 yard line the raiders have been the slow starting team here in 2008 say the least gable not a slow starting noise the chiefs a good move by herm edwards right there to take the timeout every team in the nfl for every situation that s been short yardage had to play they feel the best about they rank them permit was basically took the way this number one play in this situation by calling a timeout force and a short trade complete wattle <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">curry</person> couldnt haul it in and they had what they wanted well go over on downs to the kansas city chiefs who lead tim weve had a lot of offense but the games only touchdown came on special teams the 67 yard fumble return legatus kansas city takes over just over 5 right there you got <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> the awesome law on him by <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> and sure enough what that shows me right there is that <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> has extreme confidence in <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> nam be awesome wat told us what makes <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> so difficult is he s so big and so physical that body and is why he s in great position but <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> such an incredible athlete or hit the sighs to go up and squeeze that ball there are not many people that could catch that ball against that kind of coverage there are not many people who have caught any passes on he s not we cant bring it in a wednesday on cbs it s everyone s favorite holiday classic rudolph the rednosed reindeer the holiday season without him wednesday on cbs america s most watched network i know what ill be doing wednesday night that s my alltime favorite number i look forward to watching those shows every year usually only say im watch it with my daughter but now she s got off to college i have an excuse in behind <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">thigpen</person> out of the shotgun rose <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gonzalez</person> you can see how tough it is to get any kind of separation any kind of advantage against nam be awesome one tells you the kind of respect the raiders have for <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> him and the guy just keeps making place yeah physical did you try to get physical with him youre gonna lose any balls anywhere near him he sticks those big gloves on he s gonna make the play and he s always gonna go forward get a few extra yards he just cant say enough about this guy sure chan gailey often supporters said you know what he has lobster spit up but he s still pretty good on good like a power forward which is what he played in college it now using his body to fight <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jamaal charles</person> had a step but pigpen couldnt hit him and that will bring up fourth down for the cheese who s been battling a groin injury still not 100% he had been averaging 47 and a half yards a punt before the injury but about 37 yards to punt since coming back walk down immediately by <person player="oliver celestin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">oliver celestin</person> florida gators the topranked that is about as close to a real national championship game as youre gonna have right there and then sec what can you say about them but look at that number one and number two right there so this this really you can be looked at as a plus one scenario because alabama in florida top two teams in the country right now one who s going to lose and fall out of the picture you got the puff horn in case there s any doubt about it coming up leaders have just over four minutes to work with hell be stopped for maybe a loss of one on the play this is this kansas city defense very much maligned and injury affected very young very low rated and against the run end the past but ill tell you one thing today they have played very well against the wildcat offense of the raiders theyve got nothing out of it so far today last in the nfl in total defense last week buffalo scored on eight of their first nine possessions back inside and brought down at the 33 yard line by the <person player="mario henderson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">mario</person> williams well the last drive or two shot right here johnny lee higgins should have come down the middle of field that <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> pat <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">ronald curry</person> open on the fourth and 3play and why does it team struggle offensively why do they not score any touchdowns in the first half why they lost like that when you get opportunities nfl youve got to cash in or you pay the price incomplete <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley</person> lilly was the intended receiver now the raiders will have to punt last week against denver <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus</person> through only 11 times but he completed 10 with a touchdown and a careerhigh quarterback rating of one 491 and completed his first nine passes the start date games in throw an incomplete pass until almost through three quarters of the game and we see shameful eckler for the first time we had a pro sweeney punter with a forty nine point nine yard average giving <person player="kevin robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> as a flag is down on the move to retrieve it he does so at the 25yard line down a 42yard punt had no return tackled on a play by <person player="wallace gilberry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">wallace gilberry</person> donti back up defensive end simply saw <person player="shane lechler" race="white" position="P">shane</person> lecter for the first time we actually saw him earlier on the botched fake field goal try as he threw it between his legs trying to get to <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian</person> s key number 49 to the defense fiveyard penalty remains fourth down it said take another look at this and well <person player="wallace gilberry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">wallace</person> s finest moment no rock <person player="kevin robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">robinson</person> says i thought i thought we were boys they thought their teammates what s going on here she so get another chance after the penalty i am not surprised at all that coach tom cable took that pillar because it was not one of luckless better pawns this guy is so consistent this year already 10 punch over 50 yards on the season one of the very very best the best average in history of the nfl expecting a better pick out of this time and it s down to add about the 28 yard line and coming up on the sprint halftime report join jv dan shannon bloomberg coach cowher for all the latest nfl scores and highlights that s coming up on the sprint halftime report was just a 33yard punt from lachlan and well i misspoke he has 32 punts of over 50 yards this year 10 of over 63 yards so that right there two punts they are all very uncharacteristic of lachlan that s one thing the raiders through all their struggles in recent years theyve been able to count on him two and a half minutes remaining in the half for kansas city the kansas city spread side and ended after a pickup of five <person player="gibril wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gibril wilson</person> the <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> safety one of the big free agent signings for the raiders in offseason made the stop that could take us down to the twominute warning we have reached the twominute warning to tweet attend three back to oakland afternoon <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> tried to bounce back after a three turnover game against the bills although he did go 17 of 31 to 40 yards and three touchdowns those two interceptions against buffalo kansas city did have a seasonhigh 462 yards of offense on this is where <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> is at his best the corner networks pistol often she s situation able to get away from the first wave and is about a yard short of the first down and there really doesnt seem to be a virgin sea yet for the kansas city chiefs there theyre not rushing to get another playoff to snap a sevengame losing streak kansas city the second time they last 21 games keeps it quarterback sneak timeout on the field 117 left in the half 10 3 kansas city chiefs with one timeout remaining taking up the first down on the state just short of the 40yard line she finished us nine consecutive road games last one on the road was here in oakland in october of last year so timeout there bill in my opinion theyre going to review the spot maybe on the previous play there being but last two minutes of the half and the end of the game this is out of the control of the coaches it now goes to the review booth the review process continuing here at oakland inside the nfl is now on showtime every wednesday join jb bill sent <person player="gerard warren" race="nonwhite" position="DT">warren</person> sapp the cris collinsworth for all the vets that highlights insights and for wednesday only on showtime really has come out of it you play position if we could tell from this angle looks like that lot it s right on the 39 yard line is where the poor had to get across and that ball right there tyler s big pin you can see the ball there it was boy youre talking about inches and that s all it takes to determine whether he was indeed a first down or not you know <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> it is a game of inches it is ive read that somewhere ive heard that before after reviewing the play the quarterback was short of the line to game fourth down that i have to go so he didnt pick up the first down 38 and a half yeah you know there was the angle that showed him kind of been that little tucked position before he slid the ball forward that definitely made the difference between a 1/2 youll see when he hits the ground the play is over he is in it he trips right there didnt really get much much pushed there he s in that curl position then he gets up and sticks the ball forward that s rope too late and that looks like the chiefs are going to go for it her networks saying we got nothing to lose theyre gonna reset the chains on the opposite side of the field you know apparently well go for it i think well see either the same thing or maybe let <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry</person> jump on some talented up in it before it be great to try and catch him offguard with a hard play action pass and trying it <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> down the middle of the field theyre gonna come out actually now in measure i think he was shot he had to get to that 39 yard line he wanted to see how far he had to give to be six eight inches short im sure if going for it at this point with it with a lead yeah being with the minutes of your own left your own 39 yard line is there is to play see if they actually snap day but discipline has always been an issue with the raider organization they stopped again really a referee talking takes over 1:14 left to go in the half it s 10 3 kansas city at the game card to 117 3 extra seconds back on the clock well now that was a running place so that the clock should be blowing the whistle should blow back into play let the clock start running to because it was not a timeout called after that quarterback sneak there s the the only touchdown applied to fake field goal legged 67 yards on the return to give the chiefs a 103 lead the raiders good discipline there well take the penalty now they tough they take a timeout so still 10 359 seconds left in the half were back in oakland and kansas city after the timeout with the play clock running down will punt higgins is back deep remembering that touchdown returns the last two weeks until year 100% right even with the 103 lead this is definitely the right call for a touchback a 62yard punt from <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">dustin colquitt</person> third round draft pick in 2005 at his fourth year out of santa stay so who come the raiders weve had plenty of offense in the game but not a lot of points the only touchdown came on special teams well marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> interesting story stats not that great today six of 14 but tom cable told us that when he became the head coach he really wanted to try and help him out and kind of simplify thinking maybe there were times before he became the head coach that marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> might have been giving a little bit too much to think about he wanted him to play immediately and we have a flag on the play random car the cornerback made to stop gonna be holding against the raiders holding the way <person player="kwame harris" race="UNK" position="OT">harris</person> the left tackle called for the holding the fewest touchdowns this season includes the earlier games today and the raiders with only 14 and not a lot of double use among those four teams right there that could be part of the reason not a lot of touchdowns first at 20 after the penalty <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> yeah sure the 15yard line by <person player="maurice leggett" race="UNK" position="DB">maurice leggett</person> with nickelback raiders will take a timeout with 32 seconds left and a half let s talk a little bit more about the development of <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> certainly physically has the tools big arm do you agree with how theyve brought him along i do because you have to understand and we mentioned a little bit earlier he hasnt started a full season nfl yet he only started a couple of games last year and he missed all a training camp so this year was his first training camp never got into the playbook prior to being thrown out there last year now this year coming in with a full offseason a full training camp he still has a long way to go a great nap the offensive player talked to us and said he really does retain things very well but he still isnt rookies he got to be careful not to overload him and get him too much to think about that is back with <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> give it to the track wait for the signal johnson may have had a shot at it raiders were saying they retained possession now youre gonna sit great job kansas city one thing theyve done very well this year in the city great job stripping the ball right there by <person player="derek lokey" race="UNK" position="DT">derek</person> johnson coming in and the chiefs have generated a lot of turnovers this year 21 takeaways coming into this game number five in the nfl and right there close to number 22 they lost five turnovers last week but in the four games prior to that they had ten takeaways and it turned the ball over only twice well their team bill is plus four and turnover ratio prior to last week obviously they were plus nine that generally translates into a pretty good football team but it just shows you the depth of the other problems with the youth and with the injuries and got the cunningham right there longtime veteran defensive coach coordinator head coach none at all but he s been challenged this year and he told us or he told me that you know one of the things been most enjoyable about this is getting back to teaching he s young kids really teaching instead of taking these things for granted with a more veteran defense city with a young players players on the roster with three years or less experience and now another penalty flag false start number 15 offense fiveyard penalty remains third down johnny lee higgins talked about the raiders coming in as the most penalized team in the national football league 85 this season that was coming in to week 13 vols pass to prepare a few penalties on thanksgiving day marcus and that will bring up fourth down shouldnt be the end of the half see it s a city unable to stop the clock so it will be the end of the first half with our score kansas city ten oakland three well be back with the sprint halftime report after this message and a word from your local station youre watching the nfl on cbs a surprise that the raiders have not run the ball more this is a team that ran for 300 yards in dominating the chiefs in week two yeah they really did it and you would expect that is what the raiders do they come out they try to protect him marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> now put the game on his shoulders run the ball physically get after defenses really try and control the tempo of the game today theyve run the ball very effectively i would think they would come out running the ball more in the second half but really it s kind of been a weird game so far this first half let s take a look at the numbers from the first half you see the raiders 80 81 yards rushing the first half hecky multiply that by two it s 160 yards that s right about where the chiefs are as far as what they give up on a weekly basis hundred a little over hundred 60 yards that s a good russian day but theyre not doing it quite enough they need to get after more physically i think the one touchdown all this young special kids a huge impact on this game so far this game is brought to you in high definition on cbs and bill another another thing to point out too i mean the raiders have gained a lot of confidence come out of denver last week to come in here today and play as poorly as they have really to be losing 10 to 3 to kansas city there s got to be a little jolting today dives out close to the 30 justin meeting ba 2029 and <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> will go back to work here s a quarterback comparison of the two starters you know nothing too spectacular out of <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> a few opportunities they had to make some plays really only a couple of bathrooms and <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> very efficient going to <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> for 59 of those yards on five catches but i would really expect to see the raiders come out and get physical the second half of trying establish the physical temple second half farthest to the 34yard line fargus coming off a 100 yard day last week in denver still hasnt scored a touchdown though since his last carry of 2007 and a look at the raiders first five possessions you know they havent had any turnovers with the exception of the one big one that could cost him seven points on the fake field goal but the grizzlies the ball effectively in their first three runs right in a row pick up a good good solid 20 yards on two plays jared <person player="jarrad page" race="UNK" position="DB">page</person> free safety popped him out of bounds look out the pin in the first half and nothing spectacular but down were going to be in the desirable situations you want your young quarterback to be in and you can mix in some play action and not put too much on the shoulder vargas on the left made the stop ill tell you what that was an impressive play right there by <person player="derek lokey" race="UNK" position="DT">derek</person> johnson number 5060 outside linebacker he completely dominated this play youre gonna see on the bottom of your screen right there number 56 coming in he catches underneath the pass <person player="tony stewart" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony stewart</person> drives him back into the backfield and makes <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> half to adjust his course and slipped and ended up getting about a 2yard lock that stays in the game nice to get back to the line of scrimmage may have lost a yard number 71 offense 10yard penalty still second down <person player="john wade" race="white" position="C">john wade</person> who starting at center again this week for <person player="jake grove" race="white" position="C">jake grove</person> called for the hold well you know we can talk about what the would what we think the raiders should do or shouldnt do and tom cable i think he really does want to be a physical running football team but when you have holding penalties and putting yourself now in second twenty situations it s hard to get up there and get physical and just grind the ball you know you have to you have a plan of what you want to do and how you want to attack but if the players dont do it properly and dont execute the right way dont avoid the penalties and dumb penalties the chant game of the game plan raiders at three and eight trying to went backtoback game for the first time this season the chiefs are looking to snap a sevengame losing streak got a lot there get him out to the 42 yard line well i think i think tom cable sitting right here maybe try and pop a run inside with justin fargus but second 20 tough situation trying to try and start playing that field position game now maybe try and get the ball near midfield where you can pin kansas city back inside their own 15 own 10yard line long third and 16 for the raiders intended for <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">ronald</person> courage not a great pass from <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> the series started out promising with a couple of good physical runs but it just shows that you know one one mistake the holding penalty right there you just get you in a situation where it s asking a lot out of a young quarterback to stand in there and make those kind of plays although <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> was brought here to make those kind of plays so you cant sit here and say forever you cant expect a mythical place he s got a stubborn mixed throat before this game is over if they want to win the game 33 yards of left his first fine the end zone for a touchback a 57yard punt 10 3 kansas city as discovery righted by the nfl for the private abuse of our audience any other use of this telecast or any pictures descriptions or accounts of the game without the nfl s consent is prohibited back in oakland shoots lead at 10 3 but im able to find the endzone offensively in the first half we were just the one good drive 11 in the field goal possession the second half of the chief johnson able to get the where <person player="jonathan holland" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jonathan</person> has had good days against the raiders was this for games this season because of the various off the field issues was still kansas city s leading rusher 565 yards i mounted 19th gary s coming in with a 47 yard average in seven starts and that was good for 13 yards alright as we see the kansas city got their first rushing touchdown a first rushing first down of the day but <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> and his eight games against the raiders five times he s got four over 100 yards so you know he wants to defend that to play he has really stepped in and played well after the angela <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> was released with awesome while the other side teams have really gone after him and he has been able to rise to the challenge well there are two things i dont like about this play by <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> one the throw gets away from it was kind of tight i dont know if he should have thrown that ball in there but he put it to i over the top what i dont like also is right here at the end of the play he didnt make what i would consider to be a real solid effort to try and make a play on this tackle to keep <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris johnson</person> getting into the endzone you throw a fast like that and he s going for a touchdown or going close where you better get in there and stick your nose in there try and make something happen coaches will be talking to about that but inside the touchdown here justin farkas you talk about a long time coming justin farkas he deserves that one and making it happen as you said bill this guy s come up big form that s the kind of play the raiders needed get the z little bit of tyler s dicks and see what he s made up see if he can put this behind him come out and play a good solid quarter and a half football here this time it s the readers taking advantage of a turnover the interception return down close to the goal line the <person player="justin fargas" race="white" position="RB">fargas</person> does the rest that were trying to 10:00 with 1113 left with the third gibson now <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">thigpen</person> through two picks last week and justin fargus completed things leaping over the line and into the endzone for a touchdown his first since his final carry of 2007 and boy is he feeling good to get that monkey off his back hoping that the floodgates are open now he s had some chances this year but the raiders upfront in those goal line situations have just not done a good job of creating a seam and right there easy touchdown dixon has to remember now those little beyond the point after touchdown so big pin will try to put the turnover behind him go back to work with ty to 10 here in oakland <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> im a large if you shop at 2nd and 8th gordon fatah big king did not let this got a place gain skill outside linebacker in his third year out of utah super tackle by <person player="thomas howard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas howard</person> looks like <person player="larry

flying over it says not so fast big guy a very big play for towers big pandas can the inside makes the shop that statement was right from chan gailey offensive coordinator permit words a little bit tentative in terms of the play calling theyre just trying to make sure that their young quarterback doesnt put them in a worse situation than theyre already and that tells me a lot right there though <person player="tommy kelly" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tommy</person> lee higgins trying to return the punt for a touchdown for a third consecutive week well get another chance short hyde park higgins cross and a fair catch and makes it at the 38yard line 9:08 left at the third ten all in oakland not have been played more perfectly than brandon bennett the ball good solid clean hit <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> did not appreciate that a shot bring up fourth down again a 50yard punt the last time these two teams met he had a caste kick things off he was in a team record 56 but the real story was on the ground two rushing touchdowns before yards from macbeth <person player="michael bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">michael bush</person> who we havent seen today had 90 supposedly the sidelines that s caught by gonzaga juilliard luck chant going to <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> right there you saw another first down that few chances to make plays he just does it right there he should have paid the price the second attempt gets back to the 40 derrick s at paris hilton s america s most watched network you got any stupid human tricks youre gonna bring on with that fake field goal regards the ballgame you know ive got a lot of respect for rob ryan as a defensive coach that s a situation where right there i would have expected him to come with some pressure they came with a fourman rush he left tyler $600 and he gets it made to stop just another great run by by late for all the penetration to cross over and then he cuts behind it all gets up in a line lets them commit to the rights to the left side and then has the confidence for the chiefs this is their first trip into the red zone percentage what you seeing right now you see the wristband on <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> the receivers all have them too and when they go to this nohuddle it s not a hurry up they go to kind of a nohuddle receivers on the outside they all have a list and he calls out a number the number sent to him from the coaches he calls the number out they all look at their wristbands and i mean everybody knows 13th play of the drive not again theyre good pressure from the raiders right there come to the end of the third quarter and that was but oakland after this message the raiders had their opportunities now jabril well see if that comes back to haunt him that interception keeping 10 the city alive letting <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> live to see another day here that works hoping that has changed and snapped their seven gamblers well and out of bounds at the 11 yard line since wha forced him out i think that whenever the chiefs go to that empty backfield look with tyler thinking back there in the gun whether he s told by her mad words or chan gailey offensive coordinator he s always given i think the freedom if he sees the defense spread out to cover the pass if he doesnt see what he likes good suck it and go get down close to the two yard line because a running quarterback at coastal carolina youre gonna see great call great design he takes the drop back let s lead blocker <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jamaal charles</person> get right there in front of what a seam you can see right there <person player="kirk morrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kirk morrison</person> number 52 the

pay for it touch that hit it into the endzone herman edwards he knows that they got away with one with the couple of throws a big pin made there but in thailand big pins defense he made up for with some plays with his legs a couple of key third down conversions of <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> and his team is back out front now lead and it s good 13:43 left to play and now the chiefs lead by seven on the touchdown by <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> an impressive scoring drive from the kansas city chiefs 16 plays capped by the 2 yard touchdown run by <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> his fourth touchdown run of the season and the chiefs lead at 17 to 10 down hard at the 21yard line that s where <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> and the raiders will try to answer when we return kansas city chiefs have won the last five meetings here in oakland and lost at the coliseum since 2002 and they leave 17 to 10 with 13 that finish remaining justin pardons just trying to adjust the ball in his hands he knows that s unexcusable unexplainable really just trying to brace for the contact and the ball pops out before anybody even touches him he s sure caught one after he let go of the ball but you see oh you know what there was it was a hand in hockey boy him and stripped it away yep <person player="rocky boiman" race="white" position="LB">rocky</person> borman i didnt see him get that hand in there and <person player="brandon flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon flowers</person> recovered him looking out of virginia tech the second round draft pick tremendous play by <person player="rocky boiman" race="white" position="LB">rocky</person> borman to get that hand in there kansas city does a great job obviously of generating those tunnel should have had the ball justin varughese really going to the left side might have wanted that ball on the left arm good fundamental football cheese from the oakland 39 yard line <person player="devard darling"

player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> lana gets jess a little breathing room here is matt ryan hopes up with harry douglas who earlier had enough the ball on the puck here he catches it redemption is a title of this one 22:13 in the four back to bill and <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> all right jb thank you that two chargers secondary is nearly struggled i had another good outing for the rookie 37 for kansas city the 11 yard line it s such a weapon to have a running quarterback like this youll see right here you see sets up throw he sees its man coverage everybody running with receivers you see nothing in front of them but <person player="cornell green" race="UNK" position="OT">green</person> grass anytime tire <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">thigpen</person> sees that he obviously has the <person player="cornell green" race="UNK" position="OT">green</person> light to go and what his teammates have learned you saw some great blocks down the field theyve learned it once he tucks it get it get your hat on somebody help him out because he can make good things happen that was good for 25 yards and then we came in with over 200 yards rushing and a seven and a half yards per carry average johnson inside the tent down to the nine and billets in great point people sometimes maybe dont understand what that man coverage means if youve got a running quarterback in a defense is playing mantoman defense who s the one guy that not cover the quarterback is the one guy that s not accounted for in mantoman defense if youve got a running quarterback and he sees mantoman coverage he knows that no one s accounting for him if he can get through that line of scrimmage he s got big a big yard she s with a sevenpoint lead trying four more second and eight walk forward to the six <person player="william joseph" race="nonwhite" position="DT">joseph</person> made the stop the former first round pick of the giants back in 2003 now with the greatest and you just dont understand how <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> is when he gets that head of steam going forward he was hit in the backfield by <person player="marquis cooper" race="nonwhite" position="LB">marquis cooper</person> five no play clock reach zero then rob ryan s wishing it would have got the snap game fiveyard penalty still third down because they would have definitely had tyler dixon for a loss on the play took another look at the play clock yep defconn you see how well the raiders head at the pin and they did they were gonna stuff him in the backfield so third and ten get a first down at the one i would be surprised jan gehl a call for cats right here the wookie tightend im out of tennessee the third round draft pick well short of a first down i dont know if you could even call that offense that was a design play where the play was set up for <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> to only throw it to that tight end he wasnt looking anywhere else her mad boards and buchanan gaily thinking maybe they could pop it tight in a little delay route underneath get in the ball movement and get in the end zone just didnt work out good defense by the raid on the bar who is not missed a field goal as a kansas city chief to give the chiefs a 10point right down the middle so he s 8 for 8 is taking over the kicking duties the puffle busta raiders 3 2010 kansas city when for only the second time in the last 21 games miller feels that at the 10 and walk down rustle narrators back to work and we return 848 left to play the raiders need to get at something going offensively to the line of scrimmage great penetrate from that front seven much is the line from seven of the kansas city chiefs man look the dick always turnovers always a key shanta city scoring ten points off the turnovers oakland got the one chopped the sylar think been interception but this game now bill it comes down to <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> and his receiving corps which by the way this team is not built to come back they dont have the big the consistent wide receipt was out there in the corner dickie apart again in complete overthrows actually lily only one wide receiver for the raiders has caught a pass today that was marie on the hook and ladder and that was it zack miller has three receptions with fagin has three and correa the only reception among the sabres 35 yards in the second half for the raiders right there that s not very good they all year long theyve been a secondhalf football team they came out one on the ball in the first in the first series in the second half but they just havent had any place padding in the backfield now there s a good job stepping up in the pocket <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">ronald curry</person> was open and the ball was not even close and open to marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> i think <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> could have probably tucked that ball and run for the first down quick three and out for oakland and 12 and long comes <person player="shane lechler" race="white" position="P">shane</person> electric standing back at his own 10 yard line <person player="kevin robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">kevin robinson</person> the deep man from kansas city the chiefs good remaining raiders in general frustrated down twenty to ten oclock trying to break that sevengame losing streak those starts from their own 43 yard line i would expect the chiefs to ring really try and move the clock here finch i left that clock going down out there going to the direct snap say what hed better be careful the way he s holding that football he saw a couple of the offensive linemen sir gesturing close to the chest thereby city to the 49yard line let s pick up my chances with the jury at this point in the ballgame the defense is desperate to get the ball back theyre going to be coming from every possible angle to do any kind of trickery at this point you take your role in the dice because theyre gonna have penetration the best way to go at a penetrating defense is right at it theyre right there good solid counter play here down by 10 it s hurt outstanding job rushing the passer that time by the raiders big kid had nowhere to go so oakland will get another opportunity <person player="tommy kelly" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tommy kelly</person> led to charge tyler stegman didnt feel comfortable probably a good decision in that situation you know the raiders are a team that with the pressure they bring with the mantoman cover with their ability to cover all over the field if that ball is not throwing on the money could be tipped up in the air and all of a sudden youve got a disastrous situation that was a good decision by the young quarterback dangerous johnny lee higgins standing backers on 10 yard line kansas city 28 really been able to neutralize his last two games i had many opportunities today well next sunday the playoff race rocks with regional action here on cbs jaguars tangle with the bears bret the jets play the niners the patriots take on the seahawks check the local listings beginning with jb dan coach shannon and boomer on the nfl today and will be in denver to see the chiefs at the broncos first down that s a connection youll have to make but the raiders are going to be able to march it down the field that are hurry well in kansas city well let them have that five six yard throw all the way down the field because the clock wont stop theyll be inside number 77 offense fiveyard penalty remain second sacco moved his great nap this game as weve talked about there s missed opportunities for the raiders all day could have been a touchdown shipping that bucks down here early in the game right here marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> had <person player="ronald curry" race="UNK" position="WR">ronald curry</person> for a touchdown but it hasnt only been the offense big play right here britt <person player="gibril wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> the easy interception candice sane took advantage went down and scored a touchdown on that drive gantt control the game and <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> slipped and as he let go of the football he was trying to find <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> again yeah that was just an awkward flail around youre gonna see tomorrow just goes to throw the ball here and that left foot just slips right out in front of them fortunate something bad didnt happen there start now in the sock for 6 78 yards west of 35 yards third and seven miller cant hang on and that really is the story of the game for the oakland raiders that was a good throw by <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus</person> miller to the usually reliable mr marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> i mean to the usually reliable zack miller does a good job finding the holy balls right on the money zack brother a ball was almost too well thrown from the make that play call for our 47 he s got to get to scores this is the right call and that s making a play he s gonna hear a minute hearing that toward 70 pounds around what a great play just an athlete making plays steam rolling straight ahead god continues to run that was good for 20 yards fargus gets it across the 45 to the 46 yard line just over 4 minutes remaining second at eight upcoming johnson had it in his hands it was in about six right into <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jamarcus russell</person> ribcage for those of you expecting to see 60 minutes youre watching the nfl on cbs the game between the kansas city chiefs and the oakland raiders bill macatee along with <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> beuerlein our score kansas city 20 oakland 10 60 minutes will be seen in its entirety immediately following this game except on the west coast will be seen at its regular scheduled time 3rd the change bill this is one of those situations where kansas city really misses that patch rush weve talked about only six sacks on the year they need to be able to generate pressure in this situation obviously situation down at the 33yard line continues to run well again kansas city will be more than happy to give those three and four yard passes over the middle second and seven and kansas city is going to take a timeout herm edwards wants to settle his troops while the chiefs only win in their last 20 <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> got kansas city off to they have lost seven straight cents it s interesting they have lost the last two against oakland but theyve won the last five against the raiders here in oakland amazing this is theyre able to hang on would be six straight in the coliseum through a pic hollered is <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> safety had a chance to scoop it up good pressure off the backside the right from middle by <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> marques <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> just trying to get rid of the ball which is massive that that if any troll that weve seen today could have been considered because he was not out of the pocket yet <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> was trying to come that way but really not in that area much improved kansas city defense today against the raiders over the captain that will bring up fourth down and ill tell fon so <person player="alfonso boone" race="nonwhite" position="DT">boone</person> did a great job reading the sniffing out the screen and here come the raiders for the field goal it s a good call they need a touchdown and a field goal you got to have them both at some point youre in <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian janikowski</person> z range albeit it is a 50plus yarder but you got to have a touchdown in a field goal if you dont convert the fourth down you dont get either one so you take the field going this is maybe for janakowski it s a bit where you go and plenty of length where the raiders come away with three now trail by 7 with 255 remaining well the raiders have three timeouts left three minutes left in the game i think if youre tom cable yeah we go ahead and kick it deep and hope that you get the kansas city chiefs backed up not any not any deeper than the the oil about any people that 2025 you our line and hopefully the young quarterback they wont feel good about taking any chances your defense can rise up and get to the football back table over there talking digit well well send his <person player="darrell strong" race="UNK" position="TE">strong</person> safety this is a game that we visited with the raiders this week and practice yesterday and it was a confident team for a club of three and eight they felt they had a really good chance to win backtoback games for the first time this year you know you almost forgot walking around the raiders facility but this is a three and eight ball club and then there seemed to be a genuine sense of confidence and optimism permeating through the whole facility and i remember going home and dis thinking wow the predate how could they feel so confident but it wasnt it wasnt a negative i didnt think i just i guess what im what i felt was this is a team that really believes theyre close but they also really believed coming to this ball game that they were going to win this thing for sure in kansas city anticipating the onside kick so theyve got the hands team on the field <person player="kevin robinson" race="UNK" position="WR">kevin robinson</person> is back deep but pretty much all alone there you see ten players up near the 40yard line surprise if theyre playing it this way youre gonna bet that casting one of six on onside kick he s gonna kick it into the end zone i believe and then put the raiders that put the chiefs at the 20yard line on side kick and that will sail over the head of cattle amateur the end zone for a touchback well the raiders have had some close losses week three at buffalo that blew a ninepoint fourth quarter lead the bills 124 23 against san diego the ladies lost a five point lead the fourth quarter the took it 17 to three timeouts 2:55 make kansas city get a couple first down to win this game put it on to make a play and that s really the only way that kansas city can hurt the raiders right now in my opinion is to get <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> loose on a couple of big runs the waiters had to be very conscious of that it has taken time out tonight on 60 minutes michael phelps a rare inside look at his life s in the olympics plus the great poker swim cheaters who won twenty million dollars and got away with him powered by new episodes of the amazing race cold case and the unit i ate on cbs america s most watched network looking on anxiously to give his offense another team and seven after the timeout 20:13 give it to johnson ours is way across the 25 close to the 28 yard line and the raiders will take another timeout stop the clock at 243 remaining came in with a mathematical chance still in the afc west which by all accounts is a weak year in the west it looks like kansas city or san diego is going to go down today their trail into atlanta with about a minute left denver ahead in new york i think that s the game that was definitely counting on the jets come up and beat him but tom cable knew that the raiders had to take care of their own season five thanksgiving week 33 big catch by the way button and that will get kansas city a first down now the raiders still have time to get the ball back that was good for 12 yards and a first down and the readers take their final timeout oh im really surprised that the kansas city went somewhere other than <person player="tony gonzalez" race="nonwhite" position="TE">tony gonzalez</person> but give credit to <person player="dwayne bowe" race="UNK" position="WR">dwayne bowe</person> boy that was a heck of a throw and catch great coverage on the play did not expect that ball to get through to <person player="dwayne bowe" race="UNK" position="WR">dwayne bowe</person> but using those hands <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris johnson</person> s it covered on the play we were able to take it away from <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris johnson</person> he really did just went after grabbed that football that s the mindset of a children s weight receivers the national football league he heard about <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry</person> fitzgerald and when the ball is in the air it s mine exactly right mentality they have to have bo able to go up and get it 58 catches for 724 yards and six touchdowns coming in today been a tough day marcus <person player="jamarcus russell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> and why that play was significant to go the raiders could get the ball back with a twominute but that gave 15 more yards of field position do get it back it s going to be deep in their own territory one remaining be a nice game stays inbounds and another first down that might wrap it up theyve been the backbreaker that was good execution <person player="larry johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">larry johnson</person> showing he can still get outside of the edge picking up another first down now the raiders cant stop the clock so that will take us to the twominute warning chiefs with the football and a 20 to 13 lead two minutes remaining and the chiefs will be able to just run out the clock after that last first down frustrating vargas and the oakland raiders let s take a look one of the big stories is the baltimore ravens led by rookie joe flacco six win the last seven games they are playing hot right now then how about denver going to new york it s the jets everybody kind of writing them off <person player="jay richardson" race="UNK" position="DE">jay</person> cutler s and ends up 357 yards two touchdowns right now 34 to 17 and then right here the kansas city chiefs winning for the second time in the last 21 many people expected the raiders to win easily including maybe a couple of us up here in the booth bouncing back impressively after the onesided loss at home to the raiders last week and you know it brings up an interesting subject here to bill herman edwards understanding the plan in kansas city now going with the youth all the draft choices 12 11 draft choice is on this roster right now active 73 players have played this year since opening day for the kansas city chiefs theyre building for the future and the question a lot of people have is whether herm edwards will get that year next year to do it the consensus of the feeling that we get is that yes he will get another year next year to hopefully get this thing going in the right direction 10 again takes the knee one thing the chiefs dont have is a lot of five and six year guys who usually make up the nucleus of an nfl roster at a couple of veterans like gonzales and watters but this is a team that was really blown up and built for the future and as the players meet on the field kans the losing streak will end then the raiders are unable to win backtoback games for the first time in 2008 we had coaches hug the final score kansas city 20 oakland 13 for <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve</person> beuerlein this is bill mcentee so long from oakland let s go to <person player="james marten" race="UNK" position="OT">james</person> brown now
