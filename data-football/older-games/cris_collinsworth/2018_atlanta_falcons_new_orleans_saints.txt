absolutely <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> every time he gets an opportunity because of his size and he s a lot quicker than what you think he is for a six for wide receiver and he s going to be matched up against <person player="pj williams" race="UNK" position="DB">pj williams</person> i feel like this is a matchup that they can definitely exploit data 15 for sinew played some quarterback high school wildcat quarterback at rutgers started his career with the penguins third year with the family couple tight ends in for atlanta first and 10 good opening drive for riot then alone up shock for some news open brings it in to the 11 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> <person player="mohamed sanu" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanu</person> got the stepan <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> the safety help couldnt get there a gain of 37 and just like i talked

just said <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> has a lot of confidence in <person player="mohamed sanu" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mohamed sanu</person> he s a lot faster than what you think he is welldesigned bootleg action to the right normally everything goes to the right but now this is back across fields to new runs away from the outside technique that s what you said in the open rodney there s no fear factor new orleans came down scoring and lastly it s fine you want to go shootout we got the guys to do it matz feels very confident in his offense in his weapons this is the area though the red zone coleman hopped outside one of the best in the league <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">cameron jordan</person> was there to shut the door on the running back <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">cameron jordan</person>s standing up on the outside and he does a great job here taking on this block and coming off he s a rodney a twoway player he doesnt just rush the passer he plays run also <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> i think he s the most complete defense in the national football league because he plays the run with the same passion to get his defensive coordinator dennis <person player="ricardo allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> agrees with you best end in the league second and 15 the pattern for riot shot the minute <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> rarely targeted in the red zone gets one there and gets to the three yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> itll be third and two incredibly just the seventh time they throw to jones in the red zone all year yeah <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> but im looking at ryan should schrader and he s at he struggled with against <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">cameron jordan</person> in the past but just enough push to get him behind him again at that extra time that was a great shot by <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> just finding the open spot against that double coverage to for the first down three for the touchdown <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> s oneonone you got to go down right step 3 over the pile well see if the falcons got on it sakes think they have it and this is just what dan quinn talked about by finishing great drive down there you get in close they can finish ryan rises up to throw it just a quick minute for <person player="marcus williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus williams</person> knocked it out big turnover for atlanta the safety <person player="marcus williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus williams</person> says showing up in the spot <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> didnt expect him tony yeah and this is a running play <person player="austin hooper" race="white" position="TE">austin hooper</person>

wants to throw the ball of <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> but you cant effectively get that block on a pass <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> is not a rookie quarterback he has to see the two guys blitzing into a gap and he has to he has to change it from a run play to a pass play and you can read his lips he s where did he come from he came running right in the center guard gap <person player="austin hooper" race="white" position="TE">austin hooper</person> couldnt get two in for sack for williams s second year in the league second red zone turnover for the falcons you cant afford that against the saints to work to the 13 complete desmet <person player="desmond trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">trufant</person> breaks it up on the pass intended for <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> that is rare breezed to thomas has been the best possible daily double you could find in football this year and that was well done by <person player="desmond trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">trufant</person> competing going with him on the crossing route staying after him he s giving up at least four inches too because what this kid is huge second and ten <person player="mark ingram" race="UNK" position="RB">mark ingram</person> knapp running back three comes back to the 2009 the winner well keep those legs churning and fives before for yeah lookin could make the tackle so briefs has a touchdown and an opening drive it s 26 touchdowns and one interception no one s ever thrown that many touchdowns in the history of the league 99 years with one or fewer in ourselves once in your life you want to stay for a while we could teach you a lot of football history with <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton s especially breezed in the incredible bubblers he has hit inside the ten what is he down by contact or not will be the key thing to look at zermatt akz takes it all the way for the touchdown for the moment conversation here with john husky the referee and one of the other officials and really for the life of me i dont look at the cornerback and he was grabbing and holding the wide receiver i thought it should have been a flag but great break on the ball by the mahkumat akz he had five interception six is an interception the defender was knocked down by contact on the 39 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> we will place the ball in the 39 open to 10 atlanta the correct call trips over the leg of <person player="keith kirkwood" race="nonwhite" position="WR">keith kirkwood</person> the rookie out of temple and then comes down so it is a turnover no flag thrown and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person>

chicago got one of the into the game of detroit to get to five without kz gets his sixth after the rare turnover by both teams falcons get it back to the 39 and here is ryan in the middle of the field it s a new again complete to the 23 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> let s go back to the coverage on that interception throw by marina really felt like the falcons got away with one right here <person player="brian poole" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian poole</person> just grabbing restricting the wide receiver this should have been a pass interference call right here terry mccauley or three times super bowl referee in the booth yeah <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> absolutely personal the defenders not playing the ball he reaches out he was materially restricts that we see his ability to move toward the football this should have been defensive pass on the franchise ride and said from the 23 going back to the air just gets rid of it they have that screen cover this <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">cameron jordan</person> healed off low five from the cypher shadowing <person player="tevin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tevin coleman</person> <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">cameron jordan</person> is such a smart player he feels this screen comes off rather than continued to rest the pass and reads it right now no place to go with the ball cant teach that mic so smart so good if people always talk about pro bowls i was looking like to look at the all pro list best to the best regardless of conference allpro defensive end last year on his way to that title again this year second in ten coleman quickly much there is

down well you look at <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> and you see why he s so frustrated he doesnt know where to go with the ball because his defensive backs of the saints have done a wonderful job of just defending and plastering these guys he has nowhere to go they did he wanted to go away from <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> he had the one on once that they were covered for the first time tonight <person player="ito smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ito smith</person> rookie out of

good job on <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> he s getting up in his face he s jamming them and this is a lot of this is this builds confidence in a young cornerback mic especially a guy to struggled as much as <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> has struggle with a confidence in his time of the giants that bryant 843 third oldest player in the league of 32yard field goal attempts it s three games of the hamstring injury told me on the field before the game feeling pretty close to 100% knocks it through and the

what does it do to a defense into a coordinator when you have these two backs as unique as the skill set is of samara and the band right there margate really is difficult to defend because youve got the power running of <person player="mark ingram" race="UNK" position="RB">ingram</person> and the playaction passes and then camara you dont know is he going to be in the backfield as he flanked out and it really is a problem it s the challenge for more kuantan manual second gears defensive coordinator was the secondary coach here with atlanta was elevated a couple years ago dan quinn of course

wanted to get that deep all the <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> but that was well played it was <person player="terrell mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mcclain</person> 99 at <person player="takkarist mckinley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mckinley</person> 98 were sack for the veteran and a south bar that makes third and 11 for new orleans and a threeman rush it has the yardage on the forward progress to the 37 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> for the first down <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> runs a beautiful route and he s just so good against zone coverage he s trying to find that open space looks outside no the open spaces inside he and brazier on the same page but you see <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> looking off looks to the left side he comes back to the right side of youre defending <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> you got to get up in his face marcus <person player="desmond trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">trufant</person> desna to fine he s just 13 yards off just too far nenechan they look play action shop plays here here s another five hegemon <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> and his hands on it look like he who s going to turn and go to the goal <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> but <person player="jordan richards" race="UNK" position="DB">jordan richards</person> does a good job to take it out of there this is for verticals to tight ends right down the seam and all the breeze is doing is looking at that free safety <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> gets a great release breeze looks the pre safety off puts him right on his hands you you have to catch that you have to kiss that that was so well done by <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> here he looks the safety away knows right where he s going that s my former teammate make some question for <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> you dont see many of those touchdowns or <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> one yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> a penalty marker down south and city coming back hold it a second down interesting start to this one guys so you thought so far toward well the saints you know <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton has a lot of personnel groups a lot of things he wants to see i would write myself a note if i were him three wide receivers <person player="alvin kamara" race="nonwhite" position="RB">alvin kamara</person> i can run inside dont forget about that and im looking at the falcons <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> in particular he needs to just relax he s played in big games before calm down he seems a little bit nervous two fumbles inside the red zone he has to play better and take care football might be some of that pressure of we got to score touchdowns when we get down here but he s the same guy who played in the super bowl had a lot of success he just needs to relax this moment is not too big from that many think <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> is the favorite to do the mvp this year with the back end of the play clock on second and 20 thomas eggs on didnt go down two more yards out of it this is an unbelievable throw and drew talked to us about this how do i get completions when everybody is covered everybody is covered and he finds <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> in the middle of the field but i like about him when i saw him coach he is a big big receiver he s not afraid to come across the middle hell sacrifice his body 63 64 what a what a great catch by this young man who just stepped around bought enough time and says i can put this up high and i trust my receiver well go up and get it so that knee teeth come down we marked it in the proper spot at the 34 so it s third and seven five in the pattern tamara gets the first down so smooth turning it up field in front of <person player="isaiah oliver" race="nonwhite" position="DB">isaiah oliver</person> and you got a first down at the 25 we talked about <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> and <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> and their success the completions already today add those up targeted 95 times 85 completions to thomas 89% highest completion percentage are any duo in the league in the last 20 seasons i mean it s really remarkable it s almost 9 out of 10 times he was a thomas and to complete at all they cover him i why dont they double cover my tony said they had him covered there it was a collision with right here the 15 for the first down well see if it is here s michelle well i asked <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> about his extraordinary connection on the field with <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and he said it s taken time a lot of repetition and communication and he said if they make a mistake in practice they will repeat the play immediately and try to build muscle memory thomas also likes to think he and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> share some personality traits they just certainly both are always on and on the same page of the show quickly these seats tried to run to the <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> and get a play in but we have a whistle that first was a good job by some because that was an illegal so they somebody lined up wrong it was illegal for me yes theyre lined up wrong both wide receiver in the tight end were off the ball they were gonna snap it and get a penalty <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> stopped it down here at the bottom of the screen it looks like it s <person player="josh hill" race="white" position="TE">josh hill</person> enob hill and <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> both off the <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> of scrimmage that was going to get called as an illegal formation <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton did a good job stopped it save five yards tell you one thing <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> he sees everything gain i think being it his practice is definitely an adventure he gets into it it was eyeopening for you yesterday absolutely he s got a lot of energy absolutely very smart coach reminded me of my year i played for bill walls he just dissected everything talked about every position where youre gonna be plays were gonna dial up for you it was great <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> fight for we ready second in one heap ronald ronald outofbounds 12 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> well it planters numbers have been good they have been hurt in such key spots some of their best players are out with injury and it s showing especially in the run game they are second to last in the league in yards per rushing tonight a couple of big hits already has that number much higher than dan quinn would hope lost both of his starting safeties michelle told you the beginning deon jones perhaps the best player the linebacker in the middle play a little canoe has been in there for jones and playing better at a yale made the tackle and this is the thing that really makes him special i mean he gets the ball looks like it s nowhere to go and he just makes a couple little moves and he gets that extra hidden yardage i mean he is really amazing to watch this was an inside run he bounced it outside then spin move makes five yards where there was nothing there at the point of attack you so many things of them those receiver skills <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> olympus essentially receiver here up the middle beside the five before greeting <person player="grady jarrett" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jarrett</person> impact player in the middle of that <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> for the falcons makes the tackler forces a big third down here about a third of the way through this game and what s so tough here is the saints can do anything because <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton is so willing to go for it on fourth down so you could see playaction take a shot here they dont have to just run it in there and pound it up and get the first down watch this kid dan on he s up the very top of the screen it s over ready for the second year sign it out of division 332 sharon eastman helped out the safety getting an opportunity because those injuries back there for the falcons big play and like you said tony fourth down sometimes theyll go here theyll go for the field goal yeah he s a he s a big guy and he he just does a slant route and the falcons safeties have struggled hits him right in their hand but great job up nice but you got to give him a lot of credit swiping at the ball and this is something that they teach <person player="mark ingram" race="UNK" position="RB">mark</person> and manuel and dan quinn thanks to the job on the strip there s will <person player="wil lutz" race="UNK" position="K">lutz</person> who in college was at georgia state in atlanta he s been on our wall here to be his one this year he s just in 22 yards tapas more stead the

is ryan and get into the hands of <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> on the endora and genomes well played strung out by that new orleans defense only a gain of a yard you guys see these receivers on the regular basis around the league <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> one of the elite ones always in the top three in receiving yards in the national football league it seems he is such a threat big man with great speed and i just love his attitude he goes half to the football he is great i like to see him get more opportunities in the red zone rarely targeted down there as we alluded to in that first quarter second and ninetyfour ryan and the falcons trouble will be brought down if his <person player="sheldon rankins" race="UNK" position="DT">sheldon</person> breakins getting inside a careerhigh sack seasoning now has seven this is one place where they felt they had an advantage the saints with <person player="sheldon rankins" race="UNK" position="DT">sheldon</person> ranken s against backup guard <person player="ben garland" race="white" position="DE">ben garland</person> or second team guard damn just with this one move he s hard to handle in there again this a team that lost both of their starting guards this year and that interior pressure and some twists have bothered ryan third and 14 that s got time here takes that shot blanket coverage right through the arms of <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> and incomplete and dropped in the bucket <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> from being a tough time seeing it the falcons are left to pumped it away a really good job by marshawn <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> just stand with it they beat him on this play in the first game it was out of the great job of just trying to get his head back around trying to locate the ball sky by running to a lot of contact as well first punt of the game it s matt washer gets it away no flag as he goes down to the 35 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> here comes camaro got a step down at the 42 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> peter great throw such an important part of this atlanta defense dion jones as michele tafoya told you at the top of the game very close to coming back with a foot injury but didnt quinn the coach said i didnt want to just get him out there at when he s ready i want to make sure that he s completely ready he s a longterm part of this team before did they miss that long four different defense with him out there they lose a lot of speed the leadership that he provides and one thing that the falcons have struggled with all year has been tackling in the open field and he s a heck of a tackler this game <person player="steven means" race="UNK" position="DE">means</person> so much to him from new orleans went to jesuit high school great high school in the area saints fourth possession starts at the 42 in camara around the edge a bounce after a half dozen so jones is one of the big injuries in this season this big part of reason atlanta is only sitting on four wins <person player="devonta freeman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">devonta freeman</person> half their running back tandem out both of the guards <person player="brandon fusco" race="white" position="C">fusco</person> and levitra out with seasonending injuries i mention the two safeties keyon oneal or cardo <person player="ricardo allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> the young core of this team really damaged and jones now missing game 10 on the season with that foot injury inside two running back two guards linebackers and safeties right up the gut theyve been hit with injuries later <person player="mark ingram" race="UNK" position="RB">mark</person> more than four and six have been in other games as well the chinese first down bitch chuffing <person player="brian poole" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian poole</person> that s what rodney does as we watch games every sunday before football night there s a big hit from a safety and rodney oh i like that kid down on oh he s a former wide receiver they made him into a tight end he s big and he can run wisconsin platteville a division three player who s come on and played but those safety he gave those out for many years just i put myself in a moment which like now you dont have everything else go when you hit them during your great career the 42 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> it s so fun to watch this saints offense their guys four guys in three guys in back and forth who s gonna be in the game it puts so much pressure on the defense the matchup yeah pretty fun to watch <person player="taysom hill" race="white" position="QB">taysom hill</person> come up in there and block the lunges strong safety i love that kid that s what youre talking about 20 yeah it s like watching a hockey game <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> change yeah three in three out and as defense of those interesting with dan quinn says well theyre bringing hill in and now youre identifying what he s doing it slows you down because you have to be a little more basic so he s communicating and you know here on fire it s not like atlanta is a very exotic team in first world complete robert alfred come in from all angles for pass interference the first accepted penalty on the falconer parents alfred started to stumble and then he reached out sixteen yards on the penalty and well take it to the 26 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> you know we were talking in the break before how lucky atlanta got earlier lc offered like 20 mistakes stumbling and just oh yeah there s a bitch come on to camaro the turn of the game of a couple of yards ronnie youre no longer the feel you cant negotiate with terry well call the on penalty calls b gonna help poking like a defense to me pull the guy down no they shouldnt call what does he know he s only beneficial for twenty years you know guys are thinking about dan quinn s team here they turned it over once fumble the ball in the red zone on defense they held the saints to a field goal got a rare interception from greece theyd have opportunities to stay in this game they cant mess around here they really have to be careful at this point this sort of big series got of course another field goal here start with their quarterback <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> twenty four threes its increment size of four to the 20yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> <person player="vic beasley" race="UNK" position="DE">vic beasley</person> who only had one sack and that came in the new orleans game in week three had to last week they need him to ring the bell a little bit more this season you look at the center <person player="max unger" race="white" position="C">max unger</person> and this is a terrific block against a really good player <person player="grady jarrett" race="nonwhite" position="DT">grady jarrett</person> just clearing them out the way strong safety goes in there and he just misses yeah ryan you talked about theyre tackling sera denise knows right in the hole you got to make that tackle and make it a third wrong three wide receivers running against his nickel he can run inside this is just a college zone read but youve got small linebackers in there people trying to rush the passer camara can find those holes i like this <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> keep coming back to that inside run with tamara out of the three wide look yeah a lot of credit to that offensive <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> just getting up the field getting on top of those linebackers run it more than theyve thrown it tamara and <person player="mark ingram" race="UNK" position="RB">ingram</person> effective to 12 first down to orleans austan car we saw this in practice yes we need a copilot take your time set this up were going to make it look like run youll be wide open like you talked about oscar car he s in there like he s gonna block safety looks in the backfield he even food s the corner and just once again just sneaking out there if we put so much attention on <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> and all these other weapons <person player="alvin kamara" race="nonwhite" position="RB">alvin kamara</person> you forget about austin car luntz that s it so here the saints grow on 40 points a game going through touchdowns tonight tommy

of the most underrated players in national football league <person player="sheldon rankins" race="UNK" position="DT">sheldon</person> rankin s this guy s unbelievable nice little spin move right there putting pressure and that s what they talked about putting pressure on that <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> and getting them off that spot 13th time the jordan has sacked ryan in his career so it s fourth down new orleans took a timeout they want to get the ball back atlanta has left their offense out of the field now they say because it got to be aggressive is this too aggressive no dan quinn talked about this hey weve got to make some things happen weve got to steal some possessions im not surprised to see <person player="mohamed sanu" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mohamed sanu</person> that cannot go through if you dont get this in the same it might be ballgame fourth and seven theyre going to go for it brian scrambling can he get there yes he does put it in the left hand before he came across the sideline a huge conversion off fourth down i like to call and dan quinn talked about this yesterday we cannot win this game by playing conservative and what and one thing ive noticed <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> about <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> he s predetermined in who he wants to go to he s staring at his receiver he s not survey in the field he has to start surveying and feel and really trusting his instincts all time gutsy close where the ball is when it crosses the sideline really sharp to get in the left hand get an extra yard take any doubt out of the equation the 44 about 45 to go remember deep comes under down below minimal gain of to great job again dublin <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> this was a play accent trying to get getting him on a deep crossing rob the day the safety cutting yeah this is <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> like you talked about on deep crossing route the free safety comes out the middle the cornerback goes to the deep half and <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> somehow they got to find a way to get him in the game he s not even running a full round he s got to get it to the game right second and eight ryan scans comes back to the middle we seen that a lot from his office this year <person player="austin hooper" race="white" position="TE">austin hooper</person> the tight end with the kids first to the night 51st of the year under a minute remember now atlanta gets the ball to start the second half so they want to do the full belly check here score halftime get the ball back that s how theyre gonna get back in the game still up possessed and tony even if they get a field goal on this drive 17 6 it just stems the momentum a little early yeah youre not gonna beat for the saints kick and fill those like i know it sounds good thirtytwo five of the pattern the first down with <person player="ito smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ito smith</person> at the 31yard long time out now yes to two remaining in field goal range atlanta on the move 26 seconds till the half welcome to the toyota halftime let s go places atlanta driving trying to get within seven but alex angeloni comes up with a big hit on <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> knocks it out seats recover and they lead by 14 as we welcome you to the toyota halftime and we extend our thanksgiving wishes once again to all of you at home this saints franchise has had just a great surge over the last dozen years or so you remember back in the early days there wasnt a lot to be excited about what saints football but they did win a super bowl here s some nine years ago but in 2006 after hurricane katrina this was a very special season at a very special team and the most memorable moment from that year is what steve police have blocked a punt in the first game back here after katrina as you may know steve is battling als right now seven years into that fight yet he is still one of the most inspirational people in the city of new orleans and itll be scooped up in the endzone touchdown it was a big step in a long road to recovery and it was bigger than football for a man once known for flying all over the field flying these days takes on entirely new meaning for steve gleason but why would a man who cant walk eat or even breathe on his own fly across the country to seattle just a few weeks ago to raise over three million dollars at a gala to fight the disease that has nearly killed him im not sure if macklemore can hear us right now i got this sweet tuxedo shirt at the thrift shop i believe our responsibility as humans is when we give knock down we must not stay down we must help each other we must ask for help and stand back up regardless of how difficult that may be steve and his wife michelle welcomed their daughter gray a little over a month ago adding to a family that also includes seven year old son rivers how was having a baby possible are you asking me to explain to you about the birds and the bees peter yes yes i am i wanted to have a baby four or five years ago but i think michelle was right that we werent in a good place at that point from the beginning of time steve and i wanted to have a family we wanted to have kids he has a brother he s close with i have two big brothers who were my best friends you know i wanted to be able to look rivers in the eye when he got bigger and say i did everything i could to give you a sibling so here we are at the saints facility rivers is practicing flag football on drew breezes team what s it like for you to watch rivers play football yeah it s interesting because parents get to yell and provide encouragement to their kids but i dont get to do much of that which can be frustrating i talk with drew and tell them things rivers is working on so that s awesome because he knows a thing or two about football i would think that you probably would have really loved to have been a coach of your son and maybe your daughter as well yeah im a coach in my own way not necessarily in the typical sense but i think that in many ways the things im coaching will be more valuable to rivers in gray so this thanksgiving as usual steve gleason isnt focusing on what s been taken from him but rather everything and everyone he has to be thankful for it s a great time to have a child especially a daughter gray can be absolutely anything she wants to be some special people we visited with them at saints practice yesterday steve uses his eyes and that special keyboard to create the audio the sound you hear always remembered in this city steve gleason will be back but first clara plays a game of tag and shows us just how fun it is to be it tonight s firsthalf highlights are brought to you by chevrolet freeze ryan what s the ball saints think they have it they do shibby desert jd power dependability awards for cars trucks and suv s and that sets the table for the third quarter sunday night football on thanksgiving night from nola new orleans louisiana sits on top 14 falcons get the ball <person player="mike gillislee"

the 40yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> if you were enjoying a little bit later dinner dinner on the west coast here s the buzzer get yall caught up now the seats are up 14 in this third quarter <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> the passing numbers are good sat four times fumble laws also dropped one breeze continues the great completion percentage ten afford he did throw kick that saints defense were not talking much about the guys but again as they had the last two weeks making a difference in the falcons in the red zone not good enough which has been their story on big stages over the last year plus the 40yard get returned his teman coleman desperate to get a run game it is not fair <person player="aj klein" race="white" position="LB">aj</person> climbed the tackle and here is michele tafoya well yeah dan quinn told me his his offense has to be more balanced meaning more ron and obviously they have to protect the football but he said on third down we must get off the field on defense and weve got to make sure that harp defenders are in position to keep the running game in check <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton said the first half third downs got more manageable which allowed them to stay on the field <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> did sustain a little bit to show and to that point you made at the beginning just nine runs for the falcons compared to 20 now 21 passes is <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> but only two yards it s a <person player="jay bromley" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jay</person> <person player="aj klein" race="white" position="LB">klein</person> again before third down tony <person player="marvin hall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hall</person> of fame coach give your super bowl adjustments yeah michelle for the atlanta offense he talks about getting more runs i dont think that s the answers you cant handle that defensive <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> screens are the way to get the ball to <person player="tevin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tevin coleman</person> screams just like we saw there and then in the red zone <person player="mohamed sanu" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mohamed sanu</person> that s that s the gotta go yeah if im the saints defense im not changing anything continue to do what you can do a doubleteam <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> keep the deep safeties back and the falcons have shown theyre incapable of making adjustments knight third and tenth pressure on ryan gets rid of it <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> the open field protocol but couldnt crawl in this field he s kept the yard knives past shy of the first down and they went for it on fourth down deep were in their own territory in the last drive and ive seen no sign of matt box of the punter we will go surprised to see him go for it again dan quinn knows he s got to put points on the board and tony it s not even the desperation of the saints and their offense youre four inches yes if you dont get it tonight it s probably ball game for the season exactly well you got a play to win the game that came out five wide receivers forth in to earth s breeze gets the ball in great field position fires in the blinkin place and salone was there they were trying to get it to counted wrigley the saints are going to start the half with the ball on their side of midfield we probably let drew cuz he s probably the patriarch of you know the families he s the oldest carve the turkey cam jordan would be in charge of the music cams order to be in charge of the music i think music id get that cam jordan so you know being a be a great team event so a saints giving let be <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> would sit at the head of that table

payton didnt go for it his aggressive nature i thought they would go up up here and go for it they end up using the timeout for that dont drama off it s still fourth in fourth and 10 now itll bring out thomas moore stead but that is the smart play you should pump this ball to way your defense playing more steady he tries very hard to keep his heart rate up because he s so inactive this is only his 22nd punt you see the punts per game so far first 10 theyre on a pace for an nfl record more still have dropped in those down trying to pin the falcons inside the 10 and they will fare cough like

for that hs and even in an ultra aggressive mode you gotta keep it away here back inside your own 20 fast defense fast linebackers when you hand it off to give them a chance to go up in there and blitz just to a quarterback sneak theyre trying to get <person player="ito smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ito smith</person> in there to run it instead of pullman places today mr bond say

<person player="brooks reed" race="white" position="DE">brooks reed</person> that s no contest right there again drew told us this key to his high completion percentage is knowing how to get those completions when everyone is covered he bought time moved his right found a guy who was tightly covered but put it right on the money 20 clock running down the saints at the burn a timeout that s the second one they have used halfway through this third quarter well be back in the 32nd seats on top by 14 and driving big one saturday on the side of the pond of the premier league top for the table

business saturday is november 24th of get up get out and shopping small that s isles antiques in the heart of the french quarter opened in 1899 fourthgeneration family ownership some shopping if youre in the quarter this weekend falcon sneak points to cooper the tight end game on first down im about seven yards against this new orleans saints defense ten and a half quarters now guys look at what they have done to the bengals the super bowl champion eagles in the falcons that s a total of 24 points 11 sacks and seven turnovers in the last ten quarters when we talked to their coaches yesterday they said they are practicing better and that s what they attributed to this intensity pick up by those players and with a lead peacetime pulls it down throws to <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> and grabs it at the 39 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> in front of me <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> first down atlanta just a little playaction pass you see <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> right there tight split does a little push off and these are the type of plays you need <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> and <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> s and make that one earlier in the second quarter when they were driving down the field they had picked up the fourth down <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> took the shallow cross trying to fight for that extra yard airborne turnover every opportunity has not been able to gain momentum tefik pullman runs in the edge look it to the 44yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> picked up a five here on first down with four and a half left in this third quarter and like im just really disappointed with the falcons your season is on the <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> this is when you need your best players to come out and play well <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> had the big fumble <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> looks lost <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin</person> really only has two catches for 13 yards but you have to credit some of that to the saints defense these guys have played well coach they scored 37 points in the first game against these same guys retreating and his <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> himself so space in a couple yard shorts tony come back to that do you think this saints defense has improved that significantly from week three i think theyre playing better and this adjustment that theyve made put an <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> on <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> and given to him some help has really thrown the falcons off yeah and im not taking anything away from the saints defense and what theyve done i think this defense is wrong but im looking at the falcons and all these weapons and <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> talked about all the money that he wanted this is the time for you to step up and make plays third and two ryan deep shock <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> blanketing <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> fourthdown right around midfield we expected some of this mic to take some deep shots on third and short realizing youre gonna go for it on fourth down you talk about the guys not practicing ive got talked to aaron glen their defensive back coach and he said marcia <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> started slowly at the beginning season because he wasnt putting for effort and practice picked up his practice habits now he s playing a lot better again i still think this is where you go to <person player="mohamed sanu" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mohamed sanu</person> <person player="austin hooper" race="white" position="TE">austin hooper</person> got it first down why it s this deafening roar for a moment in front of vaughn bell it s like seattle there were very few stadiums to get this loud these fans know their team has a lead they are bringing it with the noise they made know when to get loud yes the huddle they get louder and obviously when you get the <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> of scrimmage and id like to say the falcons jump in to sum up tempo here youve got a score three times here so it s not too early to start thinking about that does bring whistles please any method <person player="brian hill" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian hill</person> has been in running back last couple of times with a good pressure the pass incomplete intended for barbarin <person player="marvin hall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hall</person> yeah this is the mat tuck we were really hit instead of saying cam jordan on ryan schrader he tries to jump in here probably holding penalty and really at this point <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> you come in with two running bags no one s fallen for the playaction pass because youre down just come out and your normal set three wide receivers youre tight in and throw the ball 42 plays for atlanta 12 runs i can see many of the rest of the way with them try one here toledo strip and vaughn beto was ready for it he and <person player="sheldon rankins" race="UNK" position="DT">sheldon</person> rincon s come up with a tackle for loss yeah this was actually a pass blitz and vaughn bell just runs through unblocked because the wide receiver cant get to him mohammed sinuhe s got him but it s a blitz and he s not going to be able to find them wake up ryan s got space to step up now throws on the reset breaking free is <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> kenny score gavin rudely inside the five itll be first and goal for atlanta brian created some time created some space and a big shot sir <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> 450 here it is mantoman coverage and once the quarterback starts scrambling as a cornerback you have coverage you cant come out of your coverage and that s exactly what marshawn <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> dead which hampton credit <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> moving a little bit extending the play making a play out of the pocket longest play of the game for either team falcons half to get it in in the red zone theyll get four cracks here from the two needles smith is the batter saints pressure up the middle ryan back in the end zone incomplete try to get to <person player="justin hardy" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hardy</person> the 510 receiver so we asked <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> this week about the red zone and <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> not being targeted much he said when you watch film and you see what other people do in the red zone two top receivers okay that s good were doing our due diligence <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> is gonna get treated different here s his red zone numbers only two games he s been targeted in the red zone six everybody else coming into this week 36 so does antonio brown and all of the odell beckham they get into double coverage it comes from the offensive coordinator you have to pass the ball to <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> the man once again there s up top safety hope to the alley it looks that way wait <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> got twisted as he and <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> collided along the goal <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> and will get third down here and one thing i noticed when i watched him practice the safety comes in from the right side so that gives a lot <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">apple</person> a lot of confidence and i like what he s doing he s pushing these plant physicals playing with a lot of confidence that s a flag that stuck three paces off the edge of the green and that ryan said im just going to jam it in there put it in there and get it and he could go you know smith fourth down this is what you miss <person player="devonta freeman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">devonta freeman</person> that tough inside running do you have <person player="mohamed sanu" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mohamed sanu</person> out there he s a six for wide receiver you got to give him at least one opportunity alex oak before the tackle you thought it was loud on this drive before here they come a fourth down fourth rodney <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> put the ball up high form let him count jambalaya if im gonna go down im going down with my best player nasty lil jon maybe if the batter and it s definitely getting doubled here look at the other way he s model look at the other way telamon <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> spikes to the ball in traffic is the seats finally succumb in the red zone as ryan gets his first touchdown of the night nick yeah <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> out here on the right side and theyre not going to let him beat them so this is double coverage hell i can sit outside him matt did a great job of just working adjusting finally finding the guy who was single quickly into all rookies in the nfl touchdown catches now on the season matt brian that s the extra point so he had the eat break out game in game one against new orleans seven catches and three touchdowns on this drive <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> 50 on that speak certain 13 play and then the one that mattered most in the red zone falcons stay alive here late third down 14 from new orleans tonight s aerial coverage proxy by geico joys of this city great food great music wherever you go maybe a lot folks been coming down here for the nfc playoffs saints have the heads head with the ram so they went tonight they go to the one rams go to the about the bears at eight and three they won five in a row cowboys now in first at six and five the wildcard team the others who are knocking on the door new game on sunday night with minnesota and green bay here on nbc fourth quarter begins with a breeze pass that is complete <person player="dan arnold" race="white" position="WR">dan arnold</person> who caught the touchdown a moment ago at the 44 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> the other big game this week guys in the nfc carolina seattle so two games on sunday significance that s impacting that wild card huh mmhmm again <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> this is where <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> is so good rather than take an incompletion here just a fiveyard game but this makes it third and 2 instead of third and seven much much more readily attainable here 20 breeze on the night not prolific 14 of 19 but effective with three touchdowns he did throw his second interception on the season third and two incomplete he tried to get it to <person player="keith kirkwood" race="nonwhite" position="WR">keith kirkwood</person> temple play his third nfl game he couldnt so the falcons defense does what they needed to do chance to get the ball back and make this a one score game this is one of those new receivers you rarely see <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> missed the ball like this where he s got a guy open but just the chemistry is just a little bit off between he and <person player="keith kirkwood" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kirkwood</person> here the rear seat punch came for thomas foster kid a falcons you definitely in his game the penalty marker down morstan could not keep it inside the 10yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> there this flag comes back right after the kick as there was a backandforth with a couple of saints a couple of falcons i should say and the saints <person player="chris banjo" race="UNK" position="DB">chris banjo</person> it was fourth and short often these times are after the kicked fouls so it doesnt affect who has the ball just affects where it is itself on the play both by the receiving team unnecessary roughness 15yard penalty keep the ball down so instead of the touchback and bringing it down theyll back them up around the 10yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> the explanation comes to dan quint <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> a company had a long field to go here and that was <person player="jack crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jack</person> <person player="takkarist mckinley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mckinley</person> he got cut on the punt yeah that s <person player="chris banjo" race="UNK" position="DB">banjo</person> yeah he gets cut and then he gets frustrated guys dont like nobody going at their knees to tell you that but he s got to keep his composure teams still in the game dude she s got a to shows how frustrated they are there s a lot there may be more than flags you get to next week in the league office looks at that the state s offense come back on the field they thought it was gonna be their fall but it was after the kick so the personal foul becomes a half the distance to the goal cuz the ball would have been at the 20th touch bags up atlanta s got 90 to work here to get it down the field after been stripped of the night we faked to new one ryan and and get close to the first down says he worked at the 19:1 chai that first out same play they ran earlier two tight ends trying to go playaction this was all set up trying to get <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> the ball the problem is you go play action youre pure tailback he goes the wrong way good job a man he can play alive gaining yards he s the falcons leading rusher tonight <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> a one of seven and a run of nine he s got to 416 dennis <person player="ricardo allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> told us yesterday that frank s an annoying scrambling his scramble must but when he does just annoys you made a couple of plays with his feet here tonight try to get it to <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> with <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> that matchup weve been watching from the jump tonight yeah and this is the matchup that i was expecting to see right here marshawn <person player="marshon lattimore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lattimore</person> their best cornerback on <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">calvin ridley</person> and really just does an out route outstanding route but it hits him right in their hands he s got to be able to make that catch thought <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> delivered a perfect pass to the outside this is problematic here for the falcons they had not been successful running the football and they go out with an homage to new helmets anew muhammad muhammad soon moon has thrown some touch down so alert for him in the passing game sinu got them to a certain plays asking for the snap here they get it off well wolf just in time sinuhe s gonna run for the first down this owenton gets under the skin of folks and terry i can bring you in terry mccauley because the mechanics here have the official watching the play clock look at the clock and then look at the ball absolutely <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> there s always going to be a slight delay from the time the clock hits zero until he blows the whistle and throws the flag for delay if the ball moves by the time he gets back to this to the ball he s not gonna call it that s what happened here and he saw <person player="pj williams" race="UNK" position="DB">pj williams</person> he was confused he went out and this is really where he would have been at the nickel bag drive stays going and a half gone by in the fourth with the interception wide open inside but the ball got tip and every defender sprint s down for the class picture tell you one thing they do <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> they worked extremely hard this is tyler davidson he gets his hands on it and what you guys say is defensive coordinators tips and overthrows votes yeah <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> breaking up against that double coverage he is open tip ball creates the interception one of those nights from that ryan first interception that he s thrown davidson the deflection <person player="aj klein" race="white" position="LB">klein</person> gets the pick it s his second career interception his first one came with the panthers it has been a night of frustration for this atlanta team that had only turned it over eight times all year three tonight and you see <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> when he gets in the huddle there like that were going right now if this is knockout punch time go on a big folks in like you the wide receiver now danger with the carrot inside take it to the 17yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> on first down a game of five and again most coaches would say hey i can run the ball here pound it in take time off the clock even if i kick a field goal that puts me back up three scores but that s not <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton s mentality youre gonna see a shot play here very quickly to the ends especially with <person player="taysom hill" race="white" position="QB">taysom hill</person> in those laughs every time i see <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> play see it s just a mad scientist with the bigger menus you can find at a latenight diner in jersey him hell here to take the direct snap shoulder down first down <person player="taysom hill" race="white" position="QB">taysom hill</person> to the 8 we saw him yesterday at practice and he is a thick he he is a big kid and as the prominent the falcons have had defensively is tackling this little fake handoff right here but this kid he runs with an attitude he s trying to punish you they actually had to play defendant well they just couldnt get him down his tackles once again it s been playing in atlanta all year phoebe 220 pounds quarterback at byu areas ready to throw it s covered in scrambling hell chase stays alive guys to deliver the blow he s taken down at the 4 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> so mention the 4 4inch speed does this look like quarterbacks body to 21 it s just like tom brady vertical of 38 a half of byu s pro day he took his latterday saint submission so two years before he got into college then was off injured to spent so much time rehabbing and working out got strong went to

more <person player="manti teo" race="white" position="LB">manti teo</person> there arent a lot of two back teams in the league and angeloni stepped up his play in the middle of this growth has played very well third a halfdozen with five rushing sack number five for the seats in the dome tonight and you could almost you can almost see that one coming ryan straighter not no help on this and this is a great counter move by cam jordan the spin ice pick with the left elbow but if you were to run it back why are you chipping the other way youre going to <person player="alex okafor" race="nonwhite"

player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> to complete that pass and i still want to see the falcons go quicker again youve got a sport three times it s not enough to score once with 30 pressure and it is recovered with a flag down late ryan took a lick from dj williams we will deny the field with a fumble recovered by the often and add john huss hell sort the flag clip here giving <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton his options and the referee communication system they can talk to each other and sod judge says push it back personal

position="RB">mike</person> on this play <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> was staring at <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> the linebacker comes out late and just gets in the way he thinks it s a double team and just forces him to hold the ball long enough for <person player="pj williams" race="UNK" position="DB">pj williams</person> to come in there knock it out i tell you one of the things that they worked on in practice a lot of disguising he s seeing different guys move around the dennis <person player="ricardo allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> defense coordinator he is a breslav minded defensive coordinator the <person player="sean harlow" race="white" position="C">sean</person> payton initially accepted the penalty josie s going over for a conversation here was then decided into the second down right it was first in ten see they got to be first at 25 with the penalty penalty it is second down anybody could find more time to deliberate if you wanted to take it or decline it that was those good lawyering 101 body what would you have done i would have turned it down yeah you want the second in 20 take the santa on the sack fumble recovered by falcons the 40 firing put two tested parties that s a blockage cooper on the side speaks to the sidelines the game is six were still on the other side of five minutes so the clock will get restarted once we dive under five getting out of bounds stops the clock until the next now which <person player="steven means" race="UNK" position="DE">means</person> you should be at the <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> move it dont understand that <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> i really dont miss thanksgiving i was trying to say it nicely we did said it s space receivers you got experienced quarterback to play in the super bowl shouldnt be that hard third fourteen here comes that same pressure it s picked up as ryan alive for <person player="calvin ridley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ridley</person> maybe tackled with a 30yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> certainly a ghost spot here fourth and ten portland see thanksgiving night the great sunday night crew finds a positive staff that s why these guys are the best for the business and <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> did frustrate he s trying to get his guys the right guys lined up and out there and it s a personnel exchange i love coming to games in the dome these fans dont quit on it were going to hear brought down poor the pattern pressure coming right up quickly has made great efforts to get close and there s been a lid on that end zone tonight yet another mistake time to play nice tomorrow night on nfl network we follow chris collinsworth journey star receiver the bengals two emmy award winning broadcasters willie the shot of his first broadcast right there a football life cris collinsworth it s a terrific series of shows done by our friends at the nfl network and at 8 oclock tomorrow night and we look forward to watching that from the 41 <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> down 21 seiden picked up first down with seven pullman to the safe side to the 47 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> rather he just said it in the break falcons 3 he fumbles in the in this game a couple that they lost inside the red zone yeah just expected their all offense to come out and really lead this team i was just really surprised at <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> didnt play his best football your seasons on the <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> this is when you expect your best players to deliver here is sinew catching a pass for the first time since the first quarter hell take it to the 41 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> the story of the season for atlanta has been finished their post can they finish and it was within each drive tonight that they couldnt finish as opposed to the entirety night dennis those red zone drives wit de <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> side with 30 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> catch 10 for jones over 120 yards again like a lot of the <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio jones</person> games 10 texas gaudy yardage numbers but no touchdowns yeah and not the place when you needed them the best receivers in the league ryan throws austin who parade will hang on is antimony tackles it at the 19 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> it s a good thing <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> is getting rid of this ball quick because there sam randy jordan is beating brian straighter every single play i dont like the fact that at the beginning of the game they gave the saints the ball really just thought that really set the tone you dont give that one of the best offenses in the league especially <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> the ball first with a shot jonesy 4 yard <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> so technically thatll be a red zone target for <person player="julio jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">julio</person> a couple in this game and now 8 on the season and that takes us inside the twominute warning with a minute 57 to go well a very

yards to this point brian makes it a 14point game with 151 and likely an onside kick coming up so the saints and the touchdowns we talked about having <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person> an elite receiver undrafted tommy lee <person player="tommylee lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">lewis</person> touchdown undrafted to the patriots camp last year

guys he said he was having so much fun just kind of helping them along helping them grow and he said hed trust these guys onside kick here it s been so difficult to recover onside kicks coming in just three of 34 recovered successfully just as the falcons show their hand the timeout is taken by new orleans michele tafoya <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> as in years past were gonna award turkey legs to the players of the game these are good but our traditions gonna get a new twist this year the turkey will be prepared by emeril lagasse the renowned new orleans chef i love that shot at morgan moses of a couple years ago washing digits ripping off that lake well see well see who gets the turkey legs coming up here in a little bit where s that tradition started by the grape john matt but it was the whole trick duncan think it inside the duck inside the turkey and the first time somebody brought madinah turducken was here and he was doing a game in new orleans so the roots so that youre duncan in the turn right here right here on the other side now with the recovery the minute 50 to go perhaps a candidate i think it s easy who gets the

remember them i watched them all a tradition that it s a really elevated thanksgiving guys give me the the state of the world here the falcon to 4 &amp; 7 probably about it for their hopes i think theyre done but i was really impressed with the saints defense tonight if the saints continue to play defense like this nobody s gonna beat them im gonna give a shoutout to the coach dennis <person player="ricardo allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> a defensive coordinator as well as aaron glen their defensive backs coach i thought he did a terrific job at the secondary what game thursday night saints at dallas the plate pittsburgh down the stretch two against carolina so it does not get easy for new orleans we mentioned atlanta at four and seven to be really hard road theyd have to win out to get tonight at seven they stuff to go to green bay they played baltimore next week up in atlanta and they had hopes of hosting the super bowl and mercedesbenz stadium in atlanta but it s going to be a tough road they have to win out and get some help to just make it to the tournament just too many injuries offensively with the guards defensively he moves deon jones and two safeties guys new orleans has the offense thing will be interesting to watch here their defense played well again do they have the best defense of these three and lead offenses with kansas city the rams and the sinks it look like it tonight it plays with a lot of effort and energy and turning the ball over and getting it back for <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> they continue to play this hard a bit tough to be dont sleep on those cowboys that defense is a real deer right there no quarterback meeting more often <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and <person player="matt ryan" race="white" position="QB">matt ryan</person> for the 21st time and <person player="drew brees" race="white"

to show up guys grab a turkey leg and roll agassi maybe you got a go ahead i want to hear who they are scrumptious well we dont have any beverages at the moment but i was just gonna ask drew something but he has a mouth full of turkey so alvin ill start with you how thankful are you for the offensive <person player="zach line" race="white" position="RB">line</person> and what they did for you guys tonight so thankful you know we talk about it every week man they start they set the tempo for our offense in you know without them you know who want to be where we are so thankful for them and you know they bring it every week they dont get they dont get the credit but that deserve it well yeah if we had more turkey they probably here too they drew four touchdown passes each one to went undrafted guy i mean it was really remarkable what made it work well first of all those guys those guys really stepped up we were down some receivers today but those guys stepped up and took advantage of their opportunities and we knew they were going to need to obviously there s a lot of attention on these two and on <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK" position="RB">mike</person> so those guys really stepped up to the challenge and it was really excited for him obviously it was an exciting day for them and great way to bring in the thanksgiving holiday sliding day for the defense as well guys six sacks you forced four turnovers you and two of the sacks had to disrupt your eating here but you dont even eat no nice are we good about to begin you know what people think of the saints as an offensive juggernaut what do you think this defense showed tonight office is a juggernaut but that being said we have to match that intensity and i think tonight we came out with that right mentality the right game plan the ability to execute that game plan and get out to the quarterback and i mean honestly i love this win like i love this turkey here s like in the turkey emerald drew what do you like most about this football team we we care about one another we love coming to work every day we know how to have a good time we also know when it s time to work and get down to

locker room and celebrated with our teammates and just keep stacking up game balls to drew alvin and cameron go ahead take your game balls guys go with you <person player="mike gillislee" race="UNK"
