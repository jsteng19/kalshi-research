============================================================

well michigan has done everything right to in their first two games rolling over vanderbilt in central michigan rolling over is about right because they run the ball really well keeping brad penny<person player="chad henne" race="white" position="QB">chad henne</person>under ass well you know<person player="chad henne" race="white" position="QB">chad henne</person>has not had to do much in those first two ball games when he threw for 113 yards last week but he is capable of doing a lot of strong 50 touchdowns in his michigan career but i think the cute guy in the heart and soul of their team is mike hart indeed a guy that was so disappointed that he get a chance to play much against notre dame last year he s a horse carries the ball 50 times in their first two games he s averaged over a hundred yards and that s a key thing when he gets a hundred yards of the game the wolverines have been 11 and 1 and <person player="tom zbikowski" race="white" position="DB">tom</person> what does that mean that means theyre possessing the clock theyre you know maybe<person player="brady quinn" race="white" position="QB">brady quinn</person>gets 10 or 15
