coming under stuff first down there s the first down for buffalo that s i dont know that s close you know you cant be careful now any time you get your helmet up around the headgear of the quarterback theyre gonna call it like the keyword is defenseless as rob minkoff hits the outside linebacker made contact with <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> well theyve actually changed the rule they said if it s that therell not be fouls unless theyre forcible blows as opposed in that case they miss all <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> s head snap back first content from the new england 44 <person player="cj spiller" race="nonwhite" position="RB">spiller</person> gets the call goes for three as we talked about earlier the patriots with a 15 straight wins against the bills 20 of the last 21 the last went for buffalo in new england opening day of the 2003 season buffalo pd doing with 31 nothing remember lawyer malloy who was dropped by new england in a salary cap move ended up with the bills and he helped spark his new team to the win but since then all new england <person player="david nelson" race="UNK" position="WR">nelson</person> gets down to the 15 an out of 26yard hook up he was pumped out by paki and arrington where he have to keep reminding yourself that you know england the bills felt behind 21 to 3 last weekend got boone on their way to the locker room this team will not give up really nice watson finished right here you think this is not important to a guy like <person player="david nelson" race="UNK" position="WR">david nelson</person> look at that reaction five catches 68 yards per <person player="david nelson" race="UNK" position="WR">nelson</person> first out of the patriot fifteen bring <person player="fred jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jackson</person> picks up for as we have hit the twominute warning two minutes to go in this first half patriots up 21 nothing bills have a second and six at the patriot a lebanon rich as well as new england has played at the offensive end some have been questions defensively giving up a lot of points to both miami and san diego although right here theyre pitching a shutout let s see how the bills who have been very effective in the red zone can do and they still beautiful pass to <person player="stevie johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">stevie johnson</person> on cue is what the bills needed to get back in this game they loved this matchup <person player="stevie johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">stevie johnson</person> on <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> up top starts him inside just enough to get that separation and <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> isnt a good catchable ball in the back of the end zone eighth touchdown pass thrown five <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> brian lyndell on for the extra point while the pills levy the national football league in a red zone deficiency now make it nine scores in 11 trips inside the opponent s 20yard line the monitor coming up on the sprint halftime report at jamie dan shannon gober coach cowher for all the latest nfl scores and

to the touchdown and they needed something positive to happen seven plays theyre sitting really a nice nice first scoring possession there for the bills but they are down 21 to 7 well stay right there theyll bring it out to the 20 tonight on cbs dont miss heavy winter julianna margulies of the season premiere of the good wife catch it on its new night time tonight after the amazing race only cbs and im not saying it because it s a cbs show or this anything been exchanged or youre not getting paid to say one of the premiere show has a good shot television yep youre able to fit that in youre very busy tv viewing i tito i tivo it we should walk down some of the shows those mighty moe it s very small on cbs pretty on the screen has <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">woodhead</person> able to spit his way across the birdie and a flag down it appeared he picked up the first down that s where his phone progress was stopped that called on the personal foul or they talk about playing to the whistle you cant you cant do the old take down on <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> that s nick should know better is a veteran player nineyear vet again penalties really hurting the bills ready to the left flat fighting the <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">woodhead</person> <person player="nick barnett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">barnett</person> fiveyard pickup braid this is a great job communicating in there there no huddle offense certainly the tempo a lot quicker here a twominute situation inside handoff to what half as a first down <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> signed by the patriots after being cut by the jets at averaging five and a half per carry last season on 97 attempts also caught 34 passes has been a very effective player <person player="aaron williams" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron williams</person> able to make the tackle at a timeout is taken now by bill belichick think about the turnovers and how big of a part theyve played in this game so far and i always said that there s one of the better coaches in football and it s a very smart team and you cant afford to turn the ball over and give <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> in this out fence short fields and you mentioned all the penalties committed by by the bills they bet hit six times it s cost them 58 yards patriots only three penalties met at 17 left in this first half brittany first down <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> to get a pretty good shot for the free safety <person player="jairus byrd" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jairus byrd</person> and again the yellow flag comes fly we await the calls and crawled scheffers bill s hit with that personal foul a moment ago i think might see another one theyre trying to decide whether or not <person player="jairus byrd" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jairus byrd</person> bit <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> up by the helmet certainly lead he was leaning leading with his helmet but your safety in this week youve really got a lower than eighty point let s take a listen clarence <person player="kellen heard" race="UNK" position="DT">heard</person> making that contact when you look at <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> and he s only five foot nine and you talk about low in lowering the aiming point youve got to get down real low not to hit <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> up around the helmet first out up the buffalo thirteen <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">woodhead</person> remains in the backfield he was covered by brian scott and apparently scott came away with it <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">logan mankins</person> not happy somewhere you gotta cheat shot what s amazing if you just miss a little bit you watch where this ball comes in very difficult kits for <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">woodhead</person> that s a big play by the safety brian scott they needed something positive to happen before halftime scott at his ninth season out of penn state originally a second round pick of atlanta 5th year with buffalo so the pills come away with a turnover and they take possession at the 10 where the death is just the second interception in his last 444 past attempts a little bit of a fastball very difficult catch there in the flat playings blows did second charge timeout in new england a 30second timeout while the patriots calling for chime and we will step away and at five remaining in this first half buffalo first content from there ten by virtue event interception by scott <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> with the time and it s brought across the 25 yard line by <person player="david nelson" race="UNK" position="WR">david nelson</person> buffalo a 30second time how the pills call for time ball spotted at the 26 well buffalo last week came from way back trailing oakland 21 three here in their home opener has a long way to go here against the club like new england but these are the largest halftime deficits that the bills in the history of the franchise have been able to overcome yeah i think the biggest difference from even from last year the experience in this offense and also the attitude this team is confident and as chan gailey told us on friday when you win it breeds confidence with the <person player="sam young" race="white" position="OT">young</person> football team first out from the pills 26 the table to go underneath the johnson takes it out of bounds to stop the clock with 50 seconds remaining <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> on the coverage well the thing i know about <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> he doesnt care if he threw a couple interceptions zero in the game he s a bit of a gunslinger and that s kind of his mentality he s gonna keep throwing it keep taking shots and he will play for four quarters they believe that <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> is the key to getting this thing turned around in buffalo looking at a second <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> on the coverage of <person player="stevie johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">stevie johnson</person> well he had a chance right here you look at the top of your screen and a better throw maybe he gets it done here he s got actually <person player="donald jones" race="UNK" position="WR">donald jones</person> has got to come back and wait on that one it gives mccarty a chance to catch back up and make the play <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> had an outstanding rookie season last year seven interceptions made it to the pro bowl he has struggled over the first two games with bigger receivers brandon marshall vincent <person player="fred jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jackson</person> it s all about consistency with <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> <person player="donald jones" race="UNK" position="WR">donald jones</person> made the catch drillbit pounds has a first down <person player="sergio brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sergio brown</person> the safety with the coverage and jones did get out of bounds where we talk about arm strength look at a jam this one in here and we always saves you wait youre late but brian <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> puts a little mustard on that throw that <person player="donald jones" race="UNK" position="WR">donald jones</person> picked up eight first down at the 41 with 40 seconds remaining in the half and now goes to the other side and it was almost intercepted at jennifer <person player="donald jones" race="UNK" position="WR">donald jones</person> who was covered by <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> who already has picked off two balls here on the first half yeah and a little beat up right now in the secondary patrick hung out with that thumb injury and <person player="rasi dowling" race="UNK" position="DB">dowling</person> out didnt did dress today and had to bring up a bunch of <person player="sam young" race="white" position="OT">young</person> players in the back end and theyre gonna use them all you look at how buffalo wants to play they feature three and four wide receiver sets playing for traction spinning his way 27 yards of that way well here s where i think <person player="fred jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred jackson</person> can be so dangerous he s a very good screen runner because he s patient and he allows the offensive line to get out in front and then you have some linemen that can really run and get downfield to get a good look and reinhardt there and <person player="eric wood" race="white" position="C">eric wood</person> and chan gailey loves to utilize the screens he has a ton of them hell throw them to the receivers to the tight ends and as well to the backs buffalo taking a timeout to stop the clock they have one remaining patriots have one timeout left well when <person player="fred jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred jackson</person> gets rolling this team usually wins and he s a very good player we talked about it being a physical runner i just think he s excellent in the passing game not only in terms of his ability to catch the ball but to sit in there and be a protector for <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> first and ten from the 32 here is <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> s pass intended for johnson brown was looking for a call is leave baden and <person player="stevie johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">stevie johnson</person> came together but no flag well they really feel like they can go after this secondary with the quick receivers on the outside <person player="donald jones" race="UNK" position="WR">donald jones</person> and <person player="stevie johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">stevie johnson</person> they like the matchups with baden and <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mccourty</person> youve got to beat them youve got to win the oneonone battles against this new england defense a majority of their coverage is going to be mantoman down a 19 psycho man <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> and tended her jones brian trying to anticipate that out cut i thought he had an extra second to wait the receivers are really doing a nice job for buffalo theyre getting separation just cant miss those throws you got to remember youre <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> youre in field goal range though turnovers are sacks in this part of the field youve got to be smart on third down this would be a 49 or 50 yard attempt patrick completes he has jones picked up eight short of a a first out it is a fourth and two that the bills will use their final timeout field goal unit will will come on ryan lind l three of four on the season one miss was a 39 yard attempt it was blocked last week yeah this is this is a good drive for the bills nice two minute drive and you know come away with the field goal here you go into the locker room at halftime with some momentum and then you come out in the second half and you start with the ball this about a 42yard attempt with the angle to the left third and final charge timeout now the patriots take a timeout a little early there one done usually they wait until just before the center is ready to snap the ball trying to ice the thoughts of riot lindo raised a very good kicker youve got to be a good kicker to kick here in buffalo you think about once the leaves start falling off the trees and the snow starts to come and the wind starts to blow it s a lot of kickers that dont want to kick here in buffalo half a lyndell it s his ninth season here at western new york after three years with seattle 42yard attempt with eight seconds to play in the half that was nearly blocked in his girth so the three points put up the results of the interception on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> with brian scott making that sensational play both outfits is doing a really good job of taking advantage of the turnovers you saw how the patriots started the day with two interceptions from their defense they go right in and convert them to scores and then brian <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> and his crew able to take advantage of a rare <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> mistake and the part of the field wednesday showtime jb cris collinsworth phil simms warrants at return cables longest running show it s inside the nfl every wednesday rich that s an unusually happy group yeah it is it s an eclectic group yeah got lauren s app in there buffalo scored the last 10 points following the on answer 21 by new england just three seconds to go in the half a dominance later our pack for the kickoff and it s picked up by one of the upend time running out think of hitch able to come up with that loose ball so halftime here in buffalo both quarterbacks putting up big numbers again and the patriots trying to make that 16 straight over the bills going back to opening day of 2003 and they have a 21 gently back with a sprint halftime report after this message and a word from your local
