============================================================

it s firsthalf highlights are brought to you by nationwide official sponsor of the nfl pass in for a touchdown deep and there s brian touchdown enjoy touchdown nationwide is on your side because the winner of the division obviously with at least at worst posts a wild card game and the way things are going right now if you finished second in this division you may not get into the playoffs even with 11 victories and the cowboys cannot win the division if they have the same number of wins as digital so doubly important for the dallas cowboys tonight and down in the end zones is harrison well for <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> has been involved in a few plays even before the game <person player="malcolm jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> he s been working on the outside against <person player="bradley fletcher" race="UNK" position="DB">bradley fletcher</person> with great success and you have to remember that it was carrie williams two fouls that kept alive the two touchdown drives for the dallas cowboys as well so both corners have had a big role here in the first half of this one and let s see what <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> decides to do here on this drive in the third quarter had good balance to this point we start with <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> the league s leading rusher for a gain of five to the 25 when we check in on the show well <person player="dennis kelly" race="UNK" position="OT">kelly</person> told me he thought he they did a pretty good job defending dallas s run but they gotta stop <person player="jason witten" race="white" position="TE">jason witten</person> on third down he converted three of them and also they need to sustain drives offensively that s for jason garrett he thought they kept up with philadelphia s pays pretty well he said they just plan to mix it up more defensively here in the second half i thank you michelle the according to tell me did a pretty good job amari they have 15 carries 51 yards so he s averaging about three and a half toad and here he goes again bottled up again doing a good job on the dallas run game weve got <person player="jermey parnell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">parnell</person> in it right tackle for the 78 damn for <person player="doug free" race="UNK" position="OT">free</person> they have rotated in the past i dont know if that s what s going on here or if something happened but of experience in this three games earlier the season with a foot injury third down and six now and that a flag was the eagles came across vinnie <person player="vinny curry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">curry</person> all start offense number 83 fiveyard penalty he was drawn off his terrence williams was the first to move parks about it i dont know that benny fries saw <person player="terrance williams" race="UNK" position="WR">terrance williams</person> on the outside but so he just got safe he did there s williams flinched mary way himself then he <person player="vinny curry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">curry</person> no way saw that so got everybody on that makes you a third down at 11 from the 19 yard line six bbs in the game got a flag two flags in fact terrence williams terry williams was back there covering bow number three yep and it s going to be defensive pass interference defense number 26 automatic first down all he has to do is get his head around and he could have made the play on the ball would not have been interference he s in great position the defense number 23 in that penalties decline down the field just turned your head around here you can have contact at that point but if the heads not around youre not allowed to do that good call by the officials so a third down and 11 becomes a 40 yard penalty well i tell you it is kept alive two touchdown drives already and who knows this could be a third from the phillies 41 yard line <person player="dwayne harris" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harris</person> kosovo client was wide left bottle them up again for a loss and chicken once more in the show well <person player="doug free" race="UNK" position="OT">doug free</person> as you mentioned is not in on the game right now he is questionable with the right angle in jewelry he s on the sidelines without a helmet heavily taped around that ankle and you know limping quite a bit al so right now not in there there he is we saw on the sideline michelle so <person player="jermey parnell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">parnell</person> is in there now a fifthyear guy out of this is sipping and right tapping while he tried to go that way to no avail on that last one second down and 11 under pressure they get to just got a thump off the knock them down take them out of the 50 yard line for the sack we talked about <person player="fletcher cox" race="nonwhite" position="DT">fletcher cox</person> a little bit earlier in this game and going through both <person player="jermey parnell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">parnell</person> and <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> here doesnt get there but horses <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> to step up and when he does he trips over his own man sort of auto sacks himself on <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone</person> smith were going to give the sack to <person player="cedric thornton" race="UNK" position="DT">thornton</person> a bit of a gift but well take it then it makes a third down on 19 way clock at one the pushing again he s a terry williams terrence williams i think that one might be on terrence williams pass interference offense number 83 was the fine work that good job officiating there that time completely opposite of like kerry williams had done in the past gets his head around terrence williams tried to push him off and died really not a bad effort by terrence williams why not youre sitting out there and third and a million and you never know sometime you get away with it and a fourth in a million for them 19 <person player="chris jones" race="white" position="P">chris jones</person> bearcats gold ford made by schools at the 14 eleven and a half to go in the third quarter status by draw tuesday dont miss the voice live finale the voice all comes down to your vote the voice live finale tomorrow tuesday on nbc both nights comcast a spectacle hearing philadelphia in fact become too broad and patterson <person player="devin street" race="UNK" position="WR">street</person> sounds philadelphia lincoln financial field philadelphia with its first possession of the second half starting from a 40yard line and it s a two yard game for <person player="lesean mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lesean mccoy</person> second and eight see how the play calling works jim <person player="dennis kelly" race="UNK" position="OT">kelly</person> and the <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> and then it s all the individual coaches to their individual positions so they can go this fast well take you to the 19 yard line one more time <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce carter</person> makes the stop third down if <person player="dennis kelly" race="UNK" position="OT">kelly</person> s ready right away but here he needs to make a substitution which is going to allow the cowboys so youll see the pump fire now hold the snap he will hold the snap see if the cowboys want a substitute they do not so theyre ready for play we stay with the base defense scores comes in for the eagles have stirred down in five from the 19 yard line macklin comes in motion to the inside were a first that what <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">carter</person> gambled on him trying to cut in front a ticket or at least the fleck did instead it s a first down of macklin <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce carter</person> was right there if he reaches over and touches him there all he does right there the fall is going to be down i thought it might have been short but just enough an immaculate second catch of the night 460 yards is a leading receiver fires over the middle wall and incomplete flag is tended receiver was macula very <person player="barry church" race="nonwhite" position="DB">church</person> going to get called for a hold it is this is like a <person player="lane johnson" race="white" position="OT">lane</person> that s number 42 fiveyard penalty automatic first down well weve seen three penalties on carey williams tonight that is the first penalty on <person player="barry church" race="nonwhite" position="DB">church</person> all season it s his arms wrapped around good call by the officials this is this is like an old school football game this is the way the game used to be played when you could do be a little physical down the field move it out to the parking lot boring tries to dance around and it s smothered by <person player="terrell mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="DT">terrell</person> mclean it s going to be interesting to see if the lead makes any adjustments to that fiveyard bump rule in the offseason because what we have sure seeing a lot of those flags this season mmhmm probably to money yeah i would say so too comes the face again second down and 11 overthrown that incomplete branding far covering matlin can you see that card that there isnt we asked chip <person player="dennis kelly" race="UNK" position="OT">kelly</person> what is se mean what does it mean you wouldnt give it up no weve been as <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> what he doesnt know what it means he didnt know so it s obviously not part of the game planning but and it changes it s not the same every year kids for halloween they takes si to the halloween party reason third and 11 <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> able to step up to buy time and then it smack them down a sideline transient by <person player="jj wilcox" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilcox</person> with a block from matthews get in theyre going to rule him down at the oneyard line wow that ball came out too and it was close theyre marking it down it s 72 yard philadelphia doesnt want dallas to have the opportunity to challenge to they race down to the field they race down and he was down there s the challenge lap becomes that but did he get it out in time and the official coming in saying yes he did yeah so garrett looking for something from upstairs meanwhile they sprinted down the field 70 yards through the eagles to try to get the play off before it could even be challenged the first look i thought his knee was down at 72 yards on a third and 12 there s the elbow down he s reaching he is down right there the only question at that point is was it a touchdown or not dallas s challenged at the rumrunner fumbles and they clearly recovered time out well they did but we think he was down at the oneyard line and it should be a first and goal when we come back after here the ruling on the field has confirmed the runner was down by contact dallas is charged with their first screen timeout bilbo was down the only thing that could have overturned on that they could have called it a touchdown right but by sprinting down the field the philadelphia eagles now forced jason garrett to use one of his timeouts which could come back to haunt later no doubt she s clearly down it could have been the double whammy they lose the challenge and a good of the touchdown this far they can get his right hand in there and macklin s off to the races 272 <person player="brandon carr" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon carr</person> has not had a good year and he is a bigmoney cornerback for the cowboys sir smoke is the running back he s already scored a touchdown tonight and make it a pair what s that eagle 17 unanswered points that is after the extra point upcoming it s going to make it a four point game after the conversion <person player="jason peters" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jason peters</person> right there just wiping down the entire side of the line of scrimmage big strong physical and boy i tell you what the dallas cowboys dont even want to think about blowing to their archrivals in this kind of december situation to go in the third before next week the super bowl champion seahawks go to the desert to take on the arizona cardinals before life begins at 7:00 eastern time on the cardinals will clinch a playoff spot tonight unless this game ends in a tie arizona 11 and 300 job these aliens sunday night seattle arizona the one back here to the 16 yard <person player="dwayne harris" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harris</person> back we go to the pace to mecklen <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> watch him he s going to glance right see what he has with macklin comeback square up the safety now go back there for the big touchdown and for <person player="brandon carr" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon carr</person> in his own defense you cannot undercut that play unless you are a hundred percent sure that youre going to get there because there s nobody left the entire side of the field is gone youre the deep bird there you cannot take that chance unless you are positive joined us late it was 21 nothing dallas the eagles have scored 17 on points weve got some ballgame escape some wouldbe sack throws corn on the outside by hannah and the number three tie then dean 12 what your put the heat on <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> but tony escaped that time first down that is <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> and his finest right there this is what he can do comes completely unblocked their best interior pass rusher <person player="fletcher cox" race="nonwhite" position="DT">fletcher cox</person> he spins out of it and instead of a 10yard sack and maybe a fumble they pick up a first down spinning against the green as he s done so magnificently through his career from the 27 yard line you clearly start through a false start false start offense number nine fiveyard penalty first down <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> himself coming out before the snap boy this is just setting up isnt it these two arch rivals and to have the cowboys out to 21 nothing lead in the newspaper today and the philadelphia enquirer there was action figure cartoon it said warning choking hazard in the cartoon well those are tough <person player="devin street" race="UNK" position="WR">street</person> first at fifteen from the 22 the backfield <person player="malcolm jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm jenkins</person> safety coming up <person player="malcolm jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm jenkins</person> has just become such an important part of this defense when tamiko ryan s their main signal caller went out he became the de facto leader of this defensive team he s the guy that gets upset he s the guy that s forced into tough man coverage situations theyre just a lot the first half or more throwing he was covered by terry williams so terence cant handle it third down and 19 next i asked <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> why havent you thrown more falls at <person player="terrance williams" race="UNK" position="WR">terrance williams</person> lately and he said he hasnt been open and on third down and on big downs i go to <person player="jason witten" race="white" position="TE">jason witten</person> goto pulled easy and i go the guys i can trust but right now kerry williams after a tough first half coming up big here in the second at a time from behind is it alive wall yes <person player="vinny curry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">curry</person> came from behind the sack fumbled and the philadelphia recovery you gotta wonder is the tuck rule in play here never saw moe tries to pull that down all the way back into his body it s automatically reviewed because it s a turnover <person player="fletcher cox" race="nonwhite" position="DT">fletcher cox</person> comes up with a recovery had at least six seven seconds and nobody can get open down the he s brought the ball back to his body and therefore it is a fumble so that is confirmed and the ball of the 14 <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> extra quiet and hands the ball off to <person player="lesean mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mccoy</person> who takes the ball inside the 10 flag down he s down at the 8 yard line after the play personal foul unnecessary roughness defense on the 97 pharrell mcclane play is clearly over there and mcclain comes over and the official couldnt miss it the player is not dead dog wow what a turnaround this has been and it looks like the cowboys are just unraveling here so first and goal at the floor with an escort bang databound short of the goal line with a moment <person player="anthony hitchens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">anthony hitchens</person> is there to save the touchdown that looked like it was going to be a walk in didnt and then the <person player="anthony hitchens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">anthony hitchens</person> a young rookie who has been so effective playing all three linebacker positions it s there just in time makes it a second down and goal and swells boulton the game it comes falls into the backfield spoils to the outside he goes touchdown eagles how about this one let s <person player="lesean mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lesean mccoy</person> lead block he s a fullback now he was the leading rusher in the league last year you say why cant you play <person player="lesean mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lesean mccoy</person> and <person player="darren sproles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren sproles</person> in the backfield together well neither one were gonna block john <person player="lesean mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mccoy</person> just played a heck of a block on the edge there scrolls with his six rushing touchdown very with a discus thrower the ice a 21point deficit has turned into a threepoint lead for the eagles up something a football little bit of happier seen in owner jeffrey lurie s box at one point twenty one month in balance now 24 21 philadelphia and the run back here to the 22 yard line fort greene <person player="dwayne harris" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harris</person> <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> let that long drive earlier and of course it s a different story with governor chris christie of new jersey who is the lifelong dallas cowboy fan to the consternation of john mara and jeff morena everybody else on both sides of the garden state so be it texas vote from the 22yard line the dallas cowboys so i went for the first time in the this is marie nice job by <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> he s now carried the ball at a total of 19 times for 47 yards that sold less than three yards per carry starting to get back to the way the first game was and really since <person player="doug free" race="UNK" position="OT">doug free</person> went out of the game we have not seen whatever success they had running the football to that right side been tough shutting sense five minutes in the third second down fires over the middle caught at the 40 yard line <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> who has scored two touchdowns tonight takes the ball out to the 45 yard line nice route by <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> down the field theyve got kendrick sitting in here in the middle of the field as a lurker they threw right over the top of him this has been getting a lot of double coverage tonight but now when everything is on the line and your team is struggling you go back to your superstars and that s <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> let s uh me lined up to the right now he comes into the slot on the let s get coming run well get to the way it s picked up a first down that s an 11yard gain to the 44 yard line that was michael <person player="mychal kendricks" race="UNK" position="LB">kendricks</person> that came on the blitz and got a good shot on <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> so theyre starting to get some hits on <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> weve seen him limping around just a little bit looking a little ginger he comes up inside and we want to see <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> on the ground as much as possible bang that birthday stop england one maybe to go back to thanksgiving day inhale tony rojo and that one clearly didnt take the shot you can see could get nothing into that through some floating interceptions tonight he s been much sharper crisper you see a little bit more torque on those throws driving it out of there <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> and has something started with this product 44 second down and meet maria again and this side marie takes off marie inside the 25yard line to the 20 priestley finally is able to break one tackle there by <person player="malcolm jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> first down dallas it s a gain of 21 yards for <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco</person> good blocking here good blocking here <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> gets <person player="vinny curry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vinny</person> <person player="bennie logan" race="nonwhite" position="DT">logan</person> pinned down inside and <person player="ronald leary" race="UNK" position="OG">leary</person> just tenacious on that block on bear and really good running by <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person> that time would have been easy to try to bounce that one he did a little too much of that against chicago stayed on the path and came up with a big 23 yard line and that cut in fact close that <person player="lane johnson" race="white" position="OT">lane</person> and the hurried benny <person player="bennie logan" race="nonwhite" position="DT">logan</person> right there to stop him second and 11 the real key to play in this stretch for vinnie <person player="bennie logan" race="nonwhite" position="DT">logan</person> is to keep his shoulders square dont let those offensive linemen get uturned he played that perfectly that time they want him sliding down the line with his shoulders square all the way down the line there is which allowed them to get back off of <person player="ronald leary" race="UNK" position="OG">leary</person> and make the play in the backfield five receivers caught inside the 10yard line <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bryant</person> to the to the set of a first down and goal his fourth reception of the night two of those have been four touchdowns think they were trying to double with the inside guy running out under <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez</person> and he ends up kind of running underneath if that was <person player="brandon boykin" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon boykin</person> but two in cuts now to <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> has this offense back on track what a huge drive this has been because it looked like everything was going against the cowboys that s good for a gain of 22 this drive started at the damaged 22 first and goal from the team draw the maria takes the ball into the endzone and so the dallas cowboys who blew a 21point lead now take the lead again and the extra point will make it a fourpoint advantage what a game what a game see it time after time whenever they need key yardage short yardage situations third ones goal line they go behind the two young players <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> inside great running there but we have to give a lot of credit to <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> and <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> on that drive where their team desperately needed them and they delivered and <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> broke off at 21 yard run they ran the ball five times through it three times go 78 yards in a little over five minutes be point after and the dallas cowboys in the final minute of the third quarter lead philadelphia 2824 we got a skirmish here well sooner or later

and breaking <person player="doug free" race="UNK" position="OT">free</person> is cherished puffs at par track him down but not until he reaches midfield and behind so a second down and 21 and <person player="josh huff" race="UNK" position="WR">huff</person> makes a huge play this is a young man that was hurt early in the year and a lot of people wondered why he hasnt had a bigger role a bigger one heir apparents deep that substitute number 55 your penalty added banana deployed perfect and that s the dallas sideline so there he goes sideline interference is what the call was if the referee cant run freely down the boundary and runs into a player or a coach in that white marked off area then it is a foul and usually it happens on plays like that when they break away and that s <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">carter</person> on the bench here s <person player="josh huff" race="UNK" position="WR">huff</person> it s it s 44 yard over here s mcclain right there on the sideline impeding the official so they marked it off down on the 32 yard line and the eagles <person player="lesean mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mccoy</person> for a gain of one mclain makes the tackle you just wonder where the cowboys would have been this season without <person player="rolando mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">rolando mcclain</person> of course shawn lee injured a nonfactor this year <person player="rolando mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">rolando mcclain</person> out of football a year ago they make a preseason trade to get him and he hasnt been the man he really runs this defense they say he is the intellectual bog out there the fame it s too high natives are sellers old weve bluebirds coming out on that one pretty wide open was selleck here you know ill be able to hit that one course every third then now becomes pretty vital third down and nine if they were stymied here and hard ill kick a field goal first of all philadelphia takes a timeout so each is used one you know chris you brought up that the philadelphia inquirer action figure the <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> cartoon there was also a column written by mike seale ski today one of the calm is talking about if the defensive backs dont have a decent night in particular <person player="bradley fletcher" race="UNK" position="DB">bradley fletcher</person> look out that was quite prescient yeah and and it really is because you know what youre going to get with the philadelphia eagles defensively theyre going to challenge you theyre going to play that man coverage and eventually somebody has to take <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> and tonight since brian has just been too much reflection on the outside a sketch there and it s been this same place twice over for touchdowns at about the same spot on the field before the game even starts now third and nine here comes the blitz the pass is caught but short of the first down to the 25 yard line that s at first so it s got a kick 1 2 3 i think you do because it s you make it an 11point game and an eightpoint game so it s still a onepossession game and a lot of time as weve already seen from this eagles offense they have the ability to fly up and down the field in a hurry 11 minutes to go there are not afraid of that kind of lead this would be a 43yard attempt to your <person player="cody parkey" race="nonwhite" position="K">cody</person> parky and his kick is good attack on three more make it a onepossession 3527 then i football brought to you by walmart where youll find unbeatable prices on this year s top gifts by at&amp;t mobilizing your world by nissan innovation that excites and by pepsi hike your hometown with pepsi at etsy calm before instead a spherical works by artists like wendell the cultural matisse were you with the pink line numbers really good stick figures only my bad me too cotton on the top it s filled it on the wrong green <person player="dwayne harris" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harris</person> and the reach dashboard it s popped out of bounds at the 20yard line these two guys <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> and <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bryant</person> the centerpieces of that offense gaining more than 60% of the yards from scrimmage to go back to tiki barber and flex to go burris back in oh 5 and tonight 83 rushing yards two tvs for <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> and langley 9 receiving yards three touchdowns for <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> so they have accounted for the 35 that was points i remember talking to <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez</person> earlier in the year he said hey we heard all the people make and find the dallas cowboys this offseason it motivated us it helped us train in the office or they could hang on the brink of doing something great the you know of course it s the first time we get the second let s go to michelle right now well eagles linebacker <person player="trent cole" race="nonwhite" position="LB">trent cole</person> went to get an xray on his left hand alveus questionable <person player="brandon graham" race="nonwhite" position="DE">brandon graham</person> has replaced him for the time being all right thank you michelle <person player="brandon graham" race="nonwhite" position="DE">graham</person> number 55 and there he is good fewer linebacker of the michigan who s the number one pick back in 2010 yeah no dropoff there they rotate three guys on the outside the issue now for the eagles defensively is theyve already defended 63 plays i think it was 84 85 against seattle the running game might be more effective for the cowboys here late the cowboys 64th play and it s <person player="lance dunbar" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunbar</person> well take the longer the 29 setting up a key third and one you know chris talking about there s the the guys feeling a little bit disrespected like a lot of players do but it s the first time in five years i can remember the cowboys very little was expected to them theyre always underperforming and this year theyre over performance that the expectations were i think even jerry jones made the comment that well we may not be so good and you know i mean i think he was wondering what kind of ballclub he was going to have but i think the choice <person player="zach ertz" race="white" position="TE">zach</person> barton this offensive line way they play three straight years of eight <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate</person> last year this contract here is more stop the ball excellent if this is coming in from the side it s going to be a little bit short of the first down big big stop clock ticks down under nine minutes and theyre forced to punt here in the middle they tried to go right behind there to young star offensive lineman and just dont get there what a huge stop by the eagles defensively now <person player="darren sproles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren sproles</person> who can be electrifying weve been watching him through the years back to receive jones since the tip toward the far sideline bulls collection with a fair catch at the 23 yard line each on the court that was five eight all right so what happens if you put viveca a fox or ombre rivera and <person player="terrell mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="DT">terrell</person> owens in a room together looking fine back on the premiere of the celebrity apprentice <person player="donald hawkins" race="UNK" position="OT">donald</person> j trump premiering january the 4th right here on nbc right now justice start from the 23 and this time begin to the run at least seven yards by shading the koi up to the 30yard line second and three remember <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> has played in two afc championship games with the jets oh he is used to this kind of pressure second and three for you again a boy with some room flag down up to the 37 a pair of flags at the 30yard line holding offense number 62 10yard penalty second down that s the center jason cosi and there goes the first down now <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce carter</person> tried to flip around him and he just reached out with that right arm right here youll see his <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">carter</person> goes around the back side he reaches out with that right arm and that hurts back to second down second and 13 now walk on the move under that menace the blitz get up the pass is caught that s a first down that s <person player="brent celek" race="white" position="TE">brent celek</person> over the middle the ball taken away from him but the play was over foul wilbur came away with the ball but it belongs to philadelphia let s see ball he s moving did anything get to the ground were gonna have a challenge i think so jason garrett he s already challenged once so this is his final challenge he of course lost that challenge so theyre down to two timeouts theyll be down a wanted to lose this one humbled proud of being down by contact the ball was moving and he landed on top of the defender if see where it goes were back in dallas is going to wind up with the ball because the runner was on top of a cowboy you got selleck here he goes down on <person player="jj wilcox" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilcox</person> he never hits the ground the ball comes loose it s recovered by wilburn right now theyre just checking to see where to spot the ball but dallas is going to get the ball on the turnover here the runner lost control the football prior to being down by contact it will be first down for dallas at the 34 yard line police set the game clock to seven minutes 48 seconds so garrett is not charged with the timeout not charged at the timeout that s their last challenge though because they lost the first one he never touches the ground not a knee not an elbow forearm nothing and for <person player="jj wilcox" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jj wilcox</person> that is the second big turnover he s been involved in and for selleck that s one of those bizarre plays you would say i was down but because there was somebody underneath him he wasnt down so the cowboy was already within long field goal range that make it to of they get any points here they start this drive from the 34 yard line if klutz of the game of fullback here goes marie to the outside and it s another lost <person player="brandon graham" race="nonwhite" position="DE">brandon graham</person> tackles him behind the line of scrimmage loss of two second down and 12 <person player="brandon graham" race="nonwhite" position="DE">brandon graham</person> has had a sensational year he really is he s sort of a role player five and a half sacks but when you try and run to his side he s like a bowling ball over there they almost tried to convince him to lose weight to play outside linebacker they so forget it just play it the way you like it and so that graphic fewest turnovers in philly history nineteen last year this year 32 ton overs already in this game of the 14 most in the lead clock at three second and 12 <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> wide open making the catch <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> you tonight continues to the 21 and a first down obviously just a completely blown coverage nobody on <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez</person> a turn and run out here and here s the guys been killing you all night there s not anybody within 20 yards tough night for the defensive backs of the philadelphia eagles six catches 114 yards and <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> can begin to work on the timepiece right now under six and a half to play annmarie tackles for another loss behind the line of scrimmage again <person player="brandon graham" race="nonwhite" position="DE">brandon graham</person> sally this guy s been doing this all season long sneaks inside <person player="tyron smith" race="UNK" position="OT">tyron smith</person> and go makes a play in the backfield desperately need it because we would love to see <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> i was going to say hed love to see him put the ball in the air but the way it s been going in the secondary maybe not well theyve done a good job on <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> theyre not accept that 121 yard scamper nine carries 82 yards it s less than three yards per carry these receivers now second and 14 again milt oclock fires eventually flag is down marco bari held in the backfield holding offense number 29 yard penalty second down only michael hendrickson theyre in danger of getting back out of field goal range here yeah he had a nice initial block but then as kendrick started to <person player="doug free" race="UNK" position="OT">free</person> himself <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> just grabbed him over here second motion right there he s the one he got called for so second down in 24 right now youd be looking at a 53yard field court visual negative twopossession lead has to go on an in cut and third and long williams terry williams covering on the play third and twentyfour and now i think theyre starting to follow with kerri williams theyve seen enough of <person player="bradley fletcher" race="UNK" position="DB">bradley fletcher</person> on <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> so that s the first time all night weve seen kerry williams across the field so what do you do here man im going through a 10 or 12 yard dallas to get daily set up you need five or six yards to get that second score under pressure look at shovel pass to the 31 to whitman so they aint a few they get four and that s going to set up about a 48 49 yard attempt for <person player="dan bailey" race="white" position="K">bailey</person> to try to make it an 11 point game not an issue he has a longer 56 yards 506 from over 50 so plenty of range here just couldnt take the sack good job by <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> escaping of course if he misses this one in philadelphia well get the ball in its own 39yard and <person player="dan bailey" race="white" position="K">bailey</person> is 3 for 3 huge field goal 437 play in regulation 38 27,000 the fans order your holiday gifts are manifold shop calm today save 20% of the official store of the nfl ive already got you a couple of gifts a couple of couple of books im going to send it over this beautiful they might be now to be top 10 best sellers right on dont want to write a shakespeare first was one a week from thursday it s down in the end zones as the eagle is now down by 11 points 437 then they have two timeouts as we head down the stretch how about <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> though now on the road 18 touchdowns one interception remarkable three touchdown passes tonight all of them to <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> meanwhile <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> now 15 of 24 started cold a couple of real nice drives and then erased a 21point deficit im going to see the cowboys come back retake the lead starts this drive with the past macklin is out of bounds right the mortar <person player="brandon carr" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon carr</person> after giving up that long one down the field now is giving plenty of cushion here so <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> is going to be able to take some of those short quick ones and this offense has enough pace to it you dont have to really change what youre doing from the 30 and pump fakes then throws deep downfield and <person player="riley cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">riley cooper</person> is there that s incomplete and the cowboys cover on the play and <person player="sterling moore" race="UNK" position="DB">sterling</person> more reaches for his back and is down on the grass tie to the pump fake oh my gosh everybody <person player="barry church" race="nonwhite" position="DB">barry church</person> down as well injury timeout itll be second down and 10 for dallas and also the game that cowboys took at 21 but nothing lead before philadelphia s score 24 unanswered points but then the cowboys rally <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> the careerhigh 3 touchdown <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person> into the twice himself and the cowboys right now up by 11 and second down and 10 more in <person player="barry church" race="nonwhite" position="DB">church</person> bolt shakin on the last play bolt out for the moment and <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> gets bottled up and taken down at the 26 yard line so he hung in the pocket and then <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> and jeremy minty are both there for the sack here s the coverage down the field of course car now in a much better position burt s going across the field maybe a shot im a little surprised they didnt take a look at tyler patman with <person player="riley cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">riley cooper</person> at the bottom he was the replacement didnt even check that side 14 were in <person player="barry church" race="nonwhite" position="DB">church</person> or both back in the game and that change is going to get sacked at the 13 yard line by jeremy minzy and that s the fourth sack of the night for the dallas cowboys <person player="jason peters" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jason peters</person> is coming out right here and he expects <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> to step up and when <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> goes backwards all the leverage goes away at that point so you have to just take a couple sacks and i guess youd say i dont want to step up in there anymore so <person player="jeremy mincey" race="UNK" position="DE">mincey</person> gets credit for the sack it s fourth down and 25 <person player="donnie jones" race="white" position="P">donnie jones</person> the low liner this bear caught at the 41 yard line so 309 remaining philadelphia can stop the clock twice plus the time out of the twominute warning and an 11point game and what would be i believe the biggest win of jason garrett s career if he could come out of here with one to see his football team that has been known for falling apart in december <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> who has been known for key interceptions late in the year that has hurt this team to see them blow a 21point lead and then go right back down the field retake the lead not lose their composure was huge for this organization from the 40yard line because for them every time hardly had to be a genius to figure that <person player="fletcher cox" race="nonwhite" position="DT">fletcher cox</person> makes the tackle and philadelphia will take a timeout that s the eleventh time tonight that <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> has been held for either no gain or negative yardage it s a tough bunch up there it really is and weve been talking about it all night they did the same thing the difference in this game really was the fact that <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> got something going with the passing game and his mobility the difference in his mobility in this game and what he was on thanksgiving day is ninth day and it probably should have been playing on sunday night come right back to a thursday he wasnt ready he usually doesnt even practice until thursday he skips wednesday practice usually practices for the first time on thursday he just wasnt ready to play second and ten marie again he s gonna get taken out for the 12th time without gaining the yardage and philadelphia now with three minutes well take its final timeout so the only time the clock will now stop again will be the twominute warning mari for the season leads the league by plenty this disaster strikes you and he s gonna wind up leaving it running down records for him emmitt smith at 1773 so he s bearing down on that might get it next week at home against indy the quartet eric dickerson for 2105 that would be your your <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark</person> that s held since the early eighties 466 best career threegame stretch and tonight he s been the workhorse again 31 carries only 81 yards but two touchdowns had a catch and for the moment hell come out and <person player="lance dunbar" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lance dunbar</person> comes in one first down away now the dallas cowboys almost locking this thing up very difficult from their one first down nice meaning out of challenges with it smooth in another 60 seconds anyway <person player="lance dunbar" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunbar</person> up to the 43 yard line so the cowboys will have to punt before the twominute warning but philadelphia would need two scores and do it without a timeout that s great i agree this would be the this is the big i was just trying to think of the big wins he s had i mean he s debut when he took over for getting garret when he took over for <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips was a big win in new york but nobody thought they could win they beat seattle earlier this year but the last three years theyve gone down to the last game of the season and lost it and it cost them a chance to go to the playoffs to this team theyve lost it yep so then to get blown out on thanksgiving and expectations plummet and to come back into this building tonight just so impressive because it just felt like you know you know what the headlines were gonna be the cowboys choked away another you know twenty one point lead they cant win in december they cant win the big games all this kind of stuff they were pecking away that was going to be the story and then they flipped the script <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> came up with some huge plays down the field <person player="jason witten" race="white" position="TE">jason witten</person> on that drive but <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> really answered when this crowd was going bananas in here calmly took his team down the field to retake the lead by 11 they punt here it s against dallas itll cost them five our offense number fiftyfour fiveyard penalty fourth down so we hit the grass to go to until arizona to these seattle seahawks red hot right now against the arizona cardinals with quarterback two about to make the playoffs so the system winds up in a tie arizona is in at the top spot in the west at stake next week the 23 it is dropped there and then picked back up by <person player="darren sproles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren sproles</person> and theyll start the drive from the 24 year 24 i was only half kidding about certain warner wasnt there a story this week of a kurt thinking about coming back you saw that right i nothing would surprise me why not warner was pretty good and there s late season runs you think they would have made him wait wait five more years if hed come back and played a quarter next week way to the hall of fame but what a job that <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce</person> arians has done dont know about stand with the weak with a sprained knee lost mama for the season he makes the catch at the 41 and that takes us to the twominute warning with exactly 157 to play and the dallas cowboys trying to move into the volkswagen postgame report michelle down on the field with the stars of the game bob tony and mike will break it all down well look ahead to next week s game between the seahawks and the cardinals before we leave here brad sham one of the really great guys in the business he s been the voice of the cowboys except for a brief interim spell since 1979 calling his 750th game took over another great pal verne lundquist years ago and 750 flip boards and that s intercepted at the 45 yard line grant can send the word all the way back to the metro flush that <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce carter</person> has in effect end of the game and cemented the dallas cowboys going into undisputed possession of first place in the nfc east not the night that <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> would have hoped for here and for jason garrett as good as it gets to turn around and watch all these people leaving this building right in the middle of the field right there loose quarter he is one of the most athletic linebackers there is say not as instinctive as <person player="anthony hitchens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">anthony hitchens</person> but that takes care of that and all the stuff about the eight nades and you cant have a winning record and you cant win the big games and all that stuff here s out the window right now it s a nice handshake the air from scotland a hand a couple of kneel downs will end the game next week it s indianapolis at home and then on the road and well try to look for a road sweep at washington the final week philadelphia meanwhile goes to washington on the train next week and then to the giants on the bus the following week but this brings everything back into play for the dallas cowboys yep you know they have a win in hand against the hottest team probably in football in seattle or at least they look like that and this is a team now that you have to recalculate everything that you were thinking about the playoffs going forward because most people would have assumed after thanksgiving in the way that the eagles now playing at home look at the dallas cowboys sitting on top there they are <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">tony romo</person> of course has done the job <person player="nick foles" race="white" position="QB">nick foles</person> is gonna go for an xray tomorrow to take a look at his left shoulder the non throwing shoulder dont know when he can come back first of all he s gotta get the x ray has to look better than it has the last time they took one can have to see that it s heal and then who knows about falls and when when or if falls can come back before the end of the regular season or into the playoffs if the eagles get there so that s gonna do it we go from 21nothing dallas to 24 21 philadelphia to a final score of 38 to 27 cowboys <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person> with three touchdown receptions the marco <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> goes in for two scores <person player="tony romo" race="white" position="QB">romo</person> throws for 265 three tvs no picks bryan
