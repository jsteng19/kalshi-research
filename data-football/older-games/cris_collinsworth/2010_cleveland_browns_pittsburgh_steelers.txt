brown offense and here as quarterback <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> starting for the injured <person player="jake delhomme" race="white" position="QB">jake delhomme</person> and the injured <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> we talked about <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> and the challenge he s facing going up against this dispersed team of defense it s designed to confuse a blocking scheme more importantly it s designed to fool the quarterback but they cant be afraid to use <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> either he s got a play quarterback yeah but that ball but he needs to be cautious he needs to learn on each and every snare they listen to that field first down in jam good throw on across the way by brian revista it is a game of 80s up to the 43 yard line and on the offensive line the left side struggled last week pass show starts for the injured <person player="john st clair" race="UNK" position="OT">john st clair</person> right tackle today and running back <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> has approves thigh only bluntest on friday but he starts this afternoon theyll need a lot of him presenting while gillen has to help fuel the offense he yesterday everything he can to put some yardage and points on the board to help the job quarterback wild animal second play sucking down june ribs mashed inside james and donna hillard adam dean of one up to the 44 yard line as we take a look at that pittsburgh defense the underrated ellen smith front of a fairly solid defensive line <person player="casey hampton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hampton</person> in the middle against matt will be a convention very good linebackers <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> the youngest of the group playing well leads the team in tackles and in the secondary the invictus <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> couple of interceptions single most important defensive player on the field for the steelers today third down and one okoye back in louis kroenke was diving after the <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> hit close to the 45 yard line the spot will of course tell us where he was on the landing and if they got the first down it s gonna be close mangini without it they did get it what a man gina tell us he said our goal today is create manageable third downs for <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> the way that you could see is developing the early trend allowed <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> to throw it on first down go with the wildcat on second down to create a third and short where they can stick it in the belly of <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> so he can power it for the first down so really interesting sequence of plays for eric mangini who initially gave him the first down now they bring the chains out on this first drive of the game he is short all they give him the first down that looked like he was short that was right on the tip of the nose i mean the very we get a replay right now that was a good sequence of plays it s very encouraging for coastal boy that looks short to me if indeed of course is that last link is what youre going by that s obviously what theyre going by to get the first down came to the nearside of cribs with you miss throw my <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> or a bad route by cribs who blew the ploy first of all pressure in the face of <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> coming right here from harrison working up against <person player="joe thomas" race="white" position="OT">joe thomas</person> the ball has to come out early and he doesnt get it two cribs on the quick slap and so that s what cribs is going to i think cribs is going to be the hot read and that s what but before he said hey we have to find the hot route he s gonna be my hot machine room they bring the blitz do sucking down antenna tripped it he was tripped up in the backfield by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> and no game employer though stay at the 45 <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> is quickly becoming one of the better players of the defense that s arty starstudded you can see them blitzing right there see him getting penetration both he and <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> plugging up the a gaps so you get the satan hill is in the backfield before he can get started <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> is one of those running backs he s a doitall kind of a guy dick your bone knows that clearly everything was going to evolve around <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> stuck he becomes nance doing super tough defensive back his day third down and 10 that s pop more on the tight end working downfield on the fifth defensive that gain to the 36 yard line that s a strike of 18 yards and a flank was going on the play wow this is a great throw coakley showing me some this ball is on the money in my film study during the week that s the one thing i found out look at he watch you take it outside number 56 defense penalty has declined result of the play is first down the film study showed on <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> and going back he had to sample his college games more importantly during the preseason the final preseason game kevin he went 13 for 13 in that game his accuracy i think is at a very high level if he can become comfortable in this game against this defense if he gets a guy he s open he s gonna hit him right on the money debug in seven play the drive first and ten googling with the set after back at the 50yard line a significant loss of nine on the play whitley guns up with the dose that is his third set to the season and <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> is overmatched by lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> at the top of your screen trying to get the block on the linebacker he just pours right in right on top of coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> and that s the kind of long day that the pittsburgh steelers defense want to make it promote the boy the young running back now second nineteen still for the second that says with the block this time at the light tapping their second abduct off on the plane brought down by more in the 28 when commissioner section of this season with the 10yard returned in a turnover on the first interception thrown in the young career of <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> when we talked to cody boyd last night he says i cannot beat timid i have to challenge the defense he does here this ball spawned the money off the hands of his receivers into the hands of wine <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> for nato seven rick pip were going to get a quick look at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> fortythree hundred yards passing last season the question is can he pick up where he left off yeah i think he has to start conservatively but theyre gonna need him to make plays throwing the football first in <person player="sam aiken" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sam</person> mendon hi im donna bonds in the nail song by <person player="abram elam" race="nonwhite" position="DB">elam</person> works it up to about the 37 picks of

roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> practice three days last week all this week missing the first quarter of the season and he took advantage of the bye week his first week back at practice with the football team said it would have been his first inclination would have been to come out and play immediately to put this all behind them but he said i had to take advantage of the extra times hitting with my teammates on the practice third receiver is linda l5 in the secondary second he cheated is there war is there dan 3 to the 42 let s take a look now at the offensive line of the pittsburgh steelers the white guard today will be <person player="doug legursky" race="white" position="C">doug</person> loggers making his third consecutive start for the injured tree <person player="trai essex" race="nonwhite" position="OT">essex</person> bunny mack <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> seventh

player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> but rob ryan puts together one of the best defenses in the national football league they are steadily improving they are the only team in the nfl who is yet to allow a rushing touchdown all season long clemons play the drive on okoye interception that s on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and his offensive got in the bag five in the second deal first antenna randall flags a litter the field working on <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> that little pump fake has always been used in the arsenal of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> it is one of his unique talents the ability to manipulate coverage the punk fake fashion he can extend the play look at the fake there that s what caused the shelled around to bite on the double move by antwaan randle and he s just forced to really i think respect that pump fake by being <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> already youre seeing the presence of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> in this game making a difference for our beyond what they were able to get from <person player="dennis

gain of three is burton makes the stop for cleveland yeah you know a tuba rule ruben their nose tackle he s the guy that sort of changes in and out with shana <person player="shaun rogers" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rogers</person> both guys are playing very well but ruben 71 he s one of the emerging stars on this defense so the cleveland brown defense while theyre still on the field the penalty flag against them they have been playing well be permitted on the stop in that previous play so i could animate dancing on <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">fujita</person> with a good little move over down to the 14 yard line and pitch up before on the plane it s a physical game out there kevin he s watch the pressure pouring in on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> he s going to take a lick and then of course <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> trying to put a move on the defensive lineman <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">scott fujita</person> makes it excellent tackle but it starts

last year since rob ryan s defense this cleveland brown deacon sacks been 11 times in those two games no defensive lineman unless they put linebackers in a threepoint stance look at this on third and fuller <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> didnt like the look he said it s as confusing a defense as he faces all year it s hard for the offensive

visit your local dodge dealer today and by sprint the now network you talked to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> on friday he said one thing

there by adams first and ten gillis for a gain of five and hit on the play by <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">keisel</person> lock him at the 30yard line of the pittsburgh steelers the bolt quarterback starting today the headline makers in this game with pickoffs as you take a look at the seventh overall pick joe hayden out of the university of floor so many people are gonna talk about <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> maybe trying to do too much i dont think he was trying to do too much it was just a misfire he overthrew his intended receiver had a great play by joe hayden and he told you this people in brown defense theyre pretty good in their own right on second down and five players are competing games ready to get one set but the rookie quarterback let s get away that s <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> upended by <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> welcome down at the 21 yard line of flag is down on a gain of nine and boy cope <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> is taking a licking youre getting some hits on the quarterback tripping number 55 offense that s a tenyard penalty from the spot of the foul still second down that is the rookie almond i make it the secondyear center <person player="alex mack" race="white" position="C">alex mack</person> out of cal he was last year man jeanne s number one pick yeah they caught the center and then they hit on <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> by lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> look at the jerseys already dirty you think he s already played a four quarter football game that s like <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">joshua</person> cribs going to come in for a little bit second wildcat look well have for this cleveland offense and this has been an effective weapon against pittsburgh in the pink or it really has and <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">joshua</person> clear to remember he is a quarterback in college at kent state spot foul second and six <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> s got to go up hold you down on the play by hina three to the 27th <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> it s been a mixed bag for him so far he s looked good when he has been on depressives and living the ball with great accuracy for a completion but then he s taking this action so g he s already getting the jersey dirty attended interception on his first possession in his very first start as an nfl quarterback so he s gonna have to weather the storm knowing what he was told that he was going to be redshirted this year he said he never embraced that he had always prepared himself to play employ a he probably enters the most difficult situation boy back in third down him three in flag has got that this is <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> i stopped over there by <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> need to be on unless they stop the play before it even had legs well that s the deal the flags were thrown but i never heard a whistle bullet neither all sides number 43 defense fiveyard penalty first down first down pull them all over <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> is theyre gonna there he is right there he shoots the gap he shoots the gap now to the 23 yard line polk has come in for <person player="casey hampton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hampton</person> first intent for the cleveland browns interceptions both ways to begin it wildcat i read that well james terry over 35 years of age now in his 14th season cana beyond and down to the 21 one of the advantages this clerk steelers have look at the outside acts to the ball the floor but one of the advantages they have against a wildcat they run a threefour defense so the outside linebackers of harrison and whitley they are already outflanked they bring to a <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> up in the box who saw him containing the play it s hard to run outside on the edges against this threefour defense here at their speed it s almost impossible but boy back in second nine mythical rush up the minute failure bouncing him for a second time today also a nice play <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> let s go to new york and james brown a kevin kevin cobb doing his part kevin to lay claim to the starting position hooking up top here 34 yards of the speedster desean <person player="dqwell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jackson</person> kevin cobb two or three 56 yards and a touchdown 14 nothing philly over atlanta back to kevin and solomon michael vick is suited up and on the sidelines today for the eagle he has listed i think there s the number three quarterback and so the fact that kevin god s gonna be given this fool game to try to lace take to that starting quarterback position little secondary 1317 to get to the 13 boy and down he goes on a run of nine so the rookie out of texas <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> gets some deeper in the pittsburgh territory talk about speeding up the play check this out now he s clean that s a clean pocket where is he going he s got to keep his vision down the field for the open receiver he gave up on the play way too quickly and that s what he s being coached at hey the protection was there for <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> but the defense has already sped up the game boy after getting a couple of sacks and a hit on the quarterback if <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> hits this hell become the alltime leading field goal kicker in the history of the passing lou groza and the browns cash in on the interception by the rookie hayden hayden got the pick on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> who comes back momentarily 151 in the first kevin three reasons why the steelers should be leery of the cleveland browns who wrecked their 2009 playoff hopes landing the steelers a critical 5th consecutive loss how about <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">joshua</person> krebbs burned the steelers for 3 career ticket returns for touchdowns and in a rookie cornerback who have revitalized that secondary at <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> and joe hayden we already seen hayden get one of those interceptions the browns are much improved under their head coach eric mangini and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> and the steelers should not take them likely <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">phil dawson</person> will kick on for the cleveland browns and deep aunt will be <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> a rookie out of smu who they really like he s being up active roster for the first time since opening weekend but bright pennsylvania sun from the one it is a 17 yard return out to the 18 yard line our second look at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> when we come back to pittsburgh cleanup in

$49 91st return the second number gets it right there at the gain out to about the 2014 oh kevin let s go back and take a look at the redzone interception by being the <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> were gonna take a look at it right here now here s the deal he should not have thrown the ball simply because here s his key right here that s his key and that s gonna be the <person player="mike adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike adams</person> that defensive back and so he is really shrinking the throwing lane and so ben should not have thrown that ball there forces the overthrow and it s kicked off so he s got do a better job of reading to coverage in that situation suck it out and fine get by the other world <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj</person> would catch a run across the way of free yards on the play with the 27 yard line he s got the right to be a little bit rusty doesnt <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> i mean the timing is not going to be perfect but i think you know in terms of his his recognition of coverage that s something that you can expect him to be very sharp on now the physical rust and the wear in terms of the game speeding up you know there may be some rust there may be a slow start but that s one of those typical reagents an easy read i think he tried to jam it into a tight area and glue he overthrew the intended receiver in the plants were very funny we call some nice tackling in there by the koopa brotherhood might call it back by etapa <person player="ahtyba rubin" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rubin</person> close to a first down yeah to get beyond the 29 let s see with that ball was spot on the second possession for the pittsburgh steelers today and the return of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> were gonna get the measurement right off the bat my tomlin was very encouraged by what he had seen of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the conversations they had had over the last month and how he had prepared himself for this first game back well he spent his entire time off during that suspension working with a personal quarterback coach so he wanted to work on his footwork his timing his technique and all the fundamentals required to play at a high level at the quarterback position and remember he did go through training camp in preseason with this football team he played in all the preseason games and so his timing really ought to be good i think they were really pleased with how his conditioning was and his timing since he has rejoined the team in practice going back to a week ago and they thought he had a good preseason which paved the way for his return today at the end of one browns by three youre watching the nfl on cbs weve got the second quarter with a first and ten for the pittsburgh steelers at the 30yard line was solomon evil cats kevin harlan <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> three or four so far through the year one interception that s a catch by wallace who is replacing the now deported santonio holmes pick up 11 first down to the 40yard line and you can see he is ready to throw the ball this was thrown with the laser log accuracy i was downstairs in the tunnel just before the game and he had attempted about a hundred throws even before he came out to warm up on the field in front of the cameras he stayed underneath in the tunnel to warm up and so the physical part of it think should be at a high level to start this game bounced around the nipple and oh ella s in first and ten from the pittsburgh 40 finely made by lindenwood college pina five and that was a busted play it looks like to the 44 yard line is they are preparing the sprint halftime report in new york for gb dan shannon boomerang coach cowher scores highlights and news sprint halftime report coming up next from new york interop was burger very aware <person player="matt roth" race="white" position="DE">matt roth</person> had blitzed and had he thrown that ball oh <person player="matt roth" race="white" position="DE">matt roth</person> probably would have intercepted that s why ben just tucked it and ran with smart her real good headsup play did it go on suck it down and five this churning run to the cards is waiting for seven has the first down and picked up on the plane by easily woman wow this is just a wonderful playwright between look at the left tackle stark s able to get through that hole between <person player="max starks" race="nonwhite" position="OT">starks</person> and chris quinoa to get to the second level the left guard left tackle get the crease leading to the second level of his cleveland brown defense minden hall has been excellent in the first four or five games of the season wrap up there in that line a furling no gain on the play in fact there s probably some argument that says that <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> is right now the mvp to the bishop i think you can you can really point to that particularly when this team goes three and want without their quarterback <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> but last year they only averaged 26 run plays per game and they threw a 33 times a game well it s almost opposite they flip those numbers coming into today s game with a average 30 before in the secondary second and ten another nice defensive play turned in by <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite"

get the cornerback and fall in the front end of your defense watching shoot the gap coming off the corner see if they dont even see a pulling guard doesnt even see him he s able to run right by liquor

his wings the hard way it s at allthey undercover boss it s tonight it s only on cbs moved in 10 they began on their now theyre 40 yard line and been all back in go car on the play they stay at the 40 kevin we talked to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> saying im hearing you say this all week that youre gonna try to not to do too much everyone else is saying dont try to do too much i said but as long as ive been watching you play youve always pushed it to the limit youve always extended the play youve always bought a little bit more time for your receivers to get open kennedy play another way kennedy tapered back he says hey i only know one way to play and he said you know i have to balance it there s a fine line between asking too much out of a play and then learning and knowing when to give up on browns in the nickel antwaan randle all the foot bench second down and ten the pocket collapses go kong head of the slippery <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> incomplete lauren was moving incomplete bringing up third down in jen again he keeps that play alive for a long time he even said he had a conversation with our colleague bill cowher his former coach here who said hey dont try to do too much i think this is one of those plays where coast caller can say okay finn s trying to do too much see he leaves the ball expose he ends up throwing it and he nearly fumbled the ball even up the pressure that s maybe one of those plays that have been goes back to look at it on tape and says okay i have to know when the live to fight another day and not expose the ball for a potential turnover but that s <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> he lives on the edge i dont know that he knows any other way to play that s barney itll be third and 10 looks like the steelers have taken their second timeout one remaining 507 to play here in the first half of pittsburgh plus burger with a touchdown pass and a pick seven of ten for the pittsburgh steeler this scene was three and one before the return of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> his return has been greatly anticipated everyone asking him to play of a conservative nature he already has pushed it to the edge one interception danny comes out throwing laser lot passes then while under pressure a touchdown pass to wallace he could indeed still live on the edge he only knows one way to play he says hey i dont like it myself to michael <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan</person> but i dont know that you can ask michael <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan</person> to play any other way than he did throw down in ten after that pittsburgh timeout one defensive line six in the secondary with apart from the welder more reciever i enjoy with the coverage by brown downfield complete it will be fourth down they got to punt the ball this is a matter of angles because being bought more time he extended the play and the receiver who knows him the best as hinds war but war breaks it off over the middle and he should have went vertical and i think that s what ben was anticipating that s what created the incompletion as ward came open he went over the middle as opposed to going deep with no cribs <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> will be retrieving and catching the plants assume the kickoffs as well 44yard punt right there so this will affect the cleveland browns as crips will not play with the head entry the rest of the day and check out the new

mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> s play huge blow because we said at the top that the wildcat had to be the wildcard to help supplement this offense with their rookie for right now the total production of the offense falls on the shoulders of their rookie quarterback keeps a lot too for the rest of the game and their defensive line for the pittsburgh steelers first and ten minutes you see the replaces kiesel among the many right there with the stop on a gain of three to the 19 and what that means is that maybe <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> of the 65 offensive snaps theyre gonna get maybe he s going to play 40 of those and then maybe the others go to <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">joshua</person> krebs playing quarterback in the wildcat offense and so now all the snaps all the production for eric mangini whose offense falls on the shoulders of <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> that means he s open to hitting more hits and even more corn up against this this work steelers defense and second down in seven <person player="tony hills" race="nonwhite" position="OT">hills</person> again for hilla son of arkansas rum born his way up to the 34yard brought down the play by <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> 14yard pickup in a first down coming with him as well this is just a great play by design and they bring the motion watch it across the action see there theyre gonna hold this guy here and that s why theyre able to bring that reverse motion when you bring the reverse motion that creates the running lane right up the middle and he s able to get to the second level so it s an excellent design on the play by the cleveland brian it s feeling brought to you by the right tackle patients first intent <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> harrison coming through with the stop among the many a gain of two to the 34 no heal as we talked about him being one of those throwback players he can run it he has excellent hands coming out of the backfield five touchdowns in their first five games this season so he s a guy that can find the endzone it what did he tell us know even eric mangini say we tried to trade for him even a year ago and he told <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> that hey if you come here there s no reason why you should not be a thousandyard back playing in this office two times on second down and eight good back by <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite"

race="nonwhite" position="K">phil</person> start in the career of <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> and he senses the pressure very early and then he gives up look watch when he tucks it now see he s talking to run his visions not down the field his vision is toward that sideline he s run it for safety to get away from <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> his parents are in attendance here at today s game they dont want to see him in harm s way maybe they think he did the right thing hell run and live to fight another day that gives him another dimension doesnt it without critics absolutely he does have the mobility to like a veteran quarterback keep your vision down the field third and three steelers in the nickel venice boulevard to the 44 he s got the first down picking up four on the play the browns keep it alive where s <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> we violet player at the point of contact when he hits you he s not nice about it he s a guy that s a softspoken young man very polite but when he puts that helmet on boy he has bad intentions invited told you at the twominute warning your quarterback making his first starter stone a pic and youve launched josh <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">cribbs</person> an element of your offense you could not lose youre down by four you probably take that if youre cleveland you fill it okay but you have to fingers crossed yes <person player="mike bell" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike bell</person> is in first and ten ketchup calamari witness harrison again lay in the wood and he is slow to get up much like cribs before him flag has been thrown harrison is all over the field 2008 nfl defensive player of the year once again a violent collision this one s headtohead much in the same way it was with <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">joshua</person> cribs now why wasnt the flat ground on the earlier one remember chris was a runner with the football he was not in a defenseless position watch <person player="mohamed massaquoi" race="nonwhite" position="WR">massaquoi</person> see he s defenseless he no way he can protect himself no way he can see the defender come and he s looking for the football let s listen in could be a fine right there helmet that s exactly what the league is trying to stay away from exactly after the play delay of game on the offense number 55 kicking the ball with a fiveyard penalty and his second down i think matt kicked the ball to center and matt kicked the ball out because he thought it could possibly be a fumble yeah that s why he kicked the ball here well fall or anything he didnt know what it would be rude and looked as if he were coming to just kick it out to get the ball out of bounds so that they can maintain possession see watch instead of hill pouncing on it he s just going to go ahead and kick it out really is a smart guy and when it cal he wanted the trannie trophy which is the heisman of academics smart guy yeah he could respond it a little bit better there but im not so sure if <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> doesnt get letter in the mail through the league office three timeouts moments ago for cleveland theyve just burned one right there theyre down to two so now theyve lost <person player="mohamed massaquoi" race="nonwhite" position="WR">massaquoi</person> who looks like hell probably go to the locker room and <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> will take his place timeout and coming up with a sprint halftime report from our cbn studios in new york jp dan shannon boomerang coach cow latest nfl scores and highlights coming up on the sprint halftime report coach cowher wasnt pittsburgh earlier this weekend of doing that ramos visiting his former team as we take a look at eric mangini trying to get his offense going here on he s an jet that time out of his an injurytime out in the last two minutes of the half nihlus the teeth of that he picks up six on the play and he s got the ball out to the 45 yard line and kevin i want to go back to that hit by harrison he remember he warmers into the mvp in the national football league he is a very good player he s a smart player i dont think he intends to commit any harm but all were speaking is about is the safety of the game and there are rules in place that omit to protect players like what we saw in that play by mohammed massive good and smith will be the only defensive lineman out there for the pittsburgh steelers 39 there was to the 45 and no gain on the play they got a pun and harrison is everywhere he s flying around nipping at the heels of these offensive linemen what a starstudded defense you have players like harrison you have farrier you have toit <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> and obviously youve got other guys like lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> is it is a burgeoning star on this defense where do you go where is the weak link im not so sure there are any on this defense theyve only given up four touchdowns theyve not allowed a running back in the nfl that they faced this year to go over 42 yards rushing on the ground im the state it dick lebeau defense havent allowed a run for over 20 yards so far this year in fact the longest run from scrimmage against his deepest his 12 yards that s incredible of the teams that remember they played a game against chris <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">johnson</person> one of the better running backs in the national football moses had a run of 14 today <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> is carried in nine times for 33 yards second consecutive pocket hutchins antoine another thanks adams let it go by out

is a im not gonna hold the reins on you you go out and be big laughs nothing about the six yard line on the play and hit by bart black by <person player="greg warren" race="white" position="C">warren</person> in every yard and now you talked to ben and we talked about the numbers they put up last year throwing the football and he mentioned the fact that they had a four thousand yard passer they had two wide receivers we had over a thousand yards in a they also had a thousand yards rushing he said we believe that we can win with the formula weve used one year or going up it s kind of surprised by that because they went nine at seven they had a fivegame losing streak and they fail to make the playoff but they believe they can win using that style of clever me limit a loss of the arm the same event will take us to halftime and there s a topper <person player="ahtyba rubin" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rubin</person> working on pounce see the rookie who starts at center for the pittsburgh steelers pouncy is one of the brightest young players that ever sat down and talked to and before games he says he makes every single call at the line of scrimmage and he is a guy who was just born ready and from the time he stepped on the field he s taken every single snapped in the preseason at training camp and so far this year he s already become a leader and the veterans have accepted him when he sat down with us in our production meeting he felt as if you were talking to a veteran kevin cleveland just took their final timeout in thinking of the sinner making all the wine reads as you talked about in the confusion that a coach like rex sera brian puts out there it s a very compete for the most seasoned of center if policy told us the difference between college football the pros at least for him he says hey you cant play a game without looking in your playbook that was a smart answer third down in ten ruben s rossdale and of the six so they got a punt timeout taken by cleveland you want a fair catch this if they punt the guy a chance maybe at a field on wednesday on cbs with the senator as their client the stakes have never been higher jim belushi jerry oconnell the defenders wednesday only on cbs what if you could catch it now <person player="daniel sepulveda" race="white" position="P">daniel sepulveda</person> he s a real good ponte here he s

position="QB">roethlisberger</person> in his return with the touchdown pass in a pit <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> had an interception weve got a flag on the plague as we keep it here and it s gonna be against the pittsburgh steelers they over there visiting with eric mangini there was illegal touching on the kicking team cleveland has chosen not to elect another snap the half is over which takes us to halftime 7 to 3 no josh <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">cribbs</person> the rest of the way the browns working from behind youre on cbs nine yard touchdown pass by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> has been our games only touchdown salman wilcox kevin harlan thank you for joining us send your thoughts on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s first half my impression so far is that i think he s hit the ground running yes he continues to push it to the edge he s committed some mistakes overthrowing an attendent receiver for an interception but then he bounced back in with that same reckless energy he throws for a touchdown while under duress so you know being giveth and he taketh away but it s been mostly positive time now for the points of protection today brought to us by austin when you think about points up protection i think the cleveland browns more than anything they have to protect their rookie quarterback <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> he s been knocked down four times sacked twice in the ballgame and theyve continued to pound the rock but their running back <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> he gets had a 14 yard run the longest allowed by the pittsburgh steelers defense so far this season and then welcome back vick <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> 80 yards passing and a touchdown and an interception so it s dead even for being right now but you know when the game is on the line he s gonna push it he s gonna look to make big plays on third down and in the final two minutes in the fourth quarter of today s game and we talked there a little bit about <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> who is throwing a pick as you mentioned but so far you know there s been a steady hand at times with him throwing he s six attempt through the air i think he s hurried some throws i think he s hurried even the times when he s had some protection i think there s been the perceived pressure in the mind of <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> where he s bailed on some opportunities you know this pittsburgh steelers defense has a tendency to do that rookie a man trust <person player="nick sorensen" race="white" position="DB">nick</person> tripped him up and he s out to about the 27 on a 21yard return on our first half highlights here in pittsburgh today well the pittsburgh steelers have gotten it going with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> came out highly expectations of making plays but we talked about the early costly error the interception by joe hate athena comes back to throws a touchdown pass to <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> while he s getting hit under pressure cook dinner off the service dog aerosol the

to take a look at rob ryan their defensive coordinator <person player="matt roth" race="white" position="DE">matt roth</person> and eric martin are also excellent players at the linebacker position secondary second down at nine underneath they gone times war that on the play by everybody the game to the thirty seventh pits of about nine yards and close to a pittsburgh first down and boy <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> has been looking to get involved in the offense watching come underneath make the catch look to create yards after the cats and so <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> heating it up he is their leading receiver in today s game three catches you can see that come in to today s game ranked dead last and passing often in fact they were dead last in passing attempts per game without then attempting only twenty passes per head first intent from the 37 for the secondary times were taught by wallace my rights to the cleveland 32 germline im here to 26 and a first down for the steeler of man this is a wonderful throw deep down the field watch how far it is outside the numbers this ball has to travel a long way to get over to heinz more deep outside the numbers okay right so hey im doing all that i can do to try to get over there and make a play but <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> knows how to get separation he comes back to the ball it coming right at you in your living room from being around his burger he and <person

position="DB">sheldon brown</person> a gain of 12 to the 25 whole lane number 73 offense 10yard penalty first down we just talked about amis taking the place that came out to <person player="ramon foster" race="nonwhite" position="OT">foster</person> it s mike tomlinson yeah cant do that cant do it there he is right there little grab action more the second penalty on the pittsburgh steelers today ive always wondered about <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> is the quarterback and the adjustments the offense lauren you touched on this earlier he s to mate with him in their place he does extend the play marquise pouncing what is that he s it again coming back that means i have to hold my box in seconds walker this theyre all aware our bad yards did to play adam didnt make a difference because chief erlich taking the place of the injured robear smith makes the stop ghena to the 46 yard line are theyre continuing to pound the running game with course for shard <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> i dont think enough to say it about him he comes into today s game as the nfl s third leading rusher they needed him to get off to a great start in a month of september in fact they needed the defense and the running game no way youre going to go three and run to those first four games without your running game being attacked and so they really have the right formula working for this football second end up in the valerio throws that away they may have been going to those without continues his block after the play as he was working on ebrill diamond were down now we talked about quarterbacks being smart enough to know hey when is it okay to just give up on the play ben said he would be tested i thought that was a smart play by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> pressure was coming in this receiver wasnt open they wanted to go with this quick screen play to a <person player="shawn lauvao" race="nonwhite" position="OT">shawn</person> <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> he wouldnt take a sack he didnt try to extend it he didnt risk a tunnel we just got a football complete <person player="eric wright" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric wright</person> was right there he s lucky yes ben is lucky we just praised him for you know kind of tapering his enthusiasm to make a great play but watch this one he s waiting and waiting but he s looking the entire time watching comes back he throws this right into coverage look at all the white jerseys theyre cutting in front of <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> so pull back no cribs is injured stuck his dead son back at the $900 for three seven now placed punt forty yards here comes <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> type out chimes three punts here comes colton <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> who they really wanted to redshirt so to speak using a college term measure they didnt want him to play his rookie season a he said the early plan was to sit him he said im never embraced it in eric mangini said that s the kind of players we draft is one of our core traits he walked from head came forward to getting on the field first and ten <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> tackle then <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bryant</person> gets over there brings him down to the 34 catchin run at 25 and a cleveland first down you know the five possesses by the cleveland browns three of them have started a tour inside their own 20yard line innocent player down for the pittsburgh steelers and nikki led by the cleveland browns so an injury timeout one of many weve had today 1116 to play in the third from pittsburgh as we return to heinz field take a look at <person player="nick sorensen" race="white" position="DB">nick</person> <person player="nicholas eason" race="UNK" position="DT">eason</person> now look that s <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> fall right on the back of his leg and that s where lyman are most susceptible to injured very critical and were fortunate to see him walking off hopefully he can get back on the field right before that injury a 25 yard catch and run by <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> cribs is out with a head injury will not return mexicoís out with a we will not return at the 34 first and 10 nihlus right into the glass posterior in the to the 39 these love the way they use that play to just allow <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> to come down heal and he s such a low 240 pounds of a boy getting wrong we talk about him having the fool and completes skillset to run it catch it he s a good blocker does so many things well and until i put the tape on im just amazed at how big he is but but a good football ziggy <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> is increasing the defensive line for the pittsburgh steelers something fun as with the block tackle made by <person player="tony hills" race="nonwhite" position="OT">hills</person> of 41 they gained it to one of the big things for cleveland today was being pretty good on first down so that third and whatever would be manageable absolutely because you want to keep the young quarterback coco coy out of those third long situations eric mangini knows that his quarterback is at risk of being picked off sacked hit harassed by dick lebeau stephenson third three you know the demons has to play it a little bit more even but the exotic blitzes tend to come from dick lebeau defense when he has the office in a third long situation fifth offensive that was <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gay</person> <person player="casey hampton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hampton</person> is our third and three we brought that they chose that spot <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> hit by <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> fix up seven on third and three good throw by sukhoi first down to the 47 cm by getting the third and three a third and manageable only fourman rush look that s easy to read for koch <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> now you can stand in the pocket and just take the underneath easy throw to create a first down so the ability to create third manageable really help your young quarterback to avoid that blitzing defense mr tim gillis got down on the play by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> gain of four <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> now today 42 yards on the ground 11 carry he s gonna clog up the a gaps with the blitzing linebackers look he takes it into the b and c gap going a little bit outside and theyre forced to bring in their corner back and look at <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> he has to come down and replace the linebacker he was blitzing but that s what this defense does so well if theyre blitzing from one area another defender is there to support and replace the blitzing defender the second area second down in ships his back <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> no gain on the play they stay at the 49 you wanted coming into this game from a boy from the cleveland perspective if they would scale back the offense or catering to what <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> does well well and that they would cope <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> said theyd go pay for the training camp he never had a chance to work with the number one offense he said i had to learn in the preseason game that s where i got my ribs because youre never cynical honest and <person player="jake delhomme" race="white" position="QB">jake</person> the lone player new to the offense as well so they got all the reps with the number ones in practice he had the weights and they actually got the preseason get him to work with your goes offensive to get any rest that was pulled out of bounds he did the same thing last week in cleveland to the 38 a kitchen run of 11 another first down for the brown you can see coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> is limping because he took the shot but he would stare down the barrel and got rid of this ball with just a real good throw to heal us and watch <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> we spun do that last week against the atlanta falcons but look at <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> it s just a little shelf from farrier that boy his jerseys gonna be dirty and boy will he have to get in the world pool but monday boy is gonna have that number 12 which he wore at texas retired at the end of this month mic bill they just made a trade with philadelphia to get him sending <person player="jerome harrison" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jerome harrison</person> away no gain on the play for bail first carry today staying at the 38 right now eight plays on the drive by the cleveland browns five runs three pass plays as you take a look so coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> is becoming a factor in this game he is playing with a greater sense of poise i like them though who plays that theyre dialing up warm from their offensive coordinator if it s just quick throws but the ability to create third and manageable that s really working in his favor second montagne there was in but to the 37 of the pittsburgh steelers picks up a young n jumping off your point <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> is caught 1 for 25 gillis gotta throw up yeah look at coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> it s patience and poise is growing look at the pressure coming in his face stepping up vision steal down the field knows where his check down guy is where <person player="lawrence vickers" race="nonwhite" position="RB">vickers</person> is standing on the sidelines so he gets the ball out of his hands he doesnt take a hit but not giving the optional t still second down penalty on the cleveland browns you were just the tail end of the call right there itll make it second down and 10 fiveyard penalty as a correction pittsburgh is elected to decline the penalty itll be third down third and about 10 37 yarder about eric mangini walking on production meeting i thought he was a new guy he s lost the way he looks good look at nice and fit even the coaches at the state of shake i felt about the round was illegal touching and you can see what he s done he s been on this kind of state before he played attempt as you play some pretty big game but it doesnt get any bigger than this more complicated defensive scheme animal defense on the road winter then i go on third and jim were two minutes <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> with the sex second of the season loss of three put it back at the 40 give <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> some credit he stood in the pocket wanted to hang in there get rid of it nowhere to go eyes come down and now he s just running for his life as the pocket collapsing see now he s looking for a receiver once he pumps it now he just really tucks it did a good job of securing the football and just taking the sack living to fight another day put a couple of putts inside the ten already in this band again how about that this guy has hit some kind of day <person player="blake costanzo" race="white" position="LB">costanzo</person> the x bill is the one down at 36 yard punt he s been terrific as biggest roi as the browns have had today tom how the nfl on cbs is sponsored by sony hailed by toyota able grounds have successfully flipped the field they began that last drive it there nine put it away to the four of the pittsburgh steelers cant weigh out to his back in at the guard its first and ten with the block going deep 20:46 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> a little bit shaking up a 50 yard strike and breathing space for the steelers but rhombus burger slow to get up the speed of wallace he led the nfl and yards per catch one year ago as a rookie now he s just burning down the sidelines and as good of a throw are good and catch as it was i think it was even better throw by being aramis berger who still down in the end zone binet was stumbling and kind of falling just his sheer athleticism allowed him to get this each kind of chips up right there steps up and then just heaves it down the field as he takes a lick right in the chops it s just a tremendous throw even though he was a little bit out of sync and well under pressure lagar ski is the man down in the end zone for the pittsburgh steelers he is taking the place today of the injured triassic thirsty getting up slow we told you came out you can see him right there he left the game now he is back in and they will bring in on other linemen to take his place third straight start for the injured essence this is what <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> brings to the table and ill take a lot of other quarterbacks in this league could give the pittsburgh steeler look as he steps up in the pocket scott fatigue 99 right in the chops he s looking down the barrel he knows he s gonna be hit but yet he is willing to take the hit while trying to deliver the ball down the field to wallace that ball was thrown on the money even though he was hit right in the chops and so he s been knocked down he s been heree but he hasnt taken the sack that s another important ingredient he brings to his football team bone <person player="ramon foster" race="nonwhite" position="OT">foster</person> takes the place of the injured workers get the right guy first and ten for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> going to be skeptical stealing when we spoke to <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> defensive back by the cleveland browns he said we cannot give up huge chunks of yards in the passing game and two consecutive throws by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> 1 to wallace this one to the tight end eath <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> and we thought <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> would be even a bigger part of the game plan today had been he s got to have to get in the whirlpool because he s going down hard in his game but he gets up smiling because he s throwing bb s 50yard catch by wallace 37 yards right there first and goal <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> with the block for <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> ward makes the stop gain of a yard to the 8th of this <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> these are rookie defensive back one of the guys weve talked about in our 3 reasons why that he cant take the browns like it he is a hard hitter i think he s going to be a future star for this football team he wants him on tape he rarely takes a wrong step he always plays physical and he s a good player get the passing yards today is that not an improvement second door at the 8 recover to the played by a blonde the ela at the two third and goal i think we see it at the top there the red zone receptor had to be <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> is he coming off the left side of your screen but you think the cleveland browns defenders <person player="abram elam" race="nonwhite" position="DB">abram elam</person> doesnt know that he <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> is a red zone presence would be a lot less berger it s a good red zone defense for cleveland to number three coming into today they are one of the best absolutely third and dorothy eight that s <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> next to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> texture <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> resist though his second touchdown pitch today great players make you pay when you dont do the little things right he flips his man that man eric right you gone for the ball go for the man inmate at the tackle <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> says it did not go to time for me im going in for a touchdown so eric right you know youre blitzing youre manned up against <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> if he s going to catch it in front of you you have to make that tackle read 14 to 3 313 to play on the 396 yard drive he hit wallace did <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> 450 37 yard pass to <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> then an eightyard touchdown pass to the aggressive boy 80 first career touchdown of <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> career second alltime in pittsburgh history passing <person player="jerome harrison" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jerome</person> bettis wow you asked what <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> brings that is often top out an explosive weapon he makes this office much more explosive with his presence in the backfield reads kickoff fritz is out of the game with a head injury joe hit back at before the office was right there <person player="stevenson sylvester" race="UNK" position="LB">stevenson sylvester</person> lucky i am tom 24yard returned tonight on 60 minutes it s a wonder of the world in the holiest of cities the dick that isnt covering thousands of years of history so why is it causing so much tension tonight on 60 minutes and it s only on cbs 28 yard line first and ten for young <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> when we talked to <person player="matt roth" race="white" position="DE">matt roth</person> and we talk to <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> defensive players for the cleveland browns they said the margin of error was seeing that they could not allow a lot of points it puts more pressure on their rookie quarterback they have to play catchup then try to keep pace with inner office bergeron with the pittsburgh steelers offense is doing well on the backfield first and ten from the car good time great throw <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> s second reception today <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> thanks a lot of bounds 23 yard catch to the 49 of the pittsburgh steeler this is one of the things ive talked about with <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> you cannot underestimate his accuracy is a very accurate passer went given time you look at his technique as he steps up and delivers a wellthrown ball so when given the time and given the vision down the field he can make the throws and hit the open receivers in my mind that s the most important part of he can hit you if you get over placed attended by pliant accent a year ago with arizona back not a pittsburgh gain of three to the 46 weve had a lot of quarterbacks completely since they were reinstated in 1999 but you know theyve had the tim couches theyve had the first round picks theyve had the free agents more than anything youve got to look for a guy who can throw the ball when it was see if it gets open can you hit him that s the most fundamental question i think eric mangini when they looked at <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> theyre gonna find out that said least the one thing that he does very well let s take different quarterback to stop for cleveland since 99 second down and seven except to the 43 im gonna pick up up three just a cavalcade of quarterbacks who s been there since tim couch to 2003 kelly holcomb luke mccown trent dilfer <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie</person> frey derek anderson brady quinn former firstround pick dorsey even grant kowski and now <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> and <person player="jake delhomme" race="white" position="QB">jake delhomme</person> and the door is open for this young man to step in i dont know that you can start in a more difficult situation if you can survive this maybe you can survive anything <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> back in into the nickel flirting for rebels with a good block it complete welcome for stuff let s go to james brown in new york kevin and solomon baltimore trying to get a little breathing room on the patriots after tom brady pick joe flacco going top to anquan boldin 25yard strike in his 1710 back to kevin harlan and nfl play books solomon wilcox im d bolton does a nice job for that offense huh thank you jb you know bowden is loving him from joe flacco <person player="reggie hodges" race="UNK" position="P">hodges</person> has had three punts inside the 10 omelets knocked away off the shoulder pad of antoine randall l 34yard punt and they have him back there to hold on cuz he s got your hands on punt returns this was right off his shoulder pam <person player="reggie hodges" race="UNK" position="P">hodges</person> is knocking down some pots that one comes off the shoulder remember that ball is not eligible for recovery and tell it hits the ground if he muffs it up in the air the punt team defenders cant take it away from him that new rule is emphasized the beginning of the year the ball is not free until it hits the ground then it becomes a live ball for anyone to recover second half of the cleveland browns two possessions two punts aquos burner coming off an eightyard touchdown pass to ward first and ten at the night end it all of the game of to store seven two three <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> goes to work inside his own 5yard line a 50yard vocal while under pressure down the field to mike wallet then he comes back on the next play at 37 yarder to hed <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> very quickly then a touchdown strike to <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> three or four on the drive of the five plays they threw it four times so <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> showing a quick strike ability to put numbers on the board they came into today s game with the last ranked passing attack i think those days are over second down and eight walk down by derek <person player="derreck robinson" race="UNK" position="DE">robinson</person> on men defensive line no game they stay at about the 10yard line in <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> maybe way that he s playing today i think it just gives this team a greater hope greater sense of confidence to conquer all those things that are out in front of him he is playing well now he takes his team into the fourth quarter where he tends to work even more magic welcome back to heinz field with the pittsburgh steelers into the fourth quarter 14 to 3 is our score the steelers score touchdowns in both the second and third quarter it s the fifth time the steelers have faced third and eight or longer in this game it s across the middle the rookie severs his second reception today good for 1530 markham at the 25 working on mike animals <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> is a guy who had been inactive in the recent weeks and look at he work to cover so look how he works on adams adams turns one way he gets on the other side and ben is patient enough to wait and find him the protection is there so it s just good work in the past he gave the team the protection <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> s patience and then sandals ability the final pillar in the defense right now if youre the cleveland browns youve got to come up with a stop yeah youve been on the field a lot youre playing with a rookie quarterback but youve got to be able to now help shorten the field for <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> youve got to find some way to be able to take the ball away create a turnover and get some momentum back in this game and make the job easier for <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> never the goes second down and ten entwine randall working on the shelter brown it s a gain of 11 its first catch today first down to the 36 and randall working against shell to brown the veteran quarterback only enough to get the hit after the catch has been made so it s a great throw from rocklers berger outside the numbers on the sidelines good cats by antoine rando al he time ends here the numbers are off the school lieutenants bottom of the screen first and ten and with teeth event defense at the cleveland browns he knows about three on the plan 10:30 what was the word that we continue to hear from all the players and even the coaches when we met with pittsburgh steel that that word was balanced and that s what they have in today s game 24 run plays call it so far 21 pass play so it hasnt gotten out of hand mike tomlin understands what the running game gives them he knows that ben s gonna get it in chunks but at the end of the day this game their office runs through the sharp metropolitan was they dont get them down on the play by goke on e to the yard to the 40 during the offseason team president arent ruining jr he mentioned he talked about we have to put more emphasis on running the football that s traditionally how they placed all those lombardi trophies in their building take a look at the play selection for the pittsburgh steelers today 25 runs blaze 21 pass plays that s the kind of balance theyre talking about almost did even with a little more emphasis on the world third down six into the mecha here comes <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">fujita</person> and it may have toyed with that pass intended for randall own coverage by ibrahim coming up for the pittsburgh steel there s no doubt about it or watch the g2 coming into the face of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> i think he hits that arm doesnt allow the followthrough kind of like a jump shot in basketball you cant follow through you dont keep the ball on its target line and so he s not able to drive that ball head for completion only plays punt gold look at booth bicep pulled it off the kicks into the end zone going back from dancing <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> 60yard punt to the 20 for cleveland and their quarterback <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> when we come back right now new york to put together the subway postgame show jp dan shannon bullpen coach bill cowher for the latest nfl scores and highlights it s all coming up on the subway postgame show took <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> 12 of 17 with a pick today on the twenty first and ten let s pick up minutes under the play by <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry</person> s foot <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> gain of three the 23 yard line i think it s a very smart play called by the cleveland browns off coordinator brian de bowl through <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> and take a look at the comparison for cocoa coin how about the high completion percentage for him 13 of 1840 yards only the one missed throw to the interception but either win your war on <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> and you want to throw it get the ball out of your hands quickly to <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">peyton hillis</person> so he can

finals next on the cbs second down 12 look at some of the numbers with the game look at the time he was uncovered yeah and the reason why it was uncovered it <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> was really the cause and the effect because watch the pump fake down the field see he s gonna have the pump fake and that s why the receiver pike see that pump fake right there and then he goes down the field and that s what he s got to be able to hit him because he did the pump fake that call darren right to sit on the pump and then wallace was uncovered and became widel third and 12 nickel for cleveland dayton is coming back there there <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> then <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> has looked pretty good we talked about this level of consistency of it 7 of 11 in the first half 7 to 10 prior to this drought prior to this drive excuse me with this fall sails high over the intended receiver <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines</person> work nearly intercepted so his last two throws it s kind of gotten away from him a little bit so pull the net number 2 roche number 5 and net in the nfl stop that s for the steelers on the play by kirin <person player="keyaron fox" race="nonwhite" position="LB">fox</person> 32 yard punt flag is down at the 40yard line walt anderson is our referee worked super bowl 35 is a wine judge illegal formation and six men on the line of scrimmage of the fiveyard penalty will replay fourth down so theyll do it once again steelers came into today threeinone in the first game welcoming back <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> as you take a look at eric mangini who has lost cribs which was a huge part of the game plan that he offensive ly for his team of course special teams too you can imagine that he loses his quarterback center for wallace you lose the second quarterback take the line now the loss of <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">joshua</person> chris takes this the flag back at the 10 i understand at the 45 there s a 32 line plan in our own illegal chef number 37 offense fiveyard penalty when we play fourth down the state of worcester his peers to the chagrin mike tomlin two consecutive penalties special team here at the friday practice at tomlin his voice could be heard you know barking out or talking to the special teams talking to the defense preparing for those situational moments you know he doesnt like what he sees right now the punt team moving battling for different perspective it seems like that has been a seamless transition from comes another flight from cow in a table fare caught by stall he bothers this one stuck he tries to vacuum it in at the 13 yard line steelers seem to think theyve gotten the ball then a flag was thrown that got the ball carrying facts is the one to grab it let s see what that flag is all about normally its fruits back there stucky who s the one retrieving all punks the ruling on the field is above concrete covered by the kicking team all sides number 23 he fancied the penalty is declined first round that s the fifth time this season that a <person player="daniel sepulveda" race="white" position="P">daniel sepulveda</person> punt has been fumbled and it s got kind of that funky backwards spin on it because they want him to try to down it inside the 10 and the world the wind is swirling down in that end we talked about the muffed punt can not be recovered by the punting team until the ball touches the ground if he tips it and tips it and hits it up in the air he can bobble it all day and still it s his to recover until the ball touches the ground at that point it becomes a live ball and the steelers recover the cleveland 13 first down and 10 <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> and brought down on the play by shieff ring with no game in the play they stay at the 13th so at this series of channel d he s hunt bits berg to give themselves to punting it three times an opportunity to get the ball back and now theyre knocking on the door you know <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> after miss shooting on a couple of passes missing receivers who are wide open on that last possession youd like to be able to stick this one into the end zone and if he does so you know he s going to be looking for <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> one of his favorite red zone targets second turnover today for the cleveland browns where takeaways been a big part of it the steelers have gone to climb out the floor and repeated maybe for one after today to the temp gain of three on the play walk down by ross this is one of those situations where less is more normally they would spread it out now being to throw the ball in this area you can see theyre just content to just pound the running game you know time is on their side and and i think there s bruce <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron</person> is the offensive coordinator they continue to download run place 30 run plays as opposed to 24 pass plays <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> one improve on those red zone possessions when you get the spread formation that s where the end goes to work in the passive that third and seven into the nickel paid with the technical one catch of eight first and gold that s great by joe hey this is a long ball place just stalling out in front of him a little more foot you know <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> is going to get hit it was a good throw by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> i think was right on the money it allowed i think <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> to not only catch it and try to make a move but he turned his back to the defender where joe hayden was able to get him out of bounds thurston gold the to the browns have not given up a rushing touchdown this season only team in the nfl most back touchdown oh yes theyre running the ball again in pittsburgh and theyre doing it <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> they get the ball back after the muff muff they run four offensive plays three of them when run plays and even the pass play was to their running back the flooding star <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> shows displeasure with the play call so the turnover proves costly for the cleveland browns here s the extra point tried by <person player="jeff reed" race="white" position="K">jeff reed</person> 21 degree in 552 play gala for <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> another touchdown he s at three in the last two games honeybag <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> today 24 carries and 77 yards a touchdown one of the two yards right there coupled with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s two touchdown passes 21 to 3 the steal and i think they know what kind of running back they have in the chard middle i think he s food grown he s matured in his role and i think you can allow the offense the run through him and he s going to help give them the balance that theyre looking for on office lead kickoff and victim 5 <person player="lawrence vickers" race="nonwhite" position="RB">vickers</person> run of the up down to the 29 yard 9 yard return and so another look at <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> in his nfl debut 545 of the 43 steelers kick off into the 30 yard line the cleveland browns 1st and 10 itll be interesting to see if they go were there that you want to do that with a rookie quarterback going up against this defense on the road for the secondary to get to the 40 and down ago is escaping the web by <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> at the 34 yard line on a gain of four it s the subway postgame show in new york from jb dan shannon : coach cowher for scores news and highlights that s coming up on the subway postgame show what the conclusion of our game second down and six pictures of the day the bounds woodleigh staring about its a43 a 23yard hit from a pawn so they do go in the nohuddle offense is not hurry up but it is a nohuddle and so he s pointing at this guy he comes back so he was pointing originally and <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> he goes to his left in the progression that comes back to <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> so you love the poise that you see right now from focal point and ive always loved the aqua see i think that s what stands out the most mr tan underneath to <person player="peyton hillis" race="white" position="RB">hillis</person> coulomb oliver threeyard gain to the 40 mario s look at the communication by the young quarterback what a mangini tell us that he called his first play in the huddle and practice and everyone just kind of laughed because he did it in such a commanding voice there theyre like okay well play along but i think this is where you earn your stripes with veteran players second down and seven wide open tight end great looking catch by <person player="evan moore" race="UNK" position="TE">evan moore</person> working on <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> down to the 12 pickup up 27 first down cleveland the moment is not too big for <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> in the fourth quarter they need him to throw the ball you have to take the training wheels off and allow him to attack this defense down the field <person player="evan moore" race="UNK" position="TE">evan moore</person> excellent catch but how about the throw from <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> into the nickel first and channel what pendulous complete if youre a cleveland fan watching at home watching <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> where do you put now this performance and hope for the future i think you had the drums rolling because you almost felt like this kid was going to face the bataan death march coming to face this defense coming into the week but after watching the game you seen that he s been hit buried and harassed but yet he wants to put points on the board right now and i think you are encouraged by what you see from cocacola his defensive pittsburgh is all given up four touchdowns and chants of defense here at heinz field something down in john as a state touchdown <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> on the first career touchdown pass for quarterback <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> hopeful coy is playing with the big boys he made this play his escape ability his ability to lure coverage now watch as he steps up through this window and now the coverage comes up to get him see he dropped coverage to <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> leaves the receiver wide open in the back of the end zone it was simply by the mobility of <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> keeping his vision down the field he had lured the defender towards him uncovered his receiver made a very accurate throw great play by the rookie quarterback weve been talking about <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> extending the play all afternoon that s exactly what the point is exactly what he did there headsup play by <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt</person> before 21 and 10 <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> puts it through coy in his nfl debut because he is the third string quarterback with injuries to dalal min juries to <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> getting the call today next sunday the nfl on cbs delivers double interaction highlighted by the steelers against the dolphins the patriots battling the chargers local listings beginning with the nfl today use the college term ridge we wonder redshirt him they did not want him in this position this early in the year and especially on the road in pittsburgh and he said hey but i didnt embrace the fact that they were willing to sit me im gonna work to come out and play in this game he said look i want to play im a competitor i want to get out he says im excited for this opportunity his head coach eric mangini says look we drafted koco coy and we draft players we dont want some guy going home and hiding underneath the sheets because theyre gonna have to play in a difficult environment under tough circumstances employee has <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person> i think he s answered now you look at the scoreboard you see one thing but if you put the tape he watched how he s playing in this game and how he s growing in terms of his poise and confidence i think you have to be encouraged you know <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> was thrown into a situation when he was a very young player on the road maddox injured his elbow he came in in baltimore of all places and i remember that you know steelers medicine is at the bottom of that pile and also in there going for it for the cleveland browns as <person player="marcus benard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">marcus</person> bernard a lot of ins speakable things go on in that huddle and then drama youve you fall youve gone after loose balls before you know what im talking let me go back to the super bowl remember sean payton s gutsy call at halftime to chimps at onside kick that ball change sands at the bottom of the pile and a super ball hung in the balance that s top punch it is riding on he gets that ball and that s how much is going on at the bottom of the pile it s a omit area onside kick and watch how many guys touch that ball there s a couple there s two three looks like it was more in the hands of someone with a gold jersey on but look at this down there at the bottom of the pile scrapping in calling for the ball now if youre the pittsburgh steelers remember i think it was mike tomlin said hey at this situation fourminute offense we want to pound the running game and if there s a cleveland browns on deeper you got to know that s what they intend to do that both blend it all and read the back first in ten knock down the rafacz dolphin to the 36 on a gain of three this is where the ability to run the football pays off for team who does it well i told you dj war could bring the heat i dont he s gonna kiss you right there on the team good hit hook tackle but that 4minute offense that s what helps you to close out games this is what they did in the days of <person player="jerome harrison" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jerome</person> bettis this is what they hope to do now that <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> has stepped up and become their primary one fans into the backfield with <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> rock down she pulling on a gain of four theyll put him at the 32 with both teams enjoying three timeouts remaining in the game are the cleveland browns defensively you got a scrape you got a claw trying to get the ball out you got some young runners for the pittsburgh steelers <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">isaac</person> greteman one year player out of bowie state then youve got other guys who are not used to finishing out ballgames carrying the football even <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> is in his third year so you have young runners got to make sure they secure the ball you got to continue to test their ability to hold on to 30 belong to one for space by the linebacker expected yeah well i think he played better earlier i dont expect it i know mike tomlin doesnt either he has thrown the ball well in all the previous moments now you say well why is the ball selling high on him now i think he s getting little overanxious that s when youre trying to do a little bit too much and maybe not following through with the correct technique and fundamental desert his back about 12 miles an hour as we watch the pulpitis punt the two 29yard well placement by <person player="daniel sepulveda" race="white" position="P">daniel sepulveda</person> and <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> will be marooned at his three and the cleveland browns get another opportunity to get the ball two minutes 30 seconds to go and you allow your young quarterback to grow up in these kinds of moments i wouldnt be afraid to put it on his shoulders i wouldnt be afraid or timid to ask him to lead my office down the field with 2:30 to go and youre down by 11 byun monday is coming as another defensive back for the pittsburgh steelers weve got five back there first in town from a court chauncey <person player="chansi stuckey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stuckey</person> and the tackle made by james very at the 14 yard line pickup of eleven what a <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>

position="QB">mccoy</person> and watch the form and the pocket just collapsed he could not escape they had him well contained this kid is growing up and we talked about this being the most difficult of positions to step in from any rookie quarterback to get his first nfl start against a dick lebeau whose humble it s deep it s out of though they could become any more complicated or any more difficult than that certainly one that lives today <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> the other end line the return of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> recall the last time these two teams played each other last december in cleveland 13 six browns win they got to <person player="ben

position="LB">timmons</person> with his first interception of the season he s looking for his intended receiver off to the left side of your screen now he s going to be hit thrown behind just a hair behind <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> then it ends up in the hands of the defender and so the ball is going to be ricocheted and this is just good it was just a tough deal and <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> comes down with it and he tried to get it in to a tight window off the back hip of <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> keep your head up kid because came into a tough position and he competed well played out in <person player="floyd womack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">floyd womack</person> he got backed up on that sideline and he appears to be ok returning picked up by <person player="derreck robinson" race="UNK" position="DE">robinson</person> aint knew about the 14 yard line it picks up for the bounce of the ball we talked about the interception on his first possession of the game now the game has slowed down for him he is beginning to see things and he was willing to take some chances and challenge this defense led him on a scoring drive for a touchdown at huh he made some other throws or maybe if a receivers giving a greater effort could have been completed that one was on the back hip of the tight end into being intercept numbers on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> couple touchdown passes at one interception himself hayden picked that went off early in the game but they extend the field and that s where my top one told us a couple days ago we gotta get that long pass back in our offense and they had especially to us six <person player="derreck robinson" race="UNK" position="DE">robinson</person> among the many over there making the stop down to the 13 in the game of er and in all that 8 27 carries 84 yards <person player="derreck robinson" race="UNK" position="DE">robinson</person> josh <person player="joshua cribbs" race="UNK" position="WR">cribbs</person> left early gavin drilled in the earhole of his helmet by harrison on a 10 as he was in the wild he left the game mexicoís left the game with the same similar hit were operating with a lot of their playbook going into today taken away the wildcat was gonna be a prominent part of their offense we knew and mike tomlin and leveland our excuse me the pittsburgh steelers facing murderers row on the road at myapp then at the defending super bowl champion new orleans saints then on the road against the divisional opponent and the cincinnati bengals and back home to play host to the new england patriots open papa burger returns just in town the tops third down in six weapon in the backfield no touchdown he didnt shell the ground <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> with his third touchdown finished theyre still coaching and it s all about execution after several older throws here in the fourth quarter for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> they dial up yet another pass to guess who s inside the redzone leaf milling and a water throw by big ben needing to settle down here in the fourth quarter first four games they had three touchdown passes ps3 alone in this game today a minute before me 10 pittsburgh on the read extra point wont 25 to play the game well about as good of outcome of this game right now for the pittsburgh steelers with the performance of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> getting the balance who talked about before running gas all in all against the divisional opponent the team to beat you last time they played not too bad and i think he would tell you he missed on some throws late in the ballgame i think he got off to a real good and early start i think he s gonna tell you you know yeah there had to be some nervous jitters coming into this game such high expectations from the fans here he knows that he needed to live what was the nfl s last ranked passing attack and he made those plays down the field he led this football team it and he didnt do anything to disrupt i think the balance in the winning formula that had existed in the previous four games prior to his return <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> is out of timeouts if he gets the ball back here is reading any turnovers today for the cleveland browns feedback is joe heat it s berg steelers then the second game at home and theyll go to four and one will drop to one in five of way the saints next week 21yard return up to the 23 saints in the bottle and then the patriots in the jets theyve had the toughest schedule so far on paper and that buy could help them get a cynical wallace or <person player="jake delhomme" race="white" position="QB">jake delhomme</person> back before taking on the new england patriots and the new york jets but you know that trip to new orleans that rule we had difficult tags theyll in the backfield first down and jennifer <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> the 23 narrows in the water tripped him up no gain on the play look at the jersey of coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> i think

younger brother play for the texas longhorns you team in second down in town nice job with his block on women more with the catch working on mcfinn grab and the 42 35 yard hit and a first down every

theyre seeing from the young man because he continues to fight and we talked about his accuracy i dont know that we could talk about it enough that was one heck of a throw earlier for 27 yards first and 10 a little catch there by <person player="mike bell" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike bell</person> who played for new orleans a season ago and has a super bowl ring to show it he was traded for number 92 defense that penalty is declined first down harrison good coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> this is the previous pass play down the field to <person player="evan moore" race="UNK" position="TE">evan moore</person> and look at it it is willing to take a chance out on the edges of the defense look at this dad on the money great thrown first and 10 just a will time defensive play by brian <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> a quarterback watching a big lanky time in yeah and moore is a big guy so that s where you do you put it up high he put on the upfield shoulder where only your guy can get it where <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> cant cut underneath for the interception might have been a little bit early on that connection your trial account shut down engine still find such defense attacks 29 yard line gain of three more was it the green bank bringing camp last year and he started to come on in the second half of last season with the cleveland browns where he really you know he s showed in practice they put him in games and continued to make plays there i dont play the game third and seven the bounce four seconds to play <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> and thatll be with
