six defensive backs for cincinnati on third and 10 and a mixup, as <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> had trouble taking the snap from center and bill walshs team does not start well and <person player="leo barker" race="UNK" position="LB">leo barker</person>, 53, and <person player="jesse sapolu" race="white" position="C">jesse sapolu</person>, 61, talking more than about their vacation plans &gt;&gt;

look at 65, montoya, that right guard hes the one who throws the key block and then <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> cuts in behind it second and 2 brooks on a reverse it doesnt fool <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeff fuller</person> no gain <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> the strong safety, number 49 a big play defensively, the 49ers joining <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> and well give you that defensive lineup in just a moment one of the things that throws us off rhythm is that quick huddle of cincinnatis and thats why sometimes we may be a little slow in getting to a replay or giving you information because we dont want to get trapped by that quick huddle, that attack huddle of cincinnati heres the first example &gt;&gt; one of the things that we were going to be keeping an eye on today would gordon wells, the umpire, stand over that football and wait until substitutes were out on the field? &gt;&gt; <person player="eddie brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> again in motion on third and 3 <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> plowing to a first down at the san francisco 43! <person player="charles haley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles haley</person> comes up pushing and shoving now the defense for the 49ers roberts, <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person> pro bowler on the nose <person player="kevin fagan" race="white" position="DE">kevin fagan</person> the linebackers <person player="charles haley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles haley</person> hes going to the pro bowl <person player="jim fahnhorst" race="UNK" position="LB">fahnhorst</person> <person player="michael walter" race="white" position="LB">michael walter</person>, the leading tackler and veteran <person player="keena turner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">keena turner</person> <person player="tim mckyer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim mckyer</person> and <person player="don griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">don griffin</person>, who held out at the start of the year in fact, they were offered for trade by walsh and theyre joined by two great safeties <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person> and <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeff fuller</person> two tight ends for cincinnati first down at the 49er 44 <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> again no playaction and <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer</person> incomplete to <person player="rodney holman" race="nonwhite" position="TE">rodney holman</person> <person player="michael walter" race="white" position="LB">michael walter</person> was there and walter would have had him for a loss had he caught the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> it was <person player="charles haley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">haley</person> applying the pressure on <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> &gt;&gt; and that particular play extremely dangerous its called sellout playaction it looks exactly like a running play boomer, a good job of handling the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> only one receiver downfield &gt;&gt; you say "sellout" in other words, youre saying all the other players are blocking as if thats really a run theres nothing fake about that &gt;&gt; youre attacking the strength of the defense, their ability to react and you show them run all the way, only one receiver out, and then you try and get deep theyve scored often on that play this year &gt;&gt; it was <person player="eddie brown" race="UNK" position="WR">eddie brown</person> deep, but he was covered by two men second down <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> and the rookie from university of nevada, las vegas, each carry has handed a handsome result to the bengals he gets 5 on that one &gt;&gt; heres the hurryup offense theyre right back to the line now lets see how long theyll hold san francisco not sending the subs onto the field so <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> will take his time here and this is what the attack offense is designed to do theyre saying, "we dont want you to get all your subs onto the field" san francisco obliging in this case &gt;&gt; third down and 5 45second clock at 6 incomplete <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim mcgee</person>, the intended receiver <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeff fuller</person> was there for san francisco and here comes the kicking team on for cincinnati its punter <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">lee johnson</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="tim mckyer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mckyer</person> up late to cover <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> in a hard position to catch and <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> is lucky he didnt get hurt on that play the line of scrimmage, the 39yard line so that would mean the field goal out in the 50s so <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">lee johnson</person> in to punt <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person>, a dangerous return man, and <person player="terry greer" race="nonwhite" position="WR">terry greer</person> both with plenty of speed are deep bradys snap you saw a good catch by <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> and downed inside the 5 [ crowd cheering ] ray horton got the big bounce and the 49ers will start from their 3yard line no score 8:16 left in the first quarter capricious winds here at joe robbie stadium and look at this snap go sailing and <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">lee johnson</person> does a great job of catching the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> and even better at placing it inside the 5, where <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> starts at the 3 no score midway, first quarter <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person> out to the 11yard line and <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> slow getting up for cincinnati and hes not up yet oh, of all the players, merlin olsen, on defense that cincinnati could not afford to lose, there it is 69 so <person player="steve wallace" race="nonwhite" position="OT">steve wallace</person> fractures an ankle on the third play of the super bowl and on just the 14th play of the game, <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> suffers a serious injury we have 8:06 left in this first quarter that is rather extraordinary to have two such serious injuries so quickly second and 2 <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> at his 11 right through where <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> normally would be and thatll be close to a first down, as <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person> applies the hit on <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">david grant</person>, a rookie from west virginia, number 98, has replaced <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> &gt;&gt; right in the center of your screen and he is perhaps the strongest in fact is the strongest of the defensive linemen but what you lose in there is experience and passrush ability and, of course, the leadership that a <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> provides to that defense &gt;&gt; <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> getting a hand from the fans as he passes down at the far end of the field going back to the locker room and a man who is so incredibly competitive its a first down, san francisco they say, "get out of his way just getting off the bus" you know, you work so hard to get here this is the supreme moment and now its lost for him fractured left leg, tibia, is the first report thats the big bone of the lower leg is the report we get <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> underneath tight end john frank at the 21yard line a gain of about 8 yards &gt;&gt; we talked about keeping <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> out of rhythm the cincinnati defense were able to do that in the first series you see whats happening now as <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> begins to get things flowing here and, of course, that will be easier with <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> out of the lineup &gt;&gt; well, they thought that cross would need help from the guards to stop <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> now cross, the veteran center playing his last game, may be able to handle the rookie <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> and a first down at the 33 <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> what an incredible star he has become in four years in college, he caught 51 touchdowns at mississippi valley state you say, "well, mississippi valley state, fine school, but smalluniversity program" but in four years in the nfl, <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> has caught 49 touchdowns 100 touchdowns in eight years four in college, four in the nfl over the head of <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person> <person player="lewis billups" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis billups</person> on the coverage and a flag is down &gt;&gt; <person player="harris barton" race="white" position="OT">harris barton</person> ended up without a helmet on that play and the penalty will go against the cincinnati bengals &gt;&gt; yeah, roughing the passer, <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> the last third and 10, <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> converted to <person player="tom rathman" race="white" position="RB">rathman</person> on a little ad lib thats <person player="mike wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wilson</person> in motion <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> incomplete to <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> and that will bring on <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">mike cofer</person> from north carolina state in his first year as the placekicker for san francisco he beat out the veteran ray wersching at the start of the year and this first one will be around 41, 42 yards cofer, on the year, made 27 of 38 his longest 52 yards you see hes had very little opportunity in the playoffs two games, only one try and that was that placement on the fair catch of a punt 60 yards 42 yards down the middle and san francisco takes the early lead, 30 &gt;&gt; special teams have a special wristband in this game "the bruise crew" lynn stiles has a little recognition for his troops out on the field &gt;&gt; kickoff by <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">cofer</person> <person player="stanford jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stanford jennings</person> will take the touchback first down at the 20 the team that scored first has lost the last four super bowls but overall in the previous 22, the team that has scored first has won 15 and lost 7 remember denver last year jumped out 100 <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> gets his first call out to the 22 or 23yard line short yardage as they ran in behind <person player="brian blados" race="white" position="OT">brian blados</person> &gt;&gt; dick lebeau, defensive coordinator for this bengal team, talking to his troops about what theyre going to have to do to shut down walshs offense &gt;&gt; we understand theyre taking let you listen to lebeau <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> by helicopter to the hospital he suffered fractures to both bones of the lower leg the tibia and fibula much like tim daggetts injury over at rotterdam the great us gymnast <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> picks up a first down across the 30 and takes the umpire with him <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeff fuller</person> made the tackle, number 49 &gt;&gt; san franciscos defense doing a lot of jumping around just before the snap and, of course, one of the key players in this whole puzzle <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeff fuller</person>, number 49 look how hes running up just at the snap of the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> of course, taking away the presnap read by the offensive quarterback, <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer esiason</person> but didnt help much there, as <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> found some room to run and picked up the first down dick, one of the things that this bengal offense has done theyve started quick in the playoffs 35 of their 42 points in the playoffs in the first half &gt;&gt; down to the final 1:35 of the first quarter <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> again his fifth carry oh, is he hit! what a pop by <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person>, the veteran from southern california now, there is a man who has made his living making tackles like that for eight great years with the 49ers &gt;&gt; i tell you, you hear that kind of shot <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lott</person> has knocked himself out a half a dozen times making that kind of tackle &gt;&gt; and hes giving over 30 pounds away on that hit first time that the 49ers have stopped <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> he had carried four times for 28 yards prior to that gain of only 1 <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> on the roll and incomplete <person player="jim riggs" race="UNK" position="TE">jim riggs</person>, the tight end, the intended receiver nose tackle <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person> applying pressure san francisco 49ers leading 30 final seconds, first quarter it is third and 9 well, a long 8 nearly 9 yards <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person> slipping up to the line of scrimmage <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> down the middle almost intercepted by lott! he moved up to the line and then, when the snap was made, drifted back and almost picked it off &gt;&gt; <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person> is one of the smartest defensive players in the nfl he plays that spy position so well, just watching he sneaks up inside they think hes gonna blitz no, hes not dropping back reading the quarterback he knew exactly where that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> was going to go what great anticipation from that pro bowl safety &gt;&gt; <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">lee johnson</person> to punt dangerous <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person> at the other end great kick and <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person> showing you the shiftiness of foot, clever spins, and almost worked his way free <person player="leo barker" race="UNK" position="LB">leo barker</person>, 53, made the tackle final seconds, first quarter <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> onehanded catch! oh, my! is he in bounds? <person player="lewis billups" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis billups</person> there and rice, a dazzling play a first down at the 45yard line &gt;&gt; <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> answering those people who were asking about his ankle bill walsh held <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> out of practice two days earlier in this week injured ankle some said smoke screen well, perhaps so <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> already an effective receiver but he didnt catch that with his ankle what a grab &gt;&gt; brilliant player drafted in the first round by the 49ers in 85 to this side it comes to craig eludes two men and finally brought down by <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fulcher</person> at the cincinnati 46 8 more yards and that probably the last play of this opening quarter <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person> on the first play of the second quarter needed only a yard and a half for a first down gets more than that and the 49ers have it now at the cincinnati 41 of course, the result of krumries injury as you look at his replacement, <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">david grant</person> is that <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> has had time you said earlier, merlin, one of the keys to the game to take <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> out of his rhythm and when <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> was in there that first series, they did that not since &gt;&gt; and the other thing that is really serious for you defensively <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> has had all kinds of time to throw the football &gt;&gt; he throws deep <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> is wide open! [ crowd cheering ] out of bounds at the 11yard line <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david fulcher</person> was applying pressure that left single coverage &gt;&gt; mantoman when you blitz and you isolate on a great receiver like this with one person, youre just asking for this to happen in patterns like this, i dont think anyone can cover <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> mantoman &gt;&gt; <person player="solomon wilcots" race="nonwhite" position="DB">solomon wilcots</person> came over to save a touchdown the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> is right on the 10yard line they have the full 10 to go <person player="tom rathman" race="white" position="RB">rathman</person> hes stopped after a 1yard pickup <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person> has played a big first half thus far another tackle for the threetime allivy league star &gt;&gt; bill walsh would love to get out to a quick lead here because he knows that this bengal team is not a comefrombehind team if you can get out there, get some quick points on them, build a lead early, they have not been able to come back from that during the season &gt;&gt; <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> on the 9yard line second down they can conceivably make a first down without scoring a touchdown <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> had john frank angling from his tight end position but, under pressure, could not find his receiver its third and a long 8 &gt;&gt; <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> upset about something bill walsh calling those first 25 plays offensively off a script, a preset script and what hell use those plays to do is to evaluate the responses of the defense how do they cover motion? what do they do in placement of personnel against these various formations? he files that information away and will use it later in the ballgame &gt;&gt; four wide receivers for san francisco and its rathman! what a call! they bring in four wide receivers and then just give it to the big fullback right up the middle and it appeared for a moment he was on his way for 6, rathman, who was finally stopped by two defensive backs horton and <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fulcher</person> its fourth down inside the 2 fourth down and a long yard for a first down and less than 2 for a touchdown &gt;&gt; bill walsh, apparently, is going to go for it on fourth down here well &gt;&gt; in super bowl xix in pontiac, remember, it was a goalline defense by san francisco in the third quarter that may have decided the game now its the bengals call bill walsh, after some time to think about it, has decided to bring on his fieldgoal team its a long yard down there, and they dont want to come away empty so cofer, apparently, is on for a fieldgoal try, a short one of about 19 yards &gt;&gt; sam wyche had a call like that in a game against seattle a few weeks ago elected to go for it on a fourth and 2 yards said later that if he had known it was that far, he wouldnt have gone for it of course, that would have iced that game and it later proved to be a point, although they did not get back into the ballgame &gt;&gt; <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">cofer</person> to kick helton, the punter, is the holder ooh bad snap [ crowd cheering ] and he misses to the left the snap or the hold confused they werent able to spot it and <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">cofer</person> hooks it wide to the left <person player="chuck thomas" race="white" position="C">chuck thomas</person>, the snapper and so now walsh will have to secondguess himself as he goes to the man who snapped the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> they come away empty from the 2yard line &gt;&gt; bad snap look where that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> comes in low and right on the knee no chance for the holder to get that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> down and the timing is destroyed you end up with a hooked kick and thats the shortest missed field goal in super bowl history &gt;&gt; and that after bill walsh, for a moment, was tempted to go for it now i guess he wishes he had so it remains 30 2 minutes gone, second quarter <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> to <person player="eddie brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> incomplete defensive play by <person player="don griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">don griffin</person> from middle tennessee state, number 29 his brother played three years <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james</person> with cincinnati as a defensive back esiasons numbers were not good down the stretch after a brilliant start passing the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> and leading the nfl how do you look at him throwing so far, merlin? &gt;&gt; hes had the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> pretty well on target, dick and it looks like hes throwing it with pretty good velocity &gt;&gt; hes missed the last five in a row <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> gains only a couple &gt;&gt; i think youve got to credit a lot of those misses to some fine defensive hits and some good defensive plays on that last play, for example, it was just great coverage &gt;&gt; <person player="michael walter" race="white" position="LB">michael walter</person>, 99, and <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person>, 95, collaborated on the tackle &gt;&gt; walter coming off his best year ever an impact player in fact, bill walsh talking about his best two defensive players walters name was one, along with <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person> but ill tell you, <person player="bruce kozerski" race="UNK" position="OG">kozerski</person> has done a fine job on <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person> so far in this ballgame &gt;&gt; the center, <person player="bruce kozerski" race="UNK" position="OG">bruce kozerski</person>, against <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carter</person> thats a key matchup third down and long <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> to <person player="eddie brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> short of the first down <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person> makes the hit at the 28yard line &gt;&gt; now, how can you end up short of the first down? you know what you got to get to pick up this first down <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> did his part <person player="eddie brown" race="UNK" position="WR">eddie brown</person> not playing that one very smart &gt;&gt; <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lott</person> is just that a "lott" of football player <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">lee johnson</person> to punt hes had a couple of good kicks <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person> at the 29 of san francisco beautiful spiral up in that wind floating away from taylor he picks it up dangerously and then breaks through the pack! and now he has an open field! 30! one man to beat! horton and horton gets him out of bounds at the 47 of cincinnati what a play by taylor! it appeared he was making a mistake by picking up the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> that had floated away from him and then he ran right through the bengal team &gt;&gt; i think sometimes a player who has obviously done something that they know is going to bring the wrath of the coach down upon them and i think thats what happens here he misjudges this football theres a surge of adrenaline through his body right at this moment but he looked back he knew he had a little time &gt;&gt; not much &gt;&gt; so dangerous to reach down and grab that football very often that play backfires on you but here it proves to be a big plus for san francisco &gt;&gt; the 49ers, leading 30, get a big return of 45 yards on a 63yard punt and then <person player="harry sydney" race="UNK" position="RB">harry sydney</person> falling on the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> back at the 44yard line sydney, a backup to <person player="tom rathman" race="white" position="RB">tom rathman</person> &gt;&gt; dangerous play, dick thats a lateral he throws this back out it might have been a double pass but <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fulcher</person> right there on top of it if <person player="harry sydney" race="UNK" position="RB">sydney</person> doesnt get down on that football, <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fulcher</person> is going to scoop it up and that would be a big turnover for cincinnati &gt;&gt; 9yard loss second and 19 <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> goes down at the 42 <person player="jason buck" race="UNK" position="DE">jason buck</person> <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">david grant</person> also there and <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">grant</person> down around the ankles made a little move they might have had a stunt on &gt;&gt; well, if <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">david grant</person> can grow into the big shoes left vacant when <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> had to leave the field, that will be one of the big stories of this ballgame he did a good at getting around the center on that one randy cross, trying to scramble with him, didnt do his job very well on that play &gt;&gt; third down and 21 craig 50 fumbles! and cincinnatis <person player="jim skow" race="white" position="DE">jim skow</person> recovers at the 41yard line [ crowd cheering ] &gt;&gt; as you saw sam wyche saying, "snake eyes" theyll come right out, theyll run the play without a huddle he said, "weve stung them once, lets sting them again" and theyll have a play all set for this situation &gt;&gt; craig with some brilliant highkicking running, that patented style of his, breaking into the open and trying perhaps for too much and that was <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fulcher</person> who applied the hit and fulcher, the pro bowler, has had a big game cris collinsworth, the veteran wide receiver, who played down in this part of the country university of florida makes the catch out at the 47yard line so the first turnover of the game to cincinnati and at this point, just judging what weve felt and seen, merlin, the 49ers, you would figure, would be up by a considerable score but its a 30 game &gt;&gt; very dangerous to have so much opportunity and to only have 3 points on the board &gt;&gt; on second and 4 <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person>! first down at the san francisco 42 <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lott</person> and fuller, two safeties, make the stop first down, cincinnati brooks with a 10yard pickup &gt;&gt; pulling both the right guard and tackle mu√±oz and <person player="bruce reimers" race="UNK" position="OL">reimers</person> 78 and 75 big hit over there by mu√±oz and brooks, if you give him room inside, one of the quickest backs in the nfl &gt;&gt; he still has happy feet who wouldnt be happy behind a <person player="guy mcintyre" race="nonwhite" position="OG">guy</person> like mu√±oz? trailing 30 <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> good protection oh, throws into a crowd <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> had four men on him there were four red shirts within 3 yards of mcgee, and <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> drilled it in lucky to be incomplete &gt;&gt; look at the excellent protection by the offensive line here look at the amount of time he has back there nobody in the picture yet nobody there nobody there finally, roberts, number 91, into the picture but, boomer, you get that much time, youve got to find somebody and get them the ball, my friend &gt;&gt; and he elected to throw to mcgee, who was blanketed second and 10 threw it away he wanted collinsworth on the out and up, but that isnt what developed <person player="larry roberts" race="nonwhite" position="DE">larry roberts</person> did, number 91, and he was in the face of <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> &gt;&gt; just looking at <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> down there remember early in the ballgame he took a hit on his knee and i said he was lucky not to be hurt? i think he may have hurt that knee a little bit there he is he looks to be limping a little bit and, of course, hes the fastest of those wide receivers, and a leg injury is very critical to the speed receiver [ crowd cheering ] &gt;&gt; <person player="charles haley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles haley</person> and danny <person player="daniel stubbs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">stubbs</person> stubbs, who played at the university of miami, a rookie picked in the second round by san francisco, finally gets the sack <person player="larry roberts" race="nonwhite" position="DE">larry roberts</person> was in there greg cox, who comes in in the nickel package and <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> had no time &gt;&gt; the 49ers roll six defensive linemen in and out of the game they always have freshlegged, fast pass rushers in there and <person player="daniel stubbs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">stubbs</person> has come on as one of the best of them he was there to take <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> down &gt;&gt; cincinnati again unable to move the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> deep enough for a score and johnsons kick these are dangerous and taylor says, "im gonna faircatch" at the 11yard line so timeout super bowl xxiii midway through the second quarter and its the 49ers leading by a field goal <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer esiason</person> has not had a good first half the 49ers lead 30 and they start from just outside the 10 with <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person>, who is twisted down at the 12 <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david fulcher</person> again he played at arizona state they call him the rock and at 63" and 228, that is a hunk of granite indeed in that secondary for the bengals well, the second and third periods if youre an afc fan, you might as well go out and take a walk look at that 1166, the nfc has outscored the afc in the last four games in the second and third periods a little wide of <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person> is <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> and theres no question, merlin, the wind is affecting those passes to the sidelines &gt;&gt; they are fluttering <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> has been icing down his right hand and, of course, thats not his throwing hand he had a finger partially dislocated and damaged earlier in the playoffs and they say that is not a problem now theres <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david fulcher</person> boy, thats thats a big safety ill tell you that <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> dumps it off to craig and craig has a first down, i believe its going to be very close <person player="leo barker" race="UNK" position="LB">barker</person> and <person player="barney bussey" race="UNK" position="DB">bussey</person> lets see where they spot it oh, thats gonna be a measurement right at the 20plus, and thats where he had to go what a weapon craig is out of that backfield, as youve mentioned so often just a long handoff just get him someplace in the open and with his running talent, let him go &gt;&gt; part of walshs philosophy is to spread that defense with pass patterns and then get the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> to a running back and, of course, at that point, youve got everybody stretched out you got room to run &gt;&gt; and another four downs for the 49ers that was a big play for cincinnatis defense, a chance to force the 49ers to punt and get pretty good field position but <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to craig and that melody has been a happy one for san francisco fans craig <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fulcher</person> &gt;&gt; what a great play again we keep mentioning his name boy, ill tell you &gt;&gt; goliath &gt;&gt; he is pumped up at one point earlier in the season, they didnt want to put him on the scales he was heavier than <person player="jim skow" race="white" position="DE">jim skow</person>, the defensive end he was over 245 <person player="jim skow" race="white" position="DE">skow</person> was under 245 there he is, 33, middle of your screen, on 33 and he gets him down &gt;&gt; youve got to be big and strong to get craig, who has those powerful legs, on those cutbacks second and 10 <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> and john frank, the tight end, fighting off one tackle <person player="joe kelly" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe kelly</person> missed him and a flag is down &gt;&gt; <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">david grant</person> made a fine move inside on randy cross might have been cross trying to save the sack on <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> [ crowd cheering ] &gt;&gt; oh, what a hit! <person player="skip mcclendon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">skip mcclendon</person>, who starred at arizona state he lost his starting job late in the year and in a passing situation, hes a light tackle they say hes light at 275 if hes that &gt;&gt; he made a fine play there when someone goes down when <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> went down, you knew that players in that defense had to say to themselves, "what are we going to do now? ive got to reach down and get something extra" <person player="skip mcclendon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mcclendon</person> did that on that play <person player="david grant" race="nonwhite" position="DT">grant</person> is doing it this defense playing pretty headsup football at this moment &gt;&gt; <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> with a screen to craig and a flag down, as craig goes down at the 13yard line &gt;&gt; pass interference number 61, offense blocking downfield prior to the pass being thrown penalty declined fourth down &gt;&gt; thats a tough call, and many times it isnt seen, that screen pass and those blockers out in front just guessing when the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> is completed and <person player="jesse sapolu" race="white" position="C">sapolu</person> was premature in his block so cincinnati will get good field position this kick, remember, into the wind or at least the kicks going left to right in all the warmups were not traveling as far <person player="barry helton" race="white" position="P">barry helton</person>, from colorado a fourthround draft pick <person player="ira hillary" race="UNK" position="WR">ira hillary</person>, the deep man, cincinnati at the 45 in bengal territory very high and taken by ray horton and horton was a star punt returner at washington returns to the san francisco 43yard line greg cox made the tackle 37yard punt 5 yards on the return and theres the story with 4:04 remaining in the first half brooks in motion <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> right into the pileup at the 41yard line &gt;&gt; dick, thats only <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> fourth run of the day i really felt coming into this ballgame that if the bengals did not take advantage of their strongest offensive asset that big offensive line and <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> strength as a runner thats his seventh of the day okay i must have looked at the firstquarter stats seventh run of the day but he has not been the kind of factor so far in this ballgame that i expected him to be and i think theyve got to start wearing down this san francisco defense with that running game &gt;&gt; meanwhile, <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> is averaging only 3 yards a pass has a man open mcgee! and a first down at the 23 the deepest penetration of the half for cincinnati <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person> made the tackle all time this is all time hall of famers otto graham sid luckman norm van brocklin per attempt and <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer esiason</person>, in his <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">young</person> career, fourth with an 8plus thats per attempt, not per completion today, per completion, prior to that last pass, averaging only 3 yards &gt;&gt; and youre absolutely right there its at 43 now &gt;&gt; that includes that pass to <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> &gt;&gt; and that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> did not have great velocity on it its the strength of his arm that impressed us earlier in the year &gt;&gt;

the give to craig cincinnati looking for the pass and the 49ers run it and get 10 big yards out to the 35yard line and without a huddle, <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> brings them right back to the line of scrimmage into the final minute of this first half a 33 tie &gt;&gt; heres a situation where theyre gonna try and catch them in the automatic defense, force them to make the audible here, and try to get the big play &gt;&gt; throw underneath to craig incomplete he did not have control <person player="barney bussey" race="UNK" position="DB">barney bussey</person>, an extra defensive back, was covering craig 41 seconds left in the half second and 10 the one player you know that the cincinnati defense is going to be sure theyve located is number 80, <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> and its <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> to the near side number 80 <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> dragged down at the 31yard line! <person player="jim skow" race="white" position="DE">jim skow</person> and <person player="jason buck" race="UNK" position="DE">jason buck</person> the two <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">young</person> defensive ends <person player="jason buck" race="UNK" position="DE">buck</person> in his second year from byu he was their numberone pick after winning the outland trophy award with the cougars of byu &gt;&gt;

not as good a position to rush the punter here because if you do get a roughing call, it would give them a first down &gt;&gt; <person player="barry helton" race="white" position="P">helton</person> was picked high in the draft last spring, in 88 fourth round one of the three punters to make it in the nfl, rookie punters and he replaced <person player="max montoya" race="white" position="OG">max</person> runager, the veteran, who went on to cleveland he averaged 39plus on the season &gt;&gt; i asked the question, why replace both the kickers at the same time? and the answer was very simple the kickers were so close they were related by marriage "joined at the hip," i think, was what lynn stiles said and he said it would have been very difficult to put one rookie together with one of those vets and cut the other one and their feeling was, better to go ahead and start with two <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">young</person> kickers and let them come on and develop &gt;&gt;

lets look at <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer esiason</person>s stats that is not much to be proud of and this is a quarterback that is the mvp of the nfl but he has not done it here in this ballgame &gt;&gt;

second down, 2 1/2 <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> has the first down at the 47yard line <person player="michael walter" race="white" position="LB">michael walter</person> and <person player="larry roberts" race="nonwhite" position="DE">larry roberts</person> spearheaded the charge a 4yard gain walter played at oregon he and walsh are on the same page they celebrate their birthday together on november 30th time remaining in the fourth quarter it seems a long time since a super bowl game has been this close the last time the game was decided in the fourth quarter as you look at the torn sod here at joe robbie stadium was in pasadena when washington and riggins beat miami that was six games ago <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> a couple <person player="larry roberts" race="nonwhite" position="DE">larry roberts</person> hes played a big game number 91 in his third year with the 49ers &gt;&gt; hes really matured during this year, become an effective pass rusher and rundown specialist in fact, they have him playing both ways they like to flipflop everybody else in there, but he stays in pretty much all the time &gt;&gt; we understand <person player="steve wallace" race="nonwhite" position="OT">steve wallace</person>, who fractured his ankle, the 49er tackle he is being casted and is here in the locker room at joe robbie stadium <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> incomplete and theyre going to rule that <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> was down and in the grasp that is a sack for <person player="larry roberts" race="nonwhite" position="DE">larry roberts</person> and <person player="charles haley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles haley</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> weve seen him rolling out more tonight, by far, than we have seen him in the past and haley, whos been relatively silent, coming very quickly off the lefthand side to get <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> before he could get that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> away &gt;&gt; three wide receivers to the right third and long 15 to go collinsworth was the intended receiver at the 37yard line and <person player="charles haley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles haley</person> again applying the pressure &gt;&gt; those are the kind of passes that <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer</person> made so very successfully early in this season we havent seen him accurately deliver those balls in the last few weeks he certainly has not been able to do it tonight &gt;&gt; boy, after the <person player="stanford jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stanford jennings</person> touchdown with a kickoff return of 93 yards, have the 49ers turned that emotion around they quickly marched to a score in four plays, 85 yards <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to rice, the payoff, 14 now theyve stopped <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> and cincinnati, and they get it right back with 11 minutes to go fair catch, taylor that wasnt a very good faircatch signal i dont know if theyre gonna allow it or not san francisco recovers the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> taylor really didnt get his hand up it was kind of halfhearted and that would have been cincinnatis <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> if recovered by the bengals alertly, <person player="darryl pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darryl pollard</person>, 26, fell on it &gt;&gt; hes got to get that hand up and wave it he didnt do it ooh, and he took his eye off of that football boy, theyre lucky they didnt get that one taken away from them &gt;&gt; at the 18yard line 13 all, the score 11 minutes to go <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> going for the big bomb to <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> what a catch by rice! unbelievable, again! [ crowd cheering ] &gt;&gt; earlier in the week, when there was talk of an injury to rices ankle, i think <person player="lewis billups" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis billups</person> was probably the happiest <person player="guy mcintyre" race="nonwhite" position="OG">guy</person> in miami but the story was not true theres a man who doesnt have a sore ankle at least hes running like a man with two healthy ankles <person player="lewis billups" race="UNK" position="DB">billups</person> with his hands full and rice, again, the amazing play &gt;&gt; human highlight film his coach in college, archie cooley, said he could catch a bb at midnight <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person> slashes to the 31yard line and the combination of <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> catching the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> and <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person> both catching and running look at the totals theyre racking up they are the san francisco offense &gt;&gt; youve got to believe that the way this bengal defense has risen to the occasion without their best player, <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person>, has taken a lot out of them emotionally but right at this moment in that huddle, theyre saying one thing "we cant backslide now lets go get them lets shut them down its still tied on the scoreboard" &gt;&gt; craig again and sealing off the outside was <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person> hes played a tough game at that linebacker position want to duck in something we understand theyre telling us that <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">tim krumrie</person> despite the fact he wanted to stay here, watch the game, see his team come in off the field the doctors now have ordered <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> to go to a nearby hospital for all the proper precautionary reasons shock and that sort of thing so <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> has left now at the 32yard line third down and 4 craig no he goes the other way, to <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> and its knocked away, incomplete it was <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person> <person player="john taylor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john taylor</person> on the near sideline &gt;&gt; and guess who was there to help that football fall to the ground <person player="david fulcher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david fulcher</person> we havent mentioned his name as many times here in this second half but that may be the biggest play for this defense in this second half he knew &gt;&gt; he had three men open he had craig, then he had <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> a little short, and then, on the sidelines, the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> zipped to taylor but fulcher, the man on the spot 49 yards for the lead testing the leg of <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">mike cofer</person> &gt;&gt; plenty of leg &gt;&gt; it is no good! wide to the right after the missed 49yard field goal, cincinnati takes over at the 31 and its <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> off tackle and theyre waiting for him <person player="kevin fagan" race="white" position="DE">kevin fagan</person> just as <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person> has been solid against the run for cincinnati, <person player="kevin fagan" race="white" position="DE">kevin fagan</person> has been the answer for the 49ers &gt;&gt; riki ellison, number 50, in the middle of that defense hes been hurt a good deal of the last part of this year he has special incentive today lets go back to that attempted field goal the snap by randy cross word that we have here now is that san francisco used cross as a snapper earlier in this game so our criticism of <person player="chuck thomas" race="white" position="C">chuck thomas</person> may have belonged on randy crosss shoulders &gt;&gt; <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person>, the nose tackle, showing his speed as he runs <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">boomer esiason</person> out of bounds at the 29 so on that missed field goal 19yarder on the bad snap, that was veteran randy cross, not <person player="chuck thomas" race="white" position="C">chuck thomas</person>, who made the snap &gt;&gt; in his last ballgame, retiring, maybe <person player="chuck thomas" race="white" position="C">chuck</person> would like to take the blame for him perhaps we can get <person player="chuck thomas" race="white" position="C">chuck</person> to do that for randy &gt;&gt; theres cross 13 years in the league three times a pro bowler hes played both center and guard wants to be a sportscaster a very glib <person player="guy mcintyre" race="nonwhite" position="OG">guy</person> dad was an actor a character actor, a bad <person player="guy mcintyre" race="nonwhite" position="OG">guy</person> in the movies hes been a good <person player="guy mcintyre" race="nonwhite" position="OG">guy</person> for the 49ers, has randy third and 13 <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> or hillary! <person player="ira hillary" race="UNK" position="WR">ira hillary</person> in the game with the injuries to <person player="tim mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcgee</person> and collinsworth has his first catch had only five all season and comes up with a big thirddown play first down &gt;&gt; <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> throwing this long out its the kind of pass he missed several times earlier in the game this one will be completed &gt;&gt; didnt have a lot of zip on it, though, did it? &gt;&gt; hangs up there a long time and that was a trademark of boomers passing earlier in the year he really has a powerful arm, and those patterns are the ones he throws the best &gt;&gt; 16 yards and the first down now <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> look who came flying up there <person player="michael walter" race="white" position="LB">michael walter</person> to plug the hole <person player="larry roberts" race="nonwhite" position="DE">roberts</person> was there as well, but it was walter, 99, flying to the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> &gt;&gt; very, very active linebackers for this 49er team ill tell you, george seifert, their defensive coordinator, has done a tremendous job of putting this defense together in positions where they can make the stops &gt;&gt; needless to say &gt;&gt; wed love to see that &gt;&gt; first experience would be one worthy of some historical merit &gt;&gt; we talked about that all week, and people looked at us like we were crazy &gt;&gt; 6:44 left in the fourth quarter tied at 13 second down, 9 <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> close to a first down, as he drives to the san francisco 44 <person player="jeff fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> and ellison make the tackle, as riki ellison gets up off the ball, number 50, the tackler for san francisco his dad, you said, is here from new zealand to see him play &gt;&gt; his father has never seen him play a football game father and mother separated early his father has lived out of the country, was in fiji wanted to come to super bowl xix the day he was going to leave, a hurricane came through, blew the roof off his house he wasnt able to come hes here watching his son today but were not gonna show you a picture of him &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] not after the norman <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> experience of a couple weeks ago first down, cincinnati 5:51 to go &gt;&gt; his father, dan, very proud, im sure, of the way his sons playing today &gt;&gt; <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">ickey woods</person> behind that big right side of the line plows under <person player="brian blados" race="white" position="OT">brian blados</person>, the 300pound right tackle, and has good yardage again &gt;&gt; san francisco slanting their defensive line theyve done a pretty good job here in the second half of shutting down the running game but i think that big offensive line beginning to wear down this defense and that should pay off in running yardage &gt;&gt; <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">jim breech</person>, the fieldgoal kicker, has connected 2 for 2 today, his last from 43 yards second down and 3 <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> now with 74 yards, leading the cincinnati running game and its his number again no, playaction <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> and throws complete was he out of bounds? <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> thats a good catch they say in bounds a dozen more for the bengals and that will put them into fieldgoal range with a first down at the 25 &gt;&gt; you talk about a toetapper boy, ill tell you those toes down now theyre saying no catch now? watch the toes here brooks one thats in bounds ah, the second toe out of bounds &gt;&gt; and so far the instant replay &gt;&gt; theyre not gonna stop it he was saying he was pushed out of bounds, that his toe would have come down the toe would have come down in bounds, but he was pushed &gt;&gt; first down at the 24yard line and the snap doesnt even come off &gt;&gt; <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carter</person> jumping a little bit early did someone move? &gt;&gt; we look at breech, but sam wyche is thinking more than field goal now &gt;&gt; he wants the 7 &gt;&gt; false start prior to the snap number 64, the center still first down &gt;&gt; kozerski, who has worked so hard today on <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">michael carter</person> we talked about the impact of <person player="michael carter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carter</person> heres that last play boy, this is great body control by <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> watch those toes stretch down and you see the shove right there by <person player="tim mckyer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim mckyer</person> if <person player="tim mckyer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mckyer</person> is not there to push him, that other toe does come down i agree with the call &gt;&gt; fans who watched it on the replay in the stadium at least the 49er fans booing they thought that was not a favorable call first down, 15 at the 30 and they run it <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> gets back the 5 yards they lost on the penalty you saw earlier in the game that ickey, on his sweatband, over the forehead, had number 46 that was the number of his friend from fresno and unlv teammate there it is andre horn youve heard the story horn was his pal they were supposed to get together one night ickey didnt make it and his friend, andre horn, was murdered and that turned <person player="ickey woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> life around that was his best buddy and he remembers him here in this super bowl experience second and 10 <person player="boomer esiason" race="white" position="QB">esiason</person> going for brooks incomplete at the 5 walter drifting back in pass defense to help out <person player="ronnie lott" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ronnie lott</person> all right third down cincinnati today has been 4 for 13 and this is a tough one third and 11 if they do not gain any yards the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> just inside the 25 were talking a 42, 43yard field goal 4:08 to go theyre letting the clock run down already 9 and now theyll call a timeout or officials will call a time cofer, who has missed two one from 19 and one from 49 yards <person player="stanford jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stanford jennings</person>, for a moment a hero for cincinnati with that kickoff return for a touchdown, is in the lineup &gt;&gt; big, big play this is a tough one for the conversion here third and 11 &gt;&gt; <person player="stanford jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; they just position the ball, middle of the field <person player="stanford jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> gets a few more yards to the 22yard line, which will give <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> a shot of a field goal from 40 or just inside he was originally drafted by the lions way back in 1978 hes an excellent golfer and whenever you talk to <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> about kicking, he talks about golf and how his leg is really the club in his body making the play &gt;&gt; same kind of mechanics he said, "you hook and slice a football the same way you do a golf ball" &gt;&gt; and you keep your head down &gt;&gt; [ chuckles ] lets see if he can do it &gt;&gt; 40 yards and it is good! [ crowd cheering ] the smallest man on the field, 56" <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">jim breech</person>, is growing by the minute he is 3 for 3 on field goals and cincinnati leads again, 1613 &gt;&gt; he really puts a foot into that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> on these kickoffs and that has been a factor here today field position &gt;&gt; and he could kick you a 50yarder he has that kind of leg but <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> is the short man in more ways than one <person player="lee johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> to del rodgers 10 flag down rodgers down another flag and it appears the 49ers will start deep in their own end rodgers, the ballcarrier, slow getting up well, as you look back on a couple of big moments early, then, merlin, in the first half the injuries, of course, to <person player="steve wallace" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wallace</person> and <person player="tim krumrie" race="UNK" position="DT">krumrie</person> we have documented but missing a 19yard field goal, the shortest ever in super bowl history this could be the one they really talk about cross is the snapper &gt;&gt; that is randy cross thomas next to him in the lineup, but cross the man snapping tonight and that <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> right on the knee and you cant get it up and maintain the timing im sure that he is blaming himself but the timing is so critical youve got to have the good snap and the good hold or the kicker cannot do his job &gt;&gt; and then <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">cofer</person> missed also from the 49, so hes 1 for 3 <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> over the middle to craig protecting the <person player="eric ball" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ball</person> and out to the 17, as he takes a lick from <person player="carl zander" race="UNK" position="LB">carl zander</person> and <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> not wasting any time no huddle &gt;&gt; so important and this cincinnati defense, boy, i tell you, they have done a great job without their best player weve said it again and again but they keep coming up with the big series, the big plays &gt;&gt; nice catch underneath the tight end john frank theyre 91 with frank in the lineup this year, that tight end clock is running 2:40, 2:39 you see it thats the game clock fourth quarter cincinnati leading by a field goal firstdown play <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> and out of bounds goes <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> with another catch and for rice, the brilliant allpro who was the nfl player of the year last year, his ninth catch for 171 yards and a touchdown he caught 22 touchdown passes for bill walsh last year to set an nfl record and remember, that was in a short season, with the strike 12 games, 22 touchdowns &gt;&gt; bill walsh and his 49ers may be most dangerous in this kind of 2minute situation they can explode on you &gt;&gt; handoff inside to craig thats like a roll <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> fakes the roll, then hands off behind him but cincinnati had it well read <person player="leo barker" race="UNK" position="LB">leo barker</person>, who came to the united states from the canal zone in panama, from rainbow city, to play at new mexico state and then make it in the nfl &gt;&gt; this is the kind of situation weve talked about the fact that walsh will save an opportunity, save some plays, for this kind of situation &gt;&gt; 2 minutes to go san francisco needs 3 one touchdown scored on an offensive drive its been field goals and the kickoff return for a touchdown <person player="roger craig" race="nonwhite" position="RB">roger craig</person> out to the 35yard line with 1:54 to go <person player="skip mcclendon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">skip mcclendon</person> made the tackle and i think back to early in the year, merlin we were watching the game from seoul, korea, when <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> hit <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person>, 78 yards an injured bengal on the play <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> hit <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person>, 78 yards, remember, against the giants with 42 seconds left, and san francisco won, 2017 <person player="eddie brown" race="UNK" position="WR">eddie</person> edwards has replaced <person player="jim skow" race="white" position="DE">jim skow</person> edwards, the veteran from miami of florida on first down <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> again! and hes out of bounds at the cincinnati 47 and that should put him right at the 200yard mark today <person player="mike cofer" race="white" position="K">mike cofer</person> may get another chance yet but the 49ers with plenty of time 1:49 to go theyre thinking touchdown six defensive backs for the bengals <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> to the left <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> over the middle to craig and <person player="leo barker" race="UNK" position="LB">barker</person> gets him down, but not until craig has another san francisco first down at the 36yard line &gt;&gt; a team playing emotional football begins to wear down at the end of the day theyre not getting heat on <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person>, and hes taking advantage of that defense &gt;&gt; <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> over his head he had broken free of <person player="eric thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric thomas</person> but a little too tall was <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> &gt;&gt; ill tell you, youve got to wonder what kind of emotions have gone through that mans heart and head during this game &gt;&gt; no one has ever gone from a fourwin season to a super bowl victory thats for certain but <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> would like to keep it that way over the middle with a flag down and its a completion to craig and i believe craig was held &gt;&gt; we might have a tripping call in there &gt;&gt; <person player="barney bussey" race="UNK" position="DB">barney bussey</person> on the play &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; other way around theyre saying now &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; ineligible man downfield, san francisco you dont see that called often but <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> scrambling, and one of his linemen released too soon &gt;&gt;
