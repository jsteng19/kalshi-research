yards so the ball is out quick he does throw a great deep ball but they havent really found the deep threat issue and at the same to use with tourists if weve gone for a couple of seasons to find a replacement for him just get <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> with the carry <person player="ricardo mathews" race="UNK" position="DT">ricardo</person> matthews in

with the run warships he is so fun to watch he really is these plays are designed you dont know where theyre gonna hit he has so much confidence in his ability to accelerate and he is so patient it s just amazing to watch what he s allowing the defense do is get out of their lanes get out of their responsibilities their gap responsibilities by just shifting and moving and then finds that crease already at 60 yards to the last three games the ravens have held him in check 20 yards in one game last you have 129 the return match is december right back to and fullback <person player="nick boyle" race="UNK" position="TE">nick</person> s leads the way this time the ravens gets into all those gaps it s a minimal game so what theyll you often talk about his yards from scrimmage because of his

effectively with their backs at their best game from a running back today they bring in the extra offense of lime and a couple of tight ends and just hammer it at you and they had a nice crease there in short yardage that s very encouraging for this offense steelers had that touchdown on the opening drive then were stopped the last two drives waited to move the ball feko a couple of big plays on their early drives one field goal made one box snap <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> back to the other <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite"

able to run the football a little bit now the ravens go play action and take a shot down the field that s what theyd like to do if they are able to run the football it is going to set up the potential for some big plays in the playaction game then he actually had a chance to get it to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> there on the deep crossing we may see that one again later penalty makes it second and 17 <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> in trouble and he s brought down good two three now three and a half

sliding he couldnt get him position to call but that could help from the other official on that sideline now let s check the flag thrown by the line judge at the live scrimmage but really an appeal is an incomplete pass one fit foot inbounds illegal formation that penalties been declined worked out there s fourth downs correct field goal attempt let s watch the back end of the catches pin a lit up

offensively just two first downs after that opening touchdown drive for the steelers he s i dont need to make adjustments we need to play cleaner as for coach harbaugh and the ravens theyve got to stop the run maybe on bail rd has about twice as many rush yards as he did the last time these two teams met hed also like to keep <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> clean he s been sacked twice and he said when we get in the red zone weve got to get to the end zone two trips there and just three points guys and that field oh right the other field goal heavier they could not convert on which would give me the lead otherwise ravens while the false start on the steelers not pavan hash looks like it s intercepted by zachary or untouched he gets up and runs or to the 20 yard line so though take a tight look at it obviously he caused it to turn over but if it is an interception to the third of the year for zachary or and a first played mistake for the steelers and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> yeah youre gonna see zach or right here just drop into coverage it s a zone <person

third nate now from baltimore s philosophy of deciding theyve got to establish a run it really helps them for pass protection theyve run some naked legs and some misdirection suffered before the linebackers playoffs but when the comes time to get it in the end zone they have to convert on these and these big mass situations come over the big play the basket against its possession all getting to the steward sat in the field only six points to show for it comes pittsburgh pressure with five flat go up top <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> for

position="QB">flacco</person> doesnt miss it this time and the blitz came off the strong side to the offensive right they picked up the blitz and still had time to put it down the middle of a field the ravens are here going for two usually it s the steelers who scored <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin goes for two for the 12 7 score here harbaugh wants to get to that 7 point he s not anticipating a lot of points in this game i think it s early to go for two i would kick here and at that point but well see what happens steel is practice going for to sew off their defense has become very proficient at stopping teams going for two here s placa and that is open and easy for <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> there s some may liked about that opportunity the touchdown and the cheese <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> also had a twopoint conversion against pittsburgh in the first game the undrafted man zachary or with a pick and the veteran the 37 year old <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> the 6 and the 2 and the ravens lead by 7 the terrible towels is so special to people dating back to the pirates hope the radio announcer got started especially this miss addition for many of the fats that they have their collection over the years from childhood all the way through the great men and women who served our country overseas and the armed forces people have their terrible towels everywhere it s gerald t soft with the return and nowhere to go cover that very well stopped inside the 20 doug what s talking about what he s looking on at the surface but look ii saw him touchdown absolutely there s a blitz coming from here and the safety has halffilled to that side so the safeties moving to the wide side the field you couldnt draw it up any better to have <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> running on a linebacker down the middle of the field versus blitz um usually when the when the safety split there s a backside safety there s no one you have to worry about on the backside of that coverage anybody was made to be a part of this rivalry of <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> absolutely the way he plays now he doesnt good so the steeler out fence after that opening drive they have done nothing from the 17 quit campaign 2004 out and catch 8 yards of the game <person player="jerraud powers" race="nonwhite" position="DB">powers</person> the tackle here s heather like 16 years in the league and <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> admitted to me he still has a chip on his shoulder he s still motivated by the fact that 10 receivers were picked ahead of him in the 2001 draft and now smith is the only receiver left in his draft class still playing his coach agrees harbaugh telling us steve s perceived flight is what motivates him and generates his energy to this day incredible still go it s still very productive skee move his orc brings him down that s a first down shy of the 30 gain of five yards guys seventh alltime you receiving yards in the nfl <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> and of position players the oldest active guys on the offensive side of the ball yet brady brees 37 years 11 months and <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> senior four months younger it s a little different when youre playing wide receiver that goodlooking point smith is a little more impressive right holding up extra offensive lineman in for pittsburgh go ravens try to stay with an animove beeps unbelievable he is he s a video game in football shoes what a move gain of four and youll see <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> going against the extra offensive lineman here runs around the block but <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> just is just incredible finding space being patient and then making people miss in close quarters <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> part of this robberies made the big names have been his dozen times whenll blitzing off the edge cant get there <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> downfield template rodgers on the run theyve burned the safety blitz with a big gain all the way down to the 26 yard line a pickup of 39 <person player="eli rogers" race="nonwhite" position="WR">eli rogers</person> again gets matched up oneonone with a quick inside move blitz no help inside <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> reddit got the ball to him accurately he s crossing routes against man cover it s always tough the key though was picking up weddell on that blitz fungus past plate of the night for pittsburgh <person player="eli rogers" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rogers</person> who had a hundred yards in the first game between these teams 39 there <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> forced to take timeout steelers trying to drive to get the gametying touchdown three coats of pootie tony dungy had the on the sidelines there s todd on the sidelines there s todd haley offensive coordinator for the steelers in his fifth year with his staff versus dad dick haley was terrific part of the personnel group here in the great days of the 70s and 80s todd with just under three seasons as the head coach of the chiefs he s really got <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> get the ball out of his hand quick not taking as many hits there he goes to <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> he s only been targeted twice tonight it s just third target you could see half a baltimore was there to stop him and yeah <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> had a bead on that screen as well and just missed it saw the most in new has come and got those hands up and just missed the ball he s very familiar with pittsburgh s terminology so if there was an audible a check he s done in a couple of times really interesting things balls 99 receptions on the season for brown he and <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> line up to the same side now <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> comes back next to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> on second and seven looking brown got him still shy the first down and itll be third in a couple i think he might have had some eye contact with <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin in the locker room i have been there ive been a coach this is a big game get me the ball steelers do this often third and short they jump the ball try to let <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> make the choice on line it will be a throw and it is brown contact no flag on cherise right and it s worth out oneonone with rightright forces im taken inside release which is a tougher fake throw there s contact down the field but nothing blatant that the ref can see a little bit of contact early <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> saw one on one over there with brown and said im going for it it s getting my <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> going and took a shot that arm would have hooked browns are might have been called the peg was underneath their right did a good job that was good coverage 36 yard kick for <person player="chris boswell" race="white" position="K">boswell</person> and chris splits the uprights he had six goals in the game last week both teams scored here early in the third but morally before nfl network exec cowboys steeler game it was played here certainly will be one of those so i would imagine beam over time all the way to the end of overtime kansas city denver game that rematch coming up on sunday night football later tonight on nbc this war will take annie <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> s got it after 25 particulars thanks jenn stats represented by mercedesbenz doug you brought this up before <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> has the second most pass attempts but essentially it s an extension of the rushing game because so many of them have been short growth the second highest percentage of passes within ten yards of the line of scrimmage and if they can get the run game going that number will come down as far as pass attempts and also using it as theyre passing in but you close the people extremely well that s the frustrating thing he wants to go down the field it just hasnt happened to them the marc trestman is replaced that s a coordinator trying to find the right balance here sticks in the carry and he gains two yards tony it s interesting as we alluded to the first half of the identity of this baltimore offense you really cant put your finger on it right now given <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> and <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> but theyre trying to find a running game with these two backs <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> and <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> know they really are and i know john harbaugh is hard and he wants to get back to that if we can get that running game established that s gonna help our deep pass and win threeman rush they drop 8 in coverage and <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis pitta</person> the veteran cited knew how to find a spot for his quarterback to find him it s a baltimore first out of the 35 yeah he does a great job it s just snapping it around feeling the zone feeling the soft spot of his own stepping around giving your shoulders giving your chest stick it in his chest and get a positive game id say you know we can talk wreck game all you want when you want to score points you throw the football it took three quarters last time these two teams played to allow bend and just start slinging it around the field and they started scoring points in the fourth quarter and both touchdowns today or touchdowns today or cda for the steelers excuse me here for the ravens game jen she must stay away from <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ryan shazier</person> was coming on in there to try to get him behind the line gain of two <person player="brian mihalik" race="UNK" position="DE">brian</person> says there this is what he does so well he s stacked at that inside linebacker position they run right at him and he pulls the trigger and runs through <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> does a great job to make him miss in the hole but that is what caesar does so well firstround pick out of ohio state a couple of years ago injuries have kept him from having full seasons when they put more on him as the season has gone on asking to do the communication for the linebacking born call the defense hit up again hit hard by put <person player="alvin dupree" race="UNK" position="LB">dupree</person> isnt remark just shy of the first down will be third in less than the arc nice job type it again kind of a lowkey call why stick little quick out route to snap it around slow down a little because you know and feel that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> on the outside coming to break on it it s all feel you feel the zone you feel the defender be your outside and it makes it easy target for the quarterback three catches tonight for pedo 70 for the year for the ball coach talent theyre gonna throw the ball get this purse down first run it up inside it s the bodies to the left they run look what a good job by <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> his balance is what the coaches talk about with him and he carries bodies get bonus tip before someone gets hurt gain of seven and a first down for <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">kenneth dixon</person> at 510 212 pounds and this is a great run but well done by pittsburgh at the line of scrimmage youre going to see this penetration here <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> goes inside but just a great battle in a run by <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">kenneth dixon</person> one be denied to get that first down and <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">pitta</person> was there trying to block <person player="sean davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sean davis</person> sheamus couldnt get a clean look to safety and allowed <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> to keep baltimore again moving on a drive to the steelers side of the field <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> at the 32 yard line and baltimore s been very effective moving the ball and that s the play doug talked about in the first half that little short motion by the back get it out there quick pittsburgh had been blitzing that motion earlier but now he just gets it in the flat gets it to him quick with blockers in front exactly a wide receivers blocking for the back knee and this is an extension of a run the runs that handoff yes get him out in open space receivers throwing blocks how we started this drive talking about what s different with this baltimore offense after nina 16 in the air <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> on the ground to the 26 yard line pick up seven coaches i can imagine this is a perfect scenario as you have two good backs who do some similar things but as one comes on the rookie dixit now that pushes <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">terrance west</person> a little bit has been in the league a few years and john harbaugh has a couple options back there yes and he has press backs and you can see these guys running hard on this drive the runs havent been cleaned guys have been turned free but they break it back well get to get past it a linebacker level game still going with the feet strength runs down he doesnt again <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> that s a couple of times the physical running of <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> who has emerged as the season has gone on there s been a difference maker to move the chains first down ravens boy this is just all leg drive to cost 62 gets in front and pushing driving his legs <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> driving his legs behind it good and the offensive players getting involved and pushing the piles <person player="ronnie stanley" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ronnie stanley</person> dude did it a couple of plays ago and again the offensive guys pushing and pulling those extra two to three yards make a big difference when it s everyone he feeds them and with good reason <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> flax come in here he looks like this one might come back as <person player="kenneth dixon" race="UNK" position="RB">dixon</person> got it inside the 10 to the 8 yard laughs ends for the 53 10yard penalty replay first down center <person player="jeremy zuttah" race="nonwhite" position="OG">jeremy</person> zut ah well your centers ooda in the middle he s trying to block <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">shazier</person> and he slips through his left side he just kind of pulls with the left hand and hooks him down and that s just the quickness of <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">shazier</person> to beat the block you know see the runthrough opportunity and go for it and surprising the offensive lineman he told me he runs a 43 when they said theyve said it about him too and leave it egged him on because <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj mosley</person> was the first round pick coming out of the same draft and she s here in the tugboat which <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> two first round picks youre gonna see merge here overtime that s a 43 in a 40yard dash not 30 i mean that is some speed this is something special here <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> in the back on first and 20 releases gets it we get back to the line of scrimmage is william game nickelback makes the tackle not sir if they were looking for blitz and maybe hoping to get him on a linebacker im not sure what that thought process was but pittsburgh was ready for it baltimore s driving this third quarter to the south of the open end of his stadium kicking field goals since his stadium opened back in 2001 has always been more difficult right now theyre in <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> s range olivia 52yard field goal from here so watch these next couple of plays he can get more <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> on the screen no more there though teammate <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> with a reintroduction and <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> had something here if he ran back inside behind his blockers they have something going trying to use the blitz and the momentum now <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> goes back outside into the traffic might have had something barty <person player="artie burns" race="nonwhite" position="DB">burns</person> the rookie join <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> his 14th year that stop 30:21 be careful here not necessarily to go for all of it steelers drop 8 in coverage pin against it to the 27 yard line so they pick up five yards exactly what they were thinking be very difficult to pick up a first down get <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> a little closer going into this open end it s an opera singer <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> sings opera in seven different languages and said that studying music and having to sing and perform and be judged when he s in the university texas perhaps hooked because these pressure moments 46 he hits the right note again and the ravens extend their leave theyve scored 11 here in the quarter at least 72 down fit to the playoffs depending on what happens here with baltimore pittsburgh so sunday night football coming up on nbc and football night in america starts in about a half hour the trick <person player="ladarius green" race="UNK" position="TE">green</person> bay has been announced by the league as the sunday night game for week 17 in number 256 touchback roughest burger gets it at the 25 steam squirt touchdown to the first drive no other tv sets upper 30s that s your other nice christmas name pittsburghers grave for a couple of days the sun came out around midafternoon his little steeler fans and their jerseys current steelers and a lot of throwback to old school stealin numbers of seal all the way to the game at heinz field his belt from 25 slamming up inside there a new game for the 29 <person player="brandon williams" race="UNK" position="DT">brandon williams</person> the nose tackle for the ravens may have stopped we talked about the ravens time getting control of this game in pittsburgh unable to sustain as weve gone through these first three quarters yeah early that first drive <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> was coming through theyre clean and he hasnt had those clean runs in the last quarter in the half pittsburgh has an extra offensive lineman in there <person player="chris hubbard" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chris hubbard</person> who s actually athletic enough to catch the ball if necessary but he s lined up in the tight end position <person player="eli rogers" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rogers</person> in motion <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> intercepted it s <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj mosley</person> doesnt underneath <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">mosley</person> the 20 <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">mosley</person> brought down the 11 yard line and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> has thrown two interceptions ravens linebackers deep in his own territory twenty nine yards on the mosely int return anion <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj</person> mosely right here a lot of things going on little playaction fake off that jet suite but he gets back in his zone and nice right underneath that ball coach the offensive line on the playaction i mean they stood up straight there was no deception at all so the linebackers just took their drops and then you know <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> was anticipating getting a good play on the linebackers wheeling around and sticking a seam around in there and there was no deception at all the linebackers just dropped right under steelers defense has to step up now theyve got to hold this to a field goal <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">terrance west</person> the running back from the 11 in his <person player="terrance west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> stretching it to the left only two yards there the ravens will probably let this quarter go and the ends of the closed end here and try to add to this lead again baltimore wins and by virtue of beating pittsburgh earlier this season they would have the sweep potentially tied and the ravens would be in control of their chances to win the title they would get it with a win next week at cincinnati if they can hold on here in the fourth quarter if the big bend pick turns into a touchdown for baltimore after three on this christmas night in pittsburgh ravens 17 steelers 10 as they trail baltimore s 7210 again a steelers home win and they win the afc north but interceptions by the two linebackers a curry or and <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj mosley</person> in that third quarter giving john harbaugh his team a great opportunity to take a doubledigit lead <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin stephens not seen the offense sustained much after an opening drive of nine plays 34 through three quarters the second and eight <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person>

is taken down at the fourth three penalties on the ravens four on the steelers assessed in this game pretty low number for this rivalry there was a collision as he was running his route and coming across is he gonna call this illegal contact or offensive pass interference there s no foul for offensive pass interference with defender the remaini to initiated the contact <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> up there in coverage to the senate burton short as he s coming across <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> gives him a chuck and within the five yard range so it s perfectly legal good call a good non call from just inside the five rosie yarder so closer would be third and three for baltimore turn into the white chocolate and beeps <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> at the bottom of the screen first book was covered and that is war were putting the toes down incomplete puddin hang on and <person player="sean davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sean davis</person> the safety who did play some corner during his time at the university of maryland was there in coverage and a field goal attempt coming he s running a corner route and there s a tight window and it opens up and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> just pulls the trigger i mean looks wide open but there s a defender out to the right it was a great job of just getting the ball out of your hand and in a position where he could make a play on it gets the feet down as you see but then as he goes to the ground doesnt complete the bosss because davis did a great job not to get out davis closing on it he had inside leverage they ate up the flat defender with a <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> in the flat very well designed dustin <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> from 23 it s another one 22:10 baltimore but 14 here in the second half to light gardening the flower shop hits conservatory and botanical gardens in the western pennsylvania holiday views steelers will close playing but browns here on new year s day late tomlin s team down by ten couple of poor interceptions drawn by band in the third quarter the place one is fading away and the other one a bad decision <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> had thrown 11 interceptions thus far this season this touch back and will go back to the 25 11 take a look at those two picks thrown by been in the 3rd first one zachary or doing just what you coach your defender to do get to your spot and then hustle you never know when youre gonna get a bad throw he got one their event comes off the play action with his back turn so maybe add a vision and throws it right at <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj mosley</person> we initially think the seam routes there but the ball is not there yet i mean if it was a situation where his under center came up and popped it to him sure but coming off play action never saw you guys both happen on first and anyways so like youre forcing to throw in that spot from the 25 <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> hot early ravens have done a good job theyre being just as patient with his patients and theyre not giving him space to run lost of a couple there they talked about that they said you cant just pull the trigger and shoot youve got a weight and be poised and see where he goes and theyre doing a great job of just holding the <person player="lj fort" race="white" position="LB">fort</person> staying there making him move laterally so it s almost like those quarterbacks were very mobile in a day that much broader term who s gonna keep you right there and wait for you to blink blosser to where is <person

position="DT">guy</person> he s working around but he feels the soft spots in zone and pull up a lot of times guys will run through and lead you into a bad throw there he felt it and then just being an athlete at the end i see more of this this year all these guys are so darn athletic especially with three tight ends said well when they go low he goes high something like that from the 44 quickly to a v and just about five yards shy of midfield weve seen some of those quick passes in the flattened all this the second level behind the linebacker level is where <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> makes his but i mean he makes those throws better anyone thrown it down the field and if he has time to throw they have to

twominute warning as malibu s check grunts to the left and the probowl bound fullback has a first down at the 19 yard line this rivalry which over the years has given us tight games great finishes and big moments the names have changed a little bit from those hall of fame performers but not the intensity and not the quality has been a terrific game right from the start the end time of game we expected and for these two teams have delivered will down territory baltimore here because of being down for flat well just gave a hand signal the wide receiver at the top as the <person player="steve

flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> complete multiple defenders tackle hit on the spot gets him to the 10 he needs to get justin inside the 10 so her head towards third in less than a yard with a minute 45 on a turning clock and if baltimore believes are going to end up in the end zone here they theyre milking the clock as of right now theyre starting to build the clock and try to score you and supplies theyve gotten spreadout i think you want to run the ball here to make that post down and give yourself four shots and each side has the first down still going run of the year from use check and the ravens take the lead on the road how great is pile you stick them on this drive watch the spur contact and just will not be denied doug once he saw the end zone once he comes off the collision with <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> he realizes if i stay up im in uses the hand to help himself and get into the end zone jam her 74 made an initial block to start this run here he kept these knees off the ground something about seeing that goal line in front of you you try to stay up at any cost he has been so good on this drive pass protection picking up things catching the ball out of the backfield runs just exceptional is a pullback that can catch the ball run opposite routes and then hammer the football the star from harvard with an incredible touchdown run <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> it s the extra point he s never missed one his career and the ravens retake the lead for the fourth quarter weve had 24 points scored minute 1810 brown and <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> and they respond starts loads seven three seven two six

<person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> has been very good again in this his stays calm but a drive he just led lady on bail another fabulous total yardage day couple of touchdowns and <person player="kyle juszczyk" race="white" position="RB">kyle</person> hughes check one of the big runs that youve seen under pressure in this series to bring baltimore back now minute 18 what are you thinking here tony with pittsburgh well again youve got to use lay down bail dont forget about them and tony obrien will get double cover that sure so the other weve got to see some other receivers step up but i would look for bail here starts at 25 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the out to this time in bishop james and the bounds for the game the three gonzaga felt <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s getting into that rhythm once they opened the up the offensive loop and absolutely no doubt about it there he felt them precious i got rid of it quick there was a blitz off the edge he the big play from his drive if it gets done is usually bent hanging onto the ball moving around a little bit making the big play down the field tight baltimore s continued to look like they want a pressure on them was burger rose left on the first down down on the balance 36 yardline charice right couldnt make the stop because of the flint zone and bringing pressure you get off coverage 101 and this is the timing route great job of getting out of bounds avoiding the tackle gotta start back upfield to get out of bounds cant go backwards to stop the clock again right on the field because <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> their best cover corner is out there no foot sides at the corners and travel with the top receivers so brown what s boatwright to stay up there pressure has he got there from the safety spot yet <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> throws it s complete to the rain boots on the midfield just the 47 yard line 59 seconds left roughest burger slow to get up here s what were talking about with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> holding on to the football under pressure five man rush sliding moving feeling it hanging on to it as long as you possibly can which allows james to uncover let s watch this hit because <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> is limping as pittsburgh has taken a timeout do merville dragging him down at the end of the play <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> just flexing that left knee 30second timeout okay well be back in 30 ruffruff less berger flexing that left knee that s the one that he injured against miami and the meniscus surgery missed one game goes down throw his clock back to marcus <person player="demarcus ayers" race="UNK" position="WR">ayers</person> his first reception <person player="demarcus ayers" race="UNK" position="WR">ayers</person> gets inside the 40 to the 39 theyre getting close to <person player="chris boswell" race="white" position="K">chris boswell</person> s field goal range with plenty of time remaining every play baltimore s giving them different looks everyone standing up milling around the line of scrimmage five guys are coming on every play trying to confuse the oline in the protection and pittsburgh is picked up every plate second and one pressure ruffus burger escapes the coursers ilan <person player="eli rogers" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rogers</person> at the 20yard line when time when in <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> both listening to <person player="crockett gillmore" race="UNK" position="TE">crockett</person> saves the chime out there s one remaining officially marked at the nineteen block stop with 41 seconds remaining in regulation and again the key doug <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> as you said holding the ball escaping to his right and then making something happen on the broken play great shot by rodgers and a great extension to make that kid s <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> is so comfortable throwing the ball when he s moving to his right delivering the ball down the field and like you saw on the one before where you held on there he s willing to take the hit play clock is running steelers are not out there there s a conversation going on with the official the referee john perry and they get the reap up of the play clock that the ravens what i dont want harry was talking to <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin play clock was down at five they got a reap ump in the play clock so he cautiously aggressive because the touchdown could win it that s down here skewers finally get a line three receivers to the top <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> throws underneath it s cut by kofi <person player="cobi hamilton" race="UNK" position="WR">hamilton</person> and a 14 to try to take the ball away from him they cant let s see if pittsburgh went they will use their final timeout with 32 seconds left that was a little discombobulated from the steelers there they werent ready they were moving players around and they end up in the middle of the field and take that timeout so now it gets interesting yeah you note no timeouts left good over the field is still viable it s third down you need to just call a play to convert here go to the middle of field the clocks running to get up and spike it then baltimore s been a lot of pressure in this drug and if youre baltimore you you want to stop his third down play but you dont want to give up a touchdown you dare blitz and play man coverage give up that oneonone throw to score and you sit back in zone maybe even concede the first down but keep them out of the end zone no right set so theyre gonna have to declare maybe on belt left alone bottom of the screen 32 seconds left third and four office burger back look at enzo throws underneath caught by james the titans of the three it s a first down they should have plenty of time to spike it kill the clock the exchange there let me try to get in the way and now they will kill it with 14 and seconds remaining still can get three shots to the end zone here balls at the for <person player="jesse james" race="white" position="TE">jesse james</person> mukesh just coming under in a zone coverage situation <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> was really looking for endzone on this though he had his eyes down the field again moving in the pocket sliding hanging on to the ball the problem here is the ball has to get out get it in the end zone anyone tackled in the field of play becomes a fire drill this is second and goal <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> looks crosser he caught it great drive well executed if he doesnt reach with the ball the clock may run out the reach with the football at the end of the run gets him across the goal line if not the clock is running with nine seconds left and he saw whittle and <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">mosley</person> looks strength by antoni oh brother with three ravens theyre trying to do exactly what doug was saying two of them eventually on the hit when he reaches forward breaks the plane with the ball the touchdown is confirmed and it is 32 27 that s a tremendous play by <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> because doug s right that clock couldnt run out before they get the balls fight off shots here the extra point is blocked it s going to be picked up and taken by chris lewis harris and down the 43 lagarde line but clearly they jumped off the edge early his <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> has led a furious 20 point for the moment fourth quarter for the steel side defense 36 fiveyear penalty <person player="tavon young" race="UNK" position="DB">tavon young</person> came quick off the corner for this is situation where maybe you want the the play blown dead when he s that far off side there s potential for injury there s potential for having to chase down the field make it that what a play by brown yeah what a im glad i got to see pass im thinking back to the 2008 game when santonio holmes just broke the plane and again in baltimore the touchdown that he caught and then he s pushed outside of the goal line but he had possession just inside that was a week 15 game two week that win the division it s eight years later it s one week later in the season but it still might end up being a division winner i never thought they would do that throw the ball short in the field of play that is so dangerous because that clock certainly could have run out because he could throw three quick passes to the end zone and then still have your field goal on fourth down <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin discussing here with john perry the options brown had nine catches in the half ten for the game he was very quiet in the first effort just one catch what tony say i think they might have had a little conversation in the locker room and on the other side sucks in the ravens know it unless there s a miracle theyre eliminated from playoff contention again <person player="tavon young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> has come offside this extra point is good that s 31 27 and the steelers will want this on the kickoff the ensuing kickoff back to the touchdown for <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> he s out wide here he s just going to run an under out everybody s going to clear out for him and it s probably designed to get in the end zone but he has to come back for the ball he s short there and this is just great effort to get it in and it s rental in most all asian players that is just going up getting that ball out recognizing i cant get stopped at the six cents it s situational football understanding that if i dont get in the end zone here this game s over or it may be over he knew he had to get in the end zone okay seven seconds left two timeouts the ravens obviously a very little hope the offside penalty means pittsburgh will kick from the 40 <person player="chris boswell" race="white" position="K">boswell</person> has kicked it out of bounds twice here today hill he kicked it out of bounce once all season to this point if you happen to kick it off out of bounds of all be at the 35 because it goes from the where the spot of the kickoff occurs the ravens being down four and has got one shot at the end zone if at all who do they decide to try the many lateral play on this to go with nine seconds left you can get this ball if it is a touch back you can get into the 25 try to get one ball to the 45 maybe and then get your shot into the end zone because they will be able to use the field with the two timeouts <person player="chris boswell" race="white" position="K">boswell</person> s boots out of the back of the end zone as <person player="chris moore" race="UNK" position="WR">chris moore</person> was trying somehow to catch it to get a return going so it goes to the 25yard line try to get to your 20 yard play here something in that intermediate zone so you can get <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> to be able to throw the ball into the end zone the middle fields in play with timeouts so usually that deep dig route deep over the middle eight keep the 22 yard area you can let a <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> work and work and work sometimes you have to haul on the ball as a quarterback to make it happen but that s usually the area you have a shot at getting a chunk <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike</person> tomlin walked out at a half way to the numbers just yelling at his rookie corner rd <person player="artie burns" race="nonwhite" position="DB">burns</person> doing his coaching there nine seconds remaining <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> gets it out quick pin a medal on the field to the 41 four seconds time out well the one thing about <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> he s got a big arm and he has always had a great ability to throw the ball deep think about standing 50 yards away and throwing the ball in a trash can which is something quarterbacks used to practice getting the nose of the ball down deep for years ive seen that ravens practice <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> do just that in the quarterback drills he is the arm and the technique to do it can you get big guys down there to go make a play if he can get himself in a situation moving towards the line of scrimmage where youre hanging on the ball move around and get back up you can reach the end zone from the 35 <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe</person> pen so if he can get himself running forward moving forward somehow without giving too much ground you can reach likely the final play of the game and itll work underneath here and that is deflected and intercepted and the pittsburgh steelers have won the afc north title the christmas gift to steeler fans is 31 to 27 and the ravens have been eliminated from playoff degeneration incredible 31point fourthquarter pittsburgh team that couldnt do much on offense ends up with 400 yards and brown and <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> carry them to a division title well i think doug said it in our opening we think of pittsburgh as the defensive team theyre <person player="tavon young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> on defense but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> lay down <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> stepped up in that fourth quarter when they needed it they drove this team to the to start a turn and been loose they did run the ball fairly well at times made some plays in the run game but when it comes down to it they rely on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> to make plays find a <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> down the field holding on to the football moving in the pocket allowing things to work themselves open and <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> just great awareness getting himself in the end zone one thing we have to say to that steelers offensive line did a great job in pass protection all day in the fourth quarter when they had to have those throws <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> head time that whole drive they were bringing the blitz ravens no sacks in the game and they are eliminated missing the playoffs for the third time in four years again very rare and after next week it will we see <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> will he continue his career that will certainly be a conversation for the next week or so and beyond but you think about the teams in the tournament the afc and the quarterbacks whove been there there s a quarterback with four super bowl titles mr brady there s a moment a couple of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> who will be in the tournament again one spot left of the afc remember kansas city denver coming up on nbc sunday night football the reach by <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> will be remembered as the moment

drives in the fourth quarter to put up the 21 points erasing a very strong effort from <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> who was 30 of 40 for the mazda
