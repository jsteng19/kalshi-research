============================================================

at&amp;t stadium 10th season that the cowboys have played here we have to moving over from <person player="david irving" race="UNK" position="DT">irving</person> texas stadium which saw so many great games a few of them have been played here as well steve wilkes is the new head coach of the cardinals last year he was the defensive coordinator for carolina under ron rivera a very interesting man interesting background well get into it he has been around and he finally gets his opportunity at the age of 49 and jason garrett who took over in the middle of the 2010 season wade <person player="john phillips" race="white" position="TE">phillips</person> gone halfway through that year finished the 2010 campaign and full time in 2011 <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">phil dawson</person> who is 43 years old is going to kickoff and <person player="jordan chunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> is back to receive north the cowboy and <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> comes after a yard into the end zone and brings him out to the 27 and we have a penalty kick <person player="ezekiel turner" race="UNK" position="DB">turner</person> making the tackle on the play carl jeffers is tonight s referee holding during the return number 57 return team 10yard penalty first down damian wilson backs and receivers now for the cowboys <person player="rod smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rod smith</person> is the running back ferns and williams are outside swim and darwin are the two tight ends so they would call 12 personnel to start plumbing keep an eye on williams he is the rookie left guard <person player="joe looney" race="nonwhite" position="OG">looney</person> edwards and collins a lot to talk about with an offensive line so we start with <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">cooper rush</person> at quarterback back <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> of course will be their guy on opening day but he s not going to play tonight and so russia s the backup starts with playaction to the left and a patch that is incomplete to the 25yard line swain is the intended receiver it is broken up so <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> is a guy who was the backup last year undrafted free agent active for the final 11 games of last season through only three passes itll be <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> obviously and then <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> and then maybe <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> were going to see him as well a rookie picked in the 5th round but there is that and with the problems that they have up front at the moment theyre not going to risk either <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> or eliot playing tonight and were going to tell you now on 3rd down is an enhancement we have we think youre gonna like this the green zone were going to call it so we are going to paint in effect the area that the team has to go to get to the yellow line the first down line and there it is so you can follow the progress we know the yellow line is great it s been around for a lot of years but this will show you exactly how far he has to go at any point in the play so once again the fans will know more than the players on the field smith and smith is in the green zone trying to get to the other line and will come close but wont get there is out of bounds and they will force to punt as buchanan makes the tackle the most interesting part of it for me is seeing which color we finally settled on for the green zone i think we took a look at about every different color there was but that was pretty unique and a chance to see just how close smith came to pick it up that first day borrowed it from baghdad <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">christian kirk</person>y rookie from texas a&amp;m is back to receive trying to win a job as a starting running back and the kick a ball for at the 26 5 ft flag down there after the fair catch is called for so weve had two penalties in the game both on the kicks one on the kickoff one on the putt scheffers checks it out during the kick holding number 48 return team 10yard penalty first down alright backs and receivers now for arizona they are going to start with three wide and one running back <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds is a rookie at a four to <person player="brice butler" race="UNK" position="WR">butler</person> williams and <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kirk</person> are the outside guys rookie seals jones is the tight end and the guys up front do potties back he was hurt last year the big story is gonna be <person player="mason cole" race="white" position="C">mason cole</person> who s a rookie at a michigan a few <person player="aq shipley" race="nonwhite" position="C">shipley</person> than starting senator got hurt in training camp you comes over from the giants and smith comes over from cincinnati so a revamped offensive line for the arizona cardinals <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds is the running back we will not see <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> tonight he s played in the first two preseason games and looked very good to the floor the one who gets scrimmage no game well weve been watching <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> for a lot of years he was the overall number one pick in 2010 by the then st louis rams he s been around st louis philadelphia last two years in minnesota that was hurt most of last season and then the cardinals signed him they signed <person player="mike glennon" race="white" position="QB">mike glennon</person> and they drafted <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> so all three quarterbacks from last season including carson palmer who retired are gone three new ones this year second attack it s jayjay <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> but he cant hold on and he s in completely third down and ten <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> with the coverage well one of the things it s very difficult to get pressure on <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> because theyre going to catch it and throw it he is a very accurate quarterback and he is also a guy that believes in getting that ball out of his hand quickly so a team that will be tough to pressure this green zone is in again on third down and ten <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> very accurate great on the short throws set a record for completion percentage two years ago in minnesota which was subsequently eclipsed by blue breeze thirteen bankers stepping up but unable to avoid a second that s <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> a big story unto himself both suspended comes back and comes in for the sack here how impressive is this you want to get excited cowboys fans here you go youve got the guy who finished second on the right side and <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> and now <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> not only getting around the starting left tackle the arizona cardinals and <person player="dj humphries" race="nonwhite" position="OT">humphries</person> but a chip as well that was some start for dallas fans andy leaves in his 15th season he s the punter walk over there s contact in the 50 yard line <person player="lance lenoir" race="UNK" position="WR">lance</person> lenora was there and who made the contact is the question like <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> is on guy and his own guy did it then arizona has a chance to wind up with the ball what was his own guy forced into him as a question i didnt think so seeing it at first glance but are going to give it to arizona so contend that he was interfering with by his own guy and the cardinals will retain possession at midfield getting your hair cut the whole thing and tonight zero coverage being brought to you by geico it s about 95 degrees outside so the roof is closed a comfortable 72 inside so they recover the ball at midfield and now <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> who used to play quarter to a quarter and a half tonight about a six yard game for <person player="ricky sealsjones" race="UNK" position="TE">ricky</person> seals jones and let s see exactly what took place on that punt but im not sure it is deserved here on this one <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> is going to go back and that punt was so far to the right there was really no way for him to anticipate that <person player="lance lenoir" race="UNK" position="WR">lance lenoir</person> was going over there just one of those things that occasionally will happen or obviously looking up into the ceiling out trying to make the catch that was a tough and <person player="dennis gardeck" race="white" position="LB">dennis</person> guard neck was there to recover it so second down and four from the cowboy 45 yard line handoff there goes <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds itll be a third down and one that dallas defense was talking about at the very top charlie <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">crawford</person> woods <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> had a breakout year last year 14 and a half sacks tied for second in the league <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> is a great story well get into that a little bit later wilson and <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> outside and in that secondary jones is the key guy woozi a is on the other side with <person player="kavon frazier" race="nonwhite" position="DB">frazier</person> and the speedy <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">heath</person> the safety skycam right now on the line of scrimmage right there need one yard third and one bring in a fullback and give it to him and theyll pick up the first down that s <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick coleman</person> who has been around played at ucla he s deaf and weve talked about his story through the years when weve had him but they brought him in that s something that bruce arians who left town and bruce sr retired good luck to bruce at cbs he never wanted a fullback but steve wolf s comes in and brings in a fullback get a little bit of a feeling a lot of things are going to be different in arizona it is about running the football and stopping the run as far as steve wolf s is concerned from the 39 yard and throws a strike but it is not held on to by seals jones not at this grass for a second couldnt hold on <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">heath</person> is there for the coverage second down and 10 i tell you we have seen some good safety plays so far out of the dallas cowboys and i know there s always that conversation going on about earl <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> and weve got a player going down really well done that time by cave on frasier so a dallas cowboy have not identified him as yet little road trip with the arizona partners new head coach and coordinators offense defense and special teams eleven regular starters from last year no longer with the team that s the most of any team in the national football league palmer <person player="dustin stanton" race="white" position="OG">stanton</person> and gabbard were the quarterbacks last year they are all gone carson retired <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">rosen</person> and <person player="mike glennon" race="white" position="QB">glennon</person> are the three cubies and the new head coach wants the new offensive coordinator is mike mccoy four years as the head coach at san diego and <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> who is trying to get through the postseason for the first time in his career back upfield goes <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds to the 36 yard line so <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> obviously is going to be their key guy you take a look at this kid played his college football in new york city at fordham five nine to ten scored a touchdown a couple of weeks ago in the preseason game against the san francisco you lost sight of him he just burrowed his way it was an amazing run it really was the thing that steve wilkes was so impressed with that young man about was his ability pass protect that keeps you in the game a lot than just about anything else and so <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> dislocated his wrist on opening day last year and that killed him the team i mean they wanted up when the market link nate but they merely listed fires he was under pressure and the pass is and well covered by aloo ga for them well this young man right there should obey you ga may end up being one of the real stars in the national football league he is proven that when he s healthy he can definitely play mantoman coverage on the other side here s <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> were going against the tight end rickey seals jones he s all over that you will see the cowboys playing a lot of man coverage this year more than i can remember them ever play 20th year in the league <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> for a 55 yard little trip to the left no good so arizona bogs down cowboys get the ball we played six minutes in arlington nothing nothing good luck anything go wrong no absolutely perfect like some tee shots ive seen over the years recently all right and there was looks a little body english he s a really interesting character we were talking to him last night at one point steve wilkes between 1999 and 2006 eight seasons had eight different jobs in eight different cities his first one was washing clothes and line in the field and painting the laborer at coach at savannah state university in georgia so now the cowboys from the 45 yard line start with great field position <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> falls down is able to slip the ball out to ron smith gain of 1 that cardinal defensive line jones led the league in sacks last season with 17 theyre waiting for marcus <person player="markus golden" race="nonwhite" position="DE">golden</person> to get help me he s on tup right now i should have him back linebackers are really good <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bynes</person> is a veteran redick was their number one draft choice last year buchanan is a tough guy and <person player="jamar taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> with today now in the league for 13 years buddha <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> s none of their swiss army knife at <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> does nothing but go to the pro bowl seven years in the league seven trips to the pro bowl there by <person player="blake jarwin" race="white" position="TE">blake</person> darwin trying to make the roster as a tight end <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> with the corner blitz that time to force it third down youre gonna see <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> coming right here theyre faking the blitz on this way and then they brought the corner blitz off of this side the one thing that the carolina defense and steve wilts was known for theyre gonna bring a lot of pressure not just with linebackers but out of the secondary there s one of the most dynamic athletes in the league pro bowl every year he s been playing football third down and eight <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> this time under pressure and cant escape the grasp of deal on youth cannondale buchanan with the sack here so <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> goes down again and it s worth that oh what a nice move here by if you can and youll see carolina s back in the day with their little inside linebackers <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> and look at the move that he put on watch smith there to come up with a sack this is the first time weve seen all the linebackers playing for the arizona cardinals and what a difference it s making already the wilkes was the linebacker coach before the defense of kuechly and <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> <person player="reggie davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> not appear to draw to fair cat school for this time at the 11 yard line by <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">christian kirk</person> and that s where arizona will begin to sex drive 704 to go in the quarter to series tonight well do it for the starter stay in <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> doesnt figure to play in the fourth and final game next week and theyll get him ready for opening day in arizona against the washington redskins <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> hit his thumb against the helmet in practice last week he wanted to play tonight we saw him yesterday he said yeah im playing and then steve willis walks into the room and said no he s not so we have <person player="mike glennon" race="white" position="QB">mike glennon</person> who comes in to play quarterback lennon s been around as a rookie he started in tampa spent three years there then he was brought to chicago ostensibly is the starter last year and they drafted mitch true biscay and then he winds up in arizona so he takes over at the 11 yard line first down you see much of the ancient tonight for hina five and we go to michelle well we saw a cave on fraser the safety go down hard on his left shoulder watch this tape he s gonna fall hard there and it is a left shoulder injury it has him questionable for the rest of this game he s back in the locker room getting further evaluation keep in mind the cowboys are already without safety <person player="xavier woods" race="nonwhite" position="DB">xavier woods</person> he s got a hamstring injury and may not be back in time for the season opener yeah that is an issue and theyll open up in two weeks at carolina so tyree robinson comes in it s safety for <person player="kavon frazier" race="nonwhite" position="DB">frazier</person> second down and six nice run here scoots out to the 28 yard line if he makes the tackle first down arizona game 213 youll see a lot of wide receivers coming in the block formation this is something that you saw a lot with <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> and bruce arians over the years but they have really picked it up and there s a couple of guys that are really good at it <person player="chad williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chad williams</person> being one and that time <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">christian kirk</person> so any time you give wide receivers that can act as additional blockers certainly help to run again bring the fullback in you know he s talking about bruce arians one of my favorite stories when bruce was the offensive coordinator in pittsburgh and they win the super bowl and there s a parade and he s on the truck and everything and most of the people are cheering guys yelling at him bruce get a fullback fullback still arent happy right i thought you were gonna say no risk at no biscuit yeah i mean he really believed you should throw the ball deep at least six or seven times every game you had to take chances to get big plays i think this cardinal version under steve bullock s the mike mccoy is going to be much more conservatively second down and nine the first step may be more conservative but boy when youve got <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> you can do a lot of stuff a lot of stuff i tell you else can do a lot of stuff this guy right here on the edge <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> i only saw him for about nine or ten plays last week but <person player="dj humphries" race="nonwhite" position="OT">dj humphries</person> is having his hands full over there and if you take him and a muchimproved <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco</person> truck and paired them with <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus</person> warrants on the other side all of a sudden this pass <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> for the dallas cowboys is about as good as youre gonna see third down and five four and a half to go in the opening quarter let s come in when one gets in the way that the pass is not caught intended for <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kirk</person> and <person player="andy lee" race="white" position="P">andy lee</person> comes in to punt as lussier makes the play on defense you have to win here your back does a great job your line does a great job theyre bringing pressure you got to win as a wide receiver now your quarterback has time and had the first down in their hands cristian <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kirk</person> has played great so far in the preseason but he missed that it s bad word good beep pic alarm juggles it loses it loose in the end zone who s going to get it the arizona cardinals will for a touchdown bouncing around about six guys had a chance to come up with it and the cardinals recover for the td and ely just crushed that ball so far lenore had to go straight backwards and the punt return team so far for the dallas cowboys is losing the game misses it good hustle on the part of the arizona cardinals but my goodness it s tough when the punt return team is the only reason that anything has happened in this game so far that stretch sure feel he is a rookie from famed aboat wide receiver by trade so they lost it when jones ran into lenore on the fair catch they lose it here it winds up as a touchdown and <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> now for the extra point out of li s hole so that was a 58yard bunt put a teepee for arizona extra point is good and the cardinals take a seven to nothing lead to get on that there is keith oquinn he s the new special teams coach he was here he was on the staff he was elevated rich masaccio left to go with his old buddy jon gruden out in oakland so oquinn takes over but tonight he s not a very happy man you know i understand what <person player="lance lenoir" race="UNK" position="WR">lance lenoir</person> was doing as a punt returner i used to do it too you play shallow because it s easy to go back on the ball but lean hit that ball so far he couldnt catch up to it and that tick will sail into the end zone for a touchback 99 seasons in the nfl team leader in taxes for 11 or more season steve largent did it for a dozen years 76 to 87 and seattle minds warner old buddy 99 through 2009 and 11 straight years for <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> a hundred nine inches last season put his name in the record book it s already there and fly minute the only jerry rice is gonna be end of him were gonna see the major categories and it s miss anderson who comes back to the line of scrimmage and we go to and im with <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> and id be remiss if we didnt start with a question about a friend you lost and john mccain and you were close to him what do you think youll remember most about the senator well this is generosity just his beliefs and ideals things that he stood for you know it s im not lost for words for you know what he s done for this great state of arizona and our nation and internationally just as hard as compassion the sacrifice is a plw and just the legion of people he s he s upped along the way do you remember forever <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> you just saw it picks it off and takes it in for a touchdown i asked the question was <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> going to be upset playing all this zone defense the answer is no he gets the stare to quarterback and do things like that because <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> typically is running with his back to the quarterback so he doesnt see it but if he gets his hands on the football out we have seen it many many times nobody s catching him intended for me vaughn washington that is a 30yard return and it puts them up by two touchdowns and still <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> tries to attack extra point and so three and a half to go in the quarter fourteen nothing and let s go back to michelle and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> well <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> just saw that pick off and returned for a touchdown and what did you say it s a special team to score the defense is scored and we still havent done anything offensively well they need you in there for sure but you know you came back for your 15th year in spite of the fact that there was a major coaching change changes at the quarterback position whyd you come back i dont know if ive been this excited for any season in my career you know it s a loss carson and lose coach ariens and you know this is so new to me first time i had to really get into a playbook and study and learn new teammates and new coaches that s everything s been new to me and it s been really excited it s kind of reinvigorating to you know kind of put your stamp on something brand new it s a great challenge for me to be able to you know gain the trust of a new staff and you know im up for it speaking of the coaching staff youve got a rookie head coach and wilkes what s what kind of impression is he made on you so far he s special he s so intelligent he s so insightful really always has the pulse of the team i mean for somebody who hasnt had a team head coaching experience i mean you would think he s done it before i mean he s compassionate he s thorough but he needs to be i mean he embodies everything that you wanted a head coach and has been a joy to play for him well another season for you and your globetrotting ways you get around where did you go this offseason i went to the winter olympics in seoul and i went to iceland im with sweden i went to a couple other places in europe and africa im moving around a little bit you did some dog sledding in sweden what was that like was cold it was cold i couldnt feel my fingers at my toes by the time i got back but it was something that ive never done before and it was it was a great experience golfing in scotland whered you play played in st andrews i was really happy i know you guys just saw <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> get that pic well i whipped him i whipped him real good at st andrews and that took him over to king s martin and beat him silly over there too so it was it was great times yeah take that stuff away from you i saw him hit a couple spectators hit the cart girl it was it was rough out there watching it hit the cart girl he had a couple people they got a couple people im just messing with you mr michaels michelle just tell them wait a second people want to know what that real handicap was know what the real <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> said i was legitimately i was i was a 10 11 handicap you know during the season i dont get a chance to play very much you know in the offseason ill get down to a four or five handicap but i like ive been touch the club and in a couple weeks now so like you saw my short game right now it would be terrible yeah right okay <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> thanks for the time always good to see you likewise out all right thank you michelle and meanwhile on that return weve got an injured cardinal in to the extent that theyre gonna have to bring the car down here let s see if we can pick this up there s the doubleteam and unfortunately there s the injury because it didnt involve one of the guys from behind they are allowed that doubleteam and unfortunately weve seen all too many kickoff returns result with somebody going off the field all the new rules they have tried and tried to make it better well it s <person player="dj foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dj foster</person> who is a fullback and special teams player third year and of arizona state and we will get a report as they take him back to the locker room now one of the interesting things is because they make that frontline stand so close and the back line but they all turn and run together so if when they were had the running start they would run past the first five guys there werent as many collisions i dont know that that rule has helped having almost and mine are doll devil over the right side rocksmith the flag comes in havent had very many tonight always a good thing karl jeffries will let us know momentarily holding number 65 defense first down its busoni to see me well the offensive line max talk about there weve <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> and <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> <person player="tyron smith" race="UNK" position="OT">tyron smith</person> especially with <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">frederick</person> well get into that story because it s made headlines here in dallas and throughout the country this week so that s part of the reasons a good partner pc like that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> s not playing that i can see kelly will play in preseason period to smith then he s gonna fight his way up to the 41 yard line an autoimmune disease inflicted upon <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">frederick</person> there he is <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> he says that theyve caught it early enough and hopefully that is the case he has played every snap since he was drafted in 2013 you have to wonder about you know what it s going to be like as we move ahead but there he is out here tonight says he feels a heck of a lot better and the cowboys are gonna have to make a decision about him as to whether they put him on ir or not i dont think they will jerry jones has already come out and said i have one concern and that is the health of that young man superstar so really who s taking his place just threw an ice block to spring rocksmith so loony is the guy who wants to take over until <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">frederick</person> comes back that s a first down there you go joe luna he at the center position and he is going to pull out and around to the righthand side set up and measure he cooked a little bit like <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> or <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> pulling out around there so that is very much a part of the dallas cowboys offense those athletic offensive linemen and joe luna just proved he could do it too two minutes to play in the quarter defensive touchdown against brother <person player="jalen tolliver" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jalen</person> is the line back there talking about him as we move forward then we get second down and long now youre seeing a really aggressive approach here on the defensive side as you take a look at <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> there but watch how many people there are two safeties right up here with the linebackers ill tell you what this arizona defense is not going to let anybody run the football they got a little embarrassed last week with all the runs that were happening but now a day on buchanan back in the lineup and josh finds still looks completely different they differently <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">cooper rush</person> in there too and it s the first time before heena 13 yards but i have a little chip on the outside there s <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">jeff</person> swam over there going to help on <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> who was the leading sacaron nfl a season ago with seventeen sacks and another good block out front there on that one by an offensive lineman so so far dallas cowboys at least havent had to change their offense any with this offensive line in there he tries to lead the way but cant eat of the way where smith he gets to the 40yard line and that should take us to the second quarter and that is the end of the first quarter in arlington texas the score arizona 14 dallas nothing nbc sunday night football back after these messages on to the second quarter al michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya att stadium and there is <person player="connor williams" race="white" position="OG">connor williams</person> second round pick and jason garrett said he is gonna be my left guard said it from day one and here he is number 52 local kid that is college ball at the university grew up in this area the metroplex watch from skycam this series as the bass goes to smith he tries to hurtle loses the ball in the cardinals commodity got the hurdle <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> so another turnover here as the arizona cardinals well let s just see what s gonna call this now did they call take a look again are they gonna call him down he s not down no way no way <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> has taken over the game not many times you see a cornerback just take over that s <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh bynes</person> and of course the challenge flag is gonna come out they ruled him down and he was knocked down and the flag comes out from coach steve wilkes and unless were crazy arizona s gonna wind up with the football well review the play then again we could be very crazy but i dont think close but it is interesting that you know a guy like <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> has really proven himself as a man coverage guy right and he takes on all the best receivers all over the national football league and he does a great job week after week jason garrett knows what s going on here and yet here he is now being asked to play in this zone coverage kind of a look and it s really fantastic because now youre adding a player like <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> who s not chasing a receiver down the field he s up making plays like that that are turning the game around well he has to love it as you said before because they normally throw away from him so he gets i dont want to say he gets bored richard sherman once said he was getting bored out because he was so good they would never throw his way and <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> is in that same category no question about it well you look at him and get the feeling he could play just about any position he wanted to he running back wide receiver safety he could do it all i got to think he s done enough to prove that he should make the team at this point he might <person player="kyle queiro" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kyle</person> jeffers to tell us what we already know after review the ball was out of the players control prior to him being gone it is recovered by the defense it will be their ball first and ten at the 38 yard line please set the game clock 21454 so the cowboys in the first 15 minutes and 11 seconds have turned the ball over four times it s amazing when youre talking about the arizona cardinals now i think they have three tonight three and then four in the last game and four in the first game and so you have a guy in steve wilkes that grew up under lovie smith and remember how good they were had taken the football way and that is a huge part of what the cardinals are going to be about this season and weve seen it every game and there it is the one with the 37 yard line bellucci i was here to bottle up <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">christian kirk</person> before he could get on track he s second down and 11 but you cant get a whole lot better than what were seeing out of these young men here but this should obey a woojae his he sees everything out there he had a chance to visit with a very bright young man and you can tell that he just has his sight said there s been some pretty good corners put on that dallas cowboys uniform maybe the next wellfortified a bat spot play clock is at 1:00 boise state who makes the stop one of the great things about <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> is because now they have <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> and <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco</person> truck they can put him back inside to the three technique position here youll see him loop inside if it has enough athleticism to then get back out and make that play so now you put warrants outside you put <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> and somebody that athletic inside it s a tough team and if they can get <person player="david irving" race="UNK" position="DT">david irving</person> off suspension enough to sit out the first four games that s another star 30:13 and so the movement charge right side but arizona to take any time then we go to michelle well we saw cardinals running back <person player="dj foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dj foster</person> get carted off the field a bit ago he went back for xrays putting very little weight on his left leg and im told it is a knee injury and he will not return tonight out all right thank you michelle you know christopher chard is the defensive back coach pass game coordinator he was for many years with seattle and before that he was with pete carroll at usc very wellrespected assistant coach kind of surprising as surprised people around the league that he was let go by the seahawks and picked up immediately by jason garrett the coach the defensive backs chuckle here brings on that asifa s it s <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> hacker the game for him in the preseason opener against san francisco who takes him to the ground here s the headline no watch <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> come off the edge again there was a chip again and there was a screen that way but they just cannot handle him i mean i cant tell you how frightening this has to be for teams in the nfc east right now to know that theyve got somebody like <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> on one side and <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> looking like that on the other nice kick fair caught by leonora this time at the 11 yard line the front with a bronx cheer they didnt turn it over but there is a flag a late flag comes in fair catch was made at the 11yard line personal foul number 49 of the receiving team for unnecessarily contacting an opponent the foul will be measured half the distance to the goal first down time out the fullback talk about <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> before one second 14 games acidic i was missed almost all of the last two seasons for i suspend that he s a very he s an interesting character remember them the other day you know if you read about him and just hear about him you think being some sort of a dope fiend he does he cant stay up the substance abuse issue but a mental health issue more than anything else yeah and the thing that impressed me was how thoughtful he was about the whole thing he understood you know his family grew up in the military he moved around all over the place he has a baby daughter now that he was trying not to let down teammates he s trying not to let down he s trying to find a way just to be happy with himself that there s this is krupa <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> and finally he gets out of the shot of his own and zonas <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">jeff</person> swain makes the catch very happy is <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy</person> to have his father here tonight ken <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> that family moved around a lot parents in the military but boy if they can keep him healthy and off the suspended list who as you say before that is some people keep telling me around here that even the media is cheering for him and after we had the conversation with i completely understand it he is trying he is trying to change his life scarborough he s the seventh round draft choice coming back later down the bama he was still on the board and jason garrett was saying the knick statement said take this guy just take him youre gonna like him img academy down in bradenton it s a guy i tell you what i remember seeing pictures of him in high school go oh my goodness i wouldnt want my son out there trying to tackle him he was a bonafide study still runs a little eyes a tall guy but he was the second leading receiver at alabama league at 17 but he wants the secondleading receipt and i penetrate the left side of the line good job lines making the tackle there well set up a third down and about five and you can see scarborough running a little high on that one you know there comes a point when youre 230 plus pounds just dip that shoulder down into the tackler he s gonna try and get lower than you are dont let him come in there and hit you in the soft spot you know everything on your front side hurts out your stomach you know you dont want to get hit there get that shoulder down deep intended easily at a great year two years ago on fear last year i mean when you look at the cowboys and their receivers who is number one well it may be this guy and coal <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> with a great double move against <person player="jamar taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jamar taylor</person> who is the other corner they made a trade from cleveland with and for <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">cooper rush</person> that was seven points off the board for the dallas cowboys so many times those double moves out the timing is hard to tame up because youre used to those guys going full speed but when they hesitate they cant get the 23 so the half its 14 nothing cards eastern right here on nbc that car <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> plated michigan <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> the gold dude omer will be looking on with some interest i bet otaku on now <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds kena won here s michelle with jack <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> who told us that last season was the toughest youve ever had at any level of playing football so what did you take away from all that adversity oh yeah dont try to do too much as simple as that just play again that i like to play take what the defense gets me and just stay within this game and it s been a lot easier he s been a lot of fun in this training account well some of that fun might be coming because youre now clearly the leader of this team jason witten is gone he handed the reins over to you how are you developing your leadership style yeah just being more vocal i always say i felt like ive been a good leader and ive always been a leader at every level but as you said when it got like jason witten leaving and leaving such a void as a leadership ive had to step up and be more of a leader on the field off the field talking guys on the route making sure they know the place and everything were doing and it s been fun he leaves a void also in the passing game as does the absence of dez who s no longer here dez bryant so where are the big plays in the passing game im going to come yeah theyre going to come weve got a lot of guys a lot of speed and a lot of guys that do a lot of different thing on this team and at the receiver position so it s about just taking what the defense gives us just getting up getting that ball to some of these fast guys and some of these idolator guys and let him go <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> your normal center weve talked about him being out indefinitely and so <person player="joe looney" race="nonwhite" position="OG">joe looney</person> is stepping in how s that adjustment coming along yeah judgments been easy joe is the center for me in the second team reps when i came in as a rookie so me and joe have a background it goes way back to then so we always we take snaps obviously practicing and preparing for a situation like we have on our hands so joe s a guy that knows what he s doing and it s been easy well well see you again in a couple of weeks on sunday night football yeah thank you see there exactly all right thank you michelle yeah well see a week two on sunday night football when the giants come second down and 11 edmond said that big run and he is the workhorse tonight to the 31 yard line he s now carried the ball 11 times let s go back to that run of 28 yards yeah we have to go down to michele more often because every time we do a big play happens here youre just going to see walled off here on the inside then the contain tries to come around the edge but ill tell you what this <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds is really showing something 577 yards last year at fordham in seven games but he had over 1600 yards rushing in each of the previous three years and he is starting to flash and dance out here tonight third down and eight and he got action up front it s like offside against the defense neutral zone infraction number 97 defense fiveyard penalty third down is tonko <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charlton</person> it s gonna turn a third down and eight into a third down in three i thought <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> looked about as good as he is played a week ago and <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> may unseat him anyway i mean in a perfect world you get <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco</person> charlie and <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> sword a splitting time on one side and maybe in a threeman rotation with <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> we pretty talented guys the 25yard line but on 3rd and 3 they only get one <person player="jordan chunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> mixed attack on <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">christian kirk</person> and then well bring out the field goal group really nice time job that time by <person player="jordan chunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> who s in a battle right now with that with over that slot cornerback position with <person player="anthony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">anthony brown</person> <person player="anthony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">anthony brown</person> has embraced the technique brought over here by a chris rashard maybe a little bit more may have a slight lead but 20200 attempt like a 23 year old <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> who s just a baby next to <person player="adam redmond" race="UNK" position="OG">adam</person> vinatieri who s 45 kick is good 648 to go and the half 17th oh nothing arizona may and that s a week from thursday night right here on nbc falcons against the champion english <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> to kickoff <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> number 44 back there for to the 26yard line cowboys history michelle talking about where the big place coming from jason witten tremendous numbers clearly going to be a firstballot halloffamer little doubt about that good luck to jason at espn dez bryant seventy three touchdowns that is a cowboys record the only other team to lose to guys with those numbers mark plate mark duper the 93 dolphins the old marx brothers went out the next year so whitney gone houston make the big plays the pay is going and that s incomplete intended for <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> got up goodlooking rookie magic <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> covering on the play i love it when the players answer your questions this is the guy this is <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael gallup</person> and he has been the deep threat so far and he s getting a chance to prove it here against <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> he just i thought he had jumped just ahead early but there is something about <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> galan he got more deep targets than just about anybody in college football season to go with a good team around him so you could tell how much confidence the quarterback have sometimes guys arent that deadly fast but there s still deep threats because they know what theyre doing it you know everybody s good <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> and he was suspended last year that really hurt and if they stay healthy im beginning to think the cowboys success is more contingent on the defense that defense could be very tough we talked about it a little bit in the opening on camera the other thing is we get a chance to watch practice the other day <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> looked awesome i mean looked awesome and i know that maybe were not supposed to talk about all that but that was an open practice i feel okay about it and he was flying around she has been in the past that s what you loved about him coming out of ohio state was the fact that he could block he could run great but he was also a tremendous receiver and of course the suspension last year took away a lot of that that was the cloud that hung over the team all year remember he was he going to be suspended at the beginning of the year and he kept appealing and he kept winning that and then finally about halfway through the season out he went an entire and smith went out the left tackle as well and that was a killer yeah and <person player="tyron smith" race="UNK" position="OT">tyron smith</person> had a lot to do with the fact that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> snuffer s came down as well because the protection really fell apart is kurt back to feel the kick which he does at the 16 and he runs across the field to no avail flat comes in at the end <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> downfield to make the tackle they got a call a horsecollar on this one almost all the penalties tonight on in the kicking game all but a couple you karl jeffries figuring out where the ball is going to be spotted next i dont think that was a horse collar by any means he went right after the football during the return personal foul blindside block number 18 receiving team the goal first leg little trying to win a job busy there it was 18 good call as a wide receiver a blindside lie inside and to the helmet littles the guy s been out of the league for a while and cinema tapes and arizona tape and said he went give me another chance look great give up the cleveland a few years ago been trying to win a spot as a receiver back here s the video that he sent to him this guy has a nine pack im telling you check this out it s pretty good doesnt know it s a cshaped meanwhile the new running back is going to be <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tj logan</person> and the fast is going to be caught up at the 19 yard line and that s bryce <person player="brice butler" race="UNK" position="WR">butler</person> the ex cowboy making the catch first down and we go to show were talking about greg little before the 2017 otas the cardinals asked him if he could try out but he hadnt worked out in a year and he told them im not in shape and he hung up the phone and cried he spent the next year working out all day every day doing everything from cycling to yoga so when he got the call in april this time he was ready went to rookie camp went to veteran mini camp it story will see if he if he winds up playing with him in two weeks against the washington redskins <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">logan</person> secondyear guys from north carolina there s a flag down talking about litter we got a hole here that play was a four yard gain two animated second and six yes carl holding number 76 offense 10yard penalty repeat first down good left corner we talked about that well that i called it a nine pack schwarzenegger never looked like that if youve ever seen al michaels around the pool at maui that s man well you know the guys in great shape can he make the two you know he was a good player he was drafted high drafted in the second round but he s been out of football the last two years no snaps the last three years but he did lead the browns and catches in each of his first two seasons so it s not out of the question whatsoever <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> he will not be playing tonight he s ready for the start of the season there has not been much offense here is if you look at that scoring to go de arizona must be going up and down the field but the fumbled punt they recovered and then a defensive touchdown by <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> and these two defenses have just been dominant in arizona has 85 69 made over the minimum teaching <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">logan</person> its knockdown by justin march lillard second down it s the march lillard formerly of the kansas city chiefs let s say the linebackers for the dallas cowboys in my opinion that may have been the most improved part of this football team it seemed every year dennett if shawn lee got hurt they were sort of fishing around what was rod marinelli going to do and how are they going to fill the gap then they drafted late in bandar ash this year they came up with <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> justin march later this is a deep line backing core right to escape and that is greg little gets it down to about the 23 yard line setting up a third down and six and you know as i mentioned before they get <person player="david irving" race="UNK" position="DT">david irving</person> back he s a guy who gets a sack of game yeah that was a good it was a zone defense so he just sort of settled down in there he came flying in there wood had his head taken off by damion wilson just a guy that knows exactly what he s doing and this is the signature look at the defensive lineman running back down the field they made three plays in the game last week with defensive linemen chasing guys as far as 40 yards down the field arizona takes a timeout well here s the highlight so far if youre a cowboy fan and it has been the play of <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> that is the starting offensive line out there for the arizona cardinals and yet he has just been relentless snap after snap you wonder what kind of shape he could possibly be and he hasnt been there that long they give him about three weeks to get in shape once he got here and id say it now i thought he was going to be a top five pick the year he was drafted i didnt know all the offthefield issues that he had but physically and talentwise he was a topfive player in that draft and he thought he should have been but you understood what happened carry that baggage with you dad right there third down and six here two and a half to go it s coming under me no good intended for <person player="brice butler" race="UNK" position="WR">brice butler</person> forth then you know it s funny chris up they always talk about the third game the next to last game is the dress rehearsal that s kind of changing right now you know the preseason is always a balance between preparation and protection so you know you got it may be a dress rehearsal of the understudies theyre wearing most of the costumes but they may use the second game as the dress rehearsal now because somebody gets hurt they want that extra week to get them back healthy these kick goes out of bounds near midfield so the spot it with 224 and steve wilts mentioned before eight jobs eight cities in eight seasons he had a running joke with his wife he used to go to the coaches convention after each season she would say hey just call let me know what we were moving she needs to she has to write a book she really has to you know he was also a guy that did something i never heard of before and that was the way he would start practice a lot of times he would come out and theyd get finished with calisthenics make a call get finished with calisthenics and hed put them the best two players on offense against each other and best two players on defense and here we go one on one action there would be just this incredible action to star fact is he wanted that intensity he wanted them used to sudden change the unexpected last part going out of bounds is lake darwin and a penalty pass interference number 83 offense 10yard penalty repeat first out it s terrence williams there we go well you know one of the problems for terrence williams right there is she looked like he was picking because of the fact he didnt do anything after he made contact you have to be a bit of a thespian out there out you know all about this living in la you have to know you continue the route afterwards cant just go out and bump somebody and stop because any official it looks like must be engaged first in 20 caught by <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> that abounds in front of the dallas bench and we come to the twominute warning in arlington 17 to nothing arizona mike tirico our buddy in the studio toyota halftime coming up which rookie should start which quarterback rookie should start lee won tony and <person player="rodney gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rodney</person> are there as well take it on the news helmet rule coming up at the half beautiful site on this sunday night temperature in the metroplex this week triple digits yeah i think the new helmet rule has already had an impact on the field ive been watching a lot of preseason games trying to get a feel for that and you can see guys really trying to get that head out of there they are making an effort because 15 yards you just cant survive that very often in the end clearly i mean the coaches know about it they have to be coaching the guys you know 15 yards that s that s a huge penalty especially in a time in the game when it could mean the difference in the game yeah i think after the meeting they had this week in mid week i do think theyve toned it down a little bit theyve taken out some of the inadvertent contact thinking to be quite as big as baby for the first two years <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> you know it comes back to to intent you know how do you mind read if youre an official as well well and as it was first presented to us i thought it was a pretty good idea that if you if there is a little element of time in other words you could see either the running back or the receiver or the tip sort of measuring up and having time to make a decision about what they were going to do that s a fact and i totally understand it what was happening though was players need to get there or have been trained to get there helmet underneath the other guy whether youre the runner or the tackler and sometimes that cisco and <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> seen his first preseason action in the bowl over the middle makes the catch 16 to 40 blue to <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> makes the tackle as we took down to a minute i like this whole cowboys offense a season ago cold <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> about the production from two years ago the terrence williams in the sixth season of the cowboys and a penalty personal foul roughing the passer number 59 defense 15 yards will be added to be able to play first now it s monetary is dora dora s came out and had a huge first game he had sacks he had works bumbles he was trying to make an impression and unfortunately right there he hit the quarterbacks head and that will never be allowed in this league he has made an impression become a little bit of a fan favorite as well and he takes the ball on the 20yard line <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> is in the backfield reflected and it s incomplete you know you look at <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">cooper rush</person> and you think about honey tony rollo in the sense that tony was a free agent like <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> and then we kind of find it his time not but he s gonna take over to thank <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> that quickly but you know who knows down the line with a guy like this yeah he was an actuarial science right and the guy that certainly smart enough to get it done dont know it was a smart guy who knows from behind the defense the presents not game and the catch is made inside the 20 yard line by <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> tackle nearby mines in of five yards and the cowboys are gonna take a timeout i always like to watch plays from the defense this is what they call the old doublea blitz you saw a lot of that in carolina sometimes they do blitz and then it forces these linemen to come down and block down but then what they like to do on defense a lot of times is drop those two guys out of there force the guards and the tackles to step down or slide the protection across that and then these outside guys have an opportunity to work oneonone which is exactly what happened there earlier we saw <person player="connor williams" race="white" position="OG">connor williams</person> number 52 right there had to pick up a stunt against <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> and this time he had it they worked in just the opposite so it s third down and five now seventh play of the drive coming and that is and <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> s going to come out of the end zone and still on his feet with a good run back back to the 20yard line so the cardinals with another take away five of them in the game once again working into those zone defenses and you get athletes out there like butta <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> now he is effectively a safety in many ways but he is also a slot cornerback on the field and that was brilliant he dropped in behind <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> gallop and then adjusted back in front and i tell you what i could not be more impressed with al holcomb and steve wilks s defense they have been brilliant out here tonight time <person player="matthew mccrane" race="white" position="K">matthew</person> used to play that role at <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> plays now honey badger <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> with the pick here so now arizona with one timeout what are they gonna do from the 20yard line 27 seconds trying to pick up a little bit more <person player="tj logan"

with a flag down got a flag on just about every kicking play tonight carl jeffers will inform us momentarily i think you see a lot of returns in preseason because coaches want to see how the players react right theyre judging guys out there so they dont want to kick it out of the back the end zone but itll be a lot more of that come right now there s nation kicking team players were not on the 34 yard line fiveyard penalty was added to the end of the play first down well that s the new rule you cant get a running start anymore so if youre behind there we go there s one right there right yep everybody also has the foot on the line so they call that one very closely but that s part of the new new rules that are enforced now on the kickoff no more running start so <person player="mike glennon" race="white" position="QB">mike glennon</person> at quarterback we saw <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> missouri tonight the right side <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tj logan</person> and we go to michelle well i talked to jason garrett at half time he is really happy with his defense and specifically i asked him about <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> and he said he he s been performing well all of camp and he just keeps building on every good performance he s a good player who can <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> the passer as far as steve wilkes all like any defensive coach very happy with the takeaways from his defense but he wants to see his offense move the ball and here s their chance out you take a look at glendon of course we saw <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> we know <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> s due to the opening date quarterback he squirts forward and does pick up that first down 41 yard line again to fit if you joined us late <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> their number one draft choice 10th overall pick he wanted to play tonight banged his thumb against the helmet of a player in practice the other day and steve woke said not what s gonna sit him down i had no idea that he was at one time at age 12 the number one player in southern california tennessee played against and beat some guys that are playing at wimbledon right now also a goodness cosplay he has meanwhile want to run this is the <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tj logan</person> chasing him down the sideline and <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">logan</person> is going to go the way for a touchdown that s 59 yards as he scampers down the right side the three plays they run they go 70 yards and extend their advantage well and youre not gonna catch the speedster you get a trap that works like this and here you go right out the door is exactly how this is supposed to work the pullback lead comes in right behind that s elijah penny and four three seven worth of speed they are not catching him when youre once again a guy that had a little trouble playing center when he was playing that position some bad snaps i think even apologized to <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> but is showing up as a guard that was a nice play and he framed for the extra point and arizona now leads it 24 then talking about christmas sharpie for the defensive secondary coach and after that last play yeah this is not been the kind of night that chris rashard envisioned although it certainly has not been much on the on the defense the defense is really played well at least in the first half now youre going to get some reserves in the game he wait to see chris in the regular season okay and that one bounds through the end zone and we go to michelle again im with <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tj logan</person> with that big scoring run just now <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> edmunds has played all right when you think your running backs tonight ive been telling everyone man dont sleep when our running back group theyre doing really well theyre running the ball really well physically and you can see how fast chases and you can see how fast <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tj</person> is we cant wait to see how fast you are when you come back you know you injured your left wrist last year it took you out of all 15 rest of the games and what kind of adjustments have you had to make in order to carry the ball catch the ball nothing nothing i got used to wearing the brace it feels good i havent made any adjustments to this playing you know the way ive always been playing that s what were hearing 2016 quite a season for you led the nfl with 20 touchdowns set a franchise record for yards from scrimmage what makes you confident you can get back to that same place really the offseason and really actually last season with the surgery and rehabbing and stuff and then the offseason getting my wrist back together getting you know my string duncan back to playing football and you know i think ive actually gotten a lot smarter and learned of a lot more football from last year hanging out with carson and stuff so i feel more confident this year and youre looking again for a hundred yards receiving 100 yards or excuse me a thousand yards receiving a thousand a little bit more than that david only 2 guys are dumb at marshall faulk and roger craig again why do you keep setting the bar so high for yourself i have to i have to set high expectations because that s what you know the coaches that s what you know teammates expect on me and that s what i expect out of myself set the bar high and i know i can definitely attain those goals and you know keep doing what ive been doing and getting ready and i think i definitely have a good chance of doing that you know your past coach aryans bruce arians never really liked having a fullback you didnt have one now you do how does that change things for you i love it because you know as a fullback you know they they know their job their main goal is to block for the running back and <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick coleman</person> and eli s have been doing a great job and i know were gonna be a lot more physical running the ball and you know it s been really been pretty cool because i had one in college and worked out great and hopefully it works out great this time well see best of luck to you thank you he is something special 2,100 yards from scrimmage a couple of years ago played his college football there it was 20 touchdowns mr fantasy football this guy there were people brokenhearted who is the first fantasy player taken in so many drafts and you start comparing on the barry sanders you know he s doing something special but over 1200 yards rushing 800 receiving the same season only three other people have ever done that marshall thought stephen <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jackson</person> lay beyond bail at a false start here on the right side <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> is the new quarterback false start number 79 offense fiveyard penalty second down it s chaz green and chaz green everybody s gonna remember that name well he had one of the toughest days weve ever seen with adrienne claiborne got those four sacks and kind of impacted his confidence i guess as it would anybody but ive been watching him out here tonight he s been playing pretty well they picked up <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> on the other side who looks like the leader in the clubhouse to be the year swing scarborough some of him alabama the seventh round draft choice so <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> trying to you know win the backup job he a longshot to do that but does he stay on the team do they carry three quarterbacks picked them in the fifth round out of western kentucky a couple of tremendous season is lost in this arizona head but a 6 take away it pretty sure they do all the red shirts so signaling like darwin gave up the football and who s at the bottom of the pile a cardinal six turnovers if youre dallas and six takeaways if youre the other guys rudy ford second year guy out of auburn comes up with the ball so arizona has the ball again it s been all cardinals tonight 24 is simply no use and scrimmage on friday night they opened their season next week against rock wall walk play no hostess bell and of course stephen jones and jerry jones john stephen had a fairly decent career moving up in the college ranks and turning some heads there too so you shall see you got charles cut off a champion up in the game and quarterback he played his college football at princeton and set a lot of records which were previously held by one jason garrett which is why he s not wearing blue and <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> right he s gonna look at the other side he s probably enjoying getting a chance to see jacking off throw it around so the 45 goes <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tj logan</person> so let s take a look at the history of the princeton tigers on the gridiron peek at that in just a second there it is so you got jason first and catch second in completion percentage chad leading and passing yards second and touchdowns and second in total offense per game of course for him to make this team would be next to impossible but at least he gets showcased in preseason piece youve already got three quarterbacks in arizona all youre looking for is film the show whoever for next time around third and six they cant get out of that green zone as bryce <person player="brice butler" race="UNK" position="WR">butler</person> makes the tackle and make it fourth down <person player="jordan chunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> makes the stop it s been interesting i i loved watching the dallas cowboys playing this much man coverage and weve got to say chris rashard is making a difference and really weve seen a nice game out of <person player="jordan chunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> and here they go yep working one they line up to go for it no honey the cowboys are there at the ready bonia time on the play clock did indeed the are gonna go for defense kenapa thing says enough start number six offense fiveyard penalty fourth down it s a false start on the quarterback a lot of head bobbing let them move it around cant do it yeah the quarterback is can be in motion as well there you see the head bob and they said clock was running down you take a shot why not there s <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron</person> leftwich over there doing a little coaching on the sidelines as well fire nice career with jacksonville or tabasco who s herion staff the six is a volleyball back and that is the nate ben wickery who s able to save it from going into the end zone id say it s so nice that veteran football players around al michaels favorite name in the national football league but nape and wickery making that play think of the out of bounds line in basketball right you can jump over the line as long as you leave your feet inside the line turns around it does a little fadeaway jumper back to his teammates and the ball is pinned down that is beautifully done sounds like a delicacy at cafe du monde doesnt it i love that name binet ben wickery they had a nice interception last week against the saints as well yep at 8:00 you have to be impressed with almost every phase of the game by the arizona cardinals here tonight they have just come out and taken it to the dallas cowboys and i understand offensive lines out and you dont have starting quarterback running back but still it s free for a gain of 11 yards i mean the cardinals i mean there are a lot of mystery teams there s out holcomb who was the linebackers coach last year at carolina when they elevated wix2 or looks to defensive coordinator so he came over here and of course when youre the linebackers coach there with a flag on the play youve got kuechly in <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> james number 86 offense half the distance to the goal repeat first down alright it was interesting i was asking about the tackling rule in the helmet the helmet and all he said it wont impact us wont impact us he said the way we tackle is we do vise tackling we want two guys closing together and we dont even put our head in front of the ball here we go behind the ball carrier wrap them up get them on the ground because i dont think itll impact look out bass russia s taking him down that s dora was penalized before soviet tones before that with it a sack that takes him all the way back to the oneyard line yeah we have seen dora end up with some really good plays coming around this side over here steps inside the tight end steps in outside the running back and he is just an athlete the more i watch him he just looks like he is going to have the ability to go get the curve back maybe making the team and he didnt get here until sometime during training getting out of the end zone you have some breathing spaces both scarborough and that makes it third down at 14 ill tell you the other thing that s really been impressive to me ill watch in arizona is to play their secondary i mean they are making some plays buddha <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> that play in zone defense was absolutely beautiful <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> may end up scoring as many points as the offense if he keeps going the way he s been out here tonight and they had three really good safeties on the back end with <person player="antoine bethea" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antoine</person> but they booted <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> and trade <person player="tre boston" race="nonwhite" position="DB">boston</person> trae <person player="tre boston" race="nonwhite" position="DB">boston</person> had five interceptions with the chargers last year but they had five with this team so this is a bunch that knows how to go get the football and they approve that tonight thursday reports stream dairies jettison the wine up well short of the first down and the cowboys will putt from deep in their own territory well i think we have some idea of just how important that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> and tyrant smith are because this is not the dallas cowboys offense that we expect to see during the course of the regular season and i know preseason and we all have to tolerate it a little bit here as they go through the paces but this i dont think it s gonna be what the cowboys will look like i think tolerate is the perfect word more than three guards brings it back just across the 50yard line six minutes to go in the third quarter all arizona right here on nbc here on nbc right now continue to stay man if you walk into this place is weve done a lot since 2009 i do that yeah just look up at the board and everything else who turns something turns it into somebody nothing we get two flags on him so you had contact the collision at the beginning called scheffers knopf may get a helmet to helmet on his own player you got a helmet to helmet you got a hold you got a lot of things going on here lord has had to initiate contact with this running back there are multiple fouls on the play holding number 66 that penalty is declined holding number 62 offense f headley will be accepted in ten yards repeat first down alright and we go to show im with <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> and based on what youve seen from the defense so far tonight what do you think you guys need to work on most yes just keep attacking on the defense led to well tonight you know we can be more superior you know come off the ball more attack the quarterback more yeah but overall we look pretty well together <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> s been away for a while what do you make of the way he played tonight yes you know earlier as a preseason week to you can tell you know he played football in a while but he s starting to get his legs back underneath them and he s looking very well im ready to see what we can do week one fourteen and a half sacks for you last season by far your best season what do you think you have to do to build on that really you know just build on my intensity on be more fierce out there you know just at the line of scrimmage more yeah and just really know my defensive lineman and um you know get better on understanding them and how do you want to <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> an addition to the defensive coaching staff chris rashard what has he brought to the unit yes you know just this attitude you know his relentless spirit and you know how he has these dbs playing im very excited so i think im thank what happened here well that was spirit al <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus</person> thank you all right thank you appreciate it thanks for sure perfect way to put it part of that defense that man oh man they could be something very special sure now marcus <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> that was some year that he had a season ago second only to <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> tied with clays <person player="ibraheim campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">campbell</person> with 14 and a half sacks and there s kalin smith the guy that im excited to see back in action it was a horrific injury had to deal with nerve damage and drop foot wear a special grace and great to see him back out here 14 set of a screen and well short of the first down sure filled so they make it for them now let s take a look at <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus</person> laurencj sal dominant he was there was only one guy in his category a season ago and he wasnt a bad player old clark kent over there with the glasses von miller probably universally accepted is one of the greatest pass rushers that weve seen for a long period of time his neck and neck with him according nice kick here cardinals gm steve kot right there returned to his job this past wednesday serving a team imposed five week suspension for pleading guilty to extreme dui in arizona in july was also five two hundred thousand dollars by the cards that money was donated to mothers against drunk driving so he is back now following the suspension michelle in a moment well have a little bit more on that as <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> is the dallas quarterback from the seven yard line and <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> is the running back for we go to michelle well al in addition to the team impose discipline crime spent two days in jail and other seven days under <person player="will house" race="white" position="OL">house</person> arrest and he told me there are no words to describe the shame he felt calling his boss and dear friend <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> bidwell he see next to him biggles also the chairman of the nfl s conduct committee and he had to call him after the arrest bid will extremely disappointed obviously but at 12:01 am the morning he was to be reinstated congress seemed to text from bidwell saying welcome back and that time told me was one of the best feelings he ever had and i saw bidwell before the game he said when he didnt come reunited well he s never been hugged that hard before secondary <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jackson</person> the first down so stevens bang of course a lot of decisions have to be made by general managers as we tick down to september first they have to cut down the rosters yeah and for steve he gave a very emotional speech afterwards and he told the story of his son basically one of his friends of his son tweeted him said hey sorry about your dad and his 12 year old son is <person player="dalton schultz" race="white" position="TE">dalton schultz</person> to make it second down and two now there s one of the tight ends well see if they can replace jason witten or not dont <person player="dalton schultz" race="white" position="TE">schultz</person> another one of those stanford tight ends seems like every year they put at least two in the national football league and he s probably been a little bit better blocker during the course of his career showed that he could make the catch there but who will it be to replace jason witten it s this slam will probably be the starter along with <person player="blake jarwin" race="white" position="TE">blake</person> darwin who gives them a little down the field element of a wide receiver in college so well see how it goes first mckay mchale mckay first your guy out of cincinnati a lot of unproven talent talking about the cowboy tight ends of course jason witten retiring career receptions coming into the season swain with nine and everybody else with a goose egg and jason witten with about 1100 so i mean it s not gonna be easy i think it s going to be here s the jersey right there they sold more than a couple of those around here and you know the thing that i think is the most impressive we go into practice to the star that indoor practice facility picture of jason witt over the entrance to the indoor practice facility like if you want to do something right do it what that guy did and i mean it s almost overwhelming when you come in there and see that thing but that s how much respect the dallas cowboys jason garrett had for that guy well everybody in business knows that too because she was one of the best guys to deal with for a long long time before good luck to jason he s been pretty good gig on monday night second and eight in the third quarter it is seven for seven it s still perfect as that tax is now made by anderson so <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> looking pretty sharp here he can sling it through for over 4,000 yards the last two seasons at western kentucky last year was very good two years ago with something like forty seven touchdowns and seven interceptions something like that some ridiculous offthewall kind of number he doesnt have the athleticism of some of the other quarterbacks to move her out and make face but as far as just pure arm talent yours there is <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jackson</person> hill moved six and we will look to the fourth quarter in three is arizona 24 dallas nothing sunday football back after these messages heading to the fourth quarter very happy this year to have with us terry mcauley who is retired as a referee only ref three super bowls i thought absolutely one of the best and he is going to take all of the onus off chris and me thank god and tell us about all of the rules and how they were interpreted etc etc as we start the fourth quarter and weve got <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> those are completely past its time to reco gather so terry so much has been made this year about the helmet rule were now three weeks into preseason youve watched every game your take on what s going on i am thrilled to say that i think the league actually got this right on on windansea with the new guidance they from officiating perspective they told the guys dont call incidental contact dont call inadvertent contact and by extension they told them what to call they called it told them to call forcible punishing contact using the helmet as a weapon things that everybody agrees needs to be out of the game what s there a little element of time and that as well in other words a moment to make a decision where it s not im duck in my head youre duck in your head and we both hit that s not a foul right correct abs absolutely chris that s a football play right and if they take that out then weve got real issues right so here we look at a play from last week this is ten times out of ten a foul has to be called they want this out of the game lines them up crown to face i wouldnt think this might have been an ejection but this is what the leaf wants out of the game great job they they made the call and if we can get that every time and get rid of some of the ones weve seen in the first two two weeks the preseason i think this this outrage that weve had over it will just disappear so weve had outrage for a lot of years over the catch rule what s a catch what s not a catch etc etc now were really talking about the helmet rule what about that catch will catch us up with that yeah you know i dont think they got rid of going to the ground which is great you know surviving the ground yeah how when where are you trying to catch it there s just one rule control two feet or another body part down and then football move you know could be a third step tucking the ball away whatever going to the ground i really dont think was a big deal other than maybe two or three plays dez bryant jesse james and calvin johnson control and they did tweak the wording and control as well they went from slight ball movement doesnt mean loss of control two ball movement doesnt automatically mean loss of control so what were gonna see and we saw it in the hall of fame game theyre gonna be more circumstance circumspect about whether player has lost control or not dont you think we have already seen this year though the officials leaving calls alone on the field that a year ago would have been overturn no question about it i actually think thought we saw that in super bowl but weve definitely seen it so far and that s absolutely right because replay is meant to correct it s not to determine what the better call might have been i mean the better call in our plane and a hall of fame game might have been incomplete pass as you as you noted but that s not what replays for these were all overturned when they happen go under the ground push it brian three yep and that didnt matter that was overturned jesse james that was overturned right and i think it shook a little bit of the foundation of people who played football our whole lives and i thought i dont want to get in the middle of this again but i thought the rule evolved a little bit over the years and there s a little different in the playoffs than it was in the regular season i absolutely agree we thought so too and i think it was right at some point they had to had to recognize that meanwhile let s all survive the ground another turnover that s seven well be back hit burlington we have a flag down so were gonna stay for just a second that was cap cappy i think who it was cap cappy created the turnover one of the great names of all time is number 61 of the recovering team 15 yards will be added to the end of the play first down he s now he s been a preseason maven theyre just trying to fit him under the cab nevermind 24 nothing early fourth quarter thanks terry classroom well you know fred always wanted to be a coach you know that right so youre good it s one of the teams and he s every year he beats jasonncaryn with his team again he s our coach he s like chris wragge arm wasnt down nigeria coverage being brought to you by geico knopf is the quarterback next before talking to terry hobbling off the field was <person player="dustin stanton" race="white" position="OG">dustin stanton</person> check on him me while another flag here in what is a penalty filled game weve had 17 accepted infractions now you get down to that point in the game where guys are tired and theyre fighting to make the team and this is their last chance and they dont care what goes on theyll hold theyll grab theyll kick theyll do anything just to make a fresh stooop <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> noise emanating from the crowd is the old the old wave way it s back that s when you know youve been sitting down too long oh yeah but you know it it s one of the interesting things arizona obviously has been brilliant on defense tonight im telling you this dallas team but the way they can play man coverage right now they move <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> from safety out to quarterback he was tremendous watching him on film i think that s gonna be great for his 33 yard line surely daddy is the number 45 is in the game in the vacuum take the him over the middle drop there by little and itll be second down at ten well thank you know <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> and again he not playing tonight furnished uh mia they in practice but he does look really good man does he have an arm does anybody watched ucla football over three years knows whether that one in there see you guys the prezi and mr <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> there s your future that was a rocket right there how many times to you here at the quarterback that he s competing against say something about another quarterbacks arms for example ad for basically was and he was saying i cant believe some of those throws that he rips out and that one he threw into <person player="christian kirk" race="nonwhite" position="WR">christian kirk</person> was a rocket last week we talked about the fact he s such a great tennis player we asked him last night how fast is you sir he said about a hundred and twenty yeah and he said that the one thing about playing tennis was all the different arm angles and shots that you have in tennis it really helps me throw in the football there we go age 11 remember at age 12 he was ranked number one in southern california and his top 50 in the country and got injured and took a little time away from tennis and liked it too much came back decide he s gonna play football third down and nine another interesting thing that josh said yesterday was that the anti year of eligibility left at ucla and then chip kelly came in and he ended declared for the draft and he went in to meet kelly and he thought ellie would do a complete sell job and all chips said it was im with you either way here you know ill be happy if you come back but be 90 100 percent you want to go to the national football league im here to support you and he is a huge chip kelly fan and almost came back because of that he s also philadelphia eagles fan so he had a good year last year too and he got to know chip kelly from watching those games and he you could tell he wanted to play for him but it was lead with the touchback beautiful sunday night september the night carrie underwood back to lead things off congratulations to senior and to mike fischer and another song it was as well that s going to be great the flag <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> but he was perfect and will remain so dependent on the penalty family who used to pass hands to the face number 69 offense 10yard penalty remains first down and a collision there with a couple of cardinals that s arthur moats on the ground that tangled up with cap caffee you know what happens is pass rusher sometimes can hurt each other they both come around the outside and that is not the first time that has ever happened arthur moats takes the worst of that one but that is a structures will actually set it up and give a signal to the guy on the other side and say im going inside or im going low you go high and they work it like that for that very reason so now i feel collision yeah and we go to michelle well with with moats theyre down you know we have <person player="travis frederick" race="white" position="C">travis frederick</person> out tonight <person player="joe looney" race="nonwhite" position="OG">joe looney</person> was backing him up and then <person player="dustin stanton" race="white" position="OG">stanton</person> who was the backup center tonight left the field with a knee injury it s a left knees being evaluated in the locker room but he is questionable wow all right thank you michelle of course they all have two weeks to get healthy forget the last preseason game coming up against the texans but in two weeks so there is hassan redick in two weeks arizona is going to take on washington at home number one pick last year he made three starts at a couple of sacks two and a half 13th overall pick in the 2017 draft he was supposed to be a pass rusher he was supposed to be an edge pass rusher really didnt end up being that two and a half sacks on the year at 17 and a half at temple nine and a half is the seam 1106 on the game clock the clock will start so they were really excited about him and but now they come in with his 43 defense and they made him a <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam</person> linebacker who play over the tight end a lot of times and he will <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> some but he now has a lot more coverage responsibilities and i tell you it is i think the reason he s still out there in this ball game is a new position the whole game is jordyn tion as the running back little game take a look at hasan redick and what he s been able to do so far so much of it about when youre playing that off the ball linebacker is being able to read the triangle in front of you those three offensive linemen and anticipate where that ball carrier is going to go you want to run the same place if there s a hole you are running the hole but in this defense it is a four three one gap so he has one gap he has to find that one gap get in there and trust his other teammate will do the same <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> is now 11 for 11 and that s <person player="jordan chunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jordan</person> tion then around free agent played his college ball at troy in alabama to make a third down of 12 hassan redick did a little bit of this in college drop into coverage but not a ton for the most part ease of pass rushers so this is a new those dropoffs underneath and come up and make the play and so as good as the arizona defense has been over the past several years theyre all learning a little something new but it seems to fit this bunch pretty well third and 13 you see the green zone by <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> totally forth that would 9:43 they go in the fourth in arizona leading 24 zip i think jason garrett had some idea what his night might be like tonight but i think the poor performance on special teams the giving up the turnovers there is not going to sit well giving up a big run there s some things still to work on but it s impossible to know what the cowboys are going to be like based on the guys that are playing in the game correctamundo filled them on the hop of the 35 yard line by <person player="tj logan" race="nonwhite" position="RB">logan</person> and now he goes at the 45yard line nine and a half to go at arlington social media training camp to her <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> against the blocking sled almost them hills and so look at this you got ben roethlisberger s son throwing to antonio browns son great miwa mixture biscay doesnt even know <person player="chase edmonds" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chase</person> daniel who s in costume at the back of quarterback he got <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> and henry as the titans running backs and how beautiful was that shot with tom brady and his daughter that true biscay true biscay signing autographs there s no idea who the guy is right it s chaste annulus backup quarterback i think better than definitely starting quarterback beautiful jiae s day baby with a gain of 1 michelle again speaking of playing incredibly <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> tonight with a forced fumble and a pick six what were you expecting out of this defense tonight they picked up where we left off last week this katene making plays on the ball correct to continue to create havoc for the offense and that s what weve been doing over the last couple games i believe and now were plus 15 on it and a turnover battle you just want to keep that going over into the season you know speaking of turnovers a lot of people think of the cornerback position they think interceptions and that s the metric to measure you by you only had one last year so what do fans overlook just saw that s why quarterbacks wont throw my way to the fourth pick six a big players liable to happen did you try 21 so that s the reason why im the least target accordingly you know your new coach steve wilkes is a defensive minded guy where do you see new opportunities for you in this in this game have an opportunity put in my eyes now have an opportunity you know through the quarterback you know reading route having the opportunity to have a habit beat on route recognitions now not playing my back towards the quarterback anymore so now i have more opportunities to make plays on the bar as you guys can see so you know he s bringing that same aggressive style here to arizona but when now were not playing without back against the ball against the quarterback anymore seven seasons seven pro bowls all before the age of 28 i just wanted to find a way to continue getting better my teammates know me i worked my butt off each and every day in practice like his mother i want to find a way just to snap my to patina to get better each and every and also get to bring the best out of my players well and now in practice youve seen both of your quarterbacks what have you seen from <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam</person> is always just seemed like he s always in control has a very good grasp of the offense and if we could keep <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam</person> healthy he s one of the best one of the one of the best quarterbacks in the league for us accuracy far as you know getting the ball in the end zone getting the ball to the guys he need to get the ball to so long you know keeping healthy off the line stay healthy as a team it stay healthy i think we can make some noise and how is <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> looked man <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> has been nothing but amazing for us so far make this coming all the time i remember him being drafted in a week after he got here they put him right in with the ones he s running hurt hurry up offense you know run a twominute off and that was i was grand prize im surprised the way he orchestrated the offense each and every day only been in the building for two weeks so he s definitely a future boys and we cant wait to see him it s gonna be i think it s gonna be some time before you play but you never know well let s talk a little bit about the division the rams coming off a terrific season jimmy garoppolo off to the hot start in san francisco and then youve always got russell wilson up in seattle where do you guys fit into this thing ultimate goal is the winners win the division you know obviously a lot of people not giving us you know overlooking us right now i believe in having us finished like for in 12 or something crazy like that but all we do is believe in one another and another and that team meeting room each and every day come to work every day respect the process just continue stacking ship to see what he fought it at the end of the year thanks a lot for the time <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick</person> good luck thank you al all right thank you michelle always a lot of fun to watch him play boys he s great some player between that guy right there and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> if theyre like un ambassadors when you come into that organization you just love getting the chain sit around and talk with around 6:00 thirteen just another hohum night tonight for <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> there s his eyes back to the quarterback as he moonwalks into the end zone for a touchdown this turnover once again just took over the first half of that game and loving life on the sideline he is some leader on that defense four targets per game and he matches up against the best receivers and they still only challenged him four times a game despite the fact those best receivers are against them here we go to it take a look four targets per game i knew i read it somewhere this week and the coverage snaps per target nine point nine most in the nfl and once again 212 coverage snaps for a catch allowed most in the nfl so this is a guy that he just puts up the stoplight unless you want to see the ball going the other way go away they look like richard sherman s numbers in his prime second and ten this time they avoid the turnover that s dora who got in there again and extracted the ball but recovered by the cowboys already seven turnovers for dallas tonight dora recovered a couple of fumbles against the saints and now he s creating some fumbles here on the outside coming right around the edge here working against chas green over there who continues to struggle because he got on that football the third down and 19 from the 21 yard line why not see the whole green zone have to get to the 40 yard line and probably even more it s all start number 75 offense fiveyard penalty third down third and 24 that s <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> it green zone just got expanded yeah i dont know how far can we take the green soon theyre gonna be 99 and a half there we go were just gonna have nothing but green zone on the screen don meredith once abandoned mine yards and a half 13:24 is another takeaway travell dixon man sometimes when you get a hand in your face late there s gonna be some pressure inside get a hand up late and he has to sort of throw over the top the fun things about playing safety i used to play a little that myself you get two or three of those a year that just fall into your lap and that s also a benefit of playing zone defenses those overthrows tend to go the other way so the cardinals now have 16 takeaways in three preseason game shirley beatty played his college ball at tulane justin march lillard makes the tackle there we have five minutes to go in the game just march lillard he s done a nice job tonight he s made a few plays and this is go time i mean people know who s on the bubble right yeah they even do it in the newspaper now they see like every town i go to they have this guy s made the team these guys these guys are on the bubble of these guys definitely not so they know a little bit of who it is behind the offense baby picks up a couple third down so the cardinals are gonna go home play a fourth preseason game and get ready to host the washington redskins three of their first four games are in arizona the second one will be a tough one at los angeles against the rams would be considered the division favorites and for the cowboys opening days and carolina against that defense will face cam newton and then back here for a sunday night game with two against the new york giants the first 10 rounds and that is quite close to a first down by andrew revolted and it will be a first down to michele im with <person player="sean lee" race="UNK" position="LB">sean lee</person> and you know weve been talking a lot about christmas char being the big addition to this defensive staff what do you see that he s brought to this team it brings an unbelievable amount of intensity extremely smart can teach any type of technique i mean he s a guy who s had a ton of success and to be able to learn from him have been incredible you know two seasons ago you miss just one game last season you missed five and the team goes one and four in those games and youd miss the playoffs what is it gonna take for you to have an injury free season do you think you know the trainer s have a great plan and were working on it right now and for me it s just staying on that plan working to stay healthy it s frustrating being out you feel like youre letting the team down but you know all the work i put in the offseason i feel great i feel healthy and im ready to do it this year <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> is another one who was coming off of a devastating knee injury he s got a season under his belt now what are you seeing from him well he s been incredible and what he was able to do last year was his story i mean to play with that injury and play as well as he did was great he s taking that next step in his career he s had an unbelievable offseason looks great in the preseason and for us he s a guy were really looking to speaking of looking to guys leadership jason witten leaves he was the undisputed leader of this team so now that falls to <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak</person> what are you seeing from him that shows you he s ready for them you know he s only been with his third year as soon as he walked in he was that type of leader it feels like he s been here for a long time he has a natural leadership ability he puts an incredible amount of work in and he has that you know it s tough that guys look to he s shown it right now and doing an incredible job well were gonna be back with you guys in a few weeks all the best to you and see you then thanks a lot great seeing you wise out all right thank you michelle here s some good news for you twominute warning 24 to nothing arizona boba s players of the nfl at the start of the regular season which comes about in 11 days tom brady 41 through grace 39 and still going very very strong papi s on defense terrence neumann minnesota s 40 jones peppers now back with carolina s 39 and infinitary oldest player in the league at 45 and <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">phil dawson</person>ville of these arizona cardinals season and that pass is incomplete to make it fourth down in 15 with 156 remaining in the game and there is mr <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">dawson</person> he s won the job there s no question about that and he s in his 20th year inand he lead the punters in his 15 <person player="andy lee" race="white" position="P">andy lee</person> had a big part of winning this game tonight he crushed a couple of punts one of them got got a touchdown on this <person player="matthew mccrane" race="white" position="K">matthew mccrane</person> he s a rook he s not going to make the team but he can showcase something right here there s a big leg this is a 54yard <person player="matthew mccrane" race="white" position="K">mccrane</person> what s the upright it s the kind of thing that you know team is looking for a guy freeagent kansas state may want a job somewhere id say what he drilled this one this is a young leg <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">phil dawson</person> s gun i even when i was 22 i couldnt do that he drilled that thing that was 64 that one probably good high that thing crossed the crossbar holy smokes i looked at their attention you anybody s watching and dead center for some scouts are watching oh yeah did i tell you what not many times does it come down to that but a whole bunch of times games come down to there s 43 yard field goals as time expires and then who do you want kicking mmmmm you want the finitary as you want some of the veterans like <person player="phil dawson" race="nonwhite" position="K">phil dawson</person> in that situation ill make those made a bunch last year missed a few to this date which was a careerhigh in may 32 which was also a career you know cowboys have a great crowd like these dallas has not even remotely sniffed the end zone so a week from thursday be with us it all starts at 7:30 eastern 4:30 pacific we open up the season with atlanta going in to fill so you know a lot of things to think about in regard to that game and one of them of course is going to be one of the big stories was in the off season who s gonna be the starting quarterback for the eagles will whence be ready when foals got hurt in that new england game a couple i thought that was serious but he he s already back yeah he was back but he wasnt that effective in that next game so you just wonder how healthy he was so dont you do i mean obviously we dont know the exact status of carson wentz but here s your franchise for the next 15 years possibly are you sending him out there for opening day no cap cap he gets hurt on that play you know the one thing that s happening and philadelphia obviously that wench hasnt been cleared for contact yet and you are youre lost youve lost the opportunity to let wince fully heal if foals isnt ready but you know as you say foals you know got hurt didnt come back even though he wasnt very effective yeah and we saw wince a little bit during the broadcast the other night moving around and he looked pretty good but that s a far cry from playing in a game and trusting your knee weve seen people come back from knee injuries and it s hard to stand in that pocket and and step into your throws and the minute somebody starts falling around your knees right you spent nine months in rehab youre gonna have some reaction to that oh yeah so it s never going to be an easy process there s no way to make it an easy process so it s a it s a really tough decision i think for doug <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> and that entire organization were gonna find that a week from thursday night lemon pressure put on here and <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> s gonna be taken down and that s dora boy hey he s really monteria stirrup and a louisiana tech it s his third team in three years and he may have found a home jazz green it s going a little bit the other way <person player="rico gathers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">rico gathers</person> the guy basketball player every little football experience trying to make the team out of baylor didnt play high school or college but he has made some people think because he was a basketball player he s a antonio gates and all these round he is not that athletic of a route runner and he has blown a lot of blocking assignments which makes this coaching staff very nervous but he s a fan favorite and one of the reasons is he makes some catches that are off the charts going up over to fit looks like a rebounder playing tight in and so that s going to be a tough decision the bottom line is he s one of those bubble guys right now those bubble guys so forth then the short green zone they go in 46 seconds good tonight back there by anderson is flipper anderson s son it is makes the catch say what i saw though arent talent that theyve been talking about with <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> on that one look a little like <person player="josh rosen" race="white" position="QB">josh rosen</person> last week he got over the top of this thing and just hump babied it right in there so dallas takes a timeout think assad reddit couldnt believe it he was in perfect position and <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> just drilled it right past <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">white</person> 16 out of 19 yeah what are you doing there s a tough we got <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">cooper rush</person> he keeps three quarterbacks they draft you expose nfl is about throwing from the pocket and we there s all kinds of different ways to win and in the game of football but when somebody has the ability to stand in the middle of the field that s a lot of field what 53 and 1/3 yards wide and maybe 60 yards down the field and so if you can make throws to all those different areas it is tough to defend this is his 21st attempt of the night throws underneath the 27yard line goes trey williams the cowboys will take another timeout with 28 seconds these trying theyre trying to get something on the boards anything but a zero yeah i dont blame them it and and you were in heavy evaluation at this point because were seeing scott linehan and jason garrett theyre thinking what were thinking you know are we seeing enough out of <person player="mike white" race="white" position="QB">mike white</person> do we want to obviously you want to put them on the practice squad but if you take a chance and release them and try and put it right here anybody can take him so now let s see what he can do can he take them on in the rest of the way here in 28 seconds and put something on the board they are they want to see more third and five be surprised at all if they did throw it <person player="rico gathers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">rico gathers</person> to see what he had at this point juggle then that s incomplete <person player="rico gathers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">rico</person> dried i mean that wasnt a bad throw that s just that seemed throw a little bit behind and im not so sure that he wasnt trying to back shoulder that ball to put him in a little better position and <person player="rico gathers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gathers</person> just didnt look quite soon enough it really was i would have to put that in the category that was a darn good throw my dens have to make that catch and in traffic now theyre going to evaluate the picker yeah this is <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">brett</person> marna he s not going to make the team but again as was the case with the other kicker <person player="matthew mccrane" race="white" position="K">mccrane</person> will audition here 45yard field goal the dallas cowboys get off the schneid oh what do you call that cheer you call that well you call that whatever the crowd number is right now it was loaded a bronx cheer many bronx very very minimal here weve shown you every package we have tonight except this one network analysts michelle by the way standby then you got troy aikman at fox many many years tony romo s been a tremendous job in his rookie season monday night he got jason witten making his debut and then michelle what is that song you sing to your daughter now they lead in money earned and i lead in laughs low man for a charity ball for you anymore <person player="budda baker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">baker</person> come on good luck guys you know man dallas cowboys at anyone i see what demarco murray is gonna work tomic triple four fox in another cowboy just retiring so one more kneel down should end this one which will go into the books or should be booked <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> there he is he s they said he wasnt gonna play in preseason he hasnt and we will see him on opening day against the carolina panthers quite a difference from last year when it was all about you know was he gonna get suspended if so a win and it turns out to be 16 exactly the middle do you know we saw that shot of shot they were number one in yards per play allowed which is the best of all parameters he has a tremendous impact as did that guy right there i could not be more impressed with what steve wilkes is done with the arizona cardinals this preseason well oaks is three you know in preseason this team has taken the ball away 16 times in three games garrett s team meanwhile is all in three and that s going to wrap it up from here the final score was twenty seven to three except on the west coast your local news coming up next so that michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya our entire crew fred goodell ian drew essica and the replays and all the rest saying goodnight the modern context well see it a week from thursday from nbc sports thanks you for watching this special presentation of the national football league you
