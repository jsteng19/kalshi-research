race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>and that is six points for oklahoma the very very perfect <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> for them bad <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> from stanford to start this ball game you dont see if it s amazing how opportunistic oklahoma s defense actually is 21st consecutive game that they have forced a turnover and one reason why you start so strongly this oklahoma team has outscored their opponents in the first quarter of this season now 103 to 13 yeah that s an averaging a little over a point for the whole season in the first quarter loud per game they are very very solid very sound theyd like to get you down early obviously their offenses struggled a lot this year with all the chains but this defense has made it very difficult on every opponent all year <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> <person player="cordero moore" race="UNK" position="DL">moore</person> when ready to kick away or loose you sophomore from westlake village california your kick just taking longer at 22 yard line what a hit welcome to well fatso that was mom right that s one of the things that things are going to do the biggest today for stanford is how can they match up athletically for this oklahoma team stanford obviously a lot of great athletes there but across the board oklahoma very very very talented <person player="richard sherman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard</person> react after the interception of the touchdown post the pile with your high gear hard averages 145 yards of games in the new year letterman is even say it was a very tight heisman race he finished second just behind marking break and weve got an injured sooner down of the 26 yard line it s the defensive tackle adrien saver in since we will take a quick break come back to el paso after this on cbs up flying high above metlife is providing today s aerial coverage of the game below here in el paso texas well steve our thoughts are would <person player="adrian taylor" race="UNK" position="DL">adrian</person> server you would not want to see the replay and we chosen not to show it it is a leg injury and his fine young defensive tackle who told us he will be back for a senior year is taken off the field here very early in the 76 unbolt very very talented junior at a mansfield texas you hate to see any injury to any player at any point obviously this looked like a significant injury to his leg and you hope you can come back strong next year and get back to the level of he s played at four thus oklahoma football team have you been involved in so many games at the collegiate and nfl level now how do you handle this type of impact of motion so early in a bowl game well it your team is going to handle it one of two ways youre going to youre going to get a little bit shellshocked and and get too distracted from your your overall focus which is to come out and produce play after play or youre going to use it to motivation so you know if that s one of our warriors it s gone down weve lost the fun weve lost a soldier weve got to make up the difference and go out there and play harder than we even expected to for him you see<person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">gerald mccoy</person>landover try to give him missus afford those two plays sidebyside and are quite a threat though jamarcus <person player="jamarkus mcfarland" race="UNK" position="DL">mcfarland</person> of freshmen and a lufkin texas number 97 will join the starters up front with deal <person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">mccoy</person> and<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>so we go back to football suck you down in five stanford vampire seven at the dealer interception in the touchdown five oil drop guns pritchett after a 29 yard line and jeremy deal quickly would have stopped oh gerhard finds the endzone like no other he leaves the ncaa this season with 26 how about ricky dobbs beat up a little bit this season great great running quarterback out of navy jonathan rogers with 21 buckram from utep right here in el paso with 21 touchdown it s been a pretty impressive view here for<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>everything everything he s done this year pretty much a record for this stanford the history of the stanford cardinal program so he s a guy that said being sought after significant sp 11 o clock down to two knocked down by ian <person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> senior out of sulphur springs texas<person player="ryan reynolds" race="UNK" position="LB">ryan reynolds</person>the middle linebacker in to stop <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> it takes not one but two to bring down this big guy it looks like they stopped them a little bit short to this oklahoma defense is not going to fall into the trap of a lot of the teams that have played to stanford this year theyve been very <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> at scheming versus their appointments oklahoma today very very sound defensively they know their assignments theyre flying to the football and theyre telling told you <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> early in this ball game we are getting beyond you and paul de la woo well<person player="david green" race="UNK" position="P">david green</person>sets a putt averaging he s a lot further than <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> he scored that first up john wayne s a fair catch takes it back still rolling it s at the quarry it will punch it down at the 16 yard line 52 yard kick greens longest of the season oklahoma seventh back at it when we come back on cbs well the sooners are making their third sun bowl appearance about back in 1981 oklahoma made its first trip to a fatso barry switzer s sooners dominated houston both sides of the football a 4214 victory an oklahoma return here to el paso a 1993 defeating texas tech 4110 mvp cale gundy tossed three touchdown passes in that game by the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> gundy is the current running backs coach at oklahoma and the sooners on top five seven and a<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>set to go back on the field and steve let s go above the line well oklahoma i think the key today craig is when they get their opportunity attacking in the red zone theyve got to do it and im not talking about field goals im talking touchdown for stanford though i dont think they can match up physically all day <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> with oklahoma theyve got to find a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> to get the football through a turnover one of these big turnovers to the right time analysis stanford this ball game give their offensive chances to score the<person

to struggle it s oklahoma offense is so quick especially after big play they get on the ball quickly if you get caught with substitution sign to get it on they will make the snail the referees will

with taylor back in thered be so many creative things from a scheme standpoint that is very difficult for a defense to know exactly what s going on by personnel groupings by formation really crazy you see a little something fusion going on now a lot of things in my life taking time out because that would have been an illegal substitution so the first time out used by the cardinal and they are driving down 7 with 724 to play here in the opening quarter the sun bowl threw down in one and will step aside for a break hold you on top by seven like oklahoma sanford s making his third sun bowl appearance back in 77 there is a legendary coach bill walsh stanford defeated lsu 23 14 we moved the clock up to 1996 the cardinal rolled over michigan state 38 nothing and i gave head coach tyrone willingham his only career full win a little gate array to go with it i above the sun bowl will home on top by 7 over the 21st ranked stanford cardinal cbs4 sicom has complete coverage of the bowl

the ball in the endzone but you cannot eliminate the possibility because of girls get the ball right here anytime you just need more to keep the drive alive with inside the 5yard line in a pile and that s what gearheart goes so well george after contact very much like mark ingram who won the heisman trophy from alabama yeah very much like mark eagan but theyre very different styles in terms of the sheer brute power that<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>ranked i mean he he looks if he doesnt see a nice clear lane he looks for someone to run over and over that shoulder on now right here in this situation craig first and goal for stanford a lot of times they like to get the ball to their fullback oh and <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> stick they give him the ball on a quick hand i forget emotion out of the backfield and maybe get in the ball here from the eye and said they go to<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>there s a pad in close and just inside the 1 yard line well what a what a brute he is at 6 1 to 35 wow great physical run that s the power play that stanford really prefers when<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>favorite plays you can see these offensive linemen take a lot of pride across start with dinner david the classical nelly of the right tackle the senior state fruit of the month they really like to get after people up cornell stanford was up that back here quick handoff touchdown marissa you called it after we talked about it that s about the only time he gets the football and his goal to go situation he s only carried the ball he s only given well eight times this year or seven times that s his fourth touchdown so you can see him you get the ball down there close to the end zone they feel like he s got the power the proof force to get in there he knows what to just get that ball across the goal line get up get back and ready to go to work get in the next drive<person player="nate whitaker" race="UNK" position="K">nate whitaker</person>is set to try the

and high above the sun bowl stanford in oklahoma tyga tied up at seven apiece five plays 14 yards and marissa takes it in from one yard out towards it all happened because of beau <person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> s interception very important break from stanford to catch in on that drive time now for the jack link s big turkey action can i watch right here cray youre going to see that s that s the defensive tackle <person player="demarcus granger" race="UNK" position="DL">granger</person> when<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>comes running this <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> the whole flow of everybody is going to be that <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> but youre going to see <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> sick right inside with the over adjustment to<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>going out to the left <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> six looks inside of everybody and that s why that play is so effective for stanford the focus on<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>a defense must pay attention to it gives marine second chances to get a little seam to get the ball in the end zone you can see there even a couple of missed blocks up front but because the defensive linemen and the linebackers for oklahoma were so caught up and sold the arrow they were at right tackle touchdown to carry baby aires now the more touched and about eight carries for about fifteen yards and four touchdowns so a big play man no i wouldnt quite go that far but i would call him very steady in the red zone and jim harbaugh has a lot of confidence in those seven all our score here in el paso consecutive pap this will angles of the far corner and is taken it to five yard line by the and frank backed up nowhere to go at the 16 yard line wednesday on showtime make sure you join gb phil simms cris collinsworth and <person player="warren rueland"

and we just outside the 25yard line well you created to talk about this defense jim harbaugh i think it was one area he feels theyve got significant room to improve it s the defense he said we have not been a dominant defense we have not fought the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> we want to fight he wants to see more out of his demons but theyre young and theyre upandcoming the very opportunistic gonna get the chin oklahoma ball to work in a hurry up jones big guys miller with a second graph and he s close to midfield dajuan miller 30second reception of the season and a pickup of 22 stanford s having a hard time adjusting to the different formation to play action fiddles and almost thrown at them right now weve seen two plays in a row where there has been a stanford to bend or anywhere around the receiver and it makes for catch and jonathan and teammate yeah a third <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> up to yards or more here in the first quarter oklahoma on the move at the half quarter since im on play action is booked for the fourth cotton field that moral to play maker of a couple of cardinals missionary the

that one right on take him to the crime i wont go home on today free for free on third down conversions away from the sideline down in six under four minutes of <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> mccrory the time jones appreciated a first down and again it s all about the one miller honey this has been the one miller s drive as inside stanford territory well it s just a single safety up top he gets his dick to go home back to the middle of the atlantic jones very quick very decisive with his decision to get that ball to <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> on a miller on the outside and will pick up a 16 and there s no play if oklahoma is really pushing the tempo it sees us drive to carry soil passes 50 yards and the clock coming up on a three minute drive to what the trying to make just a moment ago it can never be too quick for a bob speeds often better playaction jones away again no the 15yard

band the finding up to around the 12 13 yard line began drew number 41 with a stop the native ron lind deepest corner from stanford told us is the most difficult image staying with the speed and space with oklahoma he said yet you cant you cant keep up with these guys how fast that when they get the ball into space gotta go catch a jackpot by john win it the 12 yard line and the climbing team use iran and the top a drive it s eaten up the clock youve got to be in shape steven provide i dont think you could allow you handle it you i dont know how <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> my corner making but running around there by lana goes too fast youre right there down at poor or you face or throw on third down version is rather 10 yard line shotgun

race="UNK" position="P">green</person> the outside but that time very well played by as you said shades go the true freshman and then the cornerback<person player="richard sherman" race="UNK"

such a thing as a fortunate penalty right there that was it<person player="patrick ohara" race="UNK" position="K">patrick ohara</person>missed the field goal but the penalty actually spared him so instead of 23 yards theyve marked it back into the 28 this will be a 28 yard attempt he s five a seven on the season in the longest of 47 which snap added up and to get through so from 28<person player="patrick ohara" race="UNK" position="K">patrick ohara</person>gives oklahoma a threepoint lead at the sun bowl well fans having fun here in el paso texas sun bowl 11 place steve 73 yards five

one new show dont miss a new episode tuesday only here on cbs oh craig i think stanford given the situation theyre given how well oklahoma football theyve got to be happy they held up only a field goal of oklahoma deep in our offense i believe today youre playing a team that can score like stanford can when you get down in that red zone youve got to catch him with the touchdown so i think jim harbaugh got to be happy with the fact that if he can tell them to a field goal now you mentioned stanford s often they spend a lot of time on the field what they score 36 points a ball game you know and uh<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>told us steve from oklahoma they had to take advantage of every possession because they were afraid they could be maybe minus one or two possessions because of the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> that stanford holds on to the football this is an oklahoma team that gets about 75 to 80 a normal game but against stanford youre looking at probably two or three left here<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael thomas</person>at the 15yard line and then russell down to the 20 finally a market in here with progress of the 46 training poison those damper down it s a field goal will take over at the 27 yard line with 52 seconds to play in the first quarter to beat a prichard start of this game zzz shaky feet of interception oklahoma scored settled down a bit they have forgot an interception by both <person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> and mara six score can one yard out ovair up with the field goal and that s where we stand pin 7 which is still has not completed his first pass today then have to do it from home and off nice hole this time see otherwise bubbles it is im down by reynolds the middle linebacker understand an<person player="adrian taylor" race="UNK" position="DL">adrian taylor</person>from the locker room did suffer a broken leg and we wish him will he did say i want to come back i will play my senior year at oklahoma state carries 21 yards now for will be gear high

ends the first quarter here in el paso oklahoma ten stanford seven will return to the seven six group sun bowl after this message and a word from your local station you welcome back to the sun bowl as we start the second quarter oklahoma with a three point lead over stanford creek volvo jack steve beuerlein glad you with us here on cbs so you talked about the tempo because right now oklahoma that hurry up offense has worked out well in the first quarter flips it really has 143 yards passing already in the first quarter for oklahoma that s not bode and well i dont think for the rest of the ballgame for stanford stanford very opportunistic took advantage of the big turnover can down and scored a touchdown to keep this ballgame close but theyve got to change the tempo alright yeah also turnover is a big factor in this first quarter of play let s check out now our home depot tools and to victory steve beuerlein well when you talk about what s happened so far at this point craig the bottom line is that that drive when bowling now i came up with that interception to get the ball back for stanford took a deep into the red zone i think the key was to find a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> to cash in and they did it not only with the interception but also with the big third down conversion by<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>and then finishing up with the touchdown by <person player="owen marecic" race="UNK" position="RB">owen</person> <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> thick and were going to see it all right here as we talked about the big interception and return bible mcmahon <person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> nice move there to take up the steam to get it deep into oklahoma territory and then the rest of it was taken over by the big man<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>right there the big third down conversion and finished off by hole and maurice ik the little sneaky touch down inside an oklahoma deepens that was focused on<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>stanford has got to find a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> that is more the pin for more kpop offensively to get this thing working in their favor the last play that we saw before in the first quarter could be the person committing his first path missed a few yards but hopefully that set him

player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> to make mistakes again second intersection drawn by prichard here in the first half of blood on the back on the field with the offense with <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> tackle shopped and drop by <person player="nick macaluso" race="UNK" position="LB">macaluso</person> the middle linebacker number 44 well stanford has done a pretty darn <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> job to this point craig against the oklahoma run game only nine yards rushing in the first quarter for oklahoma but theyre given up a lot of big plays in the pantry were second down to ten mil game if jones takes a whoop sideline now slide this person is that baseball son 47 fiveyard penalty repeat second out that s laterally the tight end well there s polka music oklahoma offense is doing the feed referee that keyed in on that isnt spurring them to throw the fly for the illegal procedure you know and see it s a third flag of this first half theyre the sixth most penalized team in college football over eight flags again time to contradict you when you spoke from a bob stoops coach football team now suck it down at 15 shotgun john s we protection steps up throws hot rod throws it out of bounds the intended receiver was number cygnets <person player="cameron kenney" race="UNK" position="WR">cameron</person> is hitting will craig what you said though about the penalties a lot of it could be explained by the fact that this oklahoma office especially has been in a constant state of change there s been not a lot of stability up front at all weve talked about it a lot today but there s no rhythm it s because of negatives up from your hands you got plan on a position difficult to get rid of going on about this step five wideouts shotgun toes and it s cotton drop at the 40yard line after all that was one miller but come on strong with kaiser commas niger

with him at the end he actually does something neat at oklahoma every wednesday night he opens up the practices to the wives and the children has a dinner for them and actually on thanksgiving they had a turkey bowl for the kids or the parents tailgated it is the same thing on christmas pretty neat guys you know saying that s a great idea you try to balance see i mean that s what life is but

mind you steam today but the power the strength and what amazes me his ability to come off the turf here at the sun bowl and get back on that football look at look at the balance of pigment 235 pounds was a nice drip from that was actually a very <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> job of stripping the football by ron lewis to pop that thing out as he was going into the endzone that would punch yeah ron out louis of freshman no doubt that ball was coming out no question i guess if the the trying to review is it who came up with that football i dont know if there

think one of the concerns might have been was just to make sure that<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>indeed did recover his own fumble because the rule is you cannot pull the ball with normal improvement in the end zone how to be recovered by someone else <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> recovered that ball though <person player="nate whitaker" race="UNK" position="K">whitaker</person> will try the extra point kick it away and put the uprights in the back and forth battle here at masseur del taco stanford would

scottsdale big fella 322 senior you know he s been solid too steve fortythird game he s played for stanford and today making his 39th start the pretty impressive run there obviously god has been able

had he made that <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> well it looks like ron lin has tried to make the adjustments necessary on the sidelines for stanford he s a defensive coordinator he s getting kind of tired of seeing ryan balls running down the middle of the field he told cheeky ama joy he said you know what you better find a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> to get in position to take that throw away and right there<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael thomas</person>was trying to help over the top much better coverage in the buildin on that play for stanford the tres <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> is set to punt set up inside desire and kari byron

weaves his <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> up to about the 44 yard line that<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>s best form of the day it s all straight ahead blocking by the oklahoma office to the gop garden the marco again two yards hell plow past the 45 to the 46 yard line and that s the first down but two timeouts for oh you and sandberg who has burned all three here in the first half 124 to play dont we start after the except change first intent from the 46 jones baby whoo that was a dangerous pass jalan miller was right there and on top of him was chris evans so to number 24 get to know one another well you see chris evans number 24 on the outside he s in for <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> s out of motion but he s not showing any signs of being afraid of the arm miller for oklahoma whatsoever anybody they put out on that side he s breaking on the football trying to make a play didnt play of this drive second down 10 from the 46 sideline jongkook of his three and there was no full and stanford defensively very well played by will power the outside linebacker ischemia on the outside will see number 42 wolf <person player="will powers" race="UNK" position="TE">powers</person> coming coming through to clean up he didnt didnt bite on the the action from the left side and all come dry to their posts on the play wasnt the only one there but you can see<person player="will powers" race="UNK" position="TE">will powers</person>are going to come in from the outside over here and the bottom line is that nobody will school for stanford <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> break on the ball also by chicka alma joy come up and make the nice open field tackle the oklahoma burns one of their timeouts have one remaining with 1:05 to play here in the first half and you thinking field goal carol hara is <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> as some 47 and there s a <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> ways to go to get in field goal position 13 you think you guys you still have one timeout left in your oklahoma this obviously is a quick strike offense they can make up a lot of yards in a hurry youre thinking you got enough time for several several more plays because of the fact that he calls football the clock bus stop and you make a first down but she s at least thinking you got to get to the 30yard line somewhere in that area to give a hair a realistic chance of making a steal go the language own the steelers take advance and now they switch up of himself 13:15 simply wasnt oiled and now another flag is down well you get that i think stanford has got the message very loudly and clearly that theyre not shifting hucking let<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">ryan broyles</person>went down the middle field anymore holding 70 offense penalties decline fourth down<person player="cory brandon" race="UNK" position="OL">cory brandon</person>not a force oakland a fun the ability to combine my stanford vision to see how jim harbaugh decide to let his offense go depending on the building here because im gonna build the ones on the clock out they clip any 470 need any locking the threats <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> back to front last time he had that country on and a leftfooter get it away big pal to the end zone and stanford will take it at the 20 yard line with didnt you take a left in the first half oklahoma came in to start the bowl season is wooded that as a single digits but it was a 1012 point favorites um you know some people thought it down to nine subscribe to this forum you know not really craig i knew i felt in my heart that stanford would be able to match up well because the jim harbaugh and his staff are so excited to be even theyve done such a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> job preparing all year <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> for the different opponents and bring a different kind of element to each game i do feel like oklahoma probably is a little bit superior physically athletically but stanford they seem to find a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> to keep their nose in the ball game all the time they run under that harder in a hurry with 15 seconds to play they play like they mean business here down to spreads he s very hottest amped up and no game to the 20 his equipment and the clock will run with 45 seconds in play i would think that harbaugh goes to the locker room the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> this game started state with the interception in oklahoma s early touchdown feeling <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> about things i think that s a 100% right craig i think it s the right division youve got the sevenpoint lead youre right where you want to be in this ballgame dont give something silly for that oklahoma get some points before the half runs out suck it down to ten after 20 they load up that backfield great economy motion up the middle gerhardt first time ive seen him stop setting the threat in this first half weve seen oklahoma get out from pretty <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> the first effort when they make a mistake we know<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>he finds a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> to make the pay when he can change oh gerhardt off to the locker room 17 carries for 79 yards and two touchdowns stanford number 21 in the country theyll go to the locker room up seven against oklahoma 24 to 17 it was a bounceback first half as i mentioned stanford down early they came back and he had to be impressed with the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> the cardinal was able to regroup no doubt about it they could have very easily gotten discouraged with the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> this game opened up especially quarterback 2v2 <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> with his first pass being intercepted but no none of that in this stanford cardinal team theyre in control this ball game right now but i know bob stoops well enough to know that they will come out in the second half ready to make a statement go 24 17 after half and oklahoma trying to survive theyre down seven let s go downstairs and sam ryan would head coach jim harbaugh at stanford all right thanks a lot craig and jim we see <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby</person> a quiet first quarter second quarter got the momentum going how to keep it going in the second half well we have some things going there correct we have communication issues both offense and made us use a base use a couple timeouts and offensively you know were getting hit down the middle of fear were not doing a great job with that reroute and by the linebackers and getting the safety over the top so yeah we got some corrections to make pick <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby</person> <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby</person> doing this thing certainly is big huh thanks so much him like you saying that s the end of the first half and stanford heads in the locker room with a sevenpoint lead on oklahoma sam ryan well be back with a geico halftime report after these messages and a word from your local station you were at halftime of the 76th sun ball now let s take a moment go down to the field where the pride of oklahoma is performing welcome back to the geico halftime report as halftime continues here in the sun bowl let s listen to the leland stanford junior university marching band you thanks for watching the geico halftime report craig bowler jack and steve beuerlein will

or more on car insurance welcome back to the brute sun bowl el paso texas just getting ready to start the third quarter craig bullard jack along with steve beuerlein 24 17 stanford with the sevenpoint lead you have to talk about the first half some some prizes and penalties some turnovers and right now though after that shaky started by the cardinal they really they really dominated in many ways that percent i think that stanford is in control this ball game for the number of reasons but really it s gone to<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>he s been able to effectively run the football and get the ball into the end zone against the very <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> oklahoma run defense did not expect it to be as successful as it has been in the first half of stanford and one of the other keys that i thought would be a big factor in this ball game with turnovers and that stanford has come up with two of those turnovers right here early intercepts about<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>at ball <person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> look back into the red zone stanford was able to capitalize come over touchdown in the block by<person player="richard sherman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard sherman</person>that gave the ball deep in into oklahoma territory one more time against stanford able to capitalize and you look at what s going on with the first half trends<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>throwing the ball very well for oklahoma had a lot of success throwing the ball through the air<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">ryan broyles</person>has been the recipient with a two touchdown passes but then for stanford savita <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> made one big play and the passing game is going to have to make a few more in the second half i believe<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>is doing what he does run grinding up yards and putting the ball in the end zone and bob stoops you know he s managed adversity very well this team he complimented them very well after the early season injury to the quarterback<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>here they are they didnt expect to be an old tasso let s be honest they had bigger aspirations but yet you know what theyre here theyre happy about the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> they came through it all well one of the things bob stoops said to one of the positive that you take out of this season is that because of the injuries and because of what this team has had to go through as a result of that a lot of younger players have gotten a lot of variance and going in the next year therell be that much ahead of the ballgame ahead of the learning curve because theyve been forced to play a lot earlier than expected so there are high hopes coming into this next year the year 2010 for this oklahoma program because of the youth of this program and the experience that game now remember oklahoma won the toss to start this game wet they wanted the football to start the second half and so stanford has it teed up and were underway second half and el paso 24 17 stanford on top and a line drive kick and pedaling back nine yards deep and no return for might do so it

people into the ground great balance the 235 pounds the gear higher he s right alongside <person player="richard sherman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard</person> sets up and throws fits incomplete at the 40yard line third down and six plays that play with ibaka from the getgo so could be the prichard drop the football dump snapper was against maam and then made a bad decision on the girl fortunately the ball was from low in the ground because if that ball was up in a catchable area it would have been turned with turning filling the other <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> for six points for oklahoma now the numbers on prichard five of ten 83 yards keep it in bounds is forte marv on the cardinal everybody go up in the line of scrimmage going to hammer a coward spit out the tackle by delhi and stacked up a hard yard up to the 37 and<person player="ryan reynolds" race="UNK" position="LB">ryan reynolds</person>the middle linebacker made the

oklahoma and stanford let s line high above metlife is providing today s aerial coverage of the game down below and what is sad it is that s the sun bowl cut in the foothills just outside el paso texas oklahoma stanford we thought this drive their tutors at the 17yard line pressure passes up top incomplete and there s a flag late or it s been a battle all afternoon between chris evans and jajuan miller you know i have been very impressed with chris evans he s stepping in for the <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> vadym oc we have not seen as it s early in the game after fair in the 44 defense 15 yards in previous five automatic first i like chris evans has been very impressive and very physical all day on the outside right there you know in the grand scheme of things not a lot of blatant pass interference but he did definitely have that left arm in there little contact up the field the one miller able to draw that penalty ad jim harbaugh disagree mccourt of that call hope im bursting intended from the 32 a crisp clown with this 200 pound body right up in the middle time now for the answer to our aflac trivia question see if i gave you some time the question which school has participated in the most sun bowls the answer is texas tech with nine quickly come oklahoma back to the line and push you to pile up to the 42 yard line let s bring in the mentioned<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>the ball carrier looks like they picked up the first down theyre right on it may 1 major it to be syria the epis often misses until the guys in stripes over eyeballing it and i think it s the right call to bring the chain gang out oklahoma wastes no time getting to the line is a complicated process but it s amazing how 11 young men can process at all and get to play it is it is a welloiled machine i mentioned earlier i went to one of their pratt we went to the practice on friday and to see them move around up close during practices one rep after another is one of the most impressive sights ive played both downstairs in the state of oklahoma got the first down there but i i have never seen a finely tuned machine in practice like i saw him fighting with alone oklahoma now scores or 20 at first down here it is under 11 minutes to play in the third quarter so first and ten at the run 42 yard line vint jones steps back takes a glance sideline another reset and um she goes boils complete and diwan miller the intended receiver time ball home just a little bit it was put out their funding banner jones wanted to give one miller a chance to run to that football intent the right away we see oklahoma back on the line see the lawnmower running off the field theyll substitute in time to get the next play room as quickly as they can you got to be in shape to play it oklahoma second down at ten with ten thirty five to play in the third quarter now to play jen s jones again chaka jumps up in the pocket for a favorite masood there is no question golden chance and it s a first down up around the 44yard line you know what s been happening here now more than bread with the office of adjustment is second half earlier we saw oklahoma wanting to attack the middle of the field for his genitals will blaze the throne shams are getting nominate and adjust to it hopeful hold us some on the second half put boils on the outside for the most part and really trying to get the matchup room on the outside about ten receptions for <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> in is force at eighteen forty yards and two touchdowns first and ten inside central territory at the very very back augusta the 35yard line at the big chunk on first down of the nine yard pickup well oklahoma only ran for about 40 yards in the first half coming out in the second half theyre looking like theyre a little bit more committed to it <person

know what you do but what will what will bob stoops do more than one well id be surprised if oklahoma did not try to line up and run something just straight ahead up the middle with the mark omer to try and pick up that pen yard fourth and inches oklahoma by the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> 7 of 19 on fourth down tries this season a <person player="erik long"

and make sure that it wasnt even it s not even going to be measured you can see they had to get a yard across that 35 yard line never even got to the 35yard line just a super job by stanford you know really i think the big mistake on that play on that series was the third down play before that<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>had<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">ryan broyles</person>over the ball about ten yard to 400 nobody anywhere near ryan what would have been an easy third down pick up<person player="landry jones"

rushes but this oklahoma defense bases themselves on not only stopping the run but getting pressure on the quarterback hasnt been there today jeremy fields obviously the key that pass rush as you said

they didnt have a quarterback on the field for stanford in this formation with so big era here comes says he can pitch it back on the field now but it impressed how he s kept his composure for sure but david shaw the offensive boy i told us that by not having<person player="andrew luck" race="white" position="QB">andrew luck</person>who he considers to be a special player total jim harbaugh

position="QB">andrew luck</person>will give that receiver or will see a chance to make a play off the field for a big play then look at <person player="andrew luck" race="white" position="QB">luck</person> 6 for 235 pounds the redshirt freshman on a houston texas go third down and 7 under five to play in the third quarter again everybody up in the line for defense the oklahoma play clock works it down to three in the pocket that pass wobbles out of the hand of <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> incomplete<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>defensive end for oklahoma bringing pressure and that brings up fourth and seven well that s another ineffective drive for the stanford cardinal often very very uneventful drive to open up the second half but<person player="david green" race="UNK" position="P">david green</person>set the pot and boils is set to return to kick for oklahoma leftover gets a nice high hanger <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> take you to the 15yard line royals rack the tackle turns it up here 20 watch out world at the 30 35 40 royals knocked out of bounds at the 45 yard line the explosive the explosive power of royal 48 yard punt and a 42 yard return well ron lin the defensive coordinator for stanford told us most effectively i think in<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">ryan broyles</person>is a great example he said you know panthers they talked about how smart their football team is but i q does not translate for the 40yard dash brian boyle is a fast open field explodes the brother and if you dont contain him and arent discipline of your lane he can make you pay in a hurry <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> he s done ugly things today brief touchdown receptions and that punt return up to the 42 yard line for first and 10 oklahoma and a 24 old side terminal they clock rolling down to three and now i hear whistles at a timeout charge timeout well the oklahoma uses a timeout though 24 all and in oklahoma s first game steve against brigham young here s<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>injured his throwing shoulder forcing him to miss the next three games now he comes back six weeks later but on this play <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> reenters that shoulder against the longhorns and of course this time the injury would end his season and what you see today is <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> on the sidelines with a read oklahoma cap those numbers are astronomical how impressive and really done it consistently over the past couple years what this oklahoma theme is locked off it speaks for itself but i had a chance to talk with stan radford on friday at practice he s now back throw on the nerf football just got clear to do that a couple days ago so he s moving in the right direction eager to prove to the nfl people out there that he can get back to his old form first and ten at the 42yard line get the ball to <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> slides it off the left side pushes the file and hell move inside the 40 to the 30 yard line so a pickup before the clock holds up on four minutes to play here in the third <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> and braun <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> combination of backs <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> ran for nearly seven hundred yards braun did and theyre going to pot rattling reaches in complete out of bounds at the two yard line watch cole <person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> right here with the playaction how he steps up batteries on the inside just runs right past them for the touchdown were down to the two yard line first and goal at the two you can just see that playaction coming out in the second half committed to the running game that playaction got bold <person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> a little bit overly aggressive and that gave oklahoma the big play opportunity 36 yard gain and its first and goal under center jones head up up the gut powering his <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> in stop short of the goal line as<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>well weve seen earlier in the ballgame stan were stepping up in the short yardage situation and im backing down but now the ball it just from goal line so is yours pullback here comes marie ill put over marie looks like he came off a trampoline his eighth rushing touchdown of the season no doubt about that one he looked like he was shot out of the kid and that breaks the 24 alltime and the extra point to come <person player="patrick ohara" race="UNK" position="K">ohara</person> is in to try the extra point and just snuck it through time now for the jack link s beef jerky action jam yeah you get a unique perspective from this camera behind the scenes down almost a field level you can see the elevation that<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>took on that play over the top he said enough of this trying to slam it up in im going to go right over the top because there were stanford cardinal defenders in the hole penetration had been accomplished by this defensive front but the marco morrison he would take it over on his own and fly into the end zone for plays 42 yards and just a minute 23 off the clock this has been a third quarter for oklahoma they took the opening drive score and now they might gender second touchdown here the quarter with 259 to play in this stanford team now theyre in a very precarious situation they need to show this oklahoma team that theyre not going to lay down home here in the second half it s in all oklahoma this whole second half to this point stanford has done nothing offensively has not come close to stopping oklahoma defensively theyve got to answer with the drive here touchdowns by oklahoma kick taken five yards deep here comes blue suit and four there s a flag tossed at midfield that was a great throw it lands inside the 20yard line that might be the longest penalty flag thrown ive ever seen in my life that flag crew from 35 yards away here s the call during your turn holding 27 and return page 10yard penalty foots out now dont forget later in the ballgame well have the play of the game presented by outback steakhouse and see to this point there s been plenty of plays to choose from there s been no shortage of plays both sides of the ball has been nicked our overs punt block touchdown passes catches<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>runs the stamford down a touchdown well start this drive at her own 15yard line kind of make a statement up the middle that is double step bring the tackle spins again look at the power of gearheart to the 20 color the 23 yard line that is a sheer brute physical strength look at it from behind right here you saw all around<person player="andrew phillips" race="UNK" position="OL">andrew phillips</person>number 71 lead and that is that is the tower old play that they kind of call their bread and butter play just sweep up the gut with a big offensive lineman pulling to clear out any spinning rubbish in the <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> and everyone we talked at oklahoma was amazed of the size of <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> but how how fast his feet off and you saw there a couple stutter step move picked up an extra three yard back they run dug it down into pitch down get high there s the cut rose the hands and he has dropped no gain on the play back maybe loss a yard back to the 22 yard line very very solid tackle that time by<person player="ryan reynolds" race="UNK" position="LB">ryan reynolds</person>he left no doubt with<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>that he was going to bring it him flush this is east coast venables was asking his team to do all week so steve what s going on here oklahoma s beginning to zero in on gerhardt someone else has to step up let s start down into this is the big play of the game right now for stanford if they dont convert this board down oklahoma has all the momentum he s going to get <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> field position again playaction pass on the rollout pritchett trying to string it out and then throws it away great downfield coverage by oklahoma and again coming strong on the heat<person player="ryan reynolds" race="UNK" position="LB">ryan reynolds</person>the middle linebacker not fooled at all youre going to see the playaction fake the<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>to the right side and then kavita <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> just takes it on the outside theyre hoping to get <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> in the flat or the big tight end gray to the border route just didnt happen either one of them open oklahoma was not fooled one bit poor down dave agree needs a big punt and the coverage needs to corral <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> hell run up on it oh and a flag ball is loose but <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> laid out at the 35yard line yes that was i find surprised that <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> is even on his feet right now that was bad ammo see it was bad emotion and that was not <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> badda mostly to make that hit right there i like the aggressive play i like the style jim harbaugh not happy at all but i dont think there was any doubt that the royals did not have a chance to make that catch the harbaugh is about 15 yards on the field and he is not well the punt returner has got he has to have the opportunity to catch the football right there you can see batam oc did not give him that opportunity he hit him before the ball actually got there there is no foul for kick catch interference player was blocked in the receiver stanford recovered the ball in unable to advance the ball wow what a turn of events here the loft into him ive got to speed i dont know if i agree with that one bit push from behind a little bit of a push but he wrapped up on the hit you know that was<person player="jonathan nelson" race="UNK" position="DB">jonathan nelson</person>who gave just a little push oh i dont know how that that bob stoops has got to be human that we just talked about changing momentum that play changed it could jim harbaugh must have been pretty impressive in his argument i do not understand how that call can really be made in that situation bob stoops has every right to be upset right now the officials just try to control the oklahoma sideline because they are in total disagreement and youre right harbaugh got his point across and now stanford would new life at the 36 yard line and then the wildcat with<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>again in the backfield so the heisman runnerup is that trouble given his playoff and there s a direct snap and tries the left side and pushed down at the 34 yard line a twoyard gain and rondell lewis has been very active today linebacker the freshman with the tackle well there s no mention around when they go to that wildcat with<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>in the backfield stanford s not trying to be anybody theyre coming straight ahead one <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> or the other they might run a little counter action but it s going to be somewhere between the tackle well bob stoops is not trying to deceive anybody either how upset he is on ball all mine under a minute to play in the third quarter second down and eight well you know what bridget pullback from center with no football <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> forgot the snap count i wish i could say that never happened to me i you know quarterback calls a snap now paul steiger 14 off a fiveyard penalty second down happened it does happen you see right there he thought the snap was on one he had called it on to quarterback cant do that either weve seen a rule did everything in the sun bowl we have no doubt rugged after team clock running under now 30 seconds to play the third quarter penalties beginning to really stack up on both driving the football your heart take the direct snap of the middlee goes to the 40 no gain on the play or pam penalty yeah look at that there s piling on everywhere pushing and shoving on both sides very very bad decision by<person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">gerald mccoy</person>the allamerican defensive tackle and heart and phil tippett play was over personal foul 93 defense 15 yards and in play that s jennifer stock<person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">gerald mccoy</person>the junior for oklahoma city and you saw harbaugh given the first down that s exactly right very bad decision stanford basically showing they dont have a lot of confidence in to beat up <person player="richard sherman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard</person> going second <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> to the wildcat theyre late in the late in the play right there you your deepest is playing well you got to stop third and <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> and you lose your poise well we had a while third quarter here in el paso oklahoma 31 stanford 24 will be back to the 76 roots on bowl after this word from your local station and down the stretch of the brute sun bowl buckle up for a wild fourthquarter 3124 oklahoma great bowler jack steve beuerlein im going to ask you this question emotions important how to keep them in check to a point down the stretch here well craig it s an emotional game and there s a lot of intensity out there on the field right now but<person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">gerald mccoy</person>the allamerican defensive tackle he knows better than that in that situation you are in control sure youre upset you dont like what s going on in the field youve got to be able to big clearly and hold back and not cost your team a first down get momentum back to stanford those fabrics are for the fourth quarter at the 25 yard line to go back across the field with pitching catch tray the tight end still on his feet and tackle down inside the 10 for the flow went to the near side and how about the throw <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> of the wide open throw on the other side well what can you say jim jim dre the big tight end it was the old it s the old what whoopeedoo scream was a tight end takes a dive acts like he was blocking somebody oklahoma completely lost from the pole to play was to the right <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> hit him back inside big play first <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> gray on the day first and jan check that person gold now at the 8yard line <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> for the wildcats inside the five and pushes the pile up to the 4 yard line boy that was a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> 5 yard run right there find<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>again in the wildcat formation just that power play off the left side behind that big offensive line<person player="jonathan martin" race="UNK" position="OL">jonathan martin</person>and<person player="andrew phillips" race="UNK" position="OL">andrew phillips</person>bring a couple of big tight ends over there and it s tough to stop second down go at the floor a minute into the fourth quarter <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> will take to the direct snap will go up the left shot problems in blockers an oklahoma strings it out he lost that ball theyre going to mark him out though at the 40 yard line no gain third down and goal well you made the call right there craig get oklahoma did do a great job stringing it out and the play like that when there s so many people : trying to get involved on the stanford side of the ball trying to get out on the kobe <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> the best thing oklahoma can do is just try to sale me oldham not give a seam to<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>so he can get up in there and get those shoulders square to the goal line id say oklahoma now proven their worth just how <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> they are defensively it s tough to run against this team tough to score against this team during the top ten in three major categories points allowed yardage and run third down gold <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> stop drop no game<person player="travis lewis" race="UNK" position="LB">travis lewis</person>who came in with a hundred tackles on the season makes one big play now fourth and goal not too great plays in a row by the oklahoma defense and i think jim harbaugh is making the right call here goal for the field goal dover points yeah you take point there s still 13 minutes left in this ballgame you got a figure going to get another opportunity little winokur will try a field goal of 21 bastet whole kick is away and <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> from 21 the <person player="nate whitaker" race="UNK" position="K">whitaker</person> closes the gap oklahoma 30 launched stanford 27 and now it s time for our gut coke game recap hi cooper southtown touchdown run 20 carries 103 yards for <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> there s still more to go that one football fumble and he grabs his own fumble for a touchdown how about<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">ryan broyles</person>today three touchdown receptions that is a sun bowl record receiving 11 grabs on the day a hundred 27 yards it s been a royals and <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> kind of day it has been every bit <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> and <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> all day <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> those have been the key the key players both sides of the ball <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> i think he s got a little bit of gas after his sake and theyre going to be counting on him to do it here look on this this drive here for oklahoma try and maintain control this ball game stanford gained a little confidence on that last drive questions going to be on stanford s defense go here craig oklahoma has been hard to stop the second half he s on that graphic there s just something about the sun bowl how close games are decided when were heading down the stretch for a beautiful finish 3127 oklahoma short kick it hangs at the 5yard line module and tackle down to the 22 yard line and that s where oklahoma will start the drive the<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>getting some final instructions with steve right now stanford s defense you got to just step up big right now you really do and i would be concerned about the second half oklahoma s done a much better job of linking the run with the past they theyve changed their style of attack in the passing game from putting <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> down the middle of field to getting the ball on the screens and on the outside it looks very well for oklahoma go 1st and 10 and this drive starts at the 24 yard line valarie decided in motion keep it on the ground and get it on to<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>stacked up man on to the 25yard line and hell pick up one and pick your red jersey everybody and <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> for suit by stanford well theyre going to need a lot more that the people below under control just arrived here they met rubbing low back on saturdays playaction jones wears off throws a strike up pop and complete right on the hands of royal to try to put a toe down let s check it out see where that toe is boil boy that s a tough one the tall boy they threw in a double coverage ansi and thomas both their left corner and strong safety it looked like you see it a little bit a black come up with a gold dragon third down and eight and the clock is gosselaar 1210 theyre going to review it theyre going to review it so this play under review well craig i think it was a fantastic throw by<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>but the one thing that if i were coaching him up right now i would have told him he had time to get that ball in the air earlier boyle was open earlier and this seemed like <person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry</person> could get his feet under in the right position to make the throw any earlier that he did but the oil was more open early and if he could have gotten that ball in the air and on him quicker wouldnt have been an issue but let s look watch his left foot if the ball in his hand the left foot comes down it drags right there for my question steve i know we cant seem to reverse it but did he actually have possession now or then i bet that s a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> question we can see right here when that ball hits it aint finished jeff right now that last foot of will that a roll a little further youll see the rubber kick up right there that little speck of rubber right there from the field i think is going to be evidence enough this would be a catch there was no there was no bottling of the foot no no no on that last angle correct in ecollege you only have to have the one foot inbounds and you saw the the pellets of rubber on this turf kick up that s just a great replay id say that s just great concentration for my live royals more i see this kid more impressed i am he s only a sophomore again he is lightning in a bottle jim harbaugh had a best <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> abused anybody right here on the sidelines now he was the first one to say no incomplete no doubt in his mind i didnt take him a golf of officials taking their time with 12 10 to play you know what officials get berated at times mr beuerlein but you know what i like the fact get it right because this is a big one for both these teams oklahoma tried to finish strong as his stanford stanford going the right direction oklahoma coors trying to recover from injury and move forward well it cannot be overstated what a great job that jim harbaugh and his staff have done in the short period of time for the review the field fans in capri pat wow im surprised i am i am and it s got to be conclusive by the video replay out for me that was enough to overturn it but it was not conclusive to the decisionmaker that s all that really matters so third down and eight and 12 10 remaining fourth coated shotgun lambu jones stanford on the blitz jones throws incomplete had to get rid of it or he was going down and bringing mama joy bringing pressure my momma joyce had a free a free rein all day they have really had a hard time picking him up right up the gut you had<person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">bo mcnally</person>to safety and tk ama joy coming up the middle and it s almost like the offensive line for oklahoma is is not seeing him which is hard to believe because he brought up in their face the

in their own endzone and then open <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> pops the big one and really just drives a little dagger into you 26 yard pickup 129 yards on 30 carries and the parrot touchdown to go with it clock under 11 minutes and stanford trying to put a drive together but down in round we see oklahoma not fooled luis was there not even close to being fooled a little razzledazzle by stanford you can question it all you want now it didnt work out you can say with the bag called the bad guy at a bad time but i understand what david shaw jim harbaugh were thinking this is an aggressive oklahoma defend to try and catch them in pursuit come back the other <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> but no fooling them right there <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> play <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> sound assignments for oklahoma <person player="richard sherman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard</person> in the pocket put the touch on it out top and complete all whelan upset like to have that bone back and you won <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> maybe the best touch of the football all day might have been i would have loved to have seen a little bit more air on that ball that ryan whelan run to the sideline a little bit more forward being a <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> he knew he had a chance of ryan whaling up the field you dont get me shot there you got to hit him when you get the opportunity they want the big stats of the day as stanford looks at third and 17 the cardinal just one of 10 on third down conversion in stanford that s pretty darn <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> first in the pac10 this year and full third down conversion a big one right here for the iformation droplet up the middle with a stutter step gerhardt well houma had his number<person player="travis lewis" race="UNK" position="LB">travis lewis</person>quentin carter in on the tackle that s <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> patience i think a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> decision by jim harbaugh to hold off not go forward here you got plenty of time on the clock still over still over 9 minutes in the game there s really nothing there for doby yard but it was third and 16 youre not expecting to get the first down when you call it draw play that situation <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> is back to receive the punt and a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> one drives him back inside the 20 yard line boils and bumped out of bounds of the 22 yard line c12 flags really a bad decision for oklahoma there really had nothing to do with the play and i believe it was<person player="desmond jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">desmond jackson</person>number six that made the block in the back well this will push oklahoma <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> back during the return look a block in the back six under return pay half the district first out and see if i believe bob stoops was the first man to meet him timeout 921 to

deep and step up to give there off at the 10th to get this game back first and 10 for the 10 and<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>the running back from me tailback pops through a picks up two so second down clock runs up on nine minutes to play really been a wellplayed second half by this oklahoma team both offenses leann theyve dictated the stand for just one second it quickly back under center jones again the handoff <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> off the right side maybe a yard third down and <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> for oklahoma i see this in my opinion grating were this korean kind of virgin it s like particular usual especially if youre getting run the ball to noodle why dont you let it shine pump run off that clock and take away some of the pumpers on first and third down and seven<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>stanford shine whoops here they come again up the middle they throw middle of the field is high and a first down <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person>

<person player="bo mcnally" race="UNK" position="DB">mcnally</person> he has played a terrific game on the free station spot he really happy 10th the big innovation a lot of big plays for him but im saying every landlord that 13 catches today craig is an oklahoma record he had had 11 twice earlier in the year today 13 that s the record third down and one up the middle close to midfield will mark him at the 49 to move the chains and oklahoma s drive continues because it this is where a true championship caliber defense will step up one of these theyve got to give up stop oklahoma especially the last the previous one were third and <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> jones will shut attack<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>has room but everyone is out 40yard line stops oclock with 653 to play very <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> friend is by<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>here youre going to see he s looking up the field not not thinking about the marco <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> at all but realizes right there that like you just get the ball like the playmaker we got a gentle big play im just going boom boom <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> poise by<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>theyre 25 to 13 in first downs dominated dominated by oklahoma were inside stanford territory now at the 40yard line noreda tailback lost two and the first ahead marie<person player="shayne skov" race="UNK" position="LB">shayne skov</person>reset as we look at the clock running up on six minutes to play stanford three timeouts remaining oklahoma two and jen harbaugh knows it s getting to be crunch time he also knows yet his defense has got to step up here you got a second and 11 six minutes to play jones glances at the sidelines once again on second down 11 playaction in the pocket of top he goes incomplete just over the outstretched hand of <person player="james hanna" race="nonwhite" position="TE">james</person> hannah it s a tin know craig one of the other big losses for this oklahoma offense was jermaine gresham the allamerican tied in 26 career td that he he s the guy that they would love on the field to go through in that situation right there jim 26 career cuts down yeah third down 11 three wideouts top of your screen jones <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> protection steps up and scrap it and delivers the ball first down to a tree big time throw you know to me there s no excuse for this pregnant there were four or five stanford flares right around that football and it s just a matter of executing in making the break on that football there s no reason why no coahoma guy can come out of that grouping of people with the football when youve done so many red strips right there around over 400 yards passing out today for oklahoma first ten oclock under five and a half to play at the 31 yard line <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> gets the carry and is tackled down after a pickup of 3 <person player="nick macaluso" race="UNK" position="LB">macaluso</person> number 44 <person player="nick macaluso" race="UNK" position="LB">nick</person> s been on a lot of stops the middle linebacker along with <person player="shayne skov" race="UNK" position="LB">skov</person> now the clock becomes an issue for stanford a friend of oklahoma 12th play of this drive five minutes to play second seven take the head matthew 25 up to the 24 cambered had him dropped for a loss but instead just trying to pageant up its look through well they did have it it s going out pretty darn well but what you saw right there was the ability for the marco more to plan off that right foot flash very swimmer to market alamo teammate of mine back in my my oakland raider days button things up turn those shoulders not giving the score first chest to hit and knock back third down and three from the twenty four of stanford jones steps and prayed and the conclusion the lawn miller now we havent ferb heard from dhawan much it s been a broiled game<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">ryan broyles</person>but miller had a couple of big catches in the first half he sure did that s a seven catch on the day and what youre going to see again it s just another example of oklahoma stepping up and making a play when the opportunity is there theyve had three huge third now converging look at the number of first downs double the number of first down throw up on monday over stanford they right here oklahoma again stepping up and making the big play when they have the opportunity stamping updating for people and food that drives continues play clock are down to three and a timeout charge time pimper stanford wants a timeout 3:45 a play bob stoops showing emotion down to stretch oklahoma on top i above the sun bowl here in el paso oklahoma 31 stanford 27 monday on csi miami see it how it all began the science the shades every team has a beginning csi miami monday only here on cbs so the timeout situation stanford just burned one theyve got two remaining oklahoma to if they need them it s 3:45 to play in the fourth and this will be the 14th play of this drive first and ten from the 15yard line handoff goes off to <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> never stands him off hearing and maybe a yards inside the 15 of the 14 clock run then there s harbaugh rushing in once a timeout yeah <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> time to throw a timeout out there you might as well try and get the ball back with as much time on the clock as possible but now youre putting the game in the hands of your defense now youre saying guys were going to take a timeout try and preserve harbaugh you know what he he s been able to get to here the officials today you want to tie back on the clock and i think he got it he did but i think it s a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> call but again going back to finish the thought on the defense this defense has gotten theyve given only more cooler down remarks on this drive most teams played responsible here shannon on your deeper suited up up you can get the ball by that s why jim harbaugh kick the field goal he s saying my demons are going to get the ball back for me they have not been able to answer that challenge yet my miss drive posting <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> mighty follow spam party events all around a defensive coordinator ron lind and we thought the rhyme was he knew that he had a chore even though he can obviously one oklahoma s and beat up an interest he knew this often still was potent with<person player="landry jones" race="white" position="QB">landry jones</person>under center the last chemistry 35 left to play second down 10 in motion battery is an incomplete thomas kaiser at 65 he played like he was about a 6/10 center not fooled by the playaction mr kaiser right so youve seen killing the fielders surely i think it was a benefit for oklahoma but that ball was knocked down because rattori would have been drilled right as that ball was getting there he harbaugh liking that didnt have to wait the timeout either 331 to play third down at 10 and third down conversions the key on this drive for oklahoma shotgun jones steps up throws complete bears on the deck incomplete<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>had it dropped it in fourth and 10 richard<person player="richard sherman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard sherman</person>was right there to make the hit anyway but if the marco <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> would have caught that ball it would have been it s actually very beneficial to stanford last two plays this drive for oklahoma incomplete pass they get to preserve their two timeouts well see what happens with this field goal attempt by<person player="patrick ohara" race="UNK" position="K">patrick ohara</person>but stanford s can have plenty of time on the clock harrell will try a 32yard field goal kick the 28 yarder in the open kick is up no miss it wow 321 to play to timeout for stanford and they have the football down by four and were going to see this ball jumped outside as youre facing the cam with the left upright the ride up right from the kicking standpoint no doubt about it was not <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> there s a <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> hole whipsnap no pressure just push it out a little bit to the right and now it does not change the situation for stanford at all they still need a touchdown to be the rinnegan tampered with the football 321 the clock and davina picture the senior from tacoma <person player="rj washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> has the ball in his hand most and socket and a flag is down yeah cool start offense fiveyard penalty first out so you move it back by with a knife flag thrown off stanford just missed it that s no <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> the penalty makes a person 15hp flag thrown between oklahoman s happy theyre high up the middle and the big body pushes for five to the 20 yard line coming up on three minutes to play steven talk about big plays you need one now timeouts im correcting one remaining four standard oklahoma wood well you dont want to stop with the five yard motion penalty but stanford trying to make up for like a down ten it completes short here on strategy guerra try to dig it out of the turf that stops the clock to 48 to play but third down and ten third and ten tough tough situation to be in savita prichard the senior he s been in big tough situations before led the big three the surprising victory last year gets usd understand for cardinal but now he s never had a bigger play this one right here this is his opportunity to show he s made up let s see if he can answer the bell has to convert on this third down and ten to 48 to play from the 20yard line prichard from the shotgun rolling pumps goes back across the field <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">gerhart</person> has it at the 20 stiff arms and has tackled down short of the first down at the 27<person player="david king" race="UNK" position="DL">david king</person>number 90 stayed at home and makes the tackle then that is a tremendous play by<person player="david king" race="UNK" position="DL">david king</person>all the actions that the balls coming to the right side only<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>leaking out back to the left stanford uses the last timeout here look at the discipline david keene you can see him right there he just said wait a minute got a pretty <person player="stephen good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> planner just look behind me made the vita printer throw the ball over the top which bought him some time to turn and run down<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>that s a great point because <person player="david king" race="UNK" position="DL">king</person> actually helped himself he really did fall being pushed up and over the top his instinct to react back to<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>did stay in that passing lane forced the beat up richer to put it up and over him allowed him to get that time to go run down <person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby</person> gard so the cardinal are gathered around <person player="jimmy stevens" race="UNK" position="K">jimmy</person> harbaugh fourth and 2 no timeouts remaining 228 to play well you have to have to get the fourth and 2 to keep this drive alive still a lot of time on the clock and of course you can use a sideline with no timeout yep you can but youre not really concerned about the time right now youre concerned about finding a <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> to make those two yards do you put the ball in the hands and<person player="toby gerhart" race="UNK" position="RB">toby gerhart</person>im sure that the oklahoma now though the heisman trophy runnerup he s been the goto guy out here 32 carries 135 yards right here here were most dependable and fever if youre going to throw the football that chamber goes to most rifle gerhardt alongside <person player="tavita pritchard" race="UNK" position="QB">pritchard</person> on pressures not filled it up for grabs complete gerhardt were trying to come back to help his quarterback the montre <person player="demontre hurst" race="UNK" position="DB">hurst</person> of freshmen knocked that ball down in oklahoma will have possession this play was designed to get the ball quickly in the flat to a wushu but oklahoma played it very well the vita pitcher would not count on holding that ball for that <person player="erik long" race="UNK" position="DL">long</person> youre going to need like to throw that ball right now there s a wushu but you saw oklahoma played it very very well that was<person player="jonathan nelson" race="UNK" position="DB">jonathan

gerhart</person>he was been up a tough runner today 32 carries 135 yards and out im out cold when you cant say enough about the job that this oklahoma defense did in the second half and really hold oklahoma team their offense came out and scored two touchdowns take control this ball game to start the second half and stanford was not able to answer no i got a question steve with the time ive used by oklahoma and you know about the hurry up do you switch gears now and say let s run three plays you call them and you let the clock for your best friend i think you have to i mean i would be extremely surprised if oklahoma did anything other than run the ball right up the bill the field and shoot every second on that play block every time they know that stanford is now out of timeouts there s no <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> from us off the clock youre going to get the 1/2 minute stoppage but that s about it im sure that exactly what bob stoops is having his staff tell the players hey we are not in hurry up mode were trying to use every second we possibly can jones goes under center and hell take a seat and happy to lose a few yards and let the clock run now i dont necessarily agree with that im a white one of the lose yardage either <person player="tress way" race="UNK" position="K">way</person> this clock is running down to twominute drill now you see the play clock at 30 3127 oklahoma oh you trailed at the half they came out made a statement steve in the third quarter well it sure did then did it control this whole second half <person
