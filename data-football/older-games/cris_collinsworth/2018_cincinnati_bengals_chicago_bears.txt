other day and im sitting there talking to solomon wolcott s who actually was a teammate of mine on the 88 team and one of the comments he made he said i dont know if ive seen a better defensive line than what we have now you know ive got <person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dunlap</person> and <person player="michael johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">johnson</person> youve got billions whove had an excellent camp and right there you see gino <person player="geno atkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">atkins</person> who is a nightmare for anybody that tries the block on sacks last year 61 in his career 29 of those in the last three seasons blowing play dead and a timeout for chicago chicago at their first timeout 30 seconds so true biscay and the bears will rethink things a little bit you do see that defensive line make a nice early impact well you see carl our axe i was going to talk about <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carl lawson</person> but you have dont happen <person player="michael johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">johnson</person> you have genome <person player="andrew billings" race="nonwhite" position="DT">billings</person> and then you just bring in a guy that had a pretty good rookie year and <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carl lawson</person> that auburn he can rush the passer and the great thing you know dave lapham i kind of talked about him and dave talks about how low he can get <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carl lawson</person> is he s coming around the corner which makes it not only his speed and strength that makes it that much tougher for an offensive tackle when he has the ability and the flexibility to give that low and come around the corner all centers on an obvious passing down third and 13 roughing the passer penalty keeping this drive alive for the bears the chicago 38 biscay to throw under pressure eel one black is down behind the plate he slide short of the first down marker example of gino you got to hold them and he could not block them so i believe it s against the bears holding number 97 gino <person player="geno atkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">atkins</person> just camps the referee holy so chicago will parks backward center 65 cody white hair right there just naps and pulls him down dino has got that combination power and speed not to mention the leverage that he has right there is getting away and use number 65 cody white hair the third gear player out of kansas state former secondround pick the center for the first time as a rookie into the allrookie team well this is a <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> third and 23 this snuffed out near the line of scrimmage dark wes denard and miller stopped for one yard loss it s fourth down excellent play by denard breaking on the football see if to biscuit gets an odd tip with the thenardiers right there in a hurry tackle to see them coming right here get by the tap walker makes the tackle excellent he hasnt played by dark question are both donnell back but <person player="tyler boyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boyd</person> back to return <person player="tyler boyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boyd</person> under it goes to work knock mr 36 stumbles

gain of a yard last year falling a bit short of expectation it s been talked about quite a bit 25 touchdowns though second down <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">dalton</person> fires it completes a jet braid plane steps on the man s side there s territory of the 48 a <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">green</person> picking up where he left off there s a guy that you know can get open just a nice crossing route underneath the linebackers hair and he dont do it a nice job dumping it off good protection there he was hit a little late but still plenty of time to hit <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj green</person> i tell you what good <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj green</person> and some of those

healthy man look out 22yard gain and the first down bears territory doulton under center handoff right and on the stop in a couple yards let s take a look at who you think be looking out for our offense i think the natural guy is <person player="billy price" race="white" position="C">billy price</person> their number one pick and the draft this year is getting his first start here in ohio state and then when <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark walton</person> comes in as we know the starters wont <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> will probably not be in that <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark walton</person> from miami of florida im curious to see this young man zom a is the animal left second and eight nixon on the cuff back team went on the stop in third down three last year 626 yards they wanted to be a bell cow back and if this offensive line gets the push that think we both think they could get it s gonna be in the big pool and for <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mixon</person> allows a great cut by mixing on that play it was a nice little push to the left but he saw an opening back to the right and that s the excellent thing about a running back by dill mixing great vision has that ability to cut it back a nice game theyre rolling away for pressure one step out of bounds <person player="chase daniel" race="white" position="QB">chase</person> quick kowski but a flag flies dark jerseys out there which come from chicago good job by indeed all and pull it down and getting the first down you have reached the line of game holding defense in the road brice <person player="bryce callahan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">callahan</person> who steps in for <person player="prince amukamara" race="nonwhite" position="DB">prince amukamara</person> who s not expected to play believe he was holding number 18 8 champ <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">green</person> if im not wondering on c and e doing a good job pulling down kind of hard to see but the dutchman moved there didnt see anything down pill didnt try to force it we got the boots down with the camp watch gino <person player="geno atkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">atkins</person> you hold him if he can defend against <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj green</person> you hold him to backfield <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mixon</person> spun off with teemo and <person player="adrian amos" race="nonwhite" position="DB">amos</person> and the bengals first drive goes for 624 yards about that were talking throwing the football wide receivers tied in let s not leave out <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> right here nice little move he fakes his fit farm gets by the first defender teemu and then takes it in wow you can hand it off to him throw it out to him he knows what to do with it while nice spin move there great balance did not have a receiving touchdown on his 30 receptions last year but <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> phenomenal catch him run as they go six plays 64 yards in just over three minutes man <person player="jonathan bullard" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jonathan</person> brown on to the extra point it s a real good sign the previous play under review play being reviewed

position="DE">jonathan</person> brown on to kick the point after you were to hold <person player="clark harris" race="white" position="TE">clark harris</person> the snap brown has never hit a field goal competitively she his first point after here the preseason all put down by hubert and brown sails it right through the uprights to explosive plays in twenty yards or more the bengals on that drive rather talk about verticality it s a couple of short throws with a lot of athleticism on the back end we got that right mike is amazing <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> great bounce right here as he shakes off one tackler spins away from another and i guess the question was when he put the hand down but he was not down confirmed touchdown that s just amazing balance right there wow i was <person player="adrian amos" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian amos</person> tried to make that tackle got a little bit of them but not all of them oh mixins looking good at the outset <person player="randy bullock" race="white" position="K">randy bullock</person> on with a kickoff brown put the first one out the back of the endzone mizell is back deep to return for the bears and <person player="randy bullock" race="white" position="K">bullock</person> five yards deep mizell from the end zone gobbled up inside the 20 is 17 yard

grail 6 to 9 pm every monday then tune in on wednesdays 6 to 8 pm from bengals game plan presented by bud light fridays 3 to 6 pm bengals pep rally live for buffalo wings and rings well get another look at mr biscay it was a drive that ultimately only netted 3 yards on five plays when you include all the penalties first time out biscay handing off mizell stretching boston 20yard line <person player="dre kirkpatrick" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dre kirkpatrick</person> and on the stop mike you had all the starters into except one young man number 30 jesse bates the safety from wake forest one of their draft picks so he gets a chance to work and then with the number once bates out of schneider high school where he had nine interceptions of the senior tying pretty good safety <person player="rod taylor" race="nonwhite" position="OG">rod</person> woodson for their high school record id say he s pretty good you know yep the fort wayne indiana for biscay hands off to mizell the two collide the backfield <person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dunlap</person> was closest to it i think without the collision there by the quarterback and running back i think <person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carlos dunlap</person> makes the play anyway he was right there great penetration by the veteran took a new side move and i tell you what that s good quickness there by <person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carlos dunlap</person> if he doesnt i know <person player="shawn williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shawn williams</person> wouldve bobby nasty is still looking for the right tackle in the bears it s third down and eight from the mayor s 19 high snap for biscay stepping forward from behind the throw to white is incomplete his hand fighting with jackson and it s a another shortlived drive this new look bears offense let s take great effort by <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carl lawson</person> carl lassen goes all the way around the corner and then stops and comes back and it gets his hand on the ball <person player="charles leno" race="nonwhite" position="OT">charles</person> reynolds une eur did a decent job taking <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> around the corner but he wasnt gonna stop he s gonna keep going the play still gone that s the impressive thing about <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carl lawson</person> there s 100% go the entire time he s in there <person player="pat odonnell" race="white" position="P">odonnell</person> is back then tweaking his steps in his stance a little bit donald drives it away <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> trailing inside his 30 and from the 26 <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> wrapped up from behind and pulled down at the 35 a nine yard return and the bengals offense comes back onto the field good start for the day good start feel too tired discounters now through august 15th by four cooper tires and receive two tickets to select bengals regular season games only at the home of free alignment vinnie ray slow off the field and injury the linebacker and 85 tackles a year ago was listed behind <person player="nick vigil" race="white" position="LB">nick vigil</person> in the opening depth chart that s a blow to a really good line back in court it really has been he s done a tremendous job over the years filling in for guys that are either not in there injured and he continues to be very consistent his intercepted as <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> fell down wall run back here taunting back <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle fuller</person> touchdown chicago 47 yard return as <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> fell down and the bears are on the board ill pull the right thing you talk <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> fall down theyre trying to get him involved in the game here we will play action fake a little pressure up in his face but nothing serious just a matter of <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> falling down <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> making the pick and making a nice run into the end zone for six <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> signing a deep young contract over the offseason cody parky new contract with the bears over the offseason it s the extra point through seven all now as <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle fuller</person> runs back a touchdown 633 to go in this first quarter a little bit unlucky play there for cincinnati is that it really was i mean you know they still had the number ones in there trying to get <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> and it appeared that he had a chance to complete the pass but he just fell down in kailua the ball was right in his hand makes the pick but then he does a nice job running it in his own well take a look at it right here you see a little plaque some faith like there a little hand in the face but nothing serious <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> just falls down and <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle fuller</person> makes the pick comes up makes one guy miss and he takes it in the end zone for the touchdown <person player="kyle fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> better than he s ever been before word told the second quarterback taken out of virginia tech in the 2014 draft ericsson its back to return and cody parky will send this away to take a knee well well see that same unit make its way out anyone play on the last drive and i think a lot of the question marks with this first team offense we know the offensive line will probably outlast <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">andy dalton</person> and <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj green</person> and some of the ones how these tackles are going to defend defensive lines the bears that have a lot of talent well you know it s interesting andrew what would go to the rams for you figure oh boy he and <person player="jake fisher" race="white" position="OT">fisher</person> at their time but no they go after 40 but glen in the offseason and now they got <person player="bobby hart" race="nonwhite" position="OG">bobby hart</person> as a free agent theyre both starting today he fani <person player="giovani bernard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard</person> stretching left stood up and rocked out of bounds marcus like that attitude youll see the end of the run by jill giovanni right here you see vice out in front pulling doing a nice job blocking what s the end of this run this is what i like he s not going down he kind of gives him a little shove says get away from me get away from me got to take me down that s what i love it there s got to be an attitude look at that right there just make sure you know you dont go too far but let them know that youre serious kowski when we <person player="giovani bernard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard</person> there as preneur depends it up the gut gets topped up in the backfield and <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie jackson</person> actually brings him down that time the bears have nice penetration and to make sure that you plug those holes let the runningback get around the corner we didnt have a chance at time to get outside so third down at six bengals offense last year at the bottom of the nfl to throw in the bears territory and it s another big play to <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">green</person> <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus cooper</person> on the coverage one eight throw plenty of time an amazing throw by <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">andy dalton</person> but just throw it the laser watches wham right in front of the defender you mentioned about their offense they were 26 total points board total offense they were 32 in the league last year passing 27 they got to pick that up a few notches why does on a 26 yard completion theyre not quite 50 but no duo is more 50yard i said catches <person player="giovani bernard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard</person> on some little <person player="abdullah anderson" race="white" position="DT">anderson</person> there on the stop this is a staggering statistic i didnt didnt see you coming exactly i tell you these guys have been just amazing you look at the secondplace 19 between <person player="aaron lynch" race="UNK" position="DE">aaron</person> rodgers and jordy nelson so you know that streaks over with because jordy nelson is no longer there but i have a feeling that <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">dalton</person> the <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">green</person> is going to continue in a big big way eighth season together tyler croft tylar cough we did a nice job last year filling in for an injured <person player="tyler eifert" race="white" position="TE">tyler eifert</person> youll see right here just a little too quick because he was going out to try to reach linebacker bring it back to second down and seven <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">dalton</person> quick threestep drop then completes <person player="josh malone" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh malone</person> and run out of bounds by cooper <person player="josh malone" race="nonwhite" position="WR">malone</person> a bit of a hamstring earlier in camp but with these young receivers that allowed the fubon for brandon lafell last week josh little ive liked him since he got here from tenth university of tennessee and right there there s a nice timing route the ball is in the air as he makes his cut enough for a first down <person player="tyler boyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boyd</person> in motion <person player="giovani bernard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard</person> now alone back <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">dalton</person> on the gives <person player="giovani bernard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard</person> lowers his pants that s near the first down marker another area where they need to go right there you see white shoe jersey on black jersey nice little push <person player="giovani bernard" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard</person> finds that hole and we talked about the passing game the russian game was 31st so we keep this up that will move up quite a few notches this year please shorten at the three <person player="eddie jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie jackson</person> keeping him out eight first downs now for the bengals offense to chicago s one <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">dalton</person> looks for <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> just out of the reach to paul <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> down with one hand if a drought there to the corner of the endzone trying to hit <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> right after he made that nice move man ill tell you what <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj</person> s been getting open no surprise <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> makes a nice catch and ice move and then <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> on the touchdown catch not only catches the football but makes a nice move making two defenders miss for the bengals that the hope is all these explosive athletes will help just as much as the more vertically inclined passing game croft and <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> switch places on second and goal got him boy touchdown cincinnati 3 run into the first team offense two touchdowns who do you pick with you double i mean if that continued like you said you got <person player="rod

position="WR">aj</person> and andy to remind us look theyre pretty good players and now we get down to the the stuff that were really interested in is trying to figure out the next wave of guys and make sure we keep the right one you know what i enjoyed find joy between <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> involved in catching the football <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mixon</person> catching the football then as we know he can run the football key and his moves down for africa no doubt and he s got fantastic man says does pio so those guys are going to be involved take one mizell theyre on the run the second down and four a look at the first quarter statistics brought to you by gold star chile and 103 passing yards and it wasnt necessarily two feet <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> passes it was shorter passes with explosive plays yeah the timing really looked good between honesty between <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj</person> and andy and that s that s <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> standing those guys know each other well but the pass protection held up on plays and then we were able to run the ball a little bit and that was good danuel going deep there misfires for <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony miller</person> who s impressed well all this talk about the offensive line what have you gotten in that first quarter well so far so good you know you know it s gonna be an entire preseason sorting that out you know those guys have to gel as one and as the coaches figure out who the best five are as we go forward that group will have to gel is one that will be an important route for us it is for every team every team is going through the same thing it s hard to have year in and year out continuity with five guys and so you know were going through what a lot of teams were going through but so far so good with that good one of the guys i point out on offense of course is our number one pick <person player="billy price" race="white" position="C">billy price</person> on ohio state we highlighted where he pulled around the end made a nice block on a quarterback showed his speed and his athleticism getting out there he sure did and you know not going with no bad snap so we maybe got that behind us i you know it s good to see he s gonna be a fantastic player for us he s still young in this league he s gonna have growing pains like every young player does but so far so good with <person player="adam shaheen" race="white" position="TE">adam shaheen</person> brought down by a <person player="hardy nickerson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">hardy nickerson</person> after a lengthy gain there itll be 1st down and 10 defensively we spoke a lot in that first quarter by <person player="jordan evans" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jordan evans</person> he s been a bit of a ball hog yeah you know jordans getting the chance to play a lot tonight and that that s good you know he was a guy that we really had high hopes for and in the draft process and then when he got here he really hasnt disappointed and he s continued to get bigger and stronger and he s really athletic so he s a type a linebacker that you dont have to take off the field if you dont want to and he s making the most of his opportunity so we got a chance now to see a young man that s from this area played at moeller high school right up the road to ohio state sam humbert i know we talked to you earlier about him give us your assessment on him so on you so far so good with sam he s he really is a great student of the game and he s got really good instinct and that s what were seeing in practice plus he s got the size the speed all the things that you know us geek scouts look for he s got all those things and then he brings the intangibles rhythm of knowing what to do and being in the right place and so he s been very impressive so far and you know another might say high draft picks last year out of kansas state number 75 jordan comes off the block and nice block wraps a guy up he s shown a lot of uh promise too weve got that weve got a good group of defensive ends we really do and we should be able to you know maintain a consistent rotation all along the defensive line which is the successful defensive lines do you keep them fresh and you have a good rotation and with the defensive ends and even inside a defensive tackle you know we feel like were going to have a good group there to rotate and play a lot of bodies which you need to third down and two from the three and daniel hit in the backfield at five toward the goal line maybe short line a gain which is the oneyard line r <person player="carl lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> in on the stop young man we just talked about <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person> almost had him of us active gets away from posey tried to throw it out here why that was one thing mike asked me when i was down to camp who did i see right away and just say whoa and it was <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person> when i saw him i didnt expect him to be as big as he is yeah you know and it s hard to look good in uniform when youre standing next to <person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carlos</person> dunlop and <person player="michael johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael johnson</person> and he does yeah he fits the mold of what weve looked for over the years the the <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> athletic you know tall defensive ends and he fits right in the group and that s always good to see well this is short so well be fourth down i want to turn attention a bit to the secondary especially that safety position williams fedja ylim and ill oka just made that stop as well jesse bates yeah you know this is the type of game that were gonna see a lot of the young guys you know and that s that s gonna be good there s gonna be competition you know for the fourth and fifth corner spot there s going to be competition at safety which is what we tried to build in the offseason a lot of guys in there working and you know it s always fun to see the young guys in the uniform for the first time and see how they react to that and so this this would be a good game since were talking safety s i know weve talked pendulum and bates and of course you have our loken well id be remiss not to ask you about my trojan house josh shaw doing he s doing good you know josh has been a very versatile guy for us and we can plug him in in a lot of different spots which is which is very valuable for a defense and where josh has had the opportunity to works on the corner in the slot and at safety and and so the more versatility you can have the better off you are and josh brings that versatility it is cincinnati football that was my mistake sorry i pointed the wrong way its first down for chicago preseason four players and m officials right duke there you go yeah by the way id be remiss not to mention you have so much experience around the bears and what a great opportunity to kind of see that s always fun for me personally to see the bears my dad was with them for 20some years when i was growing up and you know i got to be you know firsthand around a lot of those really great teams you know everybody in the personnel worlds trying to build the 85 bears you know we got the guy that did it working for us so that s an advantage today s game it s hard to do it s hard to do but everybody s trying and it s not impossible well i know for myself when i talked about the bengals of course i played my whole career here i still live here i still every sunday im sitting up here root enough for the team and when people ask me about it not just because youre here they say so what s been the difference and i truly believe the difference has been dook tobin the fact that they have you working with everybody else and it doesnt hurt that we have your dad but i keep saying one guy we need to keep and at you duke tobin so hopefully youre here bro you know you talk about your dad being in chicago for 27 years i hope youre here 30 years well i love it here you know weve made our home here and were bengals and were cincinnati uns and this is all my kids know so this is my kids affairs of what i what i was given growing up and so i i just love working here and it s fantastic and those are kind words we like to stay in the background what we do in personnel is such a group effort you know anybody that reaches out for an individual credit and what we do is is is off base because it s such a group effort mizell running this into the end zone im first and goal well duke appreciate all the time and obviously a lot of work to do here over these next couple of weeks to try and figure everything out yeah there s a lot of work but it s fun work and you know sometimes it s hard to start saying goodbye to some of these guys you know we anybody in our uniform down there we have hopes for we have regard for we have you know development possibilities for and it s hard to say goodbye winning when you get to that point i know next week in dallas well have you again and well get some more information how things are gone looking forward to it guys or to it keep up the good work thanks just good bye for now to dupe tobin it s 14 all early stages of the second quarter cops are cracking down on drunk driving like never before if you drive drunk you will get caught and you will be arrested drive sober or get pulled over funded by the ohio traffic safety office paul brown stadium glimmering on the opening night of preseason 2018 cody park he s set to kick off a 75yard drive spanning over six minutes tie the score let s <person player="alex erickson" race="white" position="WR">erickson</person> were undrafted player out of wisconsin deep to return it took a knee the first time youll take it out now <person player="alex erickson" race="white" position="WR">erickson</person> turning right short of the 20 yard line hall in on the stop that kicked off returners and they have a little bit more the tougher time obviously the kickoff moving forward previously and now even fewer players allowed to further back to create a wall for that return man <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> barkley makes his bangles debut former starter for the chicago bears see his career numbers there mike he gets the luxury of being in with that first offensive line and we see a guy that we talked about earlier <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark walton</person> from miami at running back and off goes to <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">walton</person> across the 20 pickup of two and a half and <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">walton</person> is a guy that people really talking about not just because he plays special teams and easy versatility but he s really shown well as a runner i was at practice the other day and somebody i mentioned his name and they said a little bit of geo i said whoa quite a compliment but you know he comes from an excellent program and he s got a chance here like i said with that first offensive line to hopefully run the ball a few times saw andy s numbers there to the 25 <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark walton</person> out of miami only played four games last year due to injury and as a fourth round pick a lot of people were calling him a secondround value comes from that amazing running back tradition at miami is this surprising that his favorite player was is frank gore who outran it to miami had a nice nfl career barkley ball comes free another local kid ten year veteran <person player="kevin huber" race="white" position="P">kevin huber</person> played high school here college here you signed a threeyear contract extension so looks to be here for the foreseeable future here he goes so see what the flag is here in simmons pulling out the tricks has special teams coach personal foul luring the head to initiate contact defense our cáceres detect <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> weve heard about the rule change oh i see a direct snap to <person player="clayton fejedelem" race="white" position="DB">clayton</person> fedja lm ryan hewitt on the end there number 89 still in that corner you see right here errors lowers a helmet i know you cannot lower your helmet and lead with it you see it right there you think about the new rule that was put in rule 12 section two article eight about use of helmet as a 49yard game first down in 10 <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark</person> lee handing off <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark walton</person> stretching wide rule says a player lowers his helmet to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent player could be disqualified but it is a foul and i think a lot of people are saying it s good for player safety and what s your take on it you know i think it is good for player safety but it s gonna be tough for some of these ball carriers to to eliminate that i mean a ball carrier when he s gonna get hit that s a form of protection now you cant do that so i dont know it s gonna be a tough one to enforce but it is i think it s good for the game the safety of the game here if i belong nicholls seem a nepali as well stirred down <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> moves in motion berkeley handles the snap throws on that slant and <person player="tyler boyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boyd</person> and its skip underneath him and it s fourth down i like the timing patterns and passes are thrown but that was way too low trying to hit

threepoint lead middle of the second bengals football is here players and fans all get ready for game day in their own unique way no matter how you prepare for the game we all come together right here at paul brown stadium to seize the day flex packs are available now by calling the bengals ticket hotline five one three six two one eight three eight three by going to bengals comm seize the day like valparaiso down on the sidelines <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony</person> munos alongside mike watts with you and will the second quarter of this first preseason game cincinnati starts their own 31 yard line after the punt and trey carson that s his first carry and by john teemu well a robertson harris is well and <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony</person> we continue to talk about the offensive line we know that one performance wont make or break anybody s chance to start but theyre looking for consistency revving in a way he on the right side you have valley threatenin boy he like you just sit on the left side you have fischer in westermann in the hunt for a lot of playing time barkley overthrows <person player="tyler boyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler boyd</person> and this offensive line we spoke about offensive line coach from the outset but it s it s high tempo and high pace at practice and they expect a lot it s an aggressive change i think it it s the players but they do have on their roster i think so and we looked at the <person player="jake fisher" race="white" position="OT">jake fisher</person> there with kristian <person player="christian westerman" race="white" position="OG">westerman</person> on the left because theyre athletic and theyre strong and anytime you get those guys moving forward aggressively i think it s helpful and that s what frank pollack is brought he s more aggressive style more violent with the hands punching guys punching in and that s to me that s the way it should be youll see it right here they do a good job pass blocking and you got to keep the defenders away from you because the defenders are looking to grab counter with different things and when you keep that separation it makes it that much tougher for the defensive lineman to do and you take a look right there at frank pollak tamo there on the first down catch the tight end first down from berkeley stretch lapped carson s found a hole dives across the first down in line the paul there eventually make the stop after a 12 yard gain my god like this kid since the first day he came in trey carson does a phenomenal job and it takes patience with this type of running game you cant just see he takes it up there and he sees the whole bang then he hits it a little back side that s because youre getting a little movement by those offensive line getting them stretched out and that allows a trade carson to take it back to an opening there s carson again carson cutting upfield the 41 carson out of texarkana texas texas a&amp;m ran for over 2,000 yards after transferring in there from oregon he s been around for a little while and i think that s part of the reason why he s a little higher up on the depth chart well you know you have gio you have <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> weve seen <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mark walton</person> who was drafted this year but carson every time he gets opportunities he continues to be productive play action and the throw to big tight end tiptoeing the sideline zama again it s round pick out of auburn guy they know big and fast and strong and they want to see him put it all together theyre really doing right here <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> barkley doing a nice job a little playaction fake goes it in right over the line back into <person player="cj uzomah" race="white" position="TE">cj</person> zama nice touch there by barkley who s you know really battling <person player="jeff driskel" race="white" position="QB">jeff driskel</person> for the number two spot 19 yard gain there last year held to just 92 yards transitioning from quarterback at auburn the tight end roll it score in motion on first down and it s carson again gobbled up across the line of scrimmage see metabolic and to slow them down you see what happens in running game like this if you continue to pound it pound and you might have a play like that where you get one or two yards but the thing is keeping the confidence sticking with it then eventually you wear them down and then you start busting bigger runs so you have to take those one in two yards run along with the bigger runs berkeley throws tight window it s incomplete out of the hands of <person player="josh malone" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh malone</person> rocked on the play door grandma those young wide receivers good defensive play by the bears right there but berkeley getting back and unloading it in a hurry just a good defensive play there so it s third down and seven that was three of five on third down berkeley will look to throw hit as he gets it away and down on the ground at the 10yard line that s a first down catch <person player="alex erickson" race="white" position="WR">alex erickson</person> give marble a lot of credit he had some pressure coming from his right side as you see right here around the corner and up the middle stood in there through a nice pass to you now it should be a nice catch a nepali the hit man cooper this is on the stop a minute warning and the twominute warning cincinnati is in the red zone looking to add to their lead shortly before halftime you 17:14 lead at the twominute warning in the second quarter from paul brown stadium in cincinnati fans settled in this preseason opener and <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> barkley and this offense settling in a bit here in the red zone the tenth play of the drive coming up port drive here for barclays in this quarterback competition for the backup spot <person player="mark walton" race="nonwhite" position="RB">walton</person> right up the gut down by the ball e from chicago okay we ran the ball the first quarter weve seen it now were going to continue to mix it up sore passes run the football and did you know when that continues that way it makes that play action pass a little easier to execute but i liked it to continue into town the football get this those offense environment a chance to come off to really work the new system rushing offense the ranked 31st in the nfl last year he s done a good job of getting positive yardage missed every play barclays to throw rolls away from the pressure from for the end zone it is incomplete croft let that hit the ground down the bend the catch that was awfully close i thought it was touch down catch barclay the crop right here youve seen them really one taken out the back he pumps once put yep excellent defensive play right here yeah it was it was a nice play the preseason for houston carson barclay looks left <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> kept on the back of the end zone he is out of bounds incomplete say what i am excited to see <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john ross</person> get a lot of playing time this first half get him in there trying to get him involved in the game early on the game with <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">andy dalton</person> right here <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> barkley going to the back of the end zone just a little too <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> as we see <person player="john ross" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ross</person> trying to come down had one almost got the second step down browns first ever field goal attempt and brown puts it up and through that s a <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> time coming <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony</person> exactly lays smooth you got a heck of a leg better late than never for the 25 year old in his third training camp he made 20 and 49yard field goals in the mock game that they played he turned down a soccer scholarship louisville a phenomenal soccer program and ultimately decided to kick instead learning from videos and boy that smile that s what this is all about isnt it it really is i mean you you put the hard work can do it you you stay after it you stay persistent and diligent you keep working hard and who knows you get a job like this and what s his leg strength maybe he creates a pretty good competition here with <person player="randy bullock" race="white" position="K">bullock</person> who knows dont look now bolick is out to kick off 13 plays 63 yards four minutes 38 seconds spanning across the twominute warning it s mizell continuing to get run out here and as the return man for chicago <person player="randy bullock" race="white" position="K">bullock</person> drives it away well <person player="randy bullock" race="white" position="K">bullock</person> s got a pretty strong way to say well chance to see what a terrell austin defense looks like in the latter stages and of course it s preseason game number one we know theyre aggressive maybe itll be a little vanilla here but well see if he dials anything up well one of the things you always want to see too in a preseason tour tech atmosphere is you want to see a twominute drill so there s a minute 41 before half hopefully the the bears will you know attempt the twominute drill hurry up try to get down the field and that gives a coach austin a chance to see his defense daniel completes <person player="daniel brown" race="white" position="WR">daniel brown</person> everybody back to their feet one timeout remaining here for chicago to work with 90 seconds annual to throw again and again he goes short bond wins that s enough for a first down jesse bates wraps him up daniel lose <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> naggy in a previous stop mizell this time out of the backfield picks up nine that s by a thousand paper cuts here is the bears trudge upfield okay im second down him one and it s out of the backfield big hit right at the line of scrimmage <person player="javon wims" race="nonwhite" position="WR">javon wims</person> down by josh shaw and a timeout it s the third and final timeout for chicago take a look at josh odd number 26 coming up in a hurry you have a chance to get the first

you got a chance to talk to him and he s a young man is really trying to learn from the best well youre not walked into practice on the field monday and he looked over and he said there s the gold jacket there s to go to the hall of fame and then there was another break later on impact as he walked over said so what does it take to get to the level that you performed not a chance to kind of share briefly you know and it s to me it s place like that well he just accomplished there great coverage picking it off given the offense a chance to go back in score points so there s a young man that it s obvious that he wants to get to the highest level what s more at notre dame over the offseason he completed his management degree that takes five classes for him that s a full load it really is in addition to im sure working out and getting ready for this season to do that speaks volumes about this young man for yard gain and it s kind of the shadow of the goalpost now driscoll under center on second and six big hit and yet powering forward break marcin nepali coming through and he took the inside inside route from csun <person player="cethan carter" race="nonwhite" position="TE">carter</person> number 82 playing at left hide in make the hit seal off that inside if he goes inside you got to take him inside flush him inside let that run him back get the outside cant give him a clean shot like that coming inside if you dont have any protection to your inside tremendous by carson they keep that for being a four or five yard loss driscoll fires into the flap and the running back across the 10 short of the first down marker carson on the catch i like what ive been seeing here from the office a lot of high completion percentage passes nothing yet down the

other way punts it straight in the air catches it again and then throws it back should let <person player="kevin huber" race="white" position="P">huber</person> do the punic exactly just got to keep

very <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> take a look a bill laser theyre the offensive coordinator finally getting the full year to implement and put his offense in offseason camp pretty well from starting the week three last year he s using a lot of the terminology and a lot of the playbook from his predecessor second and 20 brian hill and that will bring us to the end of the third quarter cincinnati laughs the football third and 13 in their own territory bengals by three as we go to the fourth you inside look at the team watched bengals weekly with marvin lewis joint dan hoard dave lapham marvin lewis every sunday throughout the regular season local 12 in cincinnati fox 45 in dayton and on fox 53 in columbus as marvin lewis near number 16 twice as <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> as any other coach in sangil s history and mike brown the president of team <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony</person> said that he s placed his bat on marvin and on <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">andy dalton</person> this year two year extension after the way last season ended that s a big show of faith and now this team wants to go out and prove it i think key key phrase there at the end of the season the way they played the last two weeks really believe that s what allowed them to make the move that they have but like ive weve talked about the six new assistant coaches i think that s a good move also this is hill on third and 13 flag is down behind the play well get to that in a moment here are your fifth third bank third quarter stats and it s still a significant total yard advantage and also the first down advantage for cincinnati at that 20 yard play number you talked about necessarily the vertical stuff but but you know you mentioned the first down that has been the gap has been closed so much compared to earlier in the football game the bengals were way out ahead on first downs and the bears of the closer within for everybody will wander forward here roughing the passer will concede a fresh set of downs the bangles first down in 10 for cincinnati driscoll goes under center and handsoff and fellip with the line of scrimmage it s brian hill it s a lot more penetration than weve seen most of the night right there hill did not even have a chance to get : that bears defense was way back in the backfield i leave fitz was in on the stop trait carson checks into the game on second down at 13 driscoll looks right throws and completes that s <person player="kermit whitfield" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kermit whitfield</person> his first catch of the ball game it s a bit more manageable here that once again i like those click timing patterns sometimes doing the football before your wide receivers even get out into the break trusting that theyll be there making that rosie did right kim driscoll looking down the barrel

<person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carlos dunlap</person> and were talking a little bit terrell austin comes in your new defensive coordinator talked a little bit about how you guys are getting used to his system it s a completely new system you know a lot of the guys here been in the same system for you know five plus years you know me nine so it s just an adjustment but that s what i was looking forward to today seeing how he calls things how things flowing the game for him you know practice is one thing but getting live games was team who know game plan for you is to differently and it makes these pieces with games that much more meaningful to get that continuity right absolutely you know this game is the first game the couple series let the young guys play but those first couple series need something you know the defense the mentality is not to let them not to let them score you know not like to get let them get too many first downs and first it was getting a three and out and we got that today but got a penalty on third down personally we responded well and we got the rain out again real quick you mentioned your ninth year you come in gino adkins the same <person player="michael johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael johnson</person> ten i look at the three of you guys i watch you every pre season during the regular but well talk about that relationship and how rare it is that you guys get to have those three pillars that have been around for that <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> to get this thing done yes being able to grow up together on the field those guys have the same guys if this goes to show and display on the field without commodity how we respond how we play off each other and how we compete against each other and keep pushing each other to get to where we are now you know year ten from my year nine from me and gino and you know were all playing for another contractor we feel that weve gotten a lot of life left in us and talking to andy you know a lot of veterans whove been here but now looking at you guys and all the young guys so sam huh but we talked about <person player="billy price" race="white" position="C">billy price</person> from ohio state now the buckeye on your side of the ball so you guys are bringing in talked about some of these young guys that can make an impact i think sam s gonna be good for us he definitely is doing a lot of things good as a rookie that s what you wanna say you know you dont expect a ricky well you have expected wicked to have fully everything down but sam came in kind of like a somewhat like a secondyear guy you know he came in ahead of the curve and you know in his first game no traps getting special the reps right now everybody goes to it listen you guys have a lot of fun but i know how seriously you take all of this you guys have looked at every season and said this is it but i can watch you guys how youre youre watching every play here this is meaningful no absolutely you know for a lot of us we either than saying that were trying to make it happen <person player="carlos dunlap" race="nonwhite" position="DE">carlos</person> thank you as always for the time and have a great season and the bengals ten bears with 8:25 to go in the fourth 27:23 chicago nearing the midway point of the fourth quarter cincinnati trailing chicago 27 23 in their first week of the preseason and a lot of fresh faces to the coaching staff not one time in marvin lewis s tenure has been been more change among the assistants and it will take time everybody knows that youre right i mean youre talking 16 years since anything like this is happening and of course weve talked a lot about pollak and austin that you know the old line coach the d coordinator alex van pelt who had an excellent career in the nfl came over from the packers pick nell jones you know so yeah it s a six new coach that s a lot that s a lot to get used to for the players but you know those guys have been coaching for a while so they can adapt and bring these guys along <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">bray</person> will handoff not much doing there <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person> makes this stop and part of this is new terminology in it s one thing to choose to be a little more aggressive and its weak certain concepts but to completely change philosophies does mean that what you see preseason week one wont necessarily resemble what you see against the colts week four or week one exactly you know here s just a something i played thirteen years i had one line coach so of course your terminology kind of tweaks intent but it s basically the same thing all thirteen years where now you have a guy that s been there eight years he s got a newbie coordinator he s got to change all the terminology the quarterback i mean you know they did use it last year but now he had a chance lisa has a chance to implement all his stuff so you know terminology is gonna change so that takes you know people look at guys in the nfl say well they just go out in the field and do it no it s in the playbook and the classroom study study study and then you you can play so it takes a lot mentally as well as physically in this league 11 first downs for chicago in the second half big moment in the game gray completes on the slant and after brown made the catch on second down it s collin thompson who has a first down grab into bengals territory brendan belkin a lot of action tonight in a lot of place it s the tenth preseason meeting between these sides of course they met the regular season last year week 14 33 to 7 win for chicago which included 232 yards on the ground for 82 overall that was the most the bengals allowed the single game all year really in the first half cincinnati put a clamp on chicago it s the second half that s really and you mentioned that from last year with two bears i mean that the bangles rush defense was 30 in the league given up 2079 the pass was much better they were eight to eleven but total to the right middleoftheroad about the 339 a game so both sides of the football need improve especially for the defense stopped in the rush and the offense rushed in the football and all went 44 on first down and a run here on second and six lowering his pads and barreling ahead into <person player="chris worley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">chris worley</person> of cleveland and glenville high school hioh state university said this week theyre keeping score so i want to win choose the winner he was up there it s interesting we talked about <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person> young man won a you know state championship high school won a national championship for the hollow state id be nice to add that trifecta won a superbowl here with the bangles another mantel still incomplete walk under five minutes in the fourth quarter third and four <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">bray</person> does complete for a first down <person player="tanner gentry" race="white" position="WR">tanner gentry</person> <person player="keivarae russell" race="UNK" position="DB">russell</person> wrapping him up <person player="keivarae russell" race="UNK" position="DB">russell</person> on the coverage but <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">bray</person> doing a nice job again it s a try i mean that wasnt bad coverage by kumari <person player="keivarae russell" race="UNK" position="DB">russell</person> he was right there the throw was perfect the catch for the completion and the first down <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">tyler bray</person> with an i formation behind him in all that heat back on first and ten two yards in a cloud of dust an all running forward you mentioned it earlier just how good brain was he s 12 of 17 for now a buck 62 and that one interception really impressive performance for him it isnt really you know knowing that he s the guy i mean he s trying to solidify that backup spot yeah performances like this that helps you think about the wave chicago was described at the start of the hall of fame cris collinsworth talking about all the comparisons to the los angeles rams right youve got this i draft pick quarterback and youve got this new head coach with an offensive mastermind to him and <person player="matt lengel" race="UNK" position="TE">matt</person> maggie and maybe chicago is one of those teams and i think a lot of people think cincinnati could be that team sort of surprises people this year well you know in comparison with the rams i think you need a <person player="aaron lynch" race="UNK" position="DE">aaron</person> donnell on the defensive line yeah you look at cincinnati they have <person player="geno atkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">geno atkins</person> yes so theyre you know you have that comparison they have gurley out in la we got <person player="joe mixon" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joe mixon</person> i think he can be that type of running back so if theyre saying the bear im gonna say that the bengals have a chance to be that type of team like the rams because they have similar players impact players on their team mizell on second down stood up after in of about half a yard junior <person player="michael joseph" race="nonwhite" position="DB">joseph</person> that s in on the stop and uconn racked up 16 hamels against the university of cincinnati there are 7,000 15 30 seconds and a timeout here and get back to the impact we didnt even talk about number 18 yeah <person player="jake fisher" race="white" position="OT">jake</person> <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">green</person> i mean the guy is phenomenal i mean he is seven years seven pro bowls you know i cant remember how far back that teams have been done if it ever has been done for seven years yet you you make the popol seven times and the guys still going strong i mean you you look at him youre on the practice field you watch them you dont realize how big he is until youre down on the field and you see his physical stature his height is thickness and then his speed his ability to catch the football now that s brilliant that is wonderful work their graphics people that spend all day getting ready for that that is theyre right on top of it tm up brother as itll be third down and eight on the edge of field goal range for the bears rea crawl hopping throws it up and incomplete for penny fowler so to be fourth down it goes step further you think about <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj green</person> and the fourth overall pick eight years ago and all that he s achieved and now he s moving his way up some leaderboards heywhat 31 100yard receiving games tied for first i mean that s gonna be busted 57 touchdowns six shy of second nine shy of i mean that might be done not even halfway through the season so you know for me play with guys like isaac curtis and eddie brown cris collinsworth either way come monday to watch them i have the luxury of watching this guy in person on sunday afternoon and it is the joy to watch <person player="aj green" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aj green</person> this is <person player="pat odonnell" race="white" position="P">odonnell</person> who s come on it s a punt and it s fair caught at the nine by carson ill think back the last year cincinnati fans that game against tampa bay driscoll leading a run up field and a comefrombehind victory maybe there s a little something here in the final four minutes of a game that the bengals <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony</person> have led for the majority got plenty of time 347 the great thing about as we talked earlier not only this dress will have a nice song but he can extend plays with his legs he gets pressured you can take it up feel backing in a lob for williams shoelace tackle at the 40yard line char beyond williams who last year went up against indianapolis and we for the preseason big catch and iran here and that s out for a gain of 29 driscoll to throw austin ten and it s completely filled spinning around and nearly found a hole those two combined for a 59yard touchdown and the maquis <person player="john franklin" race="UNK" position="WR">john franklin</person> the third makes the stop there we go plenty of time 27 yard completion in the beat plays continue for the bengal offense driscoll to throw again escapes the pressure flat down fires it up take the catch another flag flies it s hard to imagine that this day might be on settings i think were going to replay the town again how about ogden <person player="auden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> we havent heard a lot from him we saw him right at the end of the first half and that s a great example of what he can do you know that we talked about the fade or throwing the jump ball but the ball was thrown too far outside did give him a chance against a 510 defensive back and right there makes an excellent call it s that thing that s probably gonna be called back well have to replay the down up well wait and see here illegal hands hands in the face offense number 76 pass interference defense both penalties offset first time we do know it was <person player="kent perkins" race="UNK" position="OG">perkins</person> here s the cash might say iii wasnt exciting to pay that s for sure 43 he takes it becomes back he s wide open when he comes back to this great concentration look at that great concentration look at <person player="kent perkins" race="UNK" position="OG">perkins</person> i think well take a look at the hands of the face right there you see the outside hand just slides up and pushes on the face mass that all it takes to get that callout up high on elijah norris rookie out of shepherd in division two line up again here driscoll eight of 12 for 95 yards trying to have another preseason comefrombehind win driscoll fires turning it was date and it looks like he pushed off <person player="john franklin" race="UNK" position="WR">john franklin</person> the third of last chance you famed pass interference offense number 19 10yard penalty still first down big guy sixfive 228 got to take a look at this it might not take a whole lot for them to call it catch the back end of that nice catch so ill tell you what a diving catch and hardest to see that there seminal from florida state and a lot of positive talk slots out wide to the left below receiver and three to the right on one amounts to first down in twenty driscoll laura s pressuring this ball flown thought <person player="jordan franks" race="white" position="TE">jordan franks</person> of about 11 and a half two minute warnings is 15 seconds away driscoll looks right in trouble there s a way 33 yards and the florida state team at cincinnati back in front right before the twominute warning <person player="niles scott" race="UNK" position="DT">scott</person> a report bid and physical that ten receiving touchdowns last year to leave the acc wow drafted in the seventh round sixfive 228 there he is driscoll extending the plague getting out of the pocket making a nice throw he s drawn comparisons to brandon marshall look like it right there didnt he what there s a heck of a catch driscoll and tape brilliant on the drive point after <person player="randy bullock" race="white" position="K">randy bullock</person> and the bengals lead by three they rested the advantage back from chicago <person player="auden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> spoke back in otas just about florida state they just want a softball championship he was proudly watching as a a proud seminole and of course one of phenomenal catchy makes their let s take a look at our airing it out pass of the game presented by ultimate air shuttle what a talks here what a catch again driscoll taking it out you really didnt feel a lot of pressure you just couldnt see anything in the middle food extends it moving to his left makes a heck of a throw nice pets bucket ivan <person player="auden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> mike you mentioned florida state seminoles seventh round pick and that s airing it out presented by ultimate air shuttle vip travel for the cost of commercial lotta air travel with <person player="jeff driskel" race="white" position="QB">jeff driskel</person> at quarterback he is impressed again and you think about how individual drives can change the competition and surely it s played the game and different players are in the driskill earning a lot of praise i think on this night wouldnt let pressure up on berkeley a bit i agree i mean youre right it doesnt matter when in the game i mean youre out there and you making plays youre extending plays youre making throws you have to take that into consideration when youre evaluating players in he s shown a lot tonight former florida high school gatorade player of the year of hagerty high school was drafted by the red sox but that was never part of the plan well now the impetus on chicago if i get one play in before the twominute warning gray hands off this is null pushing out to the 32 yard line josh shaw says stop driscoll leads a comefrombehind drive into the final two minutes bears with the ball trail by three in his preseason but good signs from cincinnati were at the twominute warning driscoll <person player="andy dalton" race="white" position="QB">dalton</person> barclay the three thatll see action on the night for the bengals all three have certainly had their moments <person player="anthony miller" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anthony</person> they really have of course andy started that offense first offense look really good bartley a parklet came in this is good things but then he cut this excitement of this you know glass drive led by driscoll hit and <person player="auden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> on the touchdown pass so youre right theyve all done some good things tonight chicago has been phenomenal offensively in the second half and they need to come up with their best drive yet if theyre to knock off cincinnati here <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">bray</person> to throw hit as he did throw and does complete <person player="daniel brown" race="white" position="WR">daniel brown</person> has had a giant role in the second half phillipe <person player="malik jefferson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jefferson</person> on the stop tell you what <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">bray</person> is showing a lot of toughness it back there he s had a lot of time most of time but when he s got pressure he just being right in there and toes the ball extremely well braille drop on first down and aim it on the front shoulder throw there s a flag <person player="benny cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benny</person> fowler couldnt hang on dafonte harris defense number 35 paulus places the spot of the foul automatic first down it was i dont know youre the guy <person player="michael johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">johnson</person> yes i do i agree with them not a foul he s going for the football well it is a first down on the pass interference on first in tampere that s batted up in the air and <person player="benny cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benny</person> fowler targeted again sort of the issue for <person player="benny cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benny</person> fowler he s got a bit of a problem with drops previously then verniers passed on a michigan state minute 28 to go empty set for prey on second down ops to throw pressure throws in the middle i just did not see that in that could have been trouble if tyrese bama rats got his head up he kicked it running behind the football didnt see it good wide receiver panic locker news you see the football club right there hits him in the foot the stonybrook program in the cia of fcs theyve done an incredible job turning that three years 13 to 21 brave for a buck 74 toughest 37 out in front of them on 3rd and 10 brave steps forward he does complete the marcus ayers leveled short of the first down marker iris bevor at later over at stony brook coming in hard little over time red making a nice tackle that were looking at if what 52 yarder here fancier for code eparchy parky modi parkies first miss for the bears and it looks like it seals it for cincinnati and their preseason opener nice tackle by bev red on that last pass kept him just short dated a 52yard er take a look at right here he s got the accuracy well not even the accuracy is wide right marky s <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> fifty pours right on the edge of his range and chicago does have three timeouts to work with first down seal the deal here driscoll and all the mill guys pick up for quentin <person player="quinton flowers" race="nonwhite" position="RB">flowers</person> their first buy <person player="quinton flowers" race="nonwhite" position="RB">flowers</person> good to see him get some time the undrafted player out of usf was an amazing quarterback in college 40 seconds to go here driscoll is tonight s the gold star of the game nice screen cash like there s an excellent play call <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> run on that screen jarv on williams then the completion to <person player="kermit whitfield" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kermit whitfield</person> well then he comes out of the pocket here god hate the nice though the touchdown your gold star of the game deservedly so is he is led cincinnati back in the fourth quarter now ray lowery their second 30 second and about two yards separate cincinnati from pre season opening win against chicago heartless at both offense and defense defense made especially with the new coordinators on each side of the football i think that is a big plus that the progress and is come along once there s still a lot more work to be done as well theyll tell you but to start out this first preseason game and to do what they did they have to be happy the deep man is quentin <person player="quinton flowers" race="nonwhite" position="RB">flowers</person> set i to the left im out the timeout cincinnati from cincinnati there this is their third and final charged 30 seconds in length timeout the executive producer of tonight s broadcast brian sells the coordinating producer is david asked rock tonight s games been produced by

race="UNK" position="DT">scott</person> simpson engineering support provided by rick henin feld thanks to our entire crew here in cincinnati i think we enjoyed it hopefully you did too a lot of action for first preseason game rolling driscoll oh nearly intercepted there s a flag down with 29 seconds to go in the fourth quarter and we may have spoken too soon there may still be action illegal formation offense nobody on the end of the right side of the line that penalty is declined fourth down well what s worse is you dont force chicago to use that third and final timeout an effort to try and get driscoll on the run and <person player="kevin huber" race="white" position="P">huber</person> will come out angles did run a fake already in this game that took it 49 yards throwing it out there hubert had been a false start there <person player="kevin huber" race="white" position="P">huber</person> gets knocked down he was pushed and it s fair caught inside the 10 yard line by aires

game clock thank you now that is polite officially it is i think we could hear them without the microphone you can hear everything that s being said im on the field it s pretty good we got a great seat here were certainly in the catbird seat i think most everybody watching is well get out of bounds or risk watching the clock run out is the scenario here for the bears on first and 10 from their 19 this is caught racing to the sidelines <person player="daniel brown" race="white" position="WR">daniel brown</person> right at the first down marker 12 seconds remain five seconds off the clock
