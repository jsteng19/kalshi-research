position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> comingofage over the past couple of years and of course last year a tremendous season you had a great threat of course in <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> running but <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt</person> did his job throwing the football as well last few you know and he s really developed i think the part of him that has developed the most is is his quickly i mean the you could rush him you know everyone thinks it he s not mobile he s not gonna run in the potty theyre gonna give him but he always gets rid of the ball before you can get to him we receive a set here in the tamarah still work that left side and hell get across the 40 to the 41 it s a little different left side for seattle this year remember in the past they had jones and they had seen much action but hutchinson left he went to minnesota so the new left guard is <person player="chris spencer" race="nonwhite" position="C">chris spencer</person> who the animal wall from center okay he s not bad im chris a fat bar and i think he s gonna be a great center for a long period of time but he s not a bad left large right now third youll excuse me ill just and they give it the storm in worn kind of but he goes nowhere so one first down and then they are stopped <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> is there to make the tackle and chicago will get the ball okay now ill plop themselves on that one i think you know they give them four wide receivers with max prong in there the you know fullback the blocking guy make make the bears think okay were gonna pass get in a pass rush and break <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> on the run but that didnt work i mean the bears the bears have great speed on defense and theyre all good tacklers long doesnt carry that much but he did come into the game averaging seven yards per carry it s usually the element of surprise when that score rapid in the seventh round means that one inside the five and it bounds into the end zone and so our first look at <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> when the chicago offense coming up on the other side of this break when they strike from the 20 that s soldier field

town architectures phenomenal and a lot of construction going on is a team 30 cranes in the stadium tonight was <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> s first carry of the night and that s nothing here s the bears offense <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> florida gators <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> the university of virginia <person player="jason mckie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jason</person> mckee total will send <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> michigan state university <person player="bernard berrian" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bernard berrian</person> dont wanna know that fresno state dez mccoy wake forest university john tate brigham young university reuben brown pitt <person player="olin kreutz" race="white" position="C">olin kreutz</person> university of washington texas a&amp;m kingsville freddy <person player="fred miller" race="nonwhite" position="OT">miller</person> and baylor university and on the ground again this is <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> so he s carried on the first two plays <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> last year over 1,300 yards and that was particularly impressive because they had no passing thread that he hopes to have as good a night as his brother had a day his brother julius is the dallas running back and he ran for 122 yards and the cowboys win over tennessee earlier today you know in his backup is <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> who who didnt play at all last week but will play some here in the first quarter tonight to the outside that s off the fingertips of rasheed davis who caught the winning touchdown pass from <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> at minnesota last week the coverage on the play by <person player="kelly herndon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelly herndon</person> so chicago thrown out looks very serious you know and that s the the bears really arent a good third and long team im they dont want to have those kinds of passing situations so when you run on first and second down they have to have more success than they did on those first two plays <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">brad maynard</person> in his tenth year in the league down for <person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person> we ex 49er flag is down it s a very short kick and it takes a seattle bounce and it s down near the 46 yard line but there is a flag down of the line of scrimmage and it s a hold against chicago kerry mccauley is tonight s referee during the kick holding receiving team number 55 10 yard penalty first down timeout yes seattle will take it after a 30 yard boot coach over that shot of chicago the monsters of the midway as theyve been known through the years the bears have allowed fewer than 10 points in each of their last seven regular season home games how odd is that it s the longest streak in the league since the mid 30s when the packers had a 12 game streak and theyve allowed only two touchdowns in those seven games and no passing touchdowns from the 38 yard line hassler back on first down throwing and finds the open man and that s the newest seahawk that s beyond <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> who came over in the trade with new england he held on with the patriots they picked them up he played last week and tonight he makes that catch from <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> that was pretty good because i was that was four wide receivers again and the bears are a nickel here s beyond <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> he s the outside guy there and you see they both come up on the short guy and <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> runs the deep pattern that horner <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice morris</person> gain of two the 29yard line the bears defense last year it was so phenomenal remember <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> got hurt so they went to <person player="kyle orton" race="white" position="QB">kyle orton</person> a rookie fourth round draft choice out of purdue and always said was dont lose the game for us just in the handoff some conservative passing and the bears last year they didnt score a lot but the defense was phenomenal theyll end up as the second seed well they have real springs up the middle in the year tommy harris and then <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> and <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> bellingham then <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike brown</person> second in a and going to the right side after pumps taking to the left he hits <person player="darryl tapp" race="nonwhite" position="DE">darryl</person> <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> and so <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> right on the mark again and that will set up a first down and goal for home goods team you know that s a quick release i was talking about that s a cover to where the corner comes up the safety comes over and there s a window in there that s a short window and you have to get look he pumps to the left and then he comes back and makes that quick release and that throw in there between the rotated corner and the safety see here s a rotated corner <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> 33 there s the safety coming over late and <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> give them perfectly 22 yard catch 18th of the season he leads the team in receptions does <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> and that pass is incomplete intended for <person player="nate burleson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate burleson</person> <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> covering on the play seattle very proficient when they get into the red zone there it is last year they were best in the lead 43 touchdowns 64 raised this year their second best in the league through three <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> ill tell you something about that though a big part of their red zone offense was running and <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> he had a real feel for scoring once he got close to the goal line so the touchdown record last year second and goal bro <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> and he gets upended at the 5yard line <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike brown</person> the safety comes up number 30 to make the tackle so itll be third down and goal and <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> can look and only <person player="willie ponder" race="UNK" position="WR">ponder</person> right now and this this is what he likes to do he does like <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> home to her about last night he says you know he said once he gets inside the 20 he just feels that end zone and <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> loves to score a touchdown when we all third goal they said <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> and motion and <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> throws and that caches incomplete <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> was back there covering the pass intended for the tide and etool emilien so the bear defense stiffens and seattle will have to settle for a field goal attempt yeah melee was <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> s third third read there that wasnt where he wanted to go you see he s trying to go outside to the left then he had to come back to the middle and by that time <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> was able to almost run me later right out the field 23 yard attempt <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">josh brown</person> has had three field goal attempts blocked this season but not this time about the distance of an extra point a little beyond and so seattle is on the board first <person player="nate burleson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate</person> 58 to go in the opening period seahawks three bears nothing in chicago on sunday night football know where the steelers will be taking on the chargers and what a game they played last season on a monday in october football night in america will get a start at 7 oclock eastern time next sunday night baltimore beach san diego baltimore remains unbeaten tomlinson with 98 yards rushing today alc with alien and company next week san diego pittsburgh on sunday night there s always tough rushing against the raiders they can they want to take away their ear run theyre pretty good at it as they did today rasheed davis you hold tomlinson 98 on 27 carries that s about as good as it gets taken away the run from san diego here s the seattle defense the <person player="bryce fisher" race="nonwhite" position="DT">bryce fisher</person> us air force academy chuck garbage south carolina state rocket the lord took say <person player="grant wistrom" race="white" position="DE">grant wistrom</person> nebraska we were hill at clemson loaf the tubu usc julia peterson michigan state <person player="kelly herndon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelly herndon</person> the betweens bernal hi <person player="ken hamlin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ken</person> hammond arkansas razorbacks <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boulware</person> florida state <person player="marcus trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus trufant</person> washington state they get on from last year <person player="jason mckie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jason</person> and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> s pass is caught by busan mohammad to a chorus of moose and that will be a first down theyll spot the ball at the 45 yard line they were in a slot there and musa mohammed was the inside guy and i think if you ask <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> who s your favorite receiver who do you want to throw it to and would that it would be that guy right there musa mohammed he said you know anytime that he gets mantoman coverage said he s open because of this big body in the way that he knows how to usually the shield with the penile missile before the snap picture the seattle seahawks are bringing their their safeties up and then playing that eightman front so that s why they were able in that first drive just about to run so the bears came out and and threw on first down i think they have to do more and more of that as they see that eightman front that mean there s only three defenders and you have to throw them out of that <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> with six touchdown passes three interceptions for the first three games in here straight drop under pressure and daddies go yeah never i wanted to back up liman <person player="russell davis" race="UNK" position="DT">russell davis</person> who have been playing for years in arizona that he comes over he s one of the guys they rotate in and davis drew a beam on him and got him for a big sack you know seattle does a lot of that those line stunts your gonna see davis is right here where the where the two tackles just crossed you see one goes to the left the other goes to the right and he comes right up to the middle the seahawks believe that that s what they have to do to <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> is put pressure on them or right up the middle right and get in his face that is a 13yard sack now on second and 18 <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> clothes over them get a lot of that back as the tax was made by <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> who was questionable coming into the night s game with a foot injury he s a little shy of the first and itll be third and short that s what lovie smith likes about rest <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> now and it s always a test for him after you have adversity but when you face adversity how do you do after that and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> seems to be passing all those tests and they come up with two tight ends out of the eye on third down and one and they fake it and then ghost he s gonna lock it and he is i believe gonna pick up the first anime confirmed progress but no this station mckee who made the catch and theyre gonna say he was forced back by <person player="julian peterson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">julian peterson</person> and theyre gonna spot a shy of the first down yeah it looked like mckee went back a little youre going to see here he catches the ball right now he has the first down but then he goes back at a couple yards or gets knocked back a couple yards he was helped back yeah he s over the line there the ball is over the line and then when they blow the whistle the ball is back on this side of the line that s i think i think fourth down i think you go for it in this situation i think the bears the bears have to go for it and i say that because seattle is a highpowered offense and hill has an opportunity to score a lot of points the other thing chicago could have done it is reviewable in terms of a first man so lonnie smith could have chosen to have it reviewed or challenged but he didnt and here is <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> who were that second surge appears to have picked up the first down of mckee s the first guy theyre saying he s got it he s got it then he does and love his spitz s clapping clapping those are tough decisions for head coaches you know that dielman do you go for it he can field goal do you go for it the upon the arrest <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> made a pretty good move there because he didnt have it initially but right now he doesnt have it then he kind of rolls and twists and turns and pushes in backwards and picks it up first down at the 34 yard sit down to the outside caught here by the fullback mckee so much talk about the chicago defense but seattle last year that great offense got to the super bowl but you forget about that that defense in in particular that great middle linebacker low put the tuple whose father a moshe played for years mainly with the new england patriots pull back and special teamer but he took over and from day one he was their starting linebacker last year what s always impressed me about loafing is away that that you know go talk about a running back that runs downhill and he just saw him do it on that flight initial surge right there and then <person player="chartric darby" race="UNK" position="DE">darby</person> comes in to clean up on jones loafers ooh blue isnt going to play on his side of the line of scrimmage he s going to play on your side look at that i mean he has about four yards of penetration in the bare backfield on that one started his college career at maine and then went all the way a country transferring to usc and played on pete carroll s national championship came third down and six well have six defensive backs and put the pressure on <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> opposed that completes it for a first down that s <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> so for a guy who a couple of days ago looked like he might be an active <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">clark</person> a very big part of this drive his second catch on this drive and that s good for 14 on a first yeah it s funny if a quarterback you know steps back or doesnt step up or throws off his back foot or those types of things you say oh you shouldnt have done that in particular but if it s complete you say hey what boise held in the hell in there backed up backed up waited until he found his open guy in the nfl today with the pass rush as they have you have to be able to throw off all jones averse to the middle and finally tackled by poole were at the 11 yard line so the chicago bears going for it on 4th down at midfield and with this surge it s a first down at the 11 yard line theyre one of the best things that silas jones does is cut that watch if he starts here to the right and then cuts back all it all it takes is a little cutback lane there and he s going to find it now now you have to get the backside block to now watch john tate he takes his guy and when this guy takes an inside rule he just drive from right beyond the hole develop them gets across 210 before he is forced back gain of a yard maybe to peterson and davison on the tackle as we took down the three minutes to go in the opening quarter youre right he enveloped them i i saw john tate on the field before the game and he walked by me and i thought that that s one of the biggest guys ive ever seen six six three 12 and he looks bigger than yeah yeah big truly a giant of a man they doesnt have any hair so you put a ball head on top of that and that s that s a sight to behold by me on the field second vanity those from chased by peter sheen nealy into the first row he had <person player="bernard berrian" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bernard berrian</person> right away im surprised he didnt throw it i was on his left side but no one said you know at one time he didnt have anything he was just gonna get out of that pocket so then he could throw it away and they have three wide receivers one tight end the seahawks down here you know people to get four years never played nickel or five defensive backs he didnt see a lot of three and four wide receivers seeing more and more amman as they get close to the goal line legacy was set to the left <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> looks that way as time throws back of the end zone you seen mohammad so the chicago bears on their second possession of the night goes 69 yards 12 plays to take the lead busan <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> was the outside guy he s running that post off a corner move he starts up fakes like he s going to the corner comes back to the pose and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> throws it right to the end line the manometer numberone receiver his first touchdown reception of the year gold extra point is doing the 227 to play in the first quarter in chicago the bears have delayed seven three over the seahawks how do you saw the movie friday night lights ville is a new series on nbc called friday night lights patterned after the movie and it comes your way on tuesday nights the debut a friday night lights is tuesday night on nbc 8 eastern pacific 7 central and mountain will depict off with a painful one back his second pick father the exclient comes back after the 28th and then two flags come in at the end of the play the face mask or personal foul pressing the face mask kicking team number 71 15yard penalty first down timeout this bill adonijah the penalty so seattle have it near midfield when we come back seven three bears when they refurbished this stadium they wanted to honor its great history so there are the columns that have been here for 80 years and they built the new stadium inside those pylons kinda like putting a spaceship and away into the parthenon but the people here like it and they love the bears right now and they love that fair defense and the ball comes loose but it was down the play is over as tommy harris number 91 came in for the sack of hassle by a net see the strength that we were talking about in the middle and it all starts with the defensive line and then in the middle it all starts with tommy harris and and and he has he has great speed and quickness i would just watch what he s going to do right here and he just starts up gets his left hand on <person player="chris spencer" race="nonwhite" position="C">spencer</person> throws him to the right and then he s right on the quarterback after he gets by his guy he is on the quarterback in one step but i look at the replay they want second

race="nonwhite" position="DB">herndon</person> in bull were covering on the play and they got that play exactly where they wanted i watch them practices the other day and they try and go play action to hold that safety on that side and then get berrien on the post in behind it i think you know we know what mohammed is i mean he s kind of that ball control guy the intermediate passing those types of things with berrien is a deep guy second down and 10 and that thing swinging the green again even for last week that s enough fun id like to see him run the ball i think youre gonna get a chance here pretty quickly yeah i mean im gonna practice number 99 second down donkey bernard he was the fourth overall pick in the draft two years ago played his college football at texas but <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> kept the job last year and jones hill is number one with bench in number two right now there had to be some miscalculations i mean when you have the fourth picked in the draft and you take a running back he should be in a second year he should be started a second in class that s blocking the lowfat the tubulins the first guy to to force the issue and then everybody else cleans up on what is very likely the final play of the opening quarter and it s tough running in there i mean the troupe was part of it but the other part of it is they get that safety up there so in essence they have four defensive linemen when that safety comes up that gives them the fourth linebacker and it s hard to find a gap in that defense scientist which ends at the end of the first quarter with the score the chicago bears seventh the seattle seahawks three and nbc s sunday night football resumes after these messages and theyd line here through the first 15 minutes touchdown past <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> through <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> 7 2 3 chicago start the second quarter i like his john man adria kramer in chicago its third down and seven as <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> to his 30yard line goes back and finds the man mohammed for another first down <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhsin</person> mohammed and when you go to him on third down he almost always picks up the first down he is a long street going yeah and that s a that s a tough pattern to cover too because it s a crossing pattern so you have all the way across the field to get open you see mohammed here he s gonna start it up then he s going all the way across so so <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> can lead him not only up a little but across the field just before straight times on third downs <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> throws and that pass is incomplete and what does it mean when a guy picks up a first down a lot on third down well the first thing i think about john is there s a guy who knows exactly how far you have to go to pick up the first down that s the first thing he knows yeah and the second thing is he s the guy that you trust the most and he s your goto guy remember last week we were talking about you know the value of a quarterback and <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> shanahan that said that that it s how you do one put it down so i think that s true of a quarterback there s probably also field noninclusive 54 straight coming down for a person eccentric been she can raise from two <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">boulware</person> makes the tackle the ball we spotted at the 18yard line worldly third down and eight with the chicago bears you know they didnt start <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> as a tight end i mean he s been going in and out and it looks like what theyre doing when they want to pass they put <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> in 88 and and if they dont want to pass a fast to that position then they have <person player="john gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="TE">john gilmore</person> in there so so you know <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">clark</person> is coming off an injury and playing but not playing evidence and this would be a passing situation maybe the hammer majority caught too and that pass is incomplete indeed he goes to disney park that the past was lowing outside he was covered by <person player="leroy hill" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leroy hill</person> the linebacker and then well come robby goal to attempt a field goal you just kind of get the feeling so far that theyve been just probably get <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> in there when they wanted to throw him the ball robbie ten for ten field goals this year eight for eight on extra points this will be a 36yard field goal on a fairly windless night about as perfect as it ever gets at soldier field hold and he s good as gold once again 11 for 11 is robbie a minute 27 into the second quarter look at the sears tower chicago 10 seattle 3 brought to you by <person player="rocky bernard" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rocky</person> mountain refreshing for his life the official beer sponsor of the nfl by general motors a new level of quality a new level of confidence by ge imagination at work and by mcdonald s mr perfect day in chicago cloud in the sky this afternoon except that you got up into the 70s high 60s tonight very comfortable and the bears have made to strive even more comfortable leading by seven early second quarter to pick off get back up to the 25yard line let s check in with ngo crandall well as you guys know one of the big offseason stories was the trade of <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> to the seattle seahawks had a long talk with <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> about the contract situation did you achieve your purpose in terms of being fairly compensated yes in terms of no longer being a patriot no now as for the patriots who felt disappointed that they let him get a trade they are attempting to collect money in addition party so that continues we law beyond couldnt be more thrilled with his pact in seattle and a gain of two here the last weekend oh we were talking about tom brady and we were talking about brady s body language and kind of tying hit into it to the loss of the un <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> body language became big around the country this week john so everybody either became like a sikh and freud for a sigmund fraud yeah i dont know about that but i do know that that it was an emotional thing when tom brady lost deon branson is emotional friend and he even said in that buffalo game that that it did affect his play now you know at some point you have to get over to the pro football you just keep going the blady apparently and the gooing got over it today because they knocked off cincinnati itll be third down and eight you know it s funny how remember with the the patriots a few years ago it looked like they had a bunch of interchange will receivers and then <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> really kind of emerged and now he s here you wonder if hell emerges the number one guy in seattle well i dont know if hell be the number one guy maybe hell emerge i mean he may know daryl <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> for a while but i think rants will quickly emerged as the number two guy third down and eight now for wives for the seahawks and that pass is incomplete as he tried to get it to be on <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> on a slant and three and a half of the seahawk so a good early drive for <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> which resulted in the field goal the national congos defense stiffens again and the bears will get the ball back you know sometimes you just have to see it for yourself dont you i mean you hear you know the bears of bear defense great defense and just standing here observing everyone that s said it is right i mean this this is really great crisp defense like an hour baris rookie at the 39yard line and then drop <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> by the bears initially ricki manning jr is there and that s the one thing about <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> talking to some of the the bear coaches hey he is electrifying he can break one but he he s a gambler and he s got to learn to pick his spots he got away with one there ten free chicago it s just a feeling that you get in your chest when you hear the rumble of a crowd and you can feel it just making your chest vibrate there s nothing like it <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhsin muhammad</person> who has scored the only touchdown of the night several years at carolina holds a lot of then came over here as a free agent 11th year in the league <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> is the running back the star here and <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benson</person> is taking down hooboy hill is the first to make contact and he stops lost one yeah we were talking to how the the seattle defense was always bringing that safety up and playing an eightman front on first down they didnt that time they had a real to deep and that was you know a pretty good time to run and that was a good time to call it against that defense but <person player="leroy hill" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leroy hill</person> made a very good flight where <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benson</person> made a very bad cut just engaged in receiving <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> and then goes that one away and it will be third down and 11 varian the closest to it you know what someone told me this week about <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> he says he has a little brett favre in them and and so far the first half ive seen that a few times that that one there where you bootleg out you cant find anything you come running to the sideline just throw it out of bound that s want to breath that one where where you keep going back while you wait for someone to get open and then you throw it off your back foot that s brett while im not saying that you know he is brett favre but he does have a little of that animal confidence never a question the question has become durability now in his fourth year in the league saleman intended for barian the only question about <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> he was picked in the first round and he started at the end of his rookie year then he got hurt early on when he became the starter in his second year tore up his knee then he broke his ankle in preseason last year but you know despite it nobody really saw enough of them to know but everybody just felt you know what if he can stay healthy he s going to be good yeah and he is and you know he s an aggressive player and ron turn of the offensive pointed said he has a lot of confidence before of equality and he hates to check it down mean instead fielded by <person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person> who s out of bounds at the 32 yard line that s where seattle will happen 11:36 remaining in the opening half in three bears next week to san diego we know the damien thomlinson company hosting the super bowl champion pittsburgh steelers that s on sunday night football from san diego a week from tonight football night in america get me started 7:00 eastern 4:00 pacific from the 31 yard line <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> walk play action rolling open man is next patriot beyond <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> that s tx / patr hey ot not an expatriate first down he could really separate this is a bootleg youre going to see the backs fake to the left then <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> is going to roll out here or bootleg to his right and <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> was coming across the field and that s where you could use sweet you could use it going up the field but you can also use it going across the field that beyond <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> did their 19 yard gain for him then toss back the <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> taking the place of the injured <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> with a moment a 17yard game behind <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">locklear</person> and seattle s indicating the fall is going to be against rival in his offside defense number 96 philly s decline first down <person player="alex brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">alex brown</person> so that will count and a little bit of what a guy like <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> can do and you look at a guy like <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> and you wonder he s playing behind <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> so he s not going to start but how many teams you think he could start for in the nfl well they say that you know he could probably start for eight or ten teams in the nfl but i will say this it s different played in the first quarter than it is mopping up in the third and fourth right in the 35 to the ingram who started the and he makes the acquaintance of one <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> on that play before that memores did run those shawn <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">locklear</person> as you said got out in front and he was very impressive when you get a guy over 300 pounds one like that and youre a little back like whoa <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> you want to get in behind it oh <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> knows all about staying around big guys he s one of 15 kids he is a 6 to 15 you have 50 but youre always fighting for something second inside is an interception by jr and <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> the shoulder him out of bounds so manning has been in the news here of plea bargain after a patient washing in to listen he has been a guy who has come in he has not done anything in regard to him in terms of the legal issues but the certainly made his mark in this one tonight especially here i think hed really play the catandmouse game when <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> on that one because what he did out he looked like he was covering the slot then the slot goes inside he let him go and then he ran to the outside receiver and under credit manning who came over from carolina as a restricted free agent first intended <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> now pay off he look deep then goes underneath and the catch was made by <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> and he was trying to get musa mohammed deep on the left side and that s when you usually go for a shot after a turnover good field position first down boom hit him right now now <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> was still wondering where <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> jr came from because he expected him to stay inside on that slide second and to the ball is at the 28 yard line nine and a half ago <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> let s check in with andrea tuesday in los angeles and did plead no contest to a felony charge of the salt for his role in an attack back in april he was placed on three years probation ordered to undergo anger management counseling and perform 100 hours of community service he told me he took the plea because he didnt want to risk going through trial possibly missing part of the season and putting the case in the jury s hands he didnt want to lose time money or freedom and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> s pass is going to be we incomplete after the officials all looked at each other <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boulware</person> smacked john gillman more as the pass got there and <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">boulware</person> then pays the price but he never had possession and the officials took a moment and then said incomplete i was going to say the officials ruled and nothing initially nothing pretty close in complete bull were down just now bull where it gets up and goes off the field but he dislodged the football from <person player="john gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gilmore</person> now listen to this one but he really he dislodged a lot of things from <person player="john gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gilmore</person> let s get up and check all his body parts as those goal where bolivar celestine comes in the request jones carrying to the outside taking it to the 23 yard line tackle there by <person player="julian peterson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">julian peterson</person> setting up a third down and seven there is the recipient of that bull were shocked he s still trying to get his stuff together look he s talking to himself and others and <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">boulware</person> theyre checking him out you know you check in the eyes and ask him questions just to see if he knows where he is fourth big safety 6023 <person player="john gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gilmore</person> 65 257 third and seven those controls caught inside the 10 and stuff shila goannas variant <person player="marcus trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus trufant</person> with tobacco for the moment saving the touchdown and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> with a big smile 22 yards that s that old thing where you overload once let see they have three guys over here get all the defense on this right and then put berrien back there and use his speed on the back side away from the overload you see three guys over here here s barry and back here and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> throws it in there perfectly where that safety is no help at all roshan is beginning to look year much less advise on the dozen sites or less and completely we go back to that that body language things on and you can tell why here he s a guy who hasnt played that much but he just has that it component yeah and and and that it is is a big dose of confidence and like i was saying earlier you know he always wants to throw tea i would like that as a coach i hate the officer that the guys always looking for the dump always looking for these if the short guy never went too deep <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> doesnt the jones and he that s this room right there making the initial stop wisdom has been making initial stops for a long time with this tm seattleman before that with the rams and and then the thing he has to do down here is you have to stay low and youre gonna see <person player="grant wistrom" race="white" position="DE">wistrom</person> he just gets underneath his guy and just takes him right in the back field he used to make those stops for lovie smith and wisdom was at st louis and lovely was the defensive court negative he got underneath <person player="john st clair" race="UNK" position="OT">john st clair</person> on that last one st clair competitive kite em that third and goal off the fake grossed and rolling throwing and that s incomplete and that is that s a very big defensive stop for seattle because again it s early in the game and if you get down 17 to 3 no big deal but against that chicago defense and then to have a first and goal at the 1 against you and to limit them to a field goal opportunity small victory for seattle s deeds and the end the bears were trying to be aggressive remember on first down they tried to take a shot and then and then the seattle seahawks kind they held them off call them off then they got down there and then a big stand down here ill be gold again that s the way it s pronounced i spoke to you on the last name fieldgoal attempt is good his perfect season continues seattle drew first blood the night for chicago now with 13 unanswered points 623 to the half 13 3 bears good way to promo this the neck nextel cup racing nascar action from talladega next sunday here nbc right that michigan avenue you let your wife shop on michigan avenue your credit card comes back without lamination i think because one of the great experiences huh maybe it s worth losing lamination over because i think i think michigan avenues these the greatest avenue in the country you know what im gonna second that motion on of <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> in great cities the michigan animal is something very special really <person player="willie ponder" race="UNK" position="WR">ponder</person> five yard line there s one of these things we havent seen the chicago bears a lot but during this first half i believe that there s a real deal i mean the way they they do they i mean the speed of the defense they the tackling the coverage they always have the right guys in the right place the pressure they put on the quarterback they they they have it all i mean to run the pass the defense that disguises that is the whole package and theyre real packers and those two touchdowns in the last eight games both through the air first and ten a flag is down kerry mccauley will give us the call the <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> that time i just need fulsome when you run an endaround like that it s gonna be a longer play and the bears got penetration and darn near got the handoff <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren is playcalling is getting a little frustrated you know down 13 unable to get anything going lately were going for lies with you both types of things to find something that s it back enforcement 20 and even max law wasnt expecting that when <person player="alex brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">alex brown</person> put the pressure on from his defensive end spot and that was one of the matchups we said we were gonna watch <person player="alex brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">alex brown</person> 96 here against <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> and you see <person player="alex brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">alex brown</person> just uses the speed then i mean he just gets around puts his shoulder down and of course what that did is that made <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> step up into the pocket second down and 20 poor wide and they give her the score on the pull back on the draw take them on the second in 20 give you five yards set up a third down in 15 the old west coast offense and you know probably <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren is close to anyone is using the old west coast offense and it s all about rhythm you know its rhythm and timing and if that offense gets in rhythm and gets its timing going they can just cut you up conversely when they dont get in a rhythm they kind of look like the seahawks habit now they go with five receivers empty backfield <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> almost paid the price on the run crows has its it has a pickoff by manning jr he does it again two picks for him he s inside the 30 from the moment we get in but i doubt that will hold up you have three flags on the field but the interception will hold up it s all about the penalties on the run back public address guy just said there are flags everywhere on the field and audrey s voice but the tone of his voice he was saying and there against the bears so that s not going to be a touchdown there found illegal block in the back intercepting scene number 99 that penalties decline illegal block in the back intercept insane number 93 10yard penalty first down it was still a heck of an interception youre gonna watch <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> here you see <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> makes a move to get out there now running and throwing back into a crowd is dangerous he seemed <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> there he tipped it with his right hand and just kept it to himself well i said he tips it up in the air and then he goes and catches it with the same hand and he s a pretty good run to the 37 yard line here s an endaround and this is <person player="bernard berrian" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bernard berrian</person> and darien is out of bounds at about the 32 yard line i was surprised that theyd ran an endaround youd think with this you know after a change of possession after a turnover that s usually when you take a shot at the end zone and maybe that was ron turner s idea of a shot you know try and get them pursuing because you know seattle does have a fast defense and then come back around and catching a big play second down and five jones that s good six of the chains along the 26yard line tackle there by two cool yeah and i think that s what jones is playing there you know the you know the key words you said good hard running that that hell keep it inside he s either gonna keep it on that play side and run the hole where it s supposed to go or he s gonna cut it back he just follows his lead and he just runs right off the lead on that play or hell cut it back he s gonna keep it inside he s not gonna be jumping around or jumping to the outside i said <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benson</person> he s back up on the right started his career with the arizona partners <person player="grant wistrom" race="white" position="DE">grant wistrom</person> makes a stop at the 22yard line here in the seattle seahawks sir you know one of those undersized defense that you can wear down and run out and and that s the boat that the bears are getting into now you know okay let s let let s keep their defense on the field a little let s let s let s make them your hang in there just pound out second and seven there s great protection man over the middle that s qualified babe weed and hell take it to the three weve picked up from the titans number these on the depth chart he would be your third tight end but after you pound it you pound it ill tell you it makes throwing it and protecting a lot easier look at the protection that rope to the <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> as here ivan he has the time to look and find his guy and hit him because they made the perfect pocket for him it s reed s first act of the season as we play all that much where s the gold and this time zones is able to get it in so they were thwarted when they had a first and goal from the one on the last series but not this time as <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> s intersection by manning and there is manning keeping the legs loose on the bench jones says give it up for me gang let me hear it nineteen three going on twenty what is <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> saying woo hey wait a second let s go back to the drawing board here for let me say this he just gave him ten points through an interception they got three and then it came back for another interception they got seven first rushing touchdown this season goals for the extra point well seattle had a three nothing lead but that was then and this is now twenty two three the thing that promised joe says you as i was saying earlier he will always keep it inside that time he started left and just cut back what he s gonna start to the left here and that s where the play is but then he sees that that movement in the middle and he just cuts right back and slices in there s so much of that down on the goal line as a feel and it s not necessarily you know the big <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> guy there s bulls or flowers in but it s a guy that feel feels flow and can go against flow <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> this gave ten points and <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> who just got ten points 2:25 remaining in the opening half the bears stay here next week buffalo comes in then they go to arizona then san francisco and miami come in that is all things considered a fairly cushy next month seattle s off next week bears have played the way they played this first half the whole season theyre all going to be cushy <person player="willie ponder" race="UNK" position="WR">ponder</person> up to the 18 yard line so <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> going back to last year his rank since the beginning of last season third and completion percentage strength and touchdowns third in passer rating so he s up among the elites it s the beginning of the 2005 season but tonight that bear dee has done some job especially after that first series and there are his very ordinary numbers that s a good shot when youre stuff running back in the goal line that just so the grass right into your shoulder pass stuff running or a bad seamstress there s national banks were gonna collapse that small 27 yard line i think it s important for this bear defense to to not let down now to not let the seattle seahawks get any rhythm but we were talking earlier that it s a rhythm offense and and the defense has done you know a great job against her schemes but has also done a great job of keeping them out of any rhythm and on the flip side it s pretty important drive for seattle to trying to get back in the game youre down by 17 to the sakai go bears at the hand that is a lot in all capital letters twominute warning what controls the universe everyone everywhere no click those documents that had taken me months i get started wow a big headache to do on dvd and bluray discs october check why the heroes premiere has created a new sensation ordinary people discovering extraordinary abilities im hearing people s false heroes tomorrow 9:00 8:00 central on nbc <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren now on is a view of the seahawks longer stephanie and green bay lovie smith and his third the pulse of the give the nine <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> good start but since then they taken care of him those two picks <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> would meanwhile has been effective 161 yards and a touchdown the ferdi as usual tough tough tough the two manning knicks leading to 10 points unless the score is 20 to 3 one of the things <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren said last night is he they want to be more physical and so far in this first half theyve lost the battle of physical second down and two at the twominute warning each scene has all of its time $27 and that s incomplete as you cool the movie the tight end was final one with it before he caught it you know johnny go back to the history of soldier field here now the bears played a lot at wrigley field of course in the early years they quit a few games here in the 20s and 30s this has been home since 71 except for the urine champagne in all the games theyve ever played at soldier field they have never had a 17 point lead and not one the game just more good news from <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren huh well you know you cant you cant remember an offense like this over there is i mean 1985 and that fair key that that s you know it s always been the thing is you know good defense will hit you a good running game and there yeah butters was your quarterback and then they go well let me see what little sid luckman they eventually get all the way back to sid luckman yep still get back to luck when he still all over the record book and they said luck scoring and picked up the first down ingram gets it out to the 43 in s seattle will take his first timeout me you go back through the years and you know we laugh about sid luckman who played in the 40s but he still holds a lot of the records including passing touchdowns passing yardage for a career singleseason erik kramer had 29 back in 95 is that one good year you go back to the billy wade who had only nine career 300 yard games but that tops all bear quarterbacks 1962 sure and i guess it s you know you think about what the bears you think about running backs and you think about middle linebackers and cold weather and all of that you dont think about the glamour boys right and that s what lovie smith is trying to keep here he said the chicago bears are about a great running back and theyre great middle linebacker that s a tradition but he got a lot more than that right method the names peyton shares and breakfast on the nine swagger s <person player="darryl tapp" race="nonwhite" position="DE">darryl</person> <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> makes the catch here and then another flag comes in at the end of the play so two separate calls here you know in the point that you just made that that the the bear defense doesnt want to let this seattle offense get some rhythm here at the end of the half and you can get a score because that could be a carry over that number 93 that pili s decline personal foul unnecessary roughness number 30 first down that s <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike brown</person> and that that falls into that category their beer on call is foolish penalties dumb penalties he s now you given seattle an opportunity to really get back into the game before the half and here comes <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike brown</person> i dont know that s pretty close yeah if he s out of bounds would be a late hit i mean he s still stand it up so ba if he were inbounds were out of foot inbounds and you know it s okay and that s it that s a tough family to me that wasnt a dirty play i mean that was the play that you almost had a mate beyond rain starts in the back heel in motion the water to 24 yard line <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> under pressure and the pass is incomplete and the bears are trying to contend that it should be grounding tommy harris got there but mcauley said no you know that s the thing about having speed at your defensive tackle position when when the quarterback starts to scramble and you have a guy like tommy harris he s as fast as a quarterback and he s going to go and catch it when he goes like a linebacker watch him he comes up here and then <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> starts to scramble right there and here comes harris and the harris is going to get him right there <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> wouldnt run away from him so he had to do what he did was locating the defensive lineman on second down were <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> all over yeah that was good coverage downfield <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> was trying to go downfield couldnt find anything and had to come back to that short pass on the sidelines at the 25yard line well that secondary is doing some work and always been spam and he s going to get the most out of that one he knew exactly where he was and was able to pick up three or four extra yards at the end before he s forced out that is the first down it stops the clock with 45 seconds and seattle still has two timeouts <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> makes a big play there but you want to know how you know that a guy doesnt have speed when he gets out in the open he looks back when first running beard is looking behind them you know they just cut speed but other than <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael</person> vick i dont know i dont know who does but you know as you said the coverage down here al has been great i mean theyve just blanketed everything that will seahawks if you went out there and hassle backers had to run when the times actually got that free that s about authority one is incomplete intended for brands covered well by <person player="nathan vasher" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nathan</person> becker s that s funny that he has that much confidence in <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> you know you usually when you get in this situation you have a goto guy and the goto guys usually been with you more than three <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> maybe yeah we said it was an interesting thing tom brady email them with a scouting report about <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> quarterback sharing information second and go let it go to guy there s <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> could be <person player="bobby engram" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bobby</person> angle missouri shorthanded he s in the slot ashley back if he was going for angling and its manning jr who is all over the place tonight you know i think this is where not having <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">shaun alexander</person> hurts the seattle seahawks and not making excuses but this is where when they get down in this area with <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> allison the ball and you would just fit you know him and he would get up and he would just hell make something happen and usually get it to the end zone now they get inside the 20 and instead of running the ball they become a passive team all the time tremendous defense another guy that missing is jeremy speed near the tightend third and goal pressure on <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> he has to throw away as <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> was in the neighborhood and tommy harris was there for a mere sack but that precludes seattle from getting into the end zone and theyll have to settle for a field goal attempt id say tommy harris is something special you usually have big bulky guys inside but when you get a guy like this with that kind of speed as i said once he gets by chris greg two steps he s right on <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> this guy is something special believe me 25 yard attempt coming here for <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">josh brown</person> the field goal of the night officially from 24 yards out and we have 27 ticks remaining in the half chicago 20 seattle 6 with second in new york with bob costas bob halftime highlights of all 12 games played earlier today in the nfl and there was a controversial moment in the dallas tennessee game borderline assault and peter king well have more on that when he joins us on the set on the toyota halftime show back to chicago all right thank you baba look at soldier field again been around for 80 years used to see the hundred thousand and then the bears who wanted they wanted a new stadium here goes harris he s gonna he s done for the half yeah he s throwing kisses and victory signs for the crowd he s a supplement that would if you were a guard you would hate the face tommy harris because you know one thing you can handle size you can throw guys tries to pull you but a guy with that much speed playing inside at times can be impossible lovie smith compared him to warren sapp and he would know of his love he was down in tampa as in the system of the tony dungy with monte kiffin and he also he compared we asked them about <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> the other linebacker because you think about pearl locker you dont think about <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> then he put <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> kind of in the <person player="derrick strait" race="UNK" position="DB">derrick</person> brooks category and then he put <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike brown</person> in the john lynch category which again there was that sprite straight up the middle shoot davis after slipping it s taken down

tom brady and the patriots today laurence moroney was the key guy he was a man of the godwin city they really have no answer for him 98 yards in the second half alone 125 for the game and two touchdowns baltimore san diego steve mcnair had to pull it out late 20th game gamewinning drive right here put together outstanding throwing catch by time heat and then determination to get the football in the end zone baltimore 16 san diego 13 vince young gets his first start but he was roughed up by the cowboys at tennessee terrell owens on the receiving end of this 46 yarder he caught five none first touchdown but had a good day terry granta had two touchdown passes from bledsoe and dallas winds at 45 to 14 this one was intercepted and returns for a touchdown by brady james for the cowboys just to rub it in on the titans and dallas wins it s 45 14 as i said there was controversy coming out of that game and when we come back peter king will join us here on the set to talk about it as the toyota halftime show continues folks the golden peacock for this week well go to santana moss of the redskins caught three touchdown passes today including the gamewinner in overtime even peyton manning could not contend with santana moss today now on a more serious note in the game between the titans and the cowboys in tennessee albert haynesworth of the titans stomps literally stomps on aundre garage of the cowboys here opened up a 30 stitch gash on his forehead not too far from his eye and afterwards his peter king from sports illustrated joins us jeff fischer hanes words coach was outraged and made it clear to bill parcells the cowboys go bob immediately after this game jeff fischer made a beeline for bill parcells on the field after the game and this is exactly what he said to bill parcells he leaned over he said bill i was outraged at what i saw on the field today if the league does not take action that we deem satisfactory if they dont do enough to albert haynesworth we will take the law into our own hands and punish him in our own way what do you think the league is likely to do i think the league is likely bob to give him a severe fine maybe $25,000 but not to suspend him on that for another i gotta tell you what youre saying is ridiculous because what happened out there today it s not a personal foul it s not a penalty it s not a final offense this is a crime this is one where the police should come in and say what in the world are you doing put the handcuffs on the guy no place in the game it s an intentional act to stop on a guy with spikes and that is what that is why jeff fischer in my mind will take the law into his own hands and society excel is the league likely to rule by wednesday or thursday the latest time from new york

been here so this is a big deal i love everything about the game i love a big hit i love when one of my teammates makes a big play or something about playing on primetime sunday night and it can be played in the backyard nobody watching but youre im still gonna be home for i dont care man and when the lights come on it s time to flip and the chicago bears as we start the third quarter on top by a score of 20 to 6 al michaels john madden andrew kramer soldier field chicago let s check in with andrew well how much do you think that this swats missus man the reigning mvp <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">shaun alexander</person> out with a broken foot down 20 to 6 what is <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren san ramon thoroughly well you know all fitzy we just got to make some plays you know the bears defense is really too good for us not to make every play count and that s what we got to do somebody s got to go out there and make something happen mass guys stay calm and most out of pop a couple runs and were good in the red zone usually your church or a held two field goals from the five and the six yard line what s been the problem you know and you know you hate to go back to no cliche about executing but you know we got some time to guys and were not getting it done so you know i think that uh and i hope that this is going to be a better hat for us and we know we scored one touchdown this one changed everything <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren told us he expects that you will be back october with your injury what do you think you know and im gonna be just wise you know i mean i told the coaches id love to play in this game and these big games are what i like but were gonna do whatever is i feel like im healthy so whatever happens happens all right andrea and if he s back on that 22nd day of october hed miss only one more game you sir off next week then theyre at st louis and in minnesota in seattle who s got the third quarter rasheed and davis next move at the 22 get outside up at the 35yard line by <person player="kelly jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelly jennings</person> in the morn draft choice out of miami the numbers now through the first 30 minutes of play seattle is 57 yards on the ground but theyve been throwing the ball a lot more than passing it of course living behind those two turnovers have been costly when we do a touchdown wondering who a field goal both interceptions by manning on they begin here the <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> carrying for two up to the 37 yard line yeah that s one of the things that they dont like about <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> running when he starts at when he starts at you know hopin before he gets to the hole they just wanted you know just hit that thing and do it what you did it in the first half either you know take it to play side and either keep it there and run through it or taking place id and cut back but dont start that s skipping and popping before you get to the line of string young jesus berry 13 times for 44 yards in the other throws passes incomplete itll be third down we saw <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boulware</person> evolving a big hit in the first half andrew what s the latest on him well he almost literally knocked himself out because he has a concussion he was questionable before but after being in the locker room at halftime they have declared him out for the game so the actual have to hope their defense maintains its poise without their starting safety big loss <person player="oliver celestin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">oliver celestin</person>e number 40 is in there <person player="jordan babineaux" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jordan babineaux</person> another safety dstean active theyve completed in the secondary and he s caught it is pulled in over the 45 yard line by <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> and that s enough for a first down seattle is at some point is going to figure that out that <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> is coming off an injury hasnt practiced and theyre just using him for the passing game and usually when he goes in there theyre trying are going to throw to him as they have done three times tonight the 39 yards that s a pretty good plan you know only put the kind of receiver in there when you need facing the people that flag down at the 43yard line that midfield you know we were talking about how the the seattle seahawks arent in any kind of rhythm offensively but on the other side dont you feel that the the chicago bears offensively are really in a rhythm absolutely and and that s without having you know a rushing game that s you know lighting up any scoreboard in terms of statistics i mean theyve rushed the ball 18 times for 50 yards it s meal average that s less than three yards per carry but <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> just you know we we talked about it john gives it to jones and the many to say well theyve done nothing rushing jones says how about this that s pretty good that s hitting it in there and keeping the play side yep <person player="leroy hill" race="nonwhite" position="LB">leroy hill</person> is able to get him by the ankles at the end of the play getting right in there behind reuben brown and john tate on that left side and he bangs it in there and that s where you have to do him he s going to take it in there he gets the linebackers shifted away gets a good lead and then cuts it back a little to the middle then makes another cut then a third cut and then he sees that he s wide open out there that looks pretty good yeah well he left celestine who s the very placing role where in the woods as new single hamid makes the catch and takes the ball to the 8 yard line that s close to a first act roof on and <person player="ken hamlin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hamlin</person> in on the tackle <person player="marcus trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">trufant</person> was too far off him and if um you down here and you play like <person player="marcus trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">trufant</person> plays here then <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> is going to do that all night to musa <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> you see how far obvious i mean he just gives them that that s like here if you want that <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhsin</person> go ahead and take it and take nine yards you either have to take that inside away or get up impression you cant get chuckling one now guardo enough with the whole before he s knocked down by two too cool to pick up a first down itll be first down and goal from the seattle five if they have everyone leading for <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> it s not only the fullback at that time the tight end is <person player="gabe reid" race="UNK" position="TE">gabe</person> reed came in and he led through that hole theyre getting a lot of leads to have the fullback lead to have the the guard pulling up through and then that one they had these tight emily bursting go if my so once again and the umpire throws it 993 six full days done at the time number 57 10yard penalty first down something like that <person player="olin kreutz" race="white" position="C">olin kreutz</person> the pro ball center he s saying i didnt hold it that guy did something to him now they always you always blame the other guy here s <person player="olin kreutz" race="white" position="C">olin kreutz</person> he s the easel center there watch his right arm right there oh yeah yeah his right and then he put his left around that was a takedown and he said he didnt do it learned that as a child it s always somebody else s fault that s all cruz what s the tricks that he has here we can stay on a meal hell move that left hand who offense the move throws and it s through that he of <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> that would have been his fourth tax of the light right every time they put him in there girl wrote to him and he was still open yeah <person player="kevin bentley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kevin bentley</person> a linebacker was mantoman on him so so when when when <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> sees that he knows who he s going to go to i mean he sees he sees his tight end up there and the closest guy is a linebacker and he throws a perfect pass to him there s no car to sound wetback heck did you do to me hand man starts their hands enchanted the 50 too much for the flag is down in the back of the endzone the pants a little high and the seahawks are going to contend it was not catchable it will be an officials conference here that s going to be the question right now it s interference but was it catchable to fight against <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> groupons has had a bad go of it down here here he has pretty good coverage and he just pumps him a little before the ball gets here you see you cant have hit him or touch him before the ball gets yet and that s what yeah you had the momentary conference there because the officials had to agree that it was a taxable ball it was close it will be first down and goal at the 1 when we come back the bears have just taken a timeout nbc sunday night football brought to you by refreshingly smooth bud light always worth it by toyota issues any direction as long as it s forward toyota moving forward by comcast watch more highdef movies from comcast live and buy levi s the original fondue silent diva is storecom host in snack would either come are you a thin crust or a deepdish guy deep dish but hold the vegetables i dont want that green stuff mostly your chicago pizza rather absolutely york pizza got a thousand percent i think basically im a new york pizza really yeah pinnacles first and gold this is heavier they got all their big guys in there they give it to jones and he s not going to get in because davis came in there to stop <person player="russell davis" race="UNK" position="DT">russell davis</person> <person player="jason mckie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jason</person> mckee the fullback went to the locker room they were looking at him and they put <person player="gabe reid" race="UNK" position="TE">gabe</person> reed in there the tight end as the fullback in that formation usually after something like that happens you think of some kind of play action or bootleg i mean a the seattle seahawk be festive really selling out in that means you know if a cover one and anything else will user just walk and this time there is enough room for the touchdown the chicago bears 65 yards in plays five runs five passes with the opening kickoff of the second half <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> had a good feel on that one down here theyre gonna pull reuben brown and theyre gonna lead thee the tight end to the fullback there reuben brown just whiffed but just his going through there and just the air of 74 reuben brown just him whipping made made enough space there for <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> to get in he goes for the extra point and the chicago bears with a dominant defense have a three touchdown lead with 1005 remaining in the third again after tonight just one unbeaten team in the nfc probably that one well that s the tradition of the bears that low v smith is trying to do it with with a running back a linebacker and a few other parts as well these days and i think that s that s part of the bears tool is the whole beard offensively old great bear defense they <person player="willie ponder" race="UNK" position="WR">ponder</person> up to the 31yard line and then it s the whole running game and the impressive thing tonight has been <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> and when you can play get quarterback play like the bears have gotten that makes running a whole lot easier and then when you get ahead twenty seven and six everything becomes easier so the bears now the three touchdown lead trying to go to four know on his first night of october every other team in the do it at least one and this is <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> or a game of three to the 35 let s go to andrea well i asked <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren about <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt</person> how selects two interceptions and he put its solely on the quarterback shoulders he said it was a judgment thing he was trying to do too much he said they were aggressive mistakes he said hustle back like the rest of the team has to do a much better job of maintaining their poise <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> good start good opening drive backed by a field goal since then has been the bayer d as of course the throw it short intended for <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> with the chicago defender at his feet but you know it s not all <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> i mean he hasnt had a lot of protection he hasnt had a lot of guys getting open and his defense hasnt helped him out i mean you know when they had to make a stand when they got the score there at the end of the half and then you kind of get fired up okay let s go get him out and the bears just take the ball and ran for third down and seven i so that goes forth <person player="grant wistrom" race="white" position="DE">grant</person> just to get the first thing done and it s gonna be very close as you can see probably be right on the yellow line as he puts it down <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> makes the tackle see <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren theyre signaling first down but so the ball isnt yam and if he didnt get a first down he was here to have to go for it there yep theyd season with a steel ottoman hard to believe he s now spent more time as the seahawks coach and he did as the packer coach seven years in green they have been long enough to get a street name that man and that both places still won so let s close it these are the bench right i mean that s coverage there and you know and the bears have been doing that all night and if they dont get the rush and and and rockastle back then they cover and he has dont know when to throw to here s where he wanted to go and you can just him just just take that slant away and then so he he comes back to the other side and there s nothing there im sure <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren said dont force anything through his backup <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite"

replay still is third and ten the quake in that inside pressure look they have both the linebackers and then they both back out when they give us a match <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">strong</person> on the but the bears are right there <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> wasnt fooled and now theyre forced to punt with each 15 to go in the third they tried to pop <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">mack strong</person> there and you would think you know that when youre down 27 to 6 and you have pretty good field position you you still have to believe in what you are and then when you have a quarterback youre a passing team and i dont know trying to pop <person player="mack strong" race="UNK" position="RB">mack strong</person> on 3rd down down 27 to 6 i think you have to be a little more aggressive passengers back there working from the 17 back up to the 26 yard line josh scobee makes the tackle <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> and company theyll go back to work halfway through the third quarter 27 to 6 chicago this next week we have five of

were in in their they add the sheet davis in the in the slot as a blocker and that s one thing if youre gonna if youre gonna play football today i mean most of these systems and youre a wide receiver i mean obviously you have to catch the ball you have to do all those things but in addition that you have to be a blocker now more than you ever had to be three great protection going deep off the fingertips of <person player="bernard berrian" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bernard berrian</person> now that was another brett favre thing wasnt yeah everywhere he looked that he looked at he s trying to go short and most guys will come back and theyll you know stop looking theyll throw the ball away he s trying to go short then he goes back a little and instead of throwing the ball away he throws it deep deep in for the swing and he just goes back and back and back and says im gonna im just gonna win this thing he almost gets a big completion <person player="marcus trufant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus trufant</person> covering on the play he was giving great perfection but third down and three all itami needs and then the past is too high secondary does its job aryan again the intended receiver and in comes the punting unit he s getting a little too much confidence now he s bouncing and bouncing and bouncing backwards and just flinging that thing on that one this is a little bit of like a debutante ball for <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> i mean these these plates are sparingly because he s been hurt and he did play in the playoff game last year against carolina but this is one of the rare national exposure games and that s <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> i think there s still that question it was he the real deal when he do it over a long period of time the indicators tonight are that he is a real deal pun bounces sideways out of bounds at the 31 yard line and the hawks get back in it down by three touchdowns you know about football your chance to hit people think you know it s the only thing you can do we can hurt somebody else and i can teleport their defense as usual doing a lot of hitting only one touchdown allowed and forty drives by the opponents that s the 41st beginning from the 31 yard line attach the back starts by going to the you are mealy 14 to the 45 <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky</person> manatees junior came over from carolina we talked about his legal travails earlier in detail tonight he has been the main man for that chicago defense of those two picks leading to a total of 10 points nestled back close and with patience and protection that time it s <person player="darryl tapp"

position="WR">jackson</person> here he makes like he s going to go up you you push up and then you come back work back to your quarterback 5 and a half to go in the third mr erlanger <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> blitzing locking down <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice morris</person> in the backfield yeah and that s what <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> does i mean he s not going to take on a lot of blocks he s gonna he s gonna try and hit a gap and that s exactly what he does he hits that center guard gap and then as he hits it he keeps his head up eyes open and look what he finds he hits that gap of boom right there three yard loss on the play that s the way he plays i mean he s not sitting back there and waiting for it to come to him he s gonna go get it second and 13 <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> going deep has an open manner that s <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> who cant control it on the sidelines <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> was free he beaten the defender he got behind <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> and couldnt hold on yeah you have to believe that that was a cover two because it looks like <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> lets him go like he s going to bump him and then let him go into safeties supposed to come over there i dont know i mean that was either terrible terrible coverage by <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> or the safety that didnt get over there but <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> had a reputation a couple years ago i got him and he did he dropped a lot of balls then he got a lot better last year he dropped none of the 38 from and that i cant handle this one third down and 13 to the 40 look at <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anderson</person> a rookie who plays behind <person player="alex brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">alex brown</person> fifth round draft choice from alabama boy and that s a tough thing when youre trying to bootleg when youre trying to bootleg into the side where a guy is is pass rushing you know you like them to be playing run <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anderson</person> is just taken up taking off up the field <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> doesnt have a chance on that i mean you cant bootleg to a pass rushing in and have a check were sack of <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anderson</person> s career came on opening day brett farr two and a half of the season the punt is must and then picked up <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> and he is taken down to the 26 yard line to a promising start for seattle on that drive little scrum here and chicago gets it back four and a half remaining in the third 27 six bears 61,000 is the capacity at the grove and refurbished soldier field in chicago theyre in a good time because their team is up 27 to 6 in a game that figured to be a heck of a lot closer in <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> as the running back the ball is at the point 7 yard line of chicago begins describe and <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benson</person> up to the 30 julianne peterson makes the tackle <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> has been very efficient tonight three games of the season he was over 250 yards which may not mean a lot for some franchises but for this one the first guy since kramer in 94 to do it and the record is held by those three guys look at how far back you have to go luckman in 47 blanda in 54 and billy wade in 62 quite george blanda never wanted be called a kicker that he was and here is a look at <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benson</person> the first real good look of the night as he takes the ball out to the 49 yard line 20 yard game for the second year back out of texas yeah i was kind of looking forward to seeing <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> because in practice the other day he looked like this and he looked like he had that extra gear you know where he could burst and run through some stuff and though he does it right here again it s a cutback and the left tackle with number 76 john tate again makes a good block on that back side at the 48 yard line on first down not this time all of a salesman comes up and there s a penalty flag in the secondary two of them go for four for that well stop itll do it for three five four if anyway you want to anyway you want to cut it let s check in with andrea well we just saw <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> finally doing something and really all teammates care about is production but you do have to wonder how he does stand with his teammates never memory as your rookie he held out during training camp and that really left a bad taste in some of the players mouth and dont forget this past preseason he was out with an injured shoulder but he left the sidelines during the preseason game and ended up going home he was i we got to look in a lot of trouble with that but mainly he was upset that some of his teammates tattletale to the coaches the bottom line is he needs to show his teammates that he is committed and that they can trust him as <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> making that catch and then this week he was the subject of some some articles here because some people felt that he didnt look happy enough after the bears had come from behind to beat minnesota he s getting play in the game yeah and they thought he was pouting but lobby smith did come out and say that that wasnt true there was an erroneous information out and if <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> didnt do anything and he s part of this team and going to be a big part of year seven and one i havent heard anybody call anybody a cat ler in a while tattletale love me you wouldnt adil feeling me with the town i dont think i ever tattle failed in my life you know what i think youre right ive known you long enough now i dont think youve ever given anybody up no i dont think sighs i mean ive probably done you know a lot of other things what was that tattletale tale yeah well then the other thing oh yeah right no not so much greg adelie can help us in the truck obviously we need it sid luckman to still be around this is <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">benson</person> something so and so is a tattletale there s nothing like that i mean you did you did things like that but you know i think you know in <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> i mean youll forget the tattletaling is that all he has to do is play well and you know at some time they break i remember a year ago in san diego we had that with shawne merriman you know he held out no one liked that he came in played like at that night and then you know he s defensive working here and that s the type of thing you would think should happen to sentiment second at 11 and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> s going to go deep and that too very end to the touchdown but there s a flag down at the 16 yard line that that was a perfect throw i mean that that was a thing of beauty perfect <person player="kelly herndon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelly herndon</person> with the illegal contact and <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> puts it right on the money then they get thirty three to six id say you <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> and these wide receivers have worn out the corners of the seattle seahawks here s <person player="kelly herndon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelly herndon</person> and barians a speed guy once he gets that step he s gone you know that that ol say in the win he s even he s leaving variant is even who even were in three catches for a hundred is their big play guy not that mohammed isnt the therian comes into the game averaging 17 yards per grab and that will go up in chicago s lead is 28 we watch this pass this this is a thing of beauty and he just lays it right in there were not burying doesnt break stride union those words over the years you havent heard a lot of a playing of beauty in the passing game with the chicago bears but they do have it tonight yeah it s always been a contradiction the what a combination when you have a moosa <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> who can do all the things that he not variant who can go get that deep one and then if you need to throw to the titan you have <person player="desmond clark" race="nonwhite" position="TE">desmond clark</person> look at that this season three touchdown receptions of 40 or more yards they had no such touchdown passes last year now theyre i say winning is a great deodorant but just look at see the faces and you know me guys just cant help but jump up and down you know you just you just have that in you when things are going like this and smiling and all those things i mean that s why winning is so big and so much fun and losing you know something is coming at the 7yard line really up to the 35 yard line with 44 seconds remaining in the third quarter last year more than 25 million tuned in to watch heroes youll see it tomorrow night a new episode tomorrow west with 25 million within if you check it out tomorrow night heroes on nbc 9:00 eastern and pacific 8:00 central and mountain time you look at one side the side that s winning then you look at the other side that s losing and you can just see the the the highs and the depths of emotional from the 35yard line and that forward pass that s really didnt complete <person player="tank johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tank johnson</person> that his arms alone <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> but he was able to get it away with a forward throwing motion i would say that theyre getting after these seattle corners theyre getting after <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> in this offensive line of the seahawks theyre just theyre just teeing off when you get a lead like this that s what you can do and there s you thought about a guy that has a tough job it s <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren now trying to come up with plays that can get his team into some kind of rhythm at the end of the third quarter second to 10 35 yard line <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> back through runs about usually usually when your running back is in front of the pulling lineman the play is not going to be worth a darn youll see <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> is going to pull out there and moe <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> instead of following him is leading them you see when the running back is in front of the blocker the running back doesnt have a chance and here comes number 93 a good lay and he is still down he went down at the end of the play and the bear staff has to go away across the field to attend to him on the seattle sideline okay i know it s only the you know fourth game of the season and the bears you know if they win this will be poor and old but they have to be the best team in the nfc dont they well theyre the only undefeated team and people would say well you know theyd be great detroit never there were two beats em and last week had a come from behind to beat minnesota well after tonight i mean how do you deny that i mean seattle comes in at four you know defending champs everybody back except <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> but a bunch for that that made that much of a difference tonight i mean the dominant i mean chicago has been dominant in all areas i mean defense and rushing and defense and coverage you know the offensive line in running the offensive line and pass to catch <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> making the the rhyming they have every part special teams everything you need there s a left so far tonight pull down at 12 past the back rows and exhibit convert the first night here spiking person makes the catch and the ball in chicago territory at the 47 yard line the seconds tick down in the third quarter and that is the way the third period will end it s been all chicago seattle had a breeze three nothing leads that the bears have been redhot lead 34 6 after three sunday night football back after these messages from your local nbc city soldier field chicago al michaels john batman s near kramer as we start the fourth quarter <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> under pressure under duress <person player="tank johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tank johnson</person> didnt even have a chance to turn around though the pass rushers were almost as quick as <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> s drop that s when you love to be a pass rusher because you could just take off and and you see ground i mean he gets around he gets around <person player="walter jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">walter jones</person> and by the time he gets around and he s riding that hassle better an 11yard sack the ball of the 41 i got a freak settle down marsh there isnt going to do that all they want at this point of the shortly in nibbles here <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> with the coverage and those defensive linemen are just getting in sprinters stance now and just sprinting to the quarterback i mean the the short pass or the one isnt going to hurt this defense now go down there to pitch tonight welcome to bush hat living to ten points nestled by those a little bit about the england im bear they stopped at the chicago s 49 yard line long trip all for the seahawks tonight the four and a half hours in the air and back home but at least they are off next week and they will try to regroup enough they cant rip the st louis two <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> from today it probably wont have <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> back then but they hope that back the following week against minnesota in seattle absolutely flag is down because the ball goes into the endzone the seahawks just didnt have any answers i mean theyve just been whipped and like i said <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> almond who wanted to be more physical tonight than the bears were really more physic or city team number 24 ten yard penalty from the 20yard line first down timeout back in a moment discuss some of the things that have gone on around the league today chris collinsworth will be joining us from new york on the other side of the break sunday night football from chicago is being brought to you by metal light for great taste there s no debate little light always a good call by linkedin retire by capital one what s in your wallets and by sprint give that a fan with nfl mobile only from strength power up chicago the loop downtown lake michigan in the background gorgeous night and a great night for the crowd here because it s good over there they start by giving it to <person player="jason mckie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jason</person> the key of course chris collinsworth has been back in the studio all day is watch to all the games see see what s on your mind i tell you this one s on my life im really surprised that what s happened here tonight didnt surprise me totally of chicago ends up winning this game or at least looks like theyre gonna win the game but the manner in which theyve done <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> cant make that much of a difference with me between these two football things yeah i dont think so i mean i think if it s something that the bears are just too physical for but are the bears now that super team weve been looking for out of the nfc because if you start to fish around if seattle is not this good is it dallas maybe i dont know they play pretty well today washington seems to be coming back maybe atlanta but if youre looking around the nfc at least right it s the chicago bears im <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> now and it s a different bears team now it s a bears team that s not based on defense in a running game it s a bears team based on defense and a quarterback that wants to throw it deep every sample points almost like a brett farr kind of guy here he is baffling underneath the jones you know we talked about it earlier christening last year people forget no offense young quarterback migas <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> had gotten heard they had to go with <person player="kyle orton" race="white" position="QB">kyle orton</person> but he was just there to manage the game in handoff but the defense was so dominant they wound up as the number two seed in the conference so it s not as if theyre coming out of nowhere now and i think when they have that passing game going then i think that helps a running game and maybe thatll come later and then i know it helps the defense and then you get a lead like this man they just got everything going <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> to kick fair catch call for also a flag on the play at the 17 yard line after <person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person> for even holding number 53 10yard penalty first down time apple in at 37 chris will be with us well talk about some of the other things going on in the nfl today when we come back to chicago 34 six beers the chicago bears on their way to going fourandoh and becoming the only unbeaten team in the nfc after four <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> of play on this first night of october 11 37 remaining in the fourth period and nasa backs been handled <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> rebecca chris collinsworth from our studios in new york and right across the river of what a game that was today between the jets and the indianapolis colts chris yeah i dont know if you guys saw it or not it s gonna ask john about the eric mangini decision it was 1414 and you had about a fourth and two and a half almost three yards decides to go for it instead of kicking a field goal there and they come back up they end up losing by three sack here by <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark anderson</person> his second of the game well i know it s easy to say you know as the next coach im always gonna defend the coach but and one of those guys who have never been a tattletale maybe that s why they i believe they did the right thing yeah i think i think when you play against the colts that you have to take every opportunity you can to score points im gonna call scored what 31 so you knew that you had to get 32 points somehow i mean even though you didnt at 1414 so you look back at it but i say this to the people at second guessing that the people at second guess them probably wouldnt have gone for that onside that he got and they would have washed them here yeah youre right about both of them on my account about what it should simply thing going i quote it definitely not down to the exact yeah so this for is is mangini seven columns were three any while a score here is <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> on the ground again on a sac by tommy harris and not too often will you see that look on <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren please okay chris have you ever seen a more dominant inside guy than tommy harris tonight i mean a guy that i mean it probably has been more dominant or as dominant inside guys but this guy with his size or with his speed and was his first and second third step he s amazing well john the thing that impressed me i was watching some tape on these two teams obviously coming into this game is that yeah there are a lot of good players but good players dont always hustle and tommy harris plays like he thinks he s going to get cut tomorrow and that s what im prices being over here s the lucky <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> with a good run back to the 32 so you saw harris with a sack the bears have five sacks tonight they have done everything almost perfectly 952 left 34 6 bears jay leno coming up this week he will have <person player="mark bradley" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bradley</person> whitford john mayer john spire wanda sykes will bring you there rod stewart and <person player="michael boulware" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael</person> clarke duncan s all new tonight show with jay leno this week hell on nbc <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> the ball carrier here probably see a healthy dose of <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> going down the stretch here we see tommy harris aaron cris collinsworth were just talking about how he always hustles and runs and this whole bear defense does that and that s a lovie smith coach trait you know he grades him on what he calls blows and if they dont go a hundred percent then they get checked off for having a low and most players come defense will have doubledigit votes per game the staff below better than none is mention mobile you try and get single did remand you would try and live with two or three or four or five loaf i think <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> said the best that he s ever had was six slopes he s always he s always a doubledigit he said like last week he was twelve loaves andrea you know loafing now no loafing and not much as you say for <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> but what is actually <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> s definition of a loaf well when a ball is thrown deep and you dont turn in spring for it full speed that s a low if youre down on the ground then you dont pop right up that s a low and any slowing down during a play that s a loaf and remember guys one loop now keep this in mind 500 grades so when you grade them you got to keep in mind about the lokes now on the other side do you think <person player="lofa tatupu" race="white" position="LB">lofa</person> 2tuples ever had a loaf i dont know the thick grade woke is there they may have to denied now they just theyve just gotten whipped im in the seattle team flew in here from the pacific northwest and got a whipping here in chicago by the bears meanwhile robbie goal to attempt the 41yard field girl he s at a perfect season hasnt missed a field goal attempt or an extra point decision can he keep that one going mater s the home gold does it again 41 yards free forum tonight and it s 37 to 6 the light rain falling at soldier field not dampening these spirits 37 to 6 chicago bears on top it s not a makeorbreak game and never risen weve four but it s a little bit of a statement made by the bears tonight for anybody who was being validated as a serious contender yeah i think the the first time that <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> really get frustrated was that that first pick that he had by <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> jr and i think he was kind of baited into that and were gonna look at this from the big picture and were gonna see the play here and this is what he s looking at now here s here s where he s trying to throw he s trying to throw the slant out there and you see <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> is inside and he just jumps off his guy now now <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> thought that he was going to go with the slot slant instead he left the slot slant go and he jumped the corner slant there is manning opposing the liquefaction you know <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> at quarterback <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> is done for the night close in that past is beyond <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> on one the sidelines want to put some sex with the other and it s incomplete it was out of bounds and this this is one quarterback change that i dont think you can make anything out of i dont think you can say that <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> is hurt and i dont think you can say that <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> is going to be the starter here maybe it s just more of a mercy thing yep but youre saying the game is over and im not taking any chances and getting that man hurt and well just lick our wounds a little bit and get back and regroup and trying to get ready for the next game in st louis in two <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> and you can see that he was he was sacked five times he was down at least three times so so man hassle banging just coming off of ribbon three he did take a little beating lovie smith 5 and 11 is a rookie coach two years ago stayed with his program 11 and 5 last year big sandy texas how to get the name loving but his parents expected a girl and it was like hell or high water they were gonna name him after or her after a favorite aunt levena and they just it s a boy so were still gonna name him lovey that s one of those things you have to be tough to live with that name yeah and he is tops whilst whimsically outside you know it s funny he has the rookie safety danielle manning wasnt been involved in too much action tonight but manning s name is his there he is danielle then i was reading a story about him this week or his parents expected a girl and the mother loved the name danielle ill pop the boy im still gonna name him danielle you cant tell about first names anymore rubber used to be like you know joe and <person

in any kind of tight game uhhuh 37 section gago i believe that up the lights in detroit and here s the rest of it looks like oakland and the twins youll have santana opening up game one tuesday afternoon in minnesota these are the menards american league playoff matchups as for the national league it s a pig race it is i mean you gotta like the mets of course they host the dodgers starting wednesday at the hunters though that won seven straight theyve got that magic working right now and with no clearcut favorite that s a team i think they could get the world to know st louis backs into the division titles today theyll battle the padre starting tuesday afternoon in san diego all yankees but i think youre right yankees are the team to beat but i wouldnt be surprised if somebody gets hot something like the twins going on so momentum might be able to i think theyre going to get past the a s but theyll run into a buzzsaw with the yankees all right were going to step aside right now much more to come including up next rant and rave we will target everybody s allamerican northers garret wolf tommy and david know him well as i do does he have a realistic shot at the heisman and what about the national football league and later well visit with don king who s making sure corrado his second home these days stay with us though they even spent a national record 820 points he said that to refresh learned the concept of playing hard until the final whistle something he s so focuses on today and this summer i got to be there when the street he grew up on was renamed lovie smith drive so i asked him one day when somebody asks or who was lovie smith he said the answer will be a local hero who led the chicago bears to multiple championships and proved it doesnt matter where you come from you can go anywhere you want to go things are going he might have a an expressly mean that for him before too long as <person player="brian griese" race="white" position="QB">brian griese</person> comes into the game <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> is done for the night and greasy who came over as a free agent from tampa bay in the offseason will finish up greasy who succeeded john elway when elway retired in denver and bryan spent five seasons with denver then he went to miami you might recall three years ago for a year then the tampa bay and out of chicago to back up <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> the arrests were sorry about all the bad stuff we said about this week and i think i think that s the way it has to be the <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> has to be the quarterback and continue to to grow and improve and and maybe even into greatness and <person player="brian griese" race="white" position="QB">brian griese</person> is a backup in case something happens to them but the bears cant afford to get into one of those quarterback controversies and i think though theyre smart enough to know that and i dont think there s any way that s gonna happen yeah i dont see one on the horizon right now because you got <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> is the offensive player of the month of september 11th in the nfc great length and iphone walt instance that are 232 yards two touchdowns and next week buffalo comes in here and then arizona there in san francisco year 32 oh yeah that s an easy schedule but as a fan you can look at it until you die no buffalo be minnesota day that they come here at arizona who knows what s going on with the cardinals right now 49ers got killed today then miami that s a messy start there so you look at the next month for the chicago bears and it s you know yeah they make a schedule that s a pretty good one to pick right and if theyre really a good team they have to win those games and even though when theyre playing the giants new england teams like that if if youre going to be the best you got to beat the best and you have to hell be able to win those kinds of games like the the bears are tonight against the seattle seahawks when the 32 steady dose jones tonight trying to get up and over the hundred yard mark he is two yards shy of it right now he s carried 24 times for 98 yards you know how the players come out in the field and they have that big huddle before they run out and they were that that was their chance today and how do you know that if you want to be the man you got to beat the man i think theyre looking at the seattle seahawks they were nfc champion they were in a super bowl and if you want to be that man you got to go out on the field tonight and beat them and theyve done that they are the man of the moment yeah and then we have to put everything in perspective were still talking about before things like second attempt cédric vention tackled by <person player="ken hamlin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hamlin</person> the championship is won in february not in september not in october in federal yeah which brings up the question of the losing super bowl team hangover and i dont think that the seahawks have that i mean i think that <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren you know knew about that and knew that that has happened and i mean tonight they look like they have it but i wouldnt i wouldnt make that statement third and nine from the 33 yard line vincent im talking about that hangover and it s well illustrated and then what s happened to the super bowl losers over the past few years lana went in the <person player="tank johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tank</person> after 99 tennessee they had a good year following 2000 but then the giants were under 500 st louis oakland carolina philadelphia look at that from 2001 on with the giants and of course the question mark next to seattle theyll be three and one after tonight and i dont see them ending up with a losing record on fear we come to the twominute warning this chicago bear is that far away from making it officially for no of the nf2 the rock star of the game or stars of the game to be determined you look at the top of 30 rockefeller center fourth and four coming up here some of this some of the sounds from week four you know weve known for ourselves the whole clan can anybody be more offputting than killed for ourselves when he wants to make now he s completely worn out on that subject though and everyone keeps beating it to death well yeah here s the cut and let s feel that <person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person> and and not that it s gonna you know come up this week either i mean me well all craziness about owens estate and then he plays today and then what happens next week then gonna fill it out philadelphia and you ever make a promise to yourself you know in life what would you ever say you know im not gonna talk but im not gonna mention that and here we are thought yeah yeah i know yeah it was just i mean with something like that overshadows you know the game the team and you know the whole nfl where that becomes the story there s something wrong okay it s a story and it s positive but that there s a lot of games being played there s a lot of great players out there isnt become a sideshow this is marcus <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> who they signed as a backup running back when <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> got hurt that of virginia they brought him up put him on the active roster so hell close it out his lo fit to to phone the seahawks will go home and after the off week at willing to take on the ranch yeah we asked <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> holmgren last night if he would be playing and he says i hope not i think the reason he hoped not is he didnt expect to be thirty seven to six no well this is something that holmgren has rarely experienced losing the game to chicago a couple of times when seattle s met chicago <person player="mike brown" race="UNK" position="DB">mike</person> has a 14 and two records against the bears and holmgren teams have won 12 consecutive games against chicago so he s in a position he s rarely found in this open i think that thatll be his first loss since 1990 and 3 with 13 seasons and <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> tonight two interceptions two costly fix seattle will one run one more play and put the stuff in the duffel bag and go on home meanwhile chicago another game in the touchdown another game less than ten points and a dominant victory the chicago bears in each of the last eight regular season home games that s the last six of glass season and the first two this year holding their opponents under double digits lovie smith and company a big night in chicon 37 to 6 as the bears routed the seahawks the sunday night football postgame show comes up next sunday night rock star the game interviews in highlights after these messages from your local nbc safe light rain falling at soldier field these chicago bears knock off seattle the final score at 37 to 6 back to take a look at some of the highlights the bears got this scoring started on this finish to loosen will happen to make the score seven to three and then two big plays one this interception by <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> the other another interception manning tipping it to himself those two turnovers led to 10 points <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> bolted in for that touchdown to make it 22 3 big night for the defense <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> got sacked with five times twice by tommy harris the two sacks were the total of 20 yards and then berrien makes this catch of a 40yard pass for a touchdown <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">grossman</person> has a 232 yard night and in new york going up on the top of 30 rock 1 from the offense and one from the defense youve got <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> and tommy harris starters of the game andrea laughs both guys in tow and we come back to chicago parrish and they are with andrea kramer andrea thank you very much i dont know <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> still hard to get used to the bears as being a passing team but how are you managed to be so prolific tonight we had an allaround good team effort you know the defense gave us some sort feels at times and we were able to come up with some big plays so we ran the ball pretty well tonight and then we threw when we needed to tape up some big third down conversions so that was huge for us what kind of statement does the team make in a game like this well you know i think this is this is huge that s a great team we just played 37 to 6 but theyre a lot better than that so we know we may face him down the road in the playoffs if we you know everything works out so but this was a huge game for us to have a dominant defense now last eight regular season games here the bears have held their opponents under 10 yards how did you manage to shut down a normally prolific seattle offense well you know we had to play against the offense that did not have the maine running back <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> i pray that he gets healthy but they came out here they gave up a good fight but we dont plan to lose in our soldier field so tonight we played a good game seattle came out and they did what they did but i think well see them later on around down the road and i mean were just playing good football right now solid defense and hopefully went up in the super bowl you had two of the five sex on <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> of course also forced into two interceptions how are you so disruptive of the quarterback well i just get off the ball and make plays that s what im here to do and were just playing well as a team right now the guys are helping out on a wildly alex mountain johnson <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark anderson</person> and rookie and were just playing good football up front all right god bless you meanwhile another opponent as we mentioned comes in to soldier field and leaves with single digits two field goals that s all for seattle tonight another opponent held under 10 points chicago wins the game by a score of 37 to 6 and we move west we go to san diego next sunday night where the san diego

emotional andy macphail resigns as president and ceo but what about dusty baker good evening live from soldier field on this special edition of the nbc 5 news im alison rosen is talking to the press right now here at soldier field let s go there now were off to a good start before now and so on you know it s all im gonna say right now yeah that was that was big i mean anytime you get in the end zone it s huge no matter how you get there but i know that they were anxious because they hadnt got there in the first three previous game so im glad to see them get get a touchdown but it really doesnt matter who gets in there you know i think 3076 just shows that what were capable of but theyre theyre a lot better than that theyre a lot better and they played tonight and we realized that there are a lot better team than coming in here and getting beat 37 to 6 but you know we realized we may face them down the road at some point and and you know were just were just glad we got the win things kind of snowballed in our favor from our good play and some of their poor decisions but you know we know that theyre a great football team and and were going to <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> taking the podium theyre obviously feeling really good tonight for anybody who was doubting this offense they showed what they could do and it was exciting to see this team on the football field defense comes up big <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> takes the ball out of the end zone seahawks settled for a field goal it was three nothing they led briefly until the bears next possession <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex</person> crispin two moose and <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> great pass great rout at seven three bears and they never looked back after an interception <person player="thomas jones"

peggy kaczynski caught up with moose <person player="muhsin muhammad" race="UNK" position="WR">muhammad</person> just moments ago we felt like we really wanted to go out play a good game you know a national audience and it was loud on the line and we were put through a lot of different things a lot of different challenges i think we challenged ourselves this week to come out and play a total game and the deepest play well <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex</person> really had a good game i was really proud of bernard going out getting a hundred yards and off puts a lot i came together running we just just glad to be able to play in front of our home fans and give them a win on nasa television and much more coming up a little bit later in sports again the bears are fourandoh for the first time since 1991 and you guys if they beat the buffalo bills next week theyll be five and oh for the first time since 1986 back to you all right thanks paula the scoreboard tells it all here tonight 37 6 yeah it was it was a game where in the end of the game people were actually just sort of chatting with each other about the embarrass super bowl holmes yeah everybody s saying a big s word man in chicago that s a bit of a jinx but as we were coming in here we saw the tailgating going around there was a lot of action in the stands outside the stadium and it s raining outside amy the fans just dont want to leave well bob and allison im sure you remember the super bowl shuffle at least i do growing up in mount prospect but i can tell you this it felt like a playoff game as the bear fans cheered on the bears who just stopped last year s nfc champs a deafening roar as the chicago bears are the first to score a touchdown many feel a win tonight would propel the bears into postseason play excited fans are breaking tackles just to get to our camera a round of highfives after every play during the first half last year s nfc champs were no match for the monsters of the midway youve got two undefeated teams here were so excited we know were going to take them down i expect to go to another championship game contenders i love that outfit i wonder if he wears it at home now the bears today hand in the seattle seahawks their first loss of the season the bears for a no first time in 15 years reporting live from soldier field amy jacobson nbc5 news yards north of us here at soldier field and by the way we should say hello to a great big bears fan who couldnt be with us tonight warner saunders who will be back soon he s feeling better he s got laryngitis fortunately he didnt have to yell at his television set too much tonight <person player="thomas jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas jones</person> running the football i think he got close to 100 yards if he didnt get it we got <person player="cedric benson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cedric benson</person> s some good quality reps pleased with what we were able to do offensively defensively the defensive line set the pace with that pressure on the quarterback <person player="tommie harris" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tommie harris</person> has gotten a game ball each week and it would be hard not to give him one for this effort marc <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anderson</person> coming in but our entire defensive front <person player="alex brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">alex brown</person>s the interception there s and that was lovie smith at the podium tonight obviously the bears now continue to be undefeated the seattle seattle seahawks cant say that tonight dont want to rub it in well say it as long as we can were gonna take a break theyre going to come back with a lot more here from soldier field including war on the other big sports story tonight the surprise announcement from the cubs well have a live report from alex perez on the resignation of a me macphail as the president cubs who will replace him what does it mean for dusty baker then the white sox title hopes are gone but they still have a big impact on this final day of the regular season are they up to the challenge and later we did have a fabulous night for the ball game but it s gotten a little bit windy and rainy brett <person player="fred miller" race="nonwhite" position="OT">miller</person> is going to be a lot with our winning forecast in just a minute stay with us you know speaking from the offensive standpoint we converted some big third downs early which got us into rhythm and got going and i got us a touchdown early which i think you know calmed everyone down and then from there we had confidence enough to you know run the ball and make plays and the defense gave us some short short fields to work with again so and they didnt let anyone score a touchdown anytime to get they get a win game so you know <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> you know just had a great game again so it was just all around a very very solid performance by everyone you know the you know we have a great running attack last couple of <person player="marquis weeks" race="UNK" position="RB">weeks</person> we played some some extremely big defensive tackles that you know started running those monsters right there a defensive tackle but you know our offensive line just did a great job of creating lanes and thomas did had some great cut backs and they just played they played well and ron turner had some good myranda calls in there so we finally got the running game going which helps everything else well i think you know it all starts up front with our offensive line and then the receivers are getting open and making place and i have time to throw and theyre separating from their defenders and catching the ball so that s i think those are the two biggest reasons and coach turner has been calling a great great game and you know weve been converting third downs which which allow you to continue your drive and make things happen you know were off to a good start before now and so on you know it s all im gonna say right now yeah that was i was big i mean aim time you get in the end zone it s huge no matter how you get there but i know that they were anxious because they hadnt got there in the first three previous game so im glad to see them get get a touchdown but it really doesnt matter who gets in there well you know i think 3076 just shows that what were capable of but there are a lot better than that there are a lot better than they played tonight and we realized that there are a lot better team than coming in here and getting beat 37 to 6 but you know we realized we may face them down the road at some point and and you know were just were just glad we got the win things kind of snowballed in our favor from our good play and some of their poor decisions but you know we know that theyre great football team and and were gonna have to see them down the road if we want to get to where we want to go all right let s check out the report cards on <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex</person> hays across the board from jerry richard and dan guys 17 231 232 yards the two touchdowns no picks quarterback rating just over a hundred is the nfc offensive player of the month this looks like nothing like the offense we watch in life you have people gonna say well wait a minute i was good as they were last week you know were the four touches and all the rest at but the key was how you win games this doesnt necessarily always add up in terms of all the numbers it s the quality of the work that you did today i thought the the quality of the work was exceptional i really did seven seven touches for five scores that s that s big that s probably i would say it s his best as a problem and it s also the way theyre doing it ron turner is calling a great game but you like what theyre doing on first down richard is certainly with the passing game yeah i mean you kind of keeping him off set you know first down when he s down on the goal line i mean only i think play that wasnt you know called correct would be trying to throw you know run the ball in on them one but outside of that i thought they did a great job like he said before i mean they were keeping him off balance and they were throwing the ball deep to a guy named bernard who seattle obviously didnt see on film you know the funny thing is too you look back and were talking about the the full rides before and how dangerous that baggage was and i was counting it up the four wide receivers today 13 receptions in total so that means that the bears defense is a heck of a job of recognizing it and really taking that away from offense do not have fast receivers shut that down this problem a better team on the turf than it is on the grass and that s why maybe there s such a you know a road warrior team there every time they go on the road it seems like they have difficulty but you get them at home they take care of business let s take a look at the quarterback comparison between <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex grossman</person> and <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt hasselbeck</person> you look at these numbers and <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt</person> certainly doesnt look like the quarterback that had his team at super bowl xl in detroit just a few months back he was 16 a 35 no touchdowns the two picks both by <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky manning</person> jr and what did you see that the bears defense was able to do we talked about it the second series <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">matt</person> was moving the ball finding some open spaces with those receivers but from there on up front for dominated and that secondary for the bears really came through right i mean that was the big question mark was a secondary everybody was talking about the secondary we havent seen the secondary you want to see what they can do and they did it today they basically got after their my receivers there was full of him on the football field they were up in their face being physical with them and just shut it completely down yeah i got a question to that when you talk about the you know what was going on the secondary there was a play in the second half where it looked like peanut released the receiver to the safety and and i think was <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> he could have caught the ball for a touchdown what happened there was a safety just not coming i think there was a little breakdown right there im not exactly sure what happened like i know the safety should have been over the top if they were covered at the same time you can give a wide receiver free release down the floor no youre right it looked like peanut turned look to see the safety help realize he wasnt home hesitated then realizes so there was some sort of breakdown there he didnt catch the ball ohoh william <person player="darrell jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jackson</person> is standing by right now live at soldier field first of all billy jack give us the barometer of what this this feeling was like at soldier field a perfect night for football on the lakefront national tv in town the defending nfc champions what was the atmosphere like there tonight we know what that i can do even better i can bring the man out here <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> joins us now live after a huge win and brian youre talking about a statement game this is with at a national audience looking on you guys with a point to prove and i think you proved it looks like well you know all phases of the game are fair different special teams we didnt turn it over we took it away we ran the ball we threw it im just a complete game for us stefan exciting to come out and play like this one on big stage like it was tonight i talked about you guys it seemed like you kept the pressure on the entire game prior to keeping them out of the end zone and in fact <person player="matt hasselbeck" race="white" position="QB">hasselbeck</person> comes out of the game i dont know if it s pressure or what but you guys were intense the holy and rd line got after him we had seven eight guys playing tonight and they all played hard they all got to the quarterback just you know we played was i should really say we played well up front we make you make up a place for us there in the second quarter we just put it together all right peanut said earlier in the week that pressure will bust the pipe if the guys up front and even you told us when we were talking earlier in the week that you were anxious to see if they tried to go with a four receiver said what your front line would do and they they did it they did it and then pay the price and like i said if you double if you dont double tommy or <person player="tank johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tank</person> or any those guys up front theyre gonna make place they did it tonight they showed i mean tommy he s unbelievable if you dont double him every play he will make the tackle every player make a sack he s a he s a great player and he just keeps showing us how good he is okay what about your offense coming around and picking up their share of the load yet again 37 points you know every week that they just keep stepping up for us they ran a good tonight that was big anytime we can run the ball it s big for our defense we got chance to rest but man <person player="rex grossman" race="white" position="QB">rex</person> is throwing all over the place the guys are catching it and protecting them it s just exciting right now all right brian enjoy the win good word for you okay all right pat so <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> pumped up and i can tell you the mood right outside the locker room very jovial because what the national audience looking on they had a point to prove and the bears think they proved that tonight putting 37 points on the board and keeping yet another opponent out of the end zone that was huge and they say they just want to keep it going dont get the big head or anything like that but they have to feel good about their accomplishments again the office doing it the defense doing it special teams chipping in so they want to do a little better in terms of letting the guys return the kicks but other than that youre just nitpicking now this is a great night i think theyll enjoy for a while all right william it certainly was a statement game for this team <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> with seven tackles <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> led the way with 10 and jerry because of the four wide sometimes the five was there was a lot of the linebacking cool for the bears and they responded what happened tonight well basically with the four wide receivers you know the defense was in nickel package and before my receiver s you know there s there s four wide receivers out there and you have to cover them and the guy that i think stepped up really big was <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> because he had it he had to basically cover that forth while receiver and it kind of went under the radar but he came up with a lot of big plays and he checked in and shut it down most linebackers in this league dont have the speed to stay up with a wide receiver that s something that lance has right lance has a speed he has you know the athletic talent and the ability to go out there and do it he s a very smart player he knows where his help is and he made it all work for him today and he made a lot of place a lot of key plays and he can help on the run game say if you leave him in there then now youve got another line back in there for the run game as well and that s why theyre able to shut down the run versus seattle not only the fact that <person player="sean locklear" race="nonwhite" position="OT">sean</person> <person player="shaun alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> was wasnt in there but they just shut down the run period and that to me was a beautiful thing you had that on top right i mean and that s where you have a dominant defensive effort tonight yeah <person player="maurice morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice morris</person> 11 carries 35 yards and they only got 77 yards total on the ground lovie smith addressed the media short time ago at soldier field let s listen in to the head coach of the chicago bears robbie with the field goals did an excellent job on the kickoff returns putting the ball in the end zone again brad manor i could go on it was a great team effort biased tonight against a good seattle team tonight was our night therell be a playoff team and who knows down the line yes <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky</person> has had a you know a few things going on for him this week larry but he was professional as far as staying focused you know for the for the football game but yes that s what we brought <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky</person> here for that s been <person player="ricky manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ricky</person> s i spent his past also he made a lot of good interceptions for the for the panthers and it s good to see him get a you know few fuss today we we play and each week i mean there are two halves we came in and we told the team we starting over again at 00 we were going to play that way we were going to call plays that way try to stay aggressive what we were doing defensively in and continue to pass the football on offensive side of the ball laden football game i you know relaxed a little bit there at the end but you dont expect things like this but you never know tonight was our night seattle is a good football team they had the same type of game at home against the giants last week our fans had a lot to do with it they were into the football game from the warmups to the end of the game so they have quite a bit and were caught were a hard combination im talking about our football team and our fans here at home well that s what im gonna as well of course that s what im going to say is that we we just completed the first quarter of our football season and were ahead after the first quarter it s no more than that we won four games we have a long ways to go but we have a lot of improvement still to make it s not like we played a perfect game by any means tonight we have a big game coming up against buffalo buffalo had a big win this past week so well get back to the practice field and try to correct some of those mistakes well that s you know it s a decent of team the first thing you would like to do
