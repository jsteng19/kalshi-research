middle of that pair defense he s <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> knees with michele tafoya al thank you very much brian you and a number of veterans on this bears defense have had great success over the years but this season s group is on track to do some historic things what if different about this year s given this explosive thicket of all the way of launches forward when we get a pressure on the quarterback all season long stop the run and make big plays youve got a lot of wind and rain tonight how is that going to help order your defense both teams have to deal with it so it s not going to matter whether it s not going to win the game for us megan plays this any adjustments though well got to care for the bullying that s it brian thank you very much and it has been raining steadily for the past several hours here on this field and the field has not been covered it s expected to continue to rain throughout the rest of the game and the wind has been gusting forcefully and unpredictably and alva texans are without two starters tonight no sack of <person player="shaun cody" race="white" position="DT">shaun cody</person> did not make the trip because of rib and lung injuries and tied it <person player="owen daniels" race="white" position="TE">owen daniels</person> who was a gametime decision is inactive with the back injury and that significant thank you miguel teams are seven and one a lot of numbers to look at obviously here the texan fewest turnovers in the league six if we law on the other side the bears with 28 takeaways that s three and a half birthday the texas bass board their opponents by a hundred points that s the second largest their friends on the league and the bears by a hundred sixteen points which is the largest differential in the league and to prime defensive player of the year candidates <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> and <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> in action tonight the bears won the toss elected to defer so theyll go on defense right away <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> to kickoff it was 70Â° midafternoon back because <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">keshawn martin</person> a rookie out of michigan state right now it s in the mid50s it s expected to go into the upper 30s after midnight so we will go in chicago from summer to winter and about half a day and looking at the radar the rain will really start to come in and project is taking two yards into the endzone by <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> will get down and the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> will be loose and the chicago bears might have another take away as they loan file the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> is inside the 20 yard line and there it is another take away right off the bat it took them all of seven seconds take a look and see if his knee hit the ground before the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> came out but down i think <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> out which means i think houston is going to get this one back let s take a look one more time right theyre going to have to challenge to get it <person player="zack bowman" race="UNK" position="DB">zack</person> coleman forced the fumble and gary kubiak will called serrator over and he will have to challenge it because the ruling on the field was a fumble and a recovery by chicago actually you see it s a turnover since it is a turnover it goes up to the booth gary ready with the flag and then stare at or well send it up to the booth all turnovers as a roll scoring please get to be reviewed looks like a relatively easy overturn here clearly down i think there s any question about it but if you are the houston texans and on the first play of the game you fumble the football something that has been in your brain all week long about you know the barriers taken away and dont give it away and all that kind of stuff and then the first play you lay it on the ground just as another little thing to your mind <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">keshawn martin</person> he working at a michigan state trend and <person player="trindon holliday" race="UNK" position="WR">holliday</person> had been their returner but they let him go about a month ago he went to denver and scored an interesting touchdown today as he gave the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> up apparently just shy of the goal line but they ruled it a touchdown anyway in denver s game against carolina the way lovey looked at it he saw the replay and he knows that he s not going to get the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> turnovers reviewed upstairs and it looked good for the moment but he knows as well as anybody that <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> was down and the texans offense is already out there and theyre huddling and theyre ready to call a play from this one a yard line but theyre thinking about guys like <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> all week and not thinking about the opening kickoff and give the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> away youre exactly right yeah gentlemen grover on the sideline somewhere he doesnt have to think too much about him but all week long and practice even after the play was over gary kubiak had his team run up behind people that had the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> running back to receivers quarterbacks and punch at it after review it hasnt determined that the runt was down by contact fire losing possesses of all it will be houston <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> first and ten on the 18 yard line the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> is placed on the hash mark here at the chicago skyline first down houston pretty clear in lincoln the old days the old days you have to challenge that now with the new rule all scoring plays were reviewed or turnovers and that were counted obviously the turnover off the opening kick so official revealed max job as you can see third passage 2011 the beginning of last year rating on the road with 15 touchdowns three interceptions as possible as an 18 yards order play of the game for the houston texas is playaction and a scream into traffic and was a few guys right there <person player="garrett graham" race="UNK" position="TE">garrett graham</person>e makes the catch even side by side with one of his offensive linemen it s a short game and we second down and nine it s a little tight end screen out here but <person player="nick roach" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick roach</person> looks like to be the one that s all over this read it all the way and just made to play the one thing that we see with the chicago bears defensively theyre not real complex but what they do they do really well the running back is faster bootleg shot has a ton of time in some sweet was <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite"

hands full tonight against his former college teammate <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> wont go to wisconsin and that chicago offensive line has been their biggest issue this season even though <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> as a runner is averaging five yards per carry he s been particularly effective on outside run and cut a little bit of the air on first watch that and that s useful and picked up by the texan that s ten times coming up with king size authority and take it all the way inside the chicago 30yard line for the pass for kelling <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">davis</person> and it would have been an eight or nine yard game and the texans get the strip danielle <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> the former bear is the guy who dislodges <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">kellen davis</person> was just blocking on the plate snuck out late and just hit nicole <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> s that i told you you should have given me more money around here he goes to the texans and what a shot to open this game a little bears treatment from the former bears back to the bear and how sweet that is for <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> who played five years here and they offered but contractors were like conduct on the houston vet that 1500 the end of the play first sound houston so they were so happy from <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> that they got a 15yard penalty on the sidelines but they if you want to take the mantle of being the top team in the afc you have to come play physical football against a very physical chicago bears team and that opening shot by danielle <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> sent a message at the 43 yard line on first down of the quick town and that pass is caught by <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre

tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> the university of louisiana <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> s had an off the charts here you look at the linebackers grigg he was getting briefed illegally reception was six on first down or play action again a lot of side of the passes overthrown and incomplete intended for <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> who has been a texan since he was drafted in the first round and third overall back in 2003 the second year of the franchise anytime you play against the chicago bears you know that these linebackers as great as they are they want to play downhill fast and you can go play action and throw it right behind them that time the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> looked like it just slipped out of the hands of that shot second down and ten doctor look at the room to the outside the senator says were about a four yard game behind a block by <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade smith</person> the left guard walled in chicago 29 yard line well one of the things on this stretch play that they run is they want to try and set a hard edge they dont want <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">arian foster</person> getting to the outside there you see milton setting the edge <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> goes inside a hem and then back outside the chicago bears defense there theyre trying shorten the field locked him in tonight with that strategy right there walker in his fourth year in his second year 2010 he led the league in rushing third and seven lexx coming off sets away from it then hits <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnson</person> and he gets tackled by coleman but not until the first sound is picked up again by <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnson</person> s to go in his way tonight <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> no stranger to the pro bowl in his tenth to where youre going to get this crossing route right across the field here and <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> youre starting to see over the past three <person player="jonathan weeks" race="UNK" position="C">weeks</person> or so he is feeling healthy again and when <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> is fast it s going to be very difficult for <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> to keep up it all night tonight from the 21 yard line first enter the room <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> difficulty outside <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnson</person> hasnt played all that much over the last couple years he s missed a lot of games and gary kubiak was saying hey look we just have to give him a playoff every now and then so we take the second playoff here like the last three games though 25 catches and he even admitted himself you had a couple of knee procedures going issues of this season but it has just been one of those nights and it s going to be fun so tonight tonight if you play against <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> all night are you going to throw those right and left hooks and try and get that <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> out or time to get it left or forced fumbles in their win in tennessee the whole roster will set up a first down and goal <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right to safety makes the tackle so <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> for a 13yard gain at the chicago seven now first and goal risk on key right here is going to try and come down here and it s going to set the edge right here where they can get outside and that creates the alley a lot of times they want to bring their safeties down inside and if they get caught up in the traffic raise the big gap sawsan back in is why do the light is sponsored and it s filled after a gain of one <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">arian foster</person> played his college <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> to tennessee and was undrafted second down and goal isnt it remarkable to think of a guy that come into the national football league and just torn it up and dirt did any fires a draft of it he is a character boy he is a guy that sort of a philosophy <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> and we stay in the huddle do they hear his opinions in the house and now he s partying on that would get nothing but delay game huh <person player="david hunter" race="UNK" position="DT">david</person> philosopher big boy just for the record second and goal from the the right side begins and litter one yard pick up sitting down setting up a third down and goal from the 5yard line wookies this time going to be right here to set this edge this time you can see what theyre doing as long as <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> has to cut inside that offensive end the bears feel like they have the advantage with the lacquer and <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> coming from inside thirty more three receivers punch to the left and one half of faster and theyll run him out of bounds at the three yard line hillman was there so they had a first and goal at the 7 yard line and now a 4th and goal at the 3 and in comes the field goal unit one of the reasons that <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> is going to be considered not one of the defensive players of the year this year is that he can tackle not only it s almost amazing isnt it <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">alan</person> you watch him it s like he sized his guys up and he still gets him on the ground but he s able to like go right and left hooks in there and knock that football out with amazing this would be a 20yard field goal attempt for gaining oil and the houston texans take the early lead in on this over chicago s bring up affecting the night football from chicago brought to you by southwest airlines you can find our fares online only at southwestcom by windows 8 by bank of america by chevrolet for pickle off to the last yard chevy runs deep phoenix with soldier field dedicated to the men our services next name six years ago the beers like their first game here tonight the 307 regular c nfl game at soldier field which was refurbished about a decade ago but you think of the chicago bears they still have played more games and wrigley field the home of the cubs than here this is a bouncing dick off to keep it away from pester yielded up at the 24yard line <person player="kyle adams" race="UNK" position="TE">kyle adams</person> one of the chicago tight end he s run out of bounds so the come back out of the field trailing by a field goal well let out log on to nbccom sns extra a lot of goodies you can see what the screen looks like like glory oh channing michele tafoya as well and tonight social media analysis with jarrett payton the some of the late great walter payton <person player="garrett graham" race="UNK" position="TE">garrett</person> himself the guy who played in the nfl for part of the 2005 season with the tennessee titans sunday night football expo all right now on first down at hand the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> off the mat for say nothing happening there over the left side tackled by brady james so comer comes here in oh 9 in the deal with denver the town is over the moon about it so he s now in his 50 you start with the bears 31 and 18 and if he can stay here for a number of years he figures to eclipse a lot of marks that have been held for a long long while by people like sid luckman going back a long time and if <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> can stay here for a while who will write his name into the bears record second down and eight from the 39 yard line the outside and that is taught by earl bank with replayed at vanderbilt to the to hook up here for first down now the bears given the texans a little bootleg action of their own and one of the things that the texans were worried about is that <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> has the ability to move around a little bit aaron rodgers and the only defeat the texans have had this year got burned several times by aaron rodgers mobility and they know <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> has the ability to do much of the same kind of stuff then i rodgers threw six touchdown pass not want to go on sunday night football at reliant stadium and there goes birthday for a game let s take a look at that houston defense <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> wisconsin pro <person player="earl mitchell" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mitchell</person> arizona <person player="antonio smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">antonio smith</person> salad <person player="brooks reed" race="white" position="DE">brooks reed</person> university of arizona jim <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dobbins</person> clint clip aku brady james lsu honor barwon university of cincinnati dorian <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> university alabama danielle man abilene christian university louver corner knock five high school <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay</person> joe rocky jonathan joseph one of the best of the ligaments at defense guided by <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips in the second year is the defensive coordinator and a tremendous turnaround for the greece of defense last year in this second debate we will take off take him down very close to a first down <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> and reid are both there and theyll spot the bull just a little short of the first down well one of the big questions is going to be the play of <person player="gabe carimi" race="UNK" position="OT">gabe</person> curry me honestly last week he played one of the worst games ive seen them this when he gets knocked over he did get tripped up on that play by his own man but for <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> again here comes the mobility and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> has started pretty slowly in the persian border just a 38 quarterback rating in the first quarter gets progressively better as he goes throughout the game and the worst in the league in the first quarter and the best in the fourth is caught by <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> that s a great tackle by <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem jackson</person> and that may be spotted just short of the first down <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem jackson</person> third year he was the number one pick out of alabama in 2010 makes a great tackle and serrator is going to bring in the chain game <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem jackson</person> was one of those guys that got picked on a lot early on in his career on the other side of jonathan joseph but who would have figured that <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> could have made that tackle certainly not <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> you get one of the best open field runners in all a football out in space and he cant gain a yard to get that first down or didnt look like good the lovie smith is going to have a pretty interesting call here early in the game he was figures to be a defensive struggle and whether convictions will get worse as we go along and he has the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> fourth and that much at the 43 yard line of the texas or if the crowd always wants the home coach to go for it but as marv levy once said you start listening to the crowd pretty soon youre sitting with it interesting decision here this is the one thing that the bears feel like that they have an advantage on in this game is that theyre bigger and stronger they do feel like that while maybe the texans have an advantage in a pass rush situation <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips bunch the bears feel like they are bigger stronger and can push them around so probably played into this decision well well see if they do in beach snapit mike tyson s now the offensive coordinator onetime head coach of the minnesota vikings so he calls the play at sea if indeed they do go for to discredit brom offside that <person player="evan rodriguez" race="UNK" position="RB">evan rodriguez</person> a fullback and michael butcher the running back marquis goes in motion and they will run it and this is loses the for every guy in the first half and nothing but <person player="cody white" race="UNK" position="OG">white</person> church surrounded and the texans come up with it louver quinn force the fumble brady games comes away with it and the texans have taken the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> away again two turnovers by the bears bring nothing sections available well the bears create a lot of fumbles but they dont fumble very often you wouldnt know that from tonight s game though for through week time and then to tonight theyve lost every one of them the last time he s been camped in for three let s see what they do here the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> at the 27 as they start this drug <person player="justin forsett" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin forsett</person> is the running back off the play fake please dont drown she s out of the pocket let s go to michelle al looking a lot left and shane mcclelland out with a concussion for the bears who left the game in the first quarter early and went to see evaluator than he has done for the night meanwhile linebacker jim <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dobbins</person> for houston he recovered that fumble earlier and then he went to the locker room and he hasnt come back out he missed the last year into defensive series for houston we have not been told why out all right thank you michelle that s very significant because brian pushing their little linebacker who got hurt inside linebacker against his debt over a month ago he s taken by solvent gaddafi was a fillin at that spot and that was the wonder about half a second attended passage for ungrate junction who s now caught green patches already and that will set up a third down and five well as soon as the bears roll one of their safeties down they know <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> has <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> one on one theyve hit this one already a couple of times out there eventually that s going to turn into quickly way the wind is swirling around long half are going to be very difficult to complete so expect feminist arts click on now thirtyfive in the pocket and the pass is caught and <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> takes the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> to the 40yard line you have to the best gas countering running backs in the league playing tonight <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> on one side and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> on the other <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> is an absolute monster you know he is out here working against an excellent tackling dwayne brown goes right through him that time and the texans would love to not have to help wayne brown but if he gets many more clean shots on that job like that they may have to jump we 15 left in the theater first down play action all the way up and when he could sort of success complete and movies he s going for the crowd wants rounding things <person player="james casey" race="white" position="TE">casey</person> was the closest he s the fullback number 86 her challenger says no i can not reach down the field but that was an attempt at a screen pass and once again 458 is eligible so say new delhi but once again this is a well coached chicago bears defense if youre going to get a screen pass off you have to be pretty devious or did a nice crowd or stepping down the penn <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> now and you can barely get out the backfield the texans love to run outside there s new jewish <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> since 2009 61% of the runs have been outside the tackles that s the highest percentage in the league and the average is seven tenths of a yard more on those outside runs than all others there s no that makin setting that pretty hard so far the only thing really working the rats on the things like that he s been calling it to going to college the reigning hoarders will increase and dice goes on 3rd and 10 shillings x7 he leads the and dinging will be sound back the remains that interception so that one back goal knocked out intended for a piece on board but theyre going to spot the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> who is down back at the houston 45 yard line but 7 picks now for jenna tonight a lot of turnovers already reset g shammar just going to slip and fall in for <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> interception number 7 were probably the easiest it s either down by contact though he tripped over his leg hey can we start at the 45 yard line a little go to the ear throws in his fort at the 31 yard line by <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> he got position on jonathan joseph and picks up the first down that was awful i reason to say that s been fl football right there <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> the outside receiver watch it he slips falls he s just going to take rebound position knew he had to hold off chuckling joseph and just thought it was one arm and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> just loaded that thing out there like he had total faith in his guys at making pies right by golly he did really 31 yard line that s a gain of 14 at chicago s second of the game 1:40 to go in the quarter well say this year were the team for the 29yard line <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> with <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tim dobbins</person> as you saw back in the game number 52 <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> pick in the second round played his college <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> at tulane and he s been a great asset for the chicago bears through the years a lot of people around here wanting to carry the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> more earlier in the season with an ankle chris was bothering him yeah and you know mike taste the offensive coordinators saying i was taking a lot of heat but there is just no way with the way he was feeling i could afford to give him the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> that much but now they say he s 100% healthy and a <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> factor everything five yards a carry as i mentioned before three attaching the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> back field here is empty cutter out of the gun he intercepted at the six yard line and danielle <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> all my goodness danielle <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> at this game circles on his calendar because the bears didnt make him the offer that he wanted two years ago and what a quarter he has had forcing a turnover and now an interception well danielle <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> the former chicago bears been his first five years here before stumble earlier and that led to the three points to rupp on the board and now the interception here third chicago turnover already watch brady james number 53 not gelling <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">davis</person> off this route and that s what set up the interception which would have illegal contact i saw <person player="justin forsett" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin forsett</person> is the running back here and it is filling the back up the faucet means to weave in pi and making the tackle and well <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> is a lot of buddies on that bear defense mechanism and this you man this bears defense probably has more fun than anybody we were watching them the other day and when theyre on the bench theyre playing charades if you think of monsters of the midway and all that kind of stuff here they are just sounds like you know movie and all that kind of stuff they do it every day waiting seconds of the on second and i can harry <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> who will end the court over the run after the 28 yard line for a first down in worcester <person player="jt thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> repossessions in the quarter fumble fumble interception into one three nothing houston and sunday night football from chicago resumes everything aerial coverage brought to you by geico now that s virtual reality truth be told we had to take that shot on friday night but it was a beautiful night here in chicago but our plane has been grounded and grounded because it s raining and it s windy and we always tell the truth here yeah then you should hire them so how about all that right now my cris collinsworth michele tafoya in chicago and is <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> for reporting on it we mentioned last week kristen when we look at the schedule on the came out it was used something in chicago and these teams almost never play each other maybe houston s only been in the league since oh 2/3 meeting ever we didnt know what were going to get you didnt think you want to get two teams that are 7 and 1 now you didnt but it s been an impressive start and i think mostly because of the play of these two defenses you know <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips has done an unbelievable job rod marinelli on the other side and that s what this game is turning into already you can already tell what were going to happen well four turnovers in the game three by chicago second and ten bootleg off the play fake and then attaches intercepted and if his pinnings again to deny eight for the season he does thinking resound he s still running around either he may be right he may be right and then right before right before there s an official on the sideline right here by the bears banter right before <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> when the end zone waved his hands over his head and then back up were out of beds when lovey or whoever was started coming after her well again if you turn over so it s automatically looked at upstairs you see it would to turn over to see if he was down so no call was made you didnt see any whistle be alone the bears are signalling that they scored a touchdown territory fourth well hear from the guys upstairs because of the turnover off the field walter fielding saying theyll have to worry about who s in charge when z is out there after the interception the play would grown and devlin the runner was at the 30yard line it will be supposed though blown dead without a signal by any of the officials well there was the official on that side of the field who was waving his hands over his head calling for a timeout but he didnt do it initially i saw him do it right before <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> went into the end zone was there any contact there boy it would be hard to say hard to overturn whatever it was that was called well there s a little contact there being he runs into his own man but <person player="james casey" race="white" position="TE">casey</person> just got a piece of his foot and that s why the play was ended right there you know these two offenses at this point in the game have got to figure out you know what we cant lose the game these conditions are such youve got to let this defense play and love you smith s not buying it he s saying all right hey you made a mistake were going to live with it but believe me it was mistake that s exactly what he s telling <person player="lester jean" race="UNK" position="WR">jean</person> job growing the pic here it is again <person player="james casey" race="white" position="TE">casey</person> will come in there s <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> his own man hitting him in case he just does get a little bit of them and then right steps on him as well yeah i agree i thought so therell be an official review of nothing else we will stand all right theyre looking at this because it s a turnovers okay so it s an official review down by contact to me the question is when gene store car came in he said the play was whistled dead it was whistled dead it s over even though theyre looking to see if kc was touching at any point <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> and it appears he makes very slight contact with his hand and <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> foot but if they rule this a touchdown thence territory either misspoke or theyre screwing up something here because if the whistle blew the play is over and i just love he has the right to have it reviewed because it s a turnover i just dont know what exactly they would be reviewing you know it was one of those calls that they always sometimes well say the officials should let it go and let it go to real play but because the call was made that way on the field tough to overturn anyway if you blow the whistle the play is over right after the view it s been determined that after the interception the returner was down by contact heresy father s death when the game pot operator please reset the game clock to 14 minutes 14 seconds gobies the prados <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> first instead that s all well and good i mean and it s a good thing for them that it turns out that way or at least that s how they saw it because if he asked <person player="lester jean" race="UNK" position="WR">jean</person> said if they had blown the whistle that <person player="michael bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> should have been dead at that point period but for seven innings how about those numbers eight interceptions and nine games now have to have only seven in his first 85 game and im not remarkable you already here tonight and it s not even in the player of the year the defensive player via conversation because killman is and here it goes <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> and he keeps those legs plugging back and what theyre picking up for talked about jeg coughlin the problems he s had early in games to tvs four picks and the lowest rating in the league in the first quarter and then he gets okay in the second and gersh words and he is off the charts figure in the fourth quarter with the highest rating in the league double double second at six hey course house our game is won by roll mix or a <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> for the first time tonight dominated on that i think it was lance lewis he was going against right here watch him take a listen just rip them back into everybody this couldnt quite make the play but so far tonight the one thing that i have been noticing is the game 3 me and lance lewis on the right side of this offensive line in one blocking and that tt walk have been very very effective for for pushing the defensive tackles off the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> just like they thought they might wear it is running third down and five handle it jonathan joseph right there widows and brandon <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> was at a tremendous first half of the season he handled that one fourth down and jonathan joseph getting fed up watch <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> here just a little nudge this is the second completion they almost had with that little push off and im telling you how so far tonight ive seen holding ive been pushing off these officials are letting these guys play out here in the rain this is going to be an interesting day 15 one yard field goal attempt for <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> win for the moment has died down because you the flags at the top of the upright oh <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie</person> <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> with a screwball next good started down the middle went back toward the right upright and early in the second winter is 30 from what would probably be the first family of football virginia mccaskey was george halas the founder of this franchise folks the team for 40 years for 10 year increments or service many women being honored all weekend that was well that was great i mean that is the first lady of football right there and that was lovely his <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> sick <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">keshawn martin</person> from new york on the opening kickoff but he was down before he lost the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> hit by <person player="kelvin hayden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelvin hayden</person> the bench players of the year well <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj</person> <person player="cody white" race="UNK" position="OG">white</person> is what is in the conversation obviously the swathi deflected ten passes and four of those have resulted in interception also his ten and a half stacks along the way which is great for alignment obviously in <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> with the punch those four forced fumbles two interceptions for tots down seven forced fumbles his counterpart jenny the toothpicks already burns down from the 21 yard line job was for <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> a second all right so the normal <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> carrier by the way i never fumbled in my nfl career okay the normal <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> carrier carries the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> like this okay so what does <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> do so he says there s no way you can keep me from getting it out so hell punch down hell punch up if youre down low like that or in the cop coughlin s of course tom coughlin told tiki barber hi in tight folder here then was that s what he s doing so i mean you know this whole thing is is really working in his favor he s a master at it he really is second bamboo over the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> at the 27 yard on the court they are silently third and one bacala five brig real off <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> a big story this week because his wife is now full term as of the weekend they expect to induce the baby tomorrow but <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> said earlier in the week hey if that baby is coming on sunday im going to be at the hospital but she want to come the games the game she s like john you know im like ill miss the game krauser breaks contact and faster picks up the first time as you find exactly like film anout fastly 40yard line at the 43 one thing youll notice whenever you watch the texas play some these short yardage plays they will go with a very quick count the bears werent even in their stance yet shot goes up snaps the football they gain the advantage has extra tight in on the outside <person player="ryan harris" race="white" position="OT">ryan harris</person> who knocked his guy down very clever played on lovie smith already is ninth season as the bears head coach or walker first or set getting at the 48yard line there s funny even announcing the game it s hard to tell are they running the stretch player they run in the bootleg pass watch the linemen they all pull it s the exact same play is they give it to <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> on the left are they pull it out and run the bootleg and you see all the defenders theyre all right with those offensive linemen down the field and it is just a very difficult combination if the texans can get that fresh flavor balance into the backfield hagana came back but he cant warm up as over to a wall at the 45 yard line it will be third down and eight after a loss of two what s happening is the defensive ends of the bears this time <person player="israel idonije" race="nonwhite" position="DT">israel idonije</person> theyre taking an inside route and beating the tackle the tackle thinks they have to jump outside theyve run that press play the bears are jumping kids and will able to make the play on the that said a big difference so far third and nine to react scene so the three three games as already has five finals laughter the plaster is walking out in front ponte and <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> coming to make the tackle it will be fourth down one of the things that <person player="matt schaub" race="white" position="QB">matt schaub</person> understood coming into this game he said you end up third nine against the chicago bears you can almost forget about it because theyre going to drop back were gonna make you dump it off somewhere and come up and make a tackle and chicago bears dont miss any time <person player="donnie jones" race="white" position="P">donnie jones</person> will punt it looked ridiculous in the textures way so that s the refills punt return touchdown history record im going to back up and let it go it bounces it the one just does go into the endzone a 44 to go in the opening hand houston three chicago three on sunday night football alumns of soldier field they remain when they refurbished this and they opened it reopened it back in 2003 after shutting it down for a little while but the stadium that went open you hold at one point over 20,000 now it s a building 16 where there s not a exceeds nearly old days first contact me but it s incidental and incomplete for injection back there with <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> is both go to the ground second out of 10 yeah no question about a green <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> was going up for the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> here there s no way this is pass interference on the play <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> see them pushing shoving that s the way it s been going all night both of them just mistimed it and now youve got right here big <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj</person> watch the pressure against his old wisconsin teammate <person player="gabe carimi" race="UNK" position="OT">gabe</person> creamy and creamy got to get those arms out notice watching the tape last week it s been his arms if you dont do this <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> ignore where on second time and that is marco and marco breaking package stopped at the 26yard learning on this field whether the third down to four nice stop by jamarcus web getting <person player="connor barwin" race="white" position="DE">connor</person> parlons hands down he still almost got his hands back up to mages plank this play were going to have one of those <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> plays against the bengals in the playoffs but <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> that guy for <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> you could just feel how much more at ease he is with <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> around here pregnant um well that s it was a huge acquisition they came up together played their first two years in denver and washington for miami and comstock here loves it third down and three best returns around all kinds of jumping up and down on a houston event looking for an appearance on nestor <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem jackson</person> covering on the floyd no flag poor down there we go outside take a look and i dont think that s pass interference either right now theyre just a little chicken fight and go ah he does kind of hook that bottom arm but that kind of stuff just doesnt get called in this league that s a good note <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> okay so gary kubiak on the sidelines hoping for the flag adam pottle x will punt for the first time in the game he s on <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> will bring it back as he comes up and says americana the bad pick that will bounce just in size of 40 and rolled dead at the 33 halfway through the second quarter at venerable soldier field in a breach we will be back in 2006 gary kubiak took over he s now in his seventh season theyve had only two coaches in the texas history <person player="dom decicco" race="UNK" position="LB">dom</person> capers when they were the expansion team of o2 and then gary came in and bob mcnair has been delivered exercise the water potion under the phoenix the gun potato office the pass is incomplete intended for tation itll be second down tsukuba after years chris as we all know under mike shanahan in denver he was the backup to john elway as a player and then on shanahan stat for a long time oh yeah after did you ever try to get traded because they had to play behind john elway he s like heck no i knew i couldnt plan didnt want anybody else to template it is a very selfdeprecating good humor john a guy and it s been beautifully released a native section please comment to say a second and fan for it threestep drop in the hax <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> who has already now made for grabs in the game and that one is good for 11 yards in the first down he s going to end up right between <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> and <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> a place most people wouldnt want to be and he holds onto the football that s pretty good stuff <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> though you look at what he s done throughout his career yards per game receptions per game he s second on both those lists there s been a tremendous player because detective evans going to play off very much how many people knowing from the 45 to the a <person player="jonathan scott" race="nonwhite" position="OT">scott</person> walker and he gets away from roche and is forced out of bounds and as he crosses the 50 yard line the game is seven and we second down and three theyre trying to switch off on the outside so theyre bringing the defensive end inside and the linebackers bouncing around and it s supposed to be <person player="nick roach" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick roach</person> this time with the contain but he doesnt get there he doesnt get his far enough outside you forget <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">arian foster</person> s a big guy there he kind of looks like marcus <person player="armando allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> me sometimes running the football but he weighs about 230 pounds second chord the 49yard line oscar exit back inside the 40 and a 15 before proposing another hundred yards at the half behind a james kasey block goes for 22 yards and on 14 carries <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> has already gained 91 yards tonight once again this down inside stun and wayne brown is going to just drive them inside and that allows james kasey to come around and seal that corner so right now the texans are making the adjustment let s see if the chicago bears now go back to the old way of doing this with the end on contain because we texans are taking advantage walker on the regular backup ben came in active tonight here s four set he cuts it back inside the 20 inside the pen is hassled by chris rock you say the pucks down but it s going to be first down and goal for houston it s exactly what they did they had just at that time the defensive end went outside tackle went outside and four set just ripped it up inside that s what makes this place so tough to defend about the time you think you know what youre doing with it the texans make an adjustment and they hit a big play on you and that s the good side of that line reclaim brown and wait missing the senate chrismyers walk her back in first and goal from the 3 5 minutes to the half posture one thing the texans are terrific in time of possession they lead the league in that and you look at it right now they have had the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> for over 70 minutes the bears have had the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> less than eight you know it s the big reason why theyve had the kind of leads that theyve had and theyve been in the lead almost 70% of the time so far this season and they do it with this blinded out kind of play second in points per game they have it second and goal at the 2 yard line sucks down by <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> covering on the play <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> puts it into the endzone on the first touchdown of the game belongs to the texans and of course theyll take a look at this upstairs it is a scoring play to make sure he came in in bounds here it is if he catches it first of all if you hold on remove none of that stuff looks like it s a good one well if you get to the goal line that s the end zone so that part of it is a touch then the question is did the ground help them control it so that s what theyre looking at upstairs left arm it can touch the ground but if the ground helps you control the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> i dont see anything they can overturn it down he lands right on the goal line right that is i tell you the coverage on that play by <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> was absolutely perfect i cant believe javy even got that <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> in there there was about a threeinch window for that roll made it but confirmed shannon brand for the for horizonte jones to hold it and with four fourteen elections opening hand expects it and the bears of the battle of ypres seven had long lead by seven and then i football the rock you buy subway restaurants deliciously milky those extinct meltzer here by nissan innovation for the day innovation for tomorrow innovation that excites by directv dont just watch tv directv and but one light the official beer better go band here we go scenes last night the second italian from the purple reign regiment celebrate the 237th birthday only for nearby wheeling illinois there are four guys in afghanistan which is a little bit after breakfast and here is a pic that <person player="jt thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jt thomas</person> covers up for chicago so it was just a little squib kick that looked like an onside kick but he s just trying to swimmin keep it away from <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> somehow <person player="jt thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jt thomas</person> as this thing hit him in the gut and he catches it that s a pretty remarkable play for a defensive lineman and is going to give the bears great field position they werent trying onside kick or anything he just made a catch and that gives the bears great field position at the 49 yard line with 412 to go in the half for say crossing this field and then gang tackle like <person player="earl mitchell" race="nonwhite" position="DT">earl mitchell</person> taking the spot of the english shawn cody at nose tackle it will be second down and eight the big difference for me so far in this ballgame is then that <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">arian foster</person> now has 15 rushes for 91 yards and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> has six rushes for about 11 or 12 yards depending on what he gained on that one and the bears are going to have a tough time winning this game if they dont start running it better than that six carries 12 yards for takes wing to the outside and a great tackle is made there mike <person player="connor barwin" race="white" position="DE">connor</person> barwon outside backer stopping into the line of scrimmage would be third down and eight under borrow in that time kept the edge barely working over here on the outside working against matt space almost youre seeing a lot of guys on the edge a little grab here a little grab there but barwon who led this team and sacks a season ago game often made the play numbers right there weve been with a big advantage in yardage the bears have only two first downs in the section says came third and nine is going to step up and he completes the pants but he was across the line of scrimmage but to get old at this is a flag down nestor taken to the five but butler came across the line of scrimmage he was inside the 49 yard line the flag came right out as he threw it and as theyll take a look at the replay at any part of your body even the back of your heel is on the line of scrimmage that s not official of course the red line but if any part of the body is behind the line as he throws the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> when does it come out it s pretty close i think that is a legal mask well theyre going to take a look at this obviously if remember it s not the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> to the big shot at the end of that play and he was very slow to get up but i think that was a legal past if our line is correct well <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tim dobbins</person> was the guy who made the contact here serrator making the pool all right im going to look at the sticks on the far side right over here it looks like it s about in york i tell you why why both teams on the play the legal overtime under six of the offense for forward pass jimmy is also personal top on necessary roughness very head above the quarterback shoulders those penalties will offset the illegal forward pass turn on a simple five all the penalties will offset were third dollars well it s an illegal forward pass go wasnt now that old thing to get lift upside down here yeah and the crowd now sees this and they go wait a minute and it s clearly an illegal hit above the head but remember if that back foot is behind the line it doesnt matter where the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> is it is the point of the body of the quarterback of the passer that is farthest back and if that back foot is behind that line that would be legal exactly so of both legs coming in one for illegal pass together for the contact on <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dobbins</person> until we go back to a third and nine from the 49 yard line sex and effect has been tremendous on third down i was kind of waiting for this challenge yeah youve got lovie smith coming in and saying wait a second we want you to take the office is really an illegal forward pass and beyond the line of three exactly i mean lovey had to get the word from upstairs it s worth a challenge and so if he wins this challenge with the defensive foul the pass would count and chicago is going to wind up with the first down in gold yeah and you tack it on then right so you would end up this is a huge call it s the down market it s officiator showed you that red line there it is wherever it is this line is coming right across there so if that put that bar this foot back is behind or on that line then this play is legal and that s what serrator has to look at to get the red line and forget the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> doesnt matter that back foot is when the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> comes out of his hand at what point and if any part of his foot we have this similar play with eli <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> and the game in philadelphia a couple years ago one of the interesting things does that foot come off the ground before the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> is released if the foot was on the ground i think it was on that red line and would be legal now the question comes in how much of the technology can they use the red line and all that kind of stuff are they going to try and size it up with the down marker on the far side serrator does not have the red line when he s looking at the monitor here comes the cool after review the ruling on the field is confirmed the runner was beyond the line of scrimmage therefore wasnt a little forward chicago will be charged with the first time also have the father now has one chalmers remaining three days well well the red line well you cant use the red line so he had to look at it and it s one of those things where you call it one way on the field and unless you see something to completely overturn it i mean it was close and confirmed was the language in use what he gave us clearly beyond that line from the corns time office apollo please be careful 24 to 25 though it s a two and a half to go in the half play clock will be wound down from 25 and jays still shaking off the cobwebs there is that s the only good thing about that for him is the count it is a bearings back ive heard nine again this time is going wrong for the first annotation <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite"

to recap the opening half on the field and halftime show you soldier filled with columns patriotic covers veterans day well interesting two of the better sacking teams in the league no sack so far in this game maybe the low field is helping these often design two minutes to the half first on wall to 39 yard line tubers punch to the right swing fast to perth a a bit tough ended it jonathan joseph ends up on the left corners it taken down near the line of scrimmage where you talk to the chicago bears and <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> about jonathan joseph and they think he is one of the top three quarterbacks in the league yet a little bit of an injury groin injury earlier this year had a couple of bad games back to back but they say joseph is fully healthy now and he is the man the night on <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> audrey vincentian in the canary as a free agent last year in houston second and 10 second award rock in traction with the interception chicago bears have just turned the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> over for the fourth time in the hand dumpling throwing his second pick and theyve lost bubbles booth dukedom on this one came across in motion it looked like it was going to be main coverage but then kreme <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> fell off and made this play when kreme <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> came all the way across the field with that motion <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> read that is mantoman it would have been an easy completion never saw <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem jackson</person> so six turnovers in the game for by chicago theyve gone half a season would close one and a half a game enough for in the first 30 minutes over 28 job going to work and that s <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnson</person> and the pass is incomplete didnt hang on <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> is right there second and 10 rain coming and going pretty good play by <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> we talked about him punching the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> out watch him come around the backside here and knock that one free this is a clever guy the coaches that you talked to lovie smith he s the great master teaching him turnovers he said i had never ever seen god more talented to punch the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> during 15 years dont know <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> making sure that <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> is stuff the bears have two timeouts we want to spend one here and they will it s going to be third down and 20 timeout chicago <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> blew this up and then <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> cleaned it up <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> takes his guy straight back out the cooling guard got his tackle and for her locker all you had to do is just come in there and take care of business inside pulled off the pulling center trying to get around the outside nice play by <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> the alltime leading factors in the national football league that came in the lead over a hundred sacks one of those players when you talk to lumpy smith these that i school cant believe we got <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> i cant believe we got <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> i cant believe we got <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> we got all three and were a heck of a team now because the <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> came a couple years ago bring north orientation and as a backup quarterback we 13:19 and that s what got me to take another turn around <person player="eric weems" race="nonwhite" position="WR">eric</person> walker 14 59 seconds chicago will go to work when they get the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> back without a timeout now got to decide he kick it to that guy did not he had a 44yard punt return last week in the game always dangerous sitting just one away from tying the record of all time returns well he had 11 of those touchdown returns in the first two years then he was blank annoying no 9 then he had 6 and 10 and 11 nothing so far this year i can tell you where i kicked his <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> i dont know bound they can score my defense has been playing great the weather is awful and not given <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> those eyes that have been the way hell angle it to the near side the short dick we fear caught at the 31 yard line by 51 seconds no time outs and a flag on the play cant believe that the bears had the gunner doubleteam and the guy made him make a furnace hit holding number 37 of the return to 10yard penalty from the end of the kick first down staccato and then seeing if any wall turd and that s going to back up to the 21 or five there we go there s on that side grab the jersey they dont miss it in this league then on this side is kate and it s going to force <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> to make a fair catch youve got a doubleteam on one guy on the outside and you cant hold him up that s that s not good counter from the gun at the 21yard line the take off again and pop over the big games flying over the 40 yard line so that s a theme of 19 yards of spotted at the 40 clock running down crowd getting anchors wasted a lot of time here finally snap it at 27 over the middle of trot felling <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">davis</person> a lot of problems design in the crosshairs to the locking issues and then he drops one here he fumbles earlier second and ten now with some of the past protection issues that <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">kellen davis</person> has had and he had a rough day just like <person player="gabe carimi" race="UNK" position="OT">gabe</person> <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem</person> he did the other day you better hang on to football if youre going to stay in the lineup cords greg olson no longer around <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> has won four more yards in these past four 37 to 35th and a half second and ten perfection and then that is rock that s <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> going feet down field and it will be third down and 10 id say if this is the better throw this might be a touchdown thrown behind <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> you ran right by clover quinn and there really was no body in the middle of the field the safeties that split wide if that one gets caught in stride from <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> might have been a touchdown third and ten is main man <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> bottom of the screen to the right dose of staying with it something looks left it was a very short pass it <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> mr nothing roll what dents makes the tackle and the chicago bears will just regroup and going to the locker room so the first half turnovers for the pike chicago it s 10 to 3 at the break coming up after these messages from your nbc around here piss off him jenny and this is fittings again who tonight eat for the season throw it walk for a touchdown by thunder and a rainy night drags out it is 10 to 3 used it at the break and let s go right to michelle well i just flipped a lovely smith coming out of the locker room at halftime <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">alan</person> i asked him about <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> who took a ferocious hit late in that first half and i said is <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay</person> okay after that hit and he said no he s not he has not come out of the locker and he tells me <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> is going to go ahead and play and now were hearing that it is a concussion that s the official diagnosis today last kind of concussion in the 2010 season he said that was his first and other reports saying he had them in college but so now he s out on the field and <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> will take over for starters all right thank you michelle and <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> is a guy that they went after because last year remember they were done in after <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> got hurt he broke his stomach in san diego they were seven and three caleb hanie could not do the job the very same day so they went out and they got camber <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> will run the kickback and it drifts up at the 24 yard line and so <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> will come in <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> is 30 years old the redskins drafted him in oh 5 and he was going to be you know there s everybody in washington always is the new quarterback you know the new sonny jurgensen he was there through all nine then he was the raiders quarterback and he got hurt there and lost a job and they made the trade to carson palmer so he s on the market and the bears wind up with him and here he goes in the second half 70 career starts with ton of experience takes over the 23 yard line and they start conservative rule with a nice day this time by <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> for a gain of 7 first half numbers houston a great rushing attack the turnovers of course are huge with chicago coughing it up four times but the rushing game <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> with 85 yards and theyve been limiting the chicago rushing game for day only 18 residents the one significant difference green a table s been in three games this season really doc and has thrown one pass here goes <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> a good start for chicago here they pick up a first down if he tugs his way out to the 39 yard line only the fifth first out of the night for the bears the one thing that the bears are getting now are theyre getting some movement on these double teams inside this was the plan coming in and now maybe because <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> is playing quarterback who s only thrown one pass all season they get back to what this game probably called for from the beginning big guys they felt like they were bigger and stronger on their offensive line and theyre getting after it now renamed from the 38 yard line all four days number again is grady james with longtime dallas cowboy you play dillon phillips s with head coach thompson now because you have two tight ends in the game and to pull back you end up with only three defensive backs on the field so basically <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips and alright <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> you want to throw it there you go im going to take one of my dbs off the field im not going to let you just turn around and hand the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> off to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> and b which is 4 db down before you second and nine in the second pasture the season is the marshal on the outside but joseph is right there and again that field which is tough under any conditions particularly tough tonight and particularly on the outside ive seen a lot of games here and it looks like they resaw the inside part of the field but this outside part when it gets wet watch <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> try and make a cut here you see it all the time ive seen about four guys fall down already in this game and you just wonder it s something different you wonder at some point as they slip and fall by a defensive back going to end up deciding this game if your vegetable garden isnt first i know you want no part of it in fact third and six and that is <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> it s three down the left side for a big gain in the first down of the 41 yard line of detection good move that time by <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> he s been running a lot of slants he s going to sell it on joseph this time watch him fake in and then back outside and quentin dimps cant get there one of the big matchups in this game gave karimi against his old college teammate and i tell you <person player="gabe carimi" race="UNK" position="OT">gabe</person> karimi has come back in a big way this game after a poor performance last week gain of 18 real opening drive for the bears or say second in law well that was one of the few times that they didnt get in behind that doubleteam i tell you the doubleteam though by <person player="gabe carimi" race="UNK" position="OT">gabe</person> curry me and lance lewis is getting big movement theyre moving the defensive tackles a good four or five yards backwards that time they just didnt catch up with the scraping linebacker but they are getting movement from those two guys on the right side three names second example a bank structure put on back has gotten away but for the very minimal gain if any match fee they can attach and dobyns with the tackle you just have to love the job that <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tim dobbins</person> has done coming in a special teams captain a guy that they really didnt expect to play much linebacker and then <person player="brian cushing" race="white" position="LB">brian cushing</person> got her he is such a superstar great coverage linebacker <person player="darryl sharpton" race="UNK" position="LB">darryl sharpton</person> was supposed to be the guy that is going to take over for damico ryan yet here it is <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tim dobbins</person> playing with one loss and he s a big reason why that if he s active in its season started pushing out a different role third down and ten and over the middle two short passes <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> escapes for the moment and then he picks up about four extra yard and he still five yards shy of the first down so the beers of course in the offseason priority one was to get a peak time wide receiver deep did and then other priorities including getting that backup quarterback and these is that in shambles but here is <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> right now who <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> was thrilled to be reunited with 21 grabs in a single game the most patches in nfl history when i was playing with denver <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> whether it was well those guys they didnt know if he was going to come to practice you know play hard enough now he gets here and hardest workers away with putting back for my putt and it will be down by <person player="eric weems" race="nonwhite" position="WR">weems</person> at the 3 yard line that will back to houston of the defections abilene so it is to jump the texans won touchdown drive of the first half team when they got their stretch play going the bears were trying to crash their defensive end down inside <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">arian foster</person> took advantage bounced a couple of them to the outside got a few good ones the bears that made the adjustment as there is outside and <person player="justin forsett" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin forsett</person> adjusted back inside a great block by <person player="chris myers" race="white" position="OG">chris myers</person> and that was how they marched it down for theyre only testing at let s see how the second half chess game develops complete because case by <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> coming in on the corner blitz rain coming down a little bit carter now second down and ten <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> having a big night here coming up oh sorry about that coming all the way across this way here safe that thing all the way across the field and of course anytime youre going out of your own endzone be careful any kind of holding <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> or anything like that in the end of the season will be the lead second oh doctor might even be a loss of real going to be third and long let s go to michelle harris who vi told me at math im al matt shaw you know the first half ariella the weather s going to get worse if look at the radar and the secretary s going to drop about as good as it s going to be probably the rest of through the middle was stopped in at the 17yard line so they do give some room that <person player="donnie jones" race="white" position="P">donnie jones</person> for his forthcoming fun just remember that prior drive by the bears <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> comes in the game they get a couple of nice runs for <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> they take it about 30 40 yards on it down to the two yard line now the field position very much in the bears favor this is the way theyve won game and a lot of it has to do with guys like <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> returned addiction specialty but not this time it s perfect and theyre looking for room but not under these conditions bass easier to knock them out of bound and so <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> will take over the 755 left in the third and three for <person player="jonathan weeks" race="UNK" position="C">weeks</person> the pressure is been building wednesday an allnew chicago fire finally written to explode chicago fire wednesday here on it bc and there s a look at the set they do a lot of the shooting right here in the windy city that s the <person player="chris spencer" race="nonwhite" position="C">spencer</person> taylor kinney couple of stars from chicago fire in the stands here tonight watching the bears private flying back with backup quarterback <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> who will have to play the rest of the way because <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> was diagnosed with the concussion that s <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> for gain of one second and nine now by <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips defense weve been talking about the bears a lot texas defense number one and third down conversions number one and three and out only allowed one 80yard drive all season only allowed one 20yard run all season until they can make some plays down the field they are going to bleed off against this running game they are all stacked up there now exactly that it s the ground incomplete <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> was there the intended receiver to return and mine to the bear you know one of the problems the barriers have had all season long i was talking to mike tyson at it they are last in the nfl on first down production they have just been in too many of these second and tens and third and tens and i dont care who you are especially up front with an offensive line that s still sort of developing and finding themselves this is a tough spot now here comes <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> on tomorrow and all these guys third and nine in a steady rain table whoops dives forward through the 45 yard line to go hunt the punt that s <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tim dobbins</person> making the tackle itll be fourth and four right over here <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> is going to help on the outside which is going to allow creamy to come back and help on <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj watt</person> notorious not only for getting sacked but for getting his hands up and knocking balls down random or josie i know im covered just go straight up here i promise yall go get it offices third punt of the game marks making a fair catch at the 15 yard line and job into detention offense back on the beale with six 30 left in the third sunday night is football night from chicago we take our active pittsburgh next week it s baltimore and pittsburgh the ravens and the steelers football night gets esparta dat 70 the ravens in the ceilings of course have become one of the great rivalries in the nfl next edition of sunday night on nbc the strike starts with an <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">arian foster</person> pickup of about a yard second down max shop you know you think about that 2004 draft and you know about eli <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> and you know about philip rivers and you know about ben roethlisberger what job was also picking that draft and he was going to backup michael vick in atlanta and that s how he started and then he got the trade to houston and now at the age of 31 led the nfl in passing yardage you know nine got up into playoff position last year and that broke his foot who was on the sidelines during the play behind <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre johnson</person> zhilie third down and nine but he s about as good a <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> handler as the liver secret yeah and the interesting part about him is he s not a runner at all weve had one rush for positive yards this year for two yards and yet when you look at his numbers outside the pocket there were more numbers after contact when you think maybe a mike vick or a scrambler kind of guy might have the best funders this guy is been sensational so while he s not a that is going to move around one because find ways to make them work in a hot climate college football virginia a tennis court but not boring first down we just haven is right there the tackle <person player="kevin walter" race="white" position="WR">kevin</person> walker though to report down and intersections with punt again leah <person player="kelvin hayden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelvin</person> ages come in and won this nickelback job there s been a good competition there with ej more mcelveen <person player="kelvin hayden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hayden</person> the former quote along with ken <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> the former pope and come over here made a big difference in this fair secondary and is joan got off the meeting for his own endzone puppet a minute ago and inside that kick is off the sign of his foot and chicago is gonna be set up at the 48 yard line he went to our food by gaudÃ­ young with chicago s near 50 with a bookworm great thing they do here in chicago at every game the honor of veteran and heir is lieutenant robert fash senior being honored on veterans 1892 naval aviator veteran of world war through 58 combat missions in the pacific in 1944 shot down six enemy planes got a tremendous ovation and there in afghanistan they are saluting from the far away one robert facts seniors oil boy arent many of those treasures left are there from world war two the greatest generation a great tribute to him and the bears do that theyve done it every home game over the last four and a half years printed up chicago starts this far from the 48 yard line with <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> taking the missed field right itll be second down and 2 or a little over five minutes to play in the third quarter on these teams going to 8 and 1 when this one s done <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj</person> right over here theyre just trying to get the double team going and actually doing a good job on that the problem is <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips keeps playing only three defensive backs so there s an extra linebacker in there that they have to block so lovey at some point is probably going to have to start throwing the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> on first and because that s the opportunity second and eight now out of a gun that wicked before the action commences dean stewart or only the call here false start offense number 62 fiveyard penalty second down the bears have done a pretty good job on walk tonight because we havent mentioned his name all that much that a tremendous season grew up in milwaukee wisconsin which is less than two hours from here just outside of milwaukee talking about soldier field said you ever come to a bears game nope you can go to any football games nope should this would be the first time ive ever set foot at soldier field hey ally start on the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> to mount hope everybody have their best shot second 13 theyre going to go at the train yard line a beautiful fast harborage was pretty tight and it s 45yard grand marshals on affection either jonathan jokes about the outside marshal not a real feature but he does this beautifully he goes up and gets the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> how many times this year have you seen it as a bears fan the bears doing absolutely nothing cant get it going and then in the second half a game that s <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> we just paid for well waiting at the 10 bus and first and goal for <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> we get to that and sadistic second and goal from the 5yard line and we were talking to <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> and <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> blow then brandon was really frustrated early into here because he was didnt doubled a lot a lot of to safety looks and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> just kept saying be patient be patient then that defense would make a play they get some single coverage it seemed like the second half is that these numbers really start to take off second goal waning about as far as you have another point take you back the state the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> carrier taken down at the 5yard line it s <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj</person> want right there big number 99 filling up a third and goal it s just so tough to contain that big guy his quickness is just overwhelming you just jumped around gave three beyond now and ive seen him do this on some plays you know it looks like youre going to have to go inside to beat them and he jumps all the way around the island speaking to the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> fair third and goal is trying to find from a limit them to a field goal effect favor throwing on the rod and nobody is open <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">earl bennett</person> was there but he was well covered and must on fourth down in comes <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> and company <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> right there in the middle theyve got it overloaded then it s completely covered marshalls completely covered <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> had to stay in and help lock there s no other options for <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> so despite giving up the one big play phillips defense your job again an old 24yard attempt for gold and once 45yard reception that double 3pointers to make it a fourpoint 155 in chicago standings right now in the nfc north chicago seven and one so they go to eat one or seven and to green bay off today they play detroit next week minnesota beat detroit today and then in the afc south look at this i mean houston seven and one you think theyre going to run away with everything but the colts is six and three tennessee wins today and houston and indianapolis have not met yet meaning they got two games to face each other at the end of the season so anyway last three now the green bay packers be voted it stings you know and theyre sitting there at 63 and but this season will be decided without the green bay packers having a little say so and theyve got a few injuries to deal with now leigh matthews with a hamstring had to leave the game the other day and weve got a few issues there is a texans on office three announces start the second half they need to get a little something going a green bay got a rolling in houston on sunday night about a month ago aaron rodgers walked in and he said hey outside the style is long inside were good fine we would have to six touchdown passes off weve done john <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> with a bigtime run back and marked with a flag down for the moment has taken it to the 46 yard line in chicago but and you see a flag on a return 99 and 44 100% of the time walk in the back or hold boy this on the return team such an issue for the texans this year they are the worst team as far as field position when it comes to kickoff returns going to return holding return to turn yard penalty first down houston and sunday night football from chicago being run by geico 15 minutes could save you 50% on car insurance like

race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> and <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> beat the texans to the punch on this play <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> goes and cuts it off and <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> comes in behind leave those two guys right lightly theyve been visiting each other in the whole thing they put 125 games together and schoville throw i open is <person player="evan rodriguez" race="UNK" position="RB">evan</person> walter who makes the cactus gives them a lot of breathing room packing by chris <person player="christopher conte" race="UNK" position="DB">conte</person> that s a gain of 23 yards this time it s <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> he s going to slip and fall outside those numbers again it s just a treacherous area you drive them all and make a cut just wonder because there s defensive backs if you fall down it s a touchdown so they have to play off in that time able to take advantage only six passes flipped by wide outs four by <person player="andre johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnson</person> but the second four will be first down at the 32 final half minute of the period the officer to the outside able to break an ankle tackle and pick up about eight yards before he sports down by <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right this is a staple clay for use in this double crack back coming in here on the outside they end up pulling the tackle derrick <person player="derek newton" race="UNK" position="OT">newton</person> out in front of it and it seems like it goes for about ten yards every single time they run that play they put me outside tight in and motion bring them down and it has worked consistently for them and the texans will let the clock run out so well go to the fourth quarter the score is houston 10 chicago six sunday night football for chicago back after these messages aerial coverage from the beautiful city of chicago brought to you by geico again we beat that on a friday night when it was clear a flame around it tonight now michaels cris collinsworth and without the foia so the field 15 regulation minutes remaining at second and three 39 yard line for the houston texans and going at the line of scrimmage in chicago doing a good job on <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> after he had a great first half and he bottles them up in the second college making was some really guys that right inside right there is <person player="nate collins" race="UNK" position="DT">nate collins</person> and he s a young man that comes in but last week when i was watching the tape i kept going who is number 93 this <person player="nate collins" race="UNK" position="DT">nate collins</person> and he s a guy that brought in from that dream it was some snaps but more and more now he s impressing the likes of <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> he says hey you tell him again again that guy gets in the gap and he s not moving theyre here in the muffin play clock about to expire saab has to spend houston s version haha so im up for ten six the weather conditions of course playing a very big part of the game six turnovers in the game but these two teams you know can always say it s a super bowl preview who knows there s too much to go between now and then each of these teams seven and one you look at used to though they win this game and as you go down the stretch theyve already defeated baltimore s they would on the tiebreak over them and denver as well so theyre in good shape in their conference well the thing that i like to see is the way they play because the people play defense youre going to be in games and produce them to come on the road in this kind of environment the rain when the coal i think it wins this kind of game you certainly would feel a lot better about going over the team is good at the south because with the new clothes we get hairy at the 30yard line that will be the first act of the game for either human <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> and <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry melton</person> right and here two of the most athletic guys youll see they move him inside <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry melton</person> was a punt returner at texas he scored 10 touchdowns as a running back and now he s playing defensive tackle you can imagine what it s like trying to block that big guy inside it can fester the railway over the sod without much distance on that negation of chicago bounce back to the 30yard launcher there by jones a 31yard youre just picking us up <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> sustained a concussion at the end of the first half so he hasnt done <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> is now the quarterback here was the play that did <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay</person> in the shot that resulted in the penalty by him <person player="tim dobbins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dobbins</person> <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> was able to finish the half of the wood and a half time and that was the end of his knee <person player="michael bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">michael bush</person> is going to running back as we start this series from the 38 yard game with 40 to 41 men marching it s a nice move jen is close to a first down tackle by clover quinn you just get that big guy the bald i love what love you smiths dubrow <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> is that the chicago bears deserve to have a receiver like that in other words being a big hall physicals long just going to overwhelm guys going up the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> at the chicago bears receiver second this is what and i can point to the 33 dont push another guy from oakland evil from oakland the teeth backups that results in the 20 yard game there s the doubleteam weve been talking about and then it s <person player="evan rodriguez" race="UNK" position="RB">evan rodriguez</person> coming through and cleaning up on brady james but that was the same play that he fumbled on earlier when he picked up a first down this time hangs on 33 yards and push again the 30yard line stop there by <person player="earl mitchell" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mitchell</person> going to set up a second down and six for the bears same exact play double team here pull backs going to block there same play until you stop it are you going to keep seeing it id say a <person player="michael bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">michael bush</person> is the big guy he was the leading rusher for the oakland raiders a year ago almost a thousand yards and i think it s going downhill at two you know second and six three in from playing with joseph almost got it off the deflection the tale of two halves here used in the big advantage statistically in the first day here in the second half chicago 129 yards and houston 32 watch <person player="connor barwin" race="white" position="DE">connor</person> bar went on this one this was a guy who is one of those workout freaks his vertical jump all his speed stuff at the combine just blew everybody away came in was the leading sacker produced in last year sort of taken over for mario williams i was out there already sick from the 30 blitz coming able getaway complete marks over there god wants a flag there is none jonathan joseph with the coverage in its fourth down the same day <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> it s not the pensioners that been enough with this tried to push me off he grabbed him back this graph look like the back of his collar and yanked him right back to him and made the plays that all right you guys arent going to call anything im host first plane just like <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> robi goal despite his convictions maybe 51 yarder earlier also for only for this one from 48 to trying to make it a onepoint game that s just punched rogatica right there nextly up right a little bit of a hook on it breezy of course here in chicago and stings a four point game sunday night football broncos ive arrived in now more than ever freud does by walmart walmart has low price guarantee backed by and by we only make one thing with ultimate driving machine and by mcdonald s im lovin it soldier field on doughboy sculptures resetting the south of first down close and mechanical day for a very like <person player="garrett graham" race="UNK" position="TE">garrett</person> ran back to hunt again houston playing without its numberone sighting tonight <person player="owen daniels" race="white" position="TE">owen daniels</person> just arent many things that you can throw it <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> they havent seen <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">jj</person> what s pretty good himself the guy that s making a name for himself probably the defensive player of the year in the first half of the season it s in that shop now the first down central role permits <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> who has to interception site breaking it up okay this <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> making an impression eight interception to lead the nfl areas on the outside whether it s off the <person player="kevin walter" race="white" position="WR">kevin walter</person> and both of these teams have the same situation they have one receiver that they want to throw to all the time somebody else could step up to make plays that get stranded third and seven drock would have had the first down graham at the 49yard line team hang on 4,000 grams going to be working against <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> who gets there just in time that s the second time the night <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> has been closed and just unable to get there where s <person player="owen daniels" race="white" position="TE">owen</person> daniel is not there and probably would have had that my dad has blown his last two punts up in bunker s faster at the 11yard swinging the outside not on this field on this night back oh boy would be merciless at the 1441 for every point scored during the nfl s salute to service games the league will donate $1 to youtube moffat partnered joined and learn more at nflcom slash salute an exhibit of dog tags and the national veterans art museum here in chicago and it gives you some idea the number of people who serve this country doesnt you bet created something like that before a 15yard line they begin this drive with a fork a game of about four well here s what the bears have done really well on offense and it hasnt been a lot but the two guys inside carini and lewis with their doubleteam and <person player="evan rodriguez" race="UNK" position="RB">evan rodriguez</person> coming in there is the fullback and cleaning up but that has been their strength and that was what they thought they might be able to do in this game it s been effective got a stay with it the problem is you have one bad play in that sequence and he does very far as in the orthoptera in a few hands until the origin reversing yardage ten minutes to play on second down and five mabel <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> ii the plank that goes through first half like i know the offensive back field behind the quarterback jeans territory indicates a hold it s over holding bank offense number 62 <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry</person> at half the distance to the goal replay second down seller rochelle is the gourd holding until your snitch going to make a little inside move here and each other a shell has to grab hold and is caught but here we go again we were talking about they had a good run on first down and plead to pass on second but now youre backed up and now you have to be careful because wait till it s open the playbook a little bit at this point and probably comes after your quarterback three days you can great riches more than you believe that is max fate taking it out to the 15yard line that s going to make it third down and nine well gave <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem</person> he has really bounced back in this game he s getting some help here from <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> but creamy is more than holding his own he struggled last week tonight probably the field helping him out a little bit but that was perfect pass protection across the board you cant blame what s happened tonight on the past potential further than nine we sit down under nine minutes they sent four stays they go five why here with a wide left <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> comes out of the slot the back mr <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> and joseph comes up from the secondary rotating to cover and complete not even close with a nine not sure that would have been anything anyway and theyre almost like maybe the bears are waiting on their defense to win the football game not wanting to take many chances but your chances are about the fade away here with one left odd what s the fun certain page yards for food tonight not particularly good going out of bounds that about mid field with a 34 remaining 36 yards how about them finding irish coming up on nbc saturday afternoon notre dame number 3 unbeaten no against wake forest pirates got a lot their victory left side and boston college ucs state to state 1 oregon 2 the irish or alabama it s about texas a&amp;m yesterday from the 47 yard line it s a fiveyard pickup to start disk drive for aryan fourth years so what are the beer need the night well they probably need a defensive score since o4 lovely schmitz a fifth of the bears touchdowns have been scored by the special teams or by the defense highest percentage in the league and the rest of the league averages 9% lowest number on love you smith like 17 more takeaways than any other team at least and he s taken over as the coach of the bears and you think weather like this could be a perfect game for them but they just drink it in secondary and five uses dumblooking offensively in this hat until now it s wall street 50 to the 40 yard line a flag is down at the end of the play in the texans roll signaling a civilian chicago like a facemask on the tail end of that one from <person player="corey wootton" race="UNK" position="DE">corey</person> wooten personal foul place left defensive 98 15yard penalty either via the run first out exactly what it is it s going to put them already into field goal range here comes the facemask little wraparound no doubt about it on the backside usually when you see a big run from the texans it s because somebody is on the ground on the backside right there dwane brown getting <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry melton</person> knocked off his feet these guys are nasty this offensive line go youre going to come in ready to play it was great and protect your knees because on the backside very stretchy theyre going after toss them out over 100 yards 106 25 franzine at kenwyn open making the tackle okay this <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry melton</person> is something he is athletic as any defensive tackle youll see we talked about evil running back at texas if you some idea what kind of athlete he was this jumps over youre trying cut that guy and more often than not just end up picking dirt on your face path we have all the junk guys i think of tommy harris back in the day when the factor he was before you got very 1yard loss second and 11 for me outside who flags in fact both at the 30yard line or even i could see ya there <person player="derek newton" race="UNK" position="OT">newton</person> on hold there they needed it to from the bear standpoint right tackle ax it s going to get them back out of field goal range holding offense number 75 10yard penalty we pretty second down the secondyear guy from arkansas state <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> and <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> going over things on the chicago sideline and we lock down a 639 left in the court pretty interesting time now against any other defense you probably open it up and throw the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> against this defense youre winning your defense is dominating do you take a chance here to try and get this thing in field goal range against the bears defensive scores for the economically woman sobs an employer with short underneath to the 35yard line that <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> making the catch <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> making the tackle line of scrimmage will be the 35 they havent done it a lot tonight but the bears oftentimes will end up playing man coverage and just rushing for and just let all roam free in the middle fields they did that last week in a game merle acker came up with about a 40 the prank that game 1 the third in nineteen and job who s gonna were time not every takes all of the time off the play clock on the game clock wives is love sidewalk apron im out here 33 to my house and that s their second of the bears off to an ugly start tonight daniel <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> forcing the fumble right off the bat man gets involved again the clover when involved here intercepted by <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> and last turnover was <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kareem jackson</person> with effective four turnovers in the first half you can make two but none for either team here the second half okay let s just talk strategy for a minute here because i dont think the texans are going to take a big chance here and if they dont gain about five or six yards they may not attempt a field goal either mrs munsif in town now under the beers without the touchdown the b demand for american who s trying the durability 53yard field or beneath conditions and give the bear to shore the field third and nineteen and that is caught and taken to the 24 yard lines and now youre in very makable field goal range as <person player="jared crick" race="UNK" position="DE">jared</person> graham picks up some very valuable yardage 11 yard so instead of maybe a short punt now youve got a field goal attempt to try to make it a 7 point game let s go to michelle well shane gran will be kicking into the wind one thing he told me was there was a concern was with the field and so he might shorten these approach a little bit although doesnt look like he s going to that wind going across the field from the houston side light of the bears all right michelle it s a 42yard attempt <person player="donnie jones" race="white" position="P">donnie</person> going his beholders good so is the placement and the kick is good so a big 11yard gain puts them in position to make it a 7 point lead 13 to 6 with 449 level i tell you there was a significant part of that last play to <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> had a chance to tackle <person player="garrett graham" race="UNK" position="TE">garrett graham</person> for about a 5 yard gain he let him slip away and pick up another six yards that would have been a much more difficult decision to make at early lacquer made a clean tackle on our go back and look at this absolutely if he holds them to a five or six yard gain as he could right here you just dont see <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> missed that tackle very often and because of that there is another four or five yards added on to it allowed for that field goal to be attempted and ultimately made and now have to have a touchdown it will never know but it with kubiak a 42 yarder yeah you send the guy out a 47yard probably money you know probably fine but either way they were going to have to have a touchdown so here we go and there he goes a long time for <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin</person> asked about the middle last year since he s returned one for a touchdown well some wacky looking pick off some gram we try to bounce it down there go for the touchback ive been bouncing again the outside becomes forced to run out of room to the 25yard line and he s taken down there by putting deaf most of the game that hit on <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> golden duchin he was out nice job tonight in the conditions with 95 yards <person player="arian foster" race="nonwhite" position="RB">foster</person> is 11th straight game with a touchdown and it s 104 detection to the roller engaged with duck confit or turnovers all in the first half and a chicago down by 7 with <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> with the hill start this drive from the 25yard line oh lucky that wasnt fiction does that one was quick a little bit of pick6 first down lit that time i loved her quinn right off the edge here and <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> had to get rid of it but danielle <person player="danieal manning" race="nonwhite" position="DB">manning</person> almost cooked that one in and boy wouldnt he have loved to have done that he s already made two huge plays in the game and almost ended this massive family for <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bennett</person> almost every pass tonight theyve thrown intended courtmartial his foot seven and chicago s 14 completions the suspension for camp then the secondary did this work and he s forced to throw underneath of the crowd doesnt like it match speed the protection was perfect out and he missed an opportunity at <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> down the field here cream <person player="kareem jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> is going to fall down on the coverage or get knocked down and he still had time there was nobody around <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> he had time to read this one out he did not have to check this one down they had their opportunity for the first down on that play set the battle loss of one it s third down and 11 going to six the function fast for mega <person player="jj watt" race="UNK" position="DE">watt</person> engine step about row and complete that ellen <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">davis</person> going up court trying to make the jacks and he has been in the crosshairs of the bluebirds now in chicago for about a month poor town it would have been a little better throw but this is definitely one that youve got to make a play on in this part of the game seems sort of play that they had <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> open on in the first half they didnt make that play and they didnt make this one when they go back and watch the tape two throws down the middle very easy completions they miss them both and it may end up costing on the difference the back of his helmet these medical attention gets booed off the field chicago theyre a little tight in productivity greg olson left town adam public twoputt now with he s john <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> back no liner down at the 33 yard line 335 remaining and job trying to go to work on the clock meanwhile we head to pittsburgh next week davell one of the great rivalries in the nfl every time the ravens and the steelers get together as the action team beginning football night america beginning at 7 oclock eastern 4:00 pacific for more 7 do routing hopefully today it s 4 5 and 3 how about this we can explain four cities in pittsburgh tomorrow night cincinnati with a big win over the giants to get the four and five now the section of the 32 think about using sign on the side twominute break a squatcher gets taken down by moment in time is when pick them out and round theyve got about a hundred defenders in here right and here just going to split the gap stay on his feet and make it compact field offensive linemen arent used to having to deal with that kind of quickness and that kind of athleticism interesting of kosis can go two ways here that sort of like tom coughlin would love to take his time us on this side of the twominute warning maybe at this point the love is missed and elec to take the proper exam you goes faster esophagus ticking down to the 30yard line and now chicago will spend the first of its timeout you just wonder if maybe in the back of his mind with the fact that <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> is in there and maybe he hasnt had the kind of experience and practice with that twominute offense that <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> would have he wants to preserve at least one for when they get the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> back assuming they do well they still have to plus the twominute warning so imperative to make the stop here with third and 13 upcoming if the texans come in here and play fair football and that s what this has been ugly raining nasty weather playoff feeling kind of football game you come in here and there win against the 71 bears and pretty darn good about yourself lied home yeah im flying home to meet jacksonville next sunday there s that go to san francisco next monday third and 13 nothing else on the chicago used another timeout so they have one plus the twominute warning and theyll get the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> back after a punt <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> and plain brown going at it all night here <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> just about his athletic as anybody youll see playing that defense of in position <person player="jared crick" race="UNK" position="DE">jared</person> <person player="armando allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> there s marcus where youre only two guys ahead of them on the sack lift and he s come in when all around in the exit <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> is back the bears trying to set up it s not going to happen but it s not a very good pick either because were going to spot that one out of bounds at the 37 yard line only a 32 yard kick with 235 left one timeout and the twominute warning as table goes to work tonight theyve thrown to <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> a dozen times and you add up everybody else and it comes out to 8 plus 6 is 14 that s the guy they need to go back to the one place there s been a hole on this defense is right down the middle they just missed an opportunity to get the <person player="alan ball" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ball</person> to cal and <person player="kellen davis" race="white" position="TE">davis</person> they miss one to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> youre getting those split safeties on the back end the one vulnerable spot theyve had tonight has been right between ash and three more on that with 17 to the other guys and 12 tomorrow first and ten from the 38th birthday and who have taken then immediately by darwin and keith get out of bands either well tomorrow one is going to follow him everywhere which he is that it takes your shot now as to that point in the game rattle <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bennett</person> write down the theme there with a chance second and 12 to the outside and that s going to be with a flag down thought by <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> to the 42 regardless of the penalty call here were at the twominute warning after the announcement by starett or holding off press number 72 and your penalty replay second down d karim here the twominute warning up second at 23 when we come back for ranger gago the texans up right after the game it s the wendy s postgame report michelle on the field with the stars of the game bostonian michael break it down look at league news as well and look ahead to next week s game between baltimore and pittsburgh it is second and 23 into the holding or mantle <person player="eric weems" race="nonwhite" position="WR">eric</person> <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> checks it off underneath short game caught by <person player="kyle adams" race="UNK" position="TE">kyle adams</person> so it s going to be third and 16 now bears have one timeout and obviously in a situation where they go for it on fourth in got to take the shot eventually go to mark julie over the middle career on an outside wheel goes out of the forties who have comes down to this for chicago it s going to be fourth down and me gamble without the huddle he s got <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> going to the left side he s got pester to the right side is the fennec in this rocket away precious seconds ticking off down to a minute and the fashion senator <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> is incomplete surrounded by your <person player="cody white" race="UNK" position="OG">white</person> shirts on the beers four hands up saying where s the pool and there is none and with a minute to go wait philip starts to get some high fives these detentions are going to go to 8 &amp; 1 conor barwon is going to pick this up coming all the way across the field here a little contact there it was initiated as much by four days it was borrowing no call not a great night offensively for the chicago bears and for <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips brilliant absolutely brilliant well all we want to say about the bears defense it was <person player="wade smith" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wade</person> phillips defense tonight they got it done he is just on a magnificent job hanging over gary kubiak brought it in in the 2011 season after the texans had huge problems defensively revamp it as well member they get rid of guys like mario williams and damico ryan s and he loses pushing and he comes into chicago he limits the bears to a pair of field goals they go home to meet jacksonville next week and if the season ended today saying going over the super bowl on the afc side would go to goofy i tell you or big question for the struggle bears and that with <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> be around because the backup quarterback thing the bears is just not working out caleb hanie and now <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> not getting production <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> s not in there other thing with the works to their benefit is to get the extra day since theyve got the monday night game next week in san francisco so this one is over outofwork of ours with it didnt figure to be under these conditions with the rain and the wind and over the rest of the texans go homer the way 13 to 6 the wendy s post
