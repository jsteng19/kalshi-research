quarterback pull the ball down from and off the stasi gang tackled on the confi the pedal i back the first to get to him so <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> goes free it is so important i think for the rams to really bring the energy early just one and coming off the short week and monday night was a very physical demanding divisional game they practice without the pads this week youre going to look at brian schott and ever there theyre out fifth corner theyve changed up the schedule and it allowed the players on thursday want to make sure the fresh remember now the titans are coming off by buying hot second down and seven y action the well see on the tackle for a loss of two welder okay she s going to do a nice job he s on the back side and it just feels clements the whole way he s going to come off and he s able to make this tackle at around a line of scrimmage but <person player="jurrell casey" race="UNK" position="DT">casey</person> has really played well this year for the titans inside richard that game under and ive seen the ball for only 30 play st louis four seven one five reigns had a 38 pennants i totally regret piano in bahamas for the winner i was able to complete right close to the marker <person player="brian quick" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brian quick</person> secondyear player at an appalachian state making his tenth catch of the season picked up nine and it is a purcell mr secret brick he s going to work across the formation he s running a little shallower out it was a nice job after he catches it trying to get trying to get that first down be nice to get it to him a little bit earlier to get him into the transition of the run first out of midfield for the rams is <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> what a second effort lies that stacey and bert on collard finally was able to get them to the ground well i really like <person player="zach brown" race="nonwhite" position="LB">zach</person> <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> and this guy runs hard he thinks many of his yards come after initial contact and if it s not there i like the fact that he gets what he can get he s going to smash it up inside and take that two or three yards another first down for st louis next <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> at vanderbilt set career records for rushing yards touchdowns rams traded up to branch <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> in the 5th round first after st louis at the tennessee 40 yard line and here s <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> again so comfortable obviously runs very low to the ground and fine for me and he can get lost behind that big offensive line but it was interesting just talking to the tennessee eoc staff about station you know he s a noname a lot of course you follow the sec they saw him each week down there nashville pain theyre very aware of his skillset and his capabilities the ball in his hands mcdowell <person player="daryl richardson" race="UNK" position="RB">richardson</person> and hot birthing cost of an injury injured foot when he finishes where disease or breast and cunning hammers has checked in and he s blacked out to the left side assistance we look from cuttings garrett what it was a fir brown pick of the titans back in 2009 and had some big years with tennessee goes for 18 and this is the matchup they want they want coco darrell case the cases actually dropping in coverage and these tip we cant hang with the tight end other first down for the rams putting him in the back to your top layer describe for st louis fantasy scoring eyes first possession and the seven i think if i smack my hand with the big hole getting to the 10 look like he he coughed it up pony sense of all is audit and has recovered so the backup

couple of weeks is always a team carry of the season suck it out and settle for the cut its johnson puts up e and has a purse down the offensive line the tennessee titans is doing a good job getting

addition to this tennessee offense havent come over from san francisco and free agency take it over for carrie cooke who ended up signing with the rams third of seven at the 24 <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">locker</person> running to the shotgun formation author fires one that is incomplete intended for tingled <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wright</person> who has had a spectacular second season the titans leading receiver with 40 receptions and the rams have been really fortunate you look at their past for us they even be able to get a lot of pressure with the front for the <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate</person> when they prefer choose between five and six those pressures really get home <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">locker</person> didnt have time to take the extra hitch so the punting unit checks in brent <person player="brett kern" race="nonwhite"

loss of five on the return houston oilers and the tennessee titans but dying week and a half ago at the age of 90 one of the founders of the old american football league so instrumental the afl merger with the nfl adams hired jeff fisher as head coach back in 1994 rich he originally paid $25,000 for the franchise rights of the houston oilers there were the original members of this proposed club the eight afl owners took on national football league monies that is drop it off his stacey broke a tackle and has a firstround fall down by outer and <person player="alterraun verner" race="UNK" position="DB">verner</person> the right quarterback picked up 12 on the play and now the titans new president and ceo is tommy swift the soninlaw of elite but adams body and bucks two daughters will oversee the operation of the titans titans are wearing the patch on their jerseys the rest of the season honoring the late owner first and ten for the rams fleming s for the gumpert arms <person player="lance kendricks" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lance</person> kubrick s tight end comes up with the catch but no gain on the play although the alfa is going to change dramatically in terms of the scheme when youve made the change from <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> to <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> i mean <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> the good thing is he s got a lot of history in the system of brian schottenheimer he was with brian early in his career with the jets and read the guide under understand the studies would be very good for the young receivers and backs with tips and reminders atticus changed place the line of scrimmage is wrong that <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> once again with the handoff but his grave next to the 25 goes for free let s get back to our new york studios championship hey marvin pays to have the right tool the right to the right arm of jeff who the quarterback the leg mark he s good 59 yards later he s into the info the bill going off of the season 7 nothing early in the book marv i know youve heard it all but i couldnt resist that when marv albert and rich gannon there i dont know what took hours to come up with things out of seven states live as in the backfield for the rebs with the completion out of first down alston tennis threeyear man from boise state on a 13yard hookup probably need to be able to generate some explosive plays with <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> at quarterback and these young receivers guys like <person player="austin pettis" race="UNK" position="WR">austin pettis</person> have to start contributing this is one of the ears where theyre very young i think a lot of these sophomores need to step forward at running back and wide receiver the production from the secondyear players <person player="daryl richardson" race="UNK" position="RB">richardson</person> is not active peed and gibbons and <person player="brian quick" race="nonwhite" position="WR">quick</person> at wide receiver <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">clemens</person> 5 for 5 52 yards at all here at the swap that s the end of the first tigers with a 7 helping link will be back to st louis after these messages on to the second quarter titans have a seven upping lead on the ramps good start though the backup quarterback <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">clemens</person> 30 of the rhymes beside season with the jets where he doesnt have a sound grant pick package on 2006 and i pursue see <person player="zach brown" race="nonwhite" position="LB">zach</person> <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> rookies mandeville those before yards or a good thing marvin talking about <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> his teammates have been very supportive i mean theyve rallied around him after <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> went down and i think his perspective has changed because of previous experiences in the lake i think he really appreciates the opportunity he s just trying to enjoy the moment and play his best football really put his team of the position have a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to win each week remember what the jets as a backup and good start eight games when chad pennington who s injured it s only his 14th career start he s going to get that pass off stacey taken down right at the marker picked up five and there s a flag bonus for every pete farrelly out of stockton california is the principal at st mary s high school in stockton you think he here some students if they disagree with the call first thing monday morning offside be fair five yard penalty remains second down victory on <person player="mike martin" race="UNK" position="DT">mike martin</person> effect up defensive tackle you just going to get an early jump right inside i just looked a little bit up he s actually on the other side here it just jumps a snap count just just a tad in the back surprise your chip drum comes with the right child before the facts if that one is good aw what receipt hanging in the back you know <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> at the concession again you can see how difficult he is to haul down he goes for seven voting burner and collared were able to get him down and theyve made more of a commitment to trying to run the football here the last month in season even before <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> went down i think they decided that in order for them to get where they need to go they need to be able to have some balance and be able to run the football more effectively up inside and that s really what <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> does best this is a team that depended on steven jackson for eight straight years and thousandyard running per season or do looking for back to my test back in our first of the time as the ram throttle right to left and picked up six on the play well this guy has variability he s still learning the finer details of playing the position but i think it s just trying to find creative ways to get him to fall in space in little italy versus if you just once he gets on the perimeter of the defense a second item for hunting ham remains in the back here early possession his plan to deploy for st louis on a big platter for a first down silence hendricks makes the catch stop by zac brown and <person player="collin mooney" race="UNK" position="RB">collin</person> <person player="colin mccarthy" race="UNK" position="LB">mccarthy</person> a gain of 11 and this is so important for <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> for him to get off to a good start he s a perfect six persistence nice job just dumping this one down to the tight end <person player="lance kendricks" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lance kendricks</person> and he just looks like he s in rhythm right now and remember in the open i talked about it it s if he s in a rhythm his footwork is good and he can be an accurate throw the football was all that last week against the tower first and ten that sizing 19 yard line several to join with a tight and after <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> went for two team airs casa ive a curvaceous stop st louis rams three and five the three wins at home against arizona and jacksonville on the road in 38:13 victory at houston the losses and a planet allison carolina lost here at home to san francisco this past monday night very tough loss to seattle to be one of the final seconds mr play of his drive the truck pass here we have picked up the official daughters setting up a <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">person</person> goal a 12 yard pickup well look <person player="tim barnes" race="UNK" position="C">tim</person> tebow here you jump up and make this throw in steadman valley another rookie just makes it terrific effort look at him use that right hand to keep it balanced that s a pretty good first career reception for the rookie from west virginia barely any third round boy fishing in the backfield courtesy by the middle itself a couple stop by <person player="colin mccarthy" race="UNK" position="LB">mccarthy</person> well the titans made to show up there on defense now theyve lost three straight to kansas city seattle san francisco during that stretch theyve given up a hundred 41 yards a game on the ground and that s nothing has to get straightened out it s get a good look at <person player="greg zuerlein" race="white" position="K">greg</person> williams who s work alongside jerry gray he worked for jeff fisher for seven years and building the 99 super bowl season among people not too good at the first half second goal for st louis but specially with his first touchdown on the ground st louis with their first looking touchdown of the season he s got a low center of gravity just just runs with power and you can see the excitement from jeff fisher on the sidelines private began back of the 2009 12 plays 80 yards of 8 minutes as great is your life for the extra point so the pleasures of the rams are tied at 7 the nfl on cbs is a survivor redesigned honda odyssey honda starts something special and by geico 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance back in st louis marv albert rich gannon rams and the titans tied at 7 you see that st louis drive as i mentioned the first rushing touchdown of the season for the rams and it s for rookie <person player="zach brown" race="nonwhite" position="LB">zach</person> <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> who came up with a <person player="damian williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">damian williams</person> who s returning kicks for the first time and the nfl who did return cuts during his college years and hell stay right there but bring it out to the 20 yard line so here comes jake <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> tennis impact to the offense watching the nfl on cbs titans first and 10 for their 40 yard line shawn green the running back three and four theyve got three in the world they started out of three epping and one down green gets the call picks up four well let s take a look at the three big questions as it relates to the tennessee titans people want to know where <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">jake locker</person> is is the all the way back way may not be a hundred percent i think he s getting close the fact that he s able to play weeks ago against the 49ers is huge and where s <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> im not so sure i have the answer to this one well he s capable of big performances unfortunately theyve been few and far between and finally i believe is still developing identity on defense with <person player="greg zuerlein" race="white" position="K">greg</person> williams and jerry gray i think <person player="greg zuerlein" race="white" position="K">greg</person> boys wont be more aggressive life while jerry gray is a bit more conservative <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> looks controlled fires at will nice catch me eleni <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> goes to five well <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> got off to a nice start and he had set before the game but he s very happy to play on the synthetic turf he thought it might help them there were i needs a guy that you know doesnt take very long tomorrow to get the top speed i mean go from 0 82 heartbeat and i just you look at the consistency talking to the coaching staff the big thing is they fall behind in some games even the 49ers game where they talk they need to be on the field they need to touch the ball till 18 to 22 times the third out of waters green for the into the back field office quiz i agree with the first out of more three down the south shore clean out of the backfield finally pushed out by rocky mccloud the free safety it s a 28 yard catch and run will sip a little wide round he just gets out on the edge of the defense and it is not a whole lot judas for you to get a sense and a feel for shawn green speed in the open field led lines the ball very well but by <person player="mike otto" race="white" position="OT">mike otto</person> s playing for the interest rate and might tackle stewart enacted because of a shoulder problem so a post time inside the 45 gotcha to cut that out right till the lion portland <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> was able to <person player="chase reynolds" race="UNK" position="RB">chase</person> him down see why millions of fans have followed russell it exists its new night and time built miss a new episode tuesday at 10 oclock 9:00 central only cbs with a good look at the rams defense there youve got to be very disciplined with your eyes and gaps now when you go up against it back like <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> and he cant give him a crease he s a guy that can really hurts im going to discourage him from getting on the edge of your defense no way extra pressure is taken down by williamses who comes up with his third sack of the season of the rams with 26x over here but even going to look at my cot on top here he s taking the place of the injured <person player="david stewart" race="nonwhite" position="OT">david stewart</person> and he just he struggles and he clearly does not do a good enough job with his punch of <person player="william hayes" race="nonwhite" position="DE">william hayes</person> in there for the easy stack we talked about that front four at the start <person player="robert quinn" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert quinn</person> with the nfc total of ten sacks three on the other line against seattle voted 14 the swing pass life except the next two yarders hooked up a couple more that was a problem last year says he lost weight and you can see the difference this season is <person player="alec ogletree" race="nonwhite" position="LB">alec ogletree</person> was able to get about about the six yard pickup at all for <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kendall wright</person> and the punting here that will will come on so once again well see save on austin from that rip urn back petals to his pudding 5yard line that s the good hang time actually anna by austin 30yard montford did the job rams and titans tied

yarder to the 15 on the season and this one is no good we missed this past monday night from 50 a narrow missed and a critical miss in the loss to the elector spin and he s trying to get those laces around again im not making excuses for the kicker zero line has been terrific this year but that s frustrating you get a big turnover and youre not able to capitalize before halftime going back to last year he had hit 15 in a row last year as a rookie connected on his first 15 attempts so that is a big break for tennessee that s bullet there no question <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> the titans take over drops it off the screen gets across the 35 is shaw check out that s my <person player="alec ogletree" race="nonwhite"

player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> with time running after them inside of the 50yard line by <person player="robert quinn" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert quinn</person> and they use their final timeout with one second remaining in the half well jake rock has got to be careful when he runs with the football remember now he s coming off of a hit but a knee injury he s wearing a brace for the first time and you cant allow these defensive players to get on your legs you see that brace there on the right knee and it doesnt take much you know that somebody to follow you funny for that thing to slow back up or for that brace to start sliding down your leg itd be cumbersome to a guy that s not used to wearing it and now the rams taking a timeout as they discuss the possibilities of what tennessee is about to do with not too many possibilities actually the one second remain yes theyre going to take it to try and hold the ball let those three receivers up on the right side of the field the far side of the field run down there and hopefully <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">locker</person> can give them a jump on the back of the endzone well you can get inside the mind of a quarterback join phil simms our very own rich gannon steve beuerlein adam shine and special guests gary danielson on nfl monday beauty that s

report after this message and a word from your local station well rams head coach jeff fisher would love to see a victory comes through against this form if you try to pump up his club it s a seven southern tie as we head to the second half yeah really emotional kind of talk there at halftime from jeff fisher and it always means something i think when youre going against your former team whether youre a player or coach i think owes me a little more my sense is that he s extremely motivated here in the second half let s take a look at the first half defense presented by intel and 12 set a nothing after <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> drove the rams now the field it was <person player="zach brown" race="nonwhite"

that s the thing that does get your attention though those four stags at the bottom there and they tennessee titans theyve got to do a better job protecting <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">jake locker</person> he s got knocked around way too much in the first half st louis will receive they get the second half on the way and they have <person player="tavon austin"

just look at how they planted a bit inconsistent up fern along the offensive line theyve got bunch of new people in there this year will be three come over from buffalo warm at their first round pay with english winkie a fourth rounder i think they played a much better in terms of the run blocking as opposed to pass blocking birth out of six at the 45 and they come through a beautiful catch <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kendall wright</person> neely came up for the onehanded grab well he had it for a while there just wasnt able to pull it in and this one came out kind of hot this has been a very difficult test cats great effort by right you can see long he s been bringing it off the edge but chipping with him to try and slow him down and <person

a bring it out to the 20yard line which weve come up with yet another new enormously popular feature we tested it on a number of levels it s rich canons history lesson today it s these teams matching up in super bowl 34 fit for meals rams against jeff fisher s titans what are the greatest tackles of all time is mike <person player="barrett jones" race="UNK" position="OG">jones</person> tackle <person player="kevin matthews" race="UNK" position="C">kevin</person> dyson one yard short of the goal line in the sevenpoint game the rams first super bowl victory in franchise history there was a special moment for dick vermeil his football team and i think one of the more dramatic finish this to a super bowl you think about that tackle by mike <person player="barrett jones" race="UNK" position="OG">jones</person> on <person player="kevin matthews" race="UNK" position="C">kevin</person> dyson i mean that was the jeff fisher thought for a second dyson was going to score professor gannon i love history hard you know that cincinnati home is the fourth hot hatchback of discussion on the front of record his issue in the back there that s a handoff those four five coming up next it is big ben tom <person player="brady quinn" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> steelers and the patriots or the ravens facing the browns local listings patriots up together on top of the afc east tom <person player="brady quinn" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and company and apartment awaiting it done despite the injuries and how about the ravens far theyve won 11 straight against the cleveland browns theyve been up and down looking to even for here right there awesome out of five for the rams <person player="zac stacy" race="UNK" position="RB">stacy</person> running accelerate mr yard time running down in this third quarter as well as these two teams have run the ball youd think that the playaction game would be more effective this hasnt been a lot of big plays in the passing game you look at <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">clemens</person> just 134 yards passing a lot for just 107 yards and yet youve got two backs have been a nice job johnson already with 80 yards face he with 92 theyve done a good enough job taking advantage of playaction turns out in i guess six yard line pass incomplete intended the <person player="chris givens" race="UNK" position="WR">givens</person> covered by burning well this is really good coverage by <person player="alterraun verner" race="UNK" position="DB">verner</person> playing off a watch him drive once he sees the underneath throughout again theyre theyre repeating some plays you can see the titans are starting to drive on concepts that they recognize either from their film study or from split and formations that the rams are lining up in honor <person player="johnny hekker" race="white" position="P">johnny</person> picker takes up the 12 flips to the far side williams will let it go right will do with his third quarter with the score with innocent 14 st louis xiv will be back to say felicitous concert in a word from your local station welcome back to st louis missouri aerial coverage of today s game being provided by directv marv albert rich gannon titans and rams tied at 14 fourth quarter getting underway as he first and ten for their 29th this johnson returns to the backfield takes the handoff thought he had a hole and he s collared by google blank through which you look at what a sacred place this always like to see a guy take a shot down the field yeah i think it s been fairly conservative play calling really from for both offenses and at some point you always learn marv youve got to make the secondary play he got a he s kid getting a free pass over i think that youve got to be able to take some shots down the field and make these guys work on the edges the worker fell logging s first full years and i think for dinner tennessee titans here is rocker we look like the ones crying for the shot down physician <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> is able to run it out for seven complete and that s a positive it really is marv i think you know you talked about taking a shot down the field if it s not there the next best thing is checking down you see cordless physic and just jaw but if it s not there dial up a protection you block them up you want to take a shot now the next best thing check it down think <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> pick up some positive yards and put yourself in a very third one manageable situation football my <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">locker</person> turns out of one tennessee attics 38 were just getting up there whore whore now offers fires and has the first now a diving catch is made like trusted <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hunter</person> but looking out of tennessee and just the fourth completion today to a wide receivers most of the balls have been going to ted into the back i think <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hunter</person> is going to be a good one once he figures it out last year at the university of tennessee 73 catches nine touchdowns a secondround pick alpha tight and off to green shawn green is run well stop by <person player="william hayes" race="nonwhite" position="DE">william hayes</person> green pickup five four and we look at the past distribution you know not a lot of production from the wide receivers but one thing we have seen though from tennessee is yards after the catch particularly from <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> little two yard ralph but turn into six or seven yard gain last week s and against san francisco because radio doesnt jumpin we went away to the right mr johnson prevailed on the ground his rocker on the wall who pass is incomplete annika net was made walk washington is still looking for his first reception of the day youve got to be careful running these boots and make it into it we say is an unblocked defender on the line of scrimmage theyve got nolan accounting for <person player="william hayes" race="nonwhite" position="DE">william hayes</person> and so the quarterback is it s certainly going to get hit when he throws the football washington look wanting to the right side johnson in the backfield to the third arizona has food that is cooked from behind taken down by the doris <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> a 20yard pass play a really nice throw here by lockers just sitting in there a good route on the

<person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> will take chances absolutely hell fit on certain route you have two deep throws controlling his directions first out of the 32 yard line and here is johnson first to go johnson inside the 15 wolfe johnson to run out by lobby s mccloud goes for 24 yards so <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> over the 100 yard mark for the first time this season yeah would <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cortland finnegan</person> say to us on product you want to see how fast youre not just allow him to get out of the edge i mean he has what i would describe as rare and unusual speed if it change your angle the secondary when <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> gets rolling 16 carries 105 yards on the touchdown for johnson john green checks in for his first control at the injured on a handoff debris gets inside apply that by robert koch and good red zone team historically have been able to run the ball in this part of the field the field gets shorter a little bit more difficult

has had help from shawn green now this repulsive is seven floors out of the quarry okay where to go please like the hand off to play to make the title fruit number 98 a loss of one for green where i thought shawn green may have had an opportunity backside look right here freeze it i just thought he had a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to maybe sleep it but it stays play side whereas <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> is more apt to whine runs back to the back side he misses that comeback in the a gap between the center and guard berta goal at the five is the tenth play of this drive have started back at that old twenty nine green remains in the back here rocket takes out of the gun look at the touchdown tennessee the four of us cause with five moritz and the score well appear with the rams defensible you have to deal with lockers escape ability and his mobility even even with that hip and the injury and it includes and a knee brace tough guy one thing i really respected admire about jake <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> as you said marvin after that injury people thought itd be out five six weeks he came back a lot sooner than most expected proper otis hands on the extra point nine late 71 yards in five minutes of eighteen seconds this is <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> taking it home and his head coach mike munchak certainly enjoying that move richard beautiful drive engineered by quarterback jake <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> and was a combination of the running backs <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> and shawn green yeah they really did a nice job mixing it up and you know you watch a couple of those runs and they had eight eight defenders in the box and they just he still ran the ball right down the middle of that rams defense there s <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> if you get away <person player="tavon austin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tavon austin</person> is fine hell run it out rise to angular oh ice creams down at the 20yard line 25 yard return keller discussin on the cover up so let s see what

it pains to double jack talk to your agent today alright six minutes gone by in the fourth quarter rich shadows <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> and his rams play it here down by seven i dont think it changed dramatically florida law like to see him take a shot at you on first down theyve run the ball a lot in this situation looking <person

zone a selfinflicted wound then after an interception late in the second quarter by corbin finnick and they failed to capitalize again in this part of the field but the 44 yard field goal missed by <person player="greg zuerlein" race="white" position="K">greg</person> suhr lying to see the frustration there from jeff fisher you dont get that many opportunities the game youve got to make them play down in that part of the field st louis with a second and what they see one the first round more water for is opposed by stinson he goes for 42 yards turtle ofall horsecollar tackle number 99 keith a 15yard penalty automatic first down bonjour well <person player="jurrell casey" race="UNK" position="DT">casey</person> which adds to that look well you dont like to play pinball and just just

behind the linebacker in between the safety and a good way to start the drive and this is really where your earn your money at the young quarterback in the way when you go on the road youre in a tight football game the ability to finish at the end when it matters the most third pat s my wife first route click lamb skewers out of prayer until cesar first out at the 41 yard line and johnson is bottled up well ask your kid the light at 64 catches the leads had a city but there were complaints because he averaged up to 10 yards a catch on the 64 receptions and we touched on it earlier lost weight during the offseason and he s been running bitter after baking this engineer and even explosive player not the biggest guy but he can beat off the line of scrimmage with his speed and quickness laughter gotten 5 at the st louis 40 playaction <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> wrong one our intercept intercept of a rocky road his first pick of the

race="white" position="QB">jake locker</person> looks out in front of it but clearly some confusion between the quarterback and the receiver the rams will take over with just uppers five remaining over for bricks this past monday night the rams had a terrific opportunity to pull one out against first place seattle down 49 seconds remaining the <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">clemens</person> those of the passing complete of the end zone of the seahawks escape with the victory and here is until that interception to pull one out against tennessee yeah you gotta be able to finish and they were able to do that among the ladies performance there at the end when they had opportunity was going time they she stopped by <person player="bernard pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">pollard</person> no gain on the plane we mentioned before the offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer saying during the week that he felt good about that final call now stacey was hurt it hurt his ankle he fell that was the right play yeah they felt pretty good about it of course they brought pressure seattle did off the edge and a couple of things as i went back and watched it <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> rushes the throw doesnt set his feet maybe a better route by <person player="brian quick" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brian quick</person> when you least have to give the receiver a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to make a play in the back of the end zone second out of kenneth e21 the toss to stacey and they have him wrapped up picks up for <person player="sammy brown" race="UNK" position="LB">sammy</person> hill leading the way of as a

position="K">greg</person> suhr line one of the stronger legs in the nfl although he s had some difficulty recently was that 50 otter on monday night well it s important not to get too far ahead of yourselves here in a second 20 situation theyve got to be able to get half of it back im still a long way to go with 350 remaining spacy in an open space and they succeed as he reaches out near the 25yard line that by <person player="colin mccarthy" race="UNK" position="LB">mccarthy</person> and that s a positive play and you just look at the quickness of safety where he s really become a much better runner out runner out in the back side he s got a good feel for the passing game and then he is a tough tackle in the open field picked up 13 on my pass play but his change of direction is incredible about nine tackles with <person player="collin mooney" race="UNK" position="RB">collin</person> <person player="colin mccarthy" race="UNK" position="LB">mccarthy</person> eight solo herd out of seven the baltic a 24 empty back to life it s loose enough by gareth <person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DE">morgan</person> of tennessee the auto turnaround collector well he forced it and <person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DE">derrick</person> more than first bit on a georgia tech four years ago comes up with a football well weve seen this a number of times today from <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> where he s had to step up inside the pressure off the edge forces him back up inside and i think what happens initially there is <person player="jurrell casey" race="UNK" position="DT">casey</person> knocks it loose and <person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DE">morgan</person> s able to come up with it a huge turnover for the titans in the red zone ball security we talked about it each week mom how important it is to have two hands on the ball as you step up inside the pot and let s see now how tennessee plays if theyre going to want to play the quality this lug is provable ready go in this fourth quarter johnson got surprised running room johnson without playing the clock one for <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> who live in terrific day for the all chappell play has been so effective for the tennessee titans and i give a lot of credit to my kado they do a nice job getting moving at the point of attack and getting up on the second level <person player="collin mooney" race="UNK" position="RB">mooney</person> gets a big block <person player="mike otto" race="white" position="OT">otto</person> gets a big block for mac and <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> does the rest second rushing touchdown of the day for johnson here is <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> the costly fumble by <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">clemens</person> leading to the touchdown and a 2821 lead for the titans how about <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> 18 carries a hundred and 25 yards you go back and look at theyre gonna get a lead with the fullback and of course <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> it s just downhill but look it s not like theyre shored up here theyve got eight defenders down in the box and theyre having success running right off the edge theyre not doing a good job getting off of a block and again once <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> gets up on the second level youre just simply not going to catch him man he has got a unique running style he has sprinter speed instant acceleration when things are going well which they have today and again the turnover e but pressure off the edge forces <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">clemens</person> to step up inside a little careless with the ball we talked about ball security and derek <person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DE">morgan</person> is there for a huge play for the titans now if youre <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> look all you got to do is regroup you get another opportunity here youve got three timeouts plenty of time left 250 for the twominute warning you have to have a short memory and it is a short memory socket if our quarterback you just have to forget about a mistake you have to be able to turn the page marvin you throw a touchdown for me a drone interception you have to be able to move on and learn that from <person player="joe barksdale" race="nonwhite" position="OT">joe</person> montana who is one of the best in the business regardless of what happened he spent very little time looking in the rearview mirror they bought austin s takes it deep in the end zone to bring it out to the 20yard line i would think a time that is very difficult to do it can be difficult but look you dont have time to think about what just happened and you know look he s actually been playing ok today done a nice job taking care of the football with the exception of a lost fumble there nice job being out in front of throws he s been a nice job managing the game the line of scrimmage the run game he s got plenty of plenty of timeouts left to read of course he s got the twominute warning so im is not really much of an issue in the situation they have to have a little bit of a sense of urgency but they have plenty of time on the clock rams got out of there what our drive to the looks 54 seconds remaining itll form theyre going to pure white house my name is the professor <person player="austin pettis" race="UNK" position="WR">austin pettis</person> well you cant miss that throw when you get them open if got to be able to hit them and that first play the drive i always say is an important play again just errand thrown not a bad decision but it s a poor throw by <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> the <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person> out for the season with a torn acl the surgery is scheduled for next week

player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> look at the timing and the rhythm and how important it is in the passing game watch where this ball lands i mean you got to at least give the receiver a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to make a play keep them on the field we say if you wait youre late found austin was out of that that break in a hurry a big play here give him flanked to the left side his punting on the rollout cant find anyone now throws a dangerous joey complete intended for <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> not able to hang on well decision here to make it to jeff fisher i think theyre too bit too deep in their own territory theyre gonna punt the ball with three timeouts in the twominute warning and try and try and pick up some field position plus lots of time two minutes 37 seconds of becker will punt <person player="damian williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">damian williams</person> was right becker from his six with his fifth part of the day and it s a good one as he s running to kind of a late surge hatch indication run into by <person player="brandon mcgee" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon mcgee</person> it s a 57yard punt let s see how they sort this one out where he s got to give the receiver a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to make and play the returner <person player="damian williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">damian williams</person> he had no <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> as soon as he catches that drives it gets it <person player="brandon mcgee" race="UNK" position="DB">mcgee</person> is right there it s kind of a hesitation by williams and at the last instant right there well he s going to say that he got pushed into all i think <person player="tommie campbell" race="UNK" position="DB">campbell</person> pushes them right he s trying to block him regardless he can you cant do that you have to allow the returner and opportunity to make the catch and so were discussing right now whether or not he got pushed into am i supposed there is no foul the 62 defense can play however illegal block in the back number 57 of the 37 rethinking gene 10yard penalty first down no <person player="tommie campbell" race="UNK" position="DB">campbell</person> were going to get him for an illegal legal block he puts it clearly he pushes <person player="brandon mcgee" race="UNK" position="DB">mcgee</person> and <person player="brandon mcgee" race="UNK" position="DB">mcgee</person> winds up running right into the returner great concentration there by <person player="damian williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">damian williams</person> is to try and hold on to it <person player="damian williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">damian williams</person> handling kickoffs and punts for the first time in his nfl career he s done it in preseason he had been a punt returner in college hit southern cal when he brought one back in the preseason for a touchdown replacing various green aldo had a very difficult game two weeks ago against san francisco so what the penalty is a first return from there 10 now you gotta eat a piece to the back up here you got to be able to run the ball and get a first thing out make it rams you go to <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> fighting a hole and then tripped up stressing out to the 15th michael drucker s mavis up st louis takes a timeout with 2 minutes and 21 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter mike munchak has been in this situation a lot of a player into the coach and if youre jake <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">walker</person> the message throughout pencil line is here s where we need it the most we need somebody to make a play got to be able to run the football successfully get a first down and force the rams to use those timeout youve got to be able to remind the back to hands on the football stay in bounds he s smart when you get towards the sidelines saturday johnson oh we found a hole and is hauled out of the 30yard line picks up the first down <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> was able to <person player="chase reynolds" race="UNK" position="RB">chase</person> him down but 18 on a big play by <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> and all he needs is a crease this is the opportunity for big runs because everybody is committed to the line of scrimmage first down at the 32 when we resume after the dilatant warning first and ten for the tightness in the 32 yard line just under two to go and this fourth quarters had johnson with a short pickup of a timeout taken again by by st louis on from tennessee s point of view how do you play it level oh youre going to run the football they can run it they can afford to run it three times and make the rams use those two timeouts in that situation marv if they it have a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to get the ball back with about a minute left to go in the game with no timeouts left if they can find a way to get youre going to stop here on second third down but your dialogue is the offensive coordinator you want to run in here twice hopefully <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> can bust another one and get your first down and get a first down the game is essentially over for the ram and what a huge game for tennessee they could go to four and four just a game and a half behind indianapolis the colts five and two they play tonight at houston so the players will be right in the race once again the in off the joshan and nothing is there another time out the final timeout taken by the rams well we always say youve got to be skinny to trying to run this power play in the right guard rookie <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> wore back he just falls down once he falls down the fullback falls right into him mooning in <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> has nowhere to go it is now a third and 10 the tennessee at the 32 yard line 8 washington who has been very quiet frank s to the right side the running back is johnson is johnson stutterstep said that he is capped at the 35 yard line so the rams able to stop the titans it s <person player="alec ogletree" race="nonwhite" position="LB">alec ogletree</person> will just run the clock down here and punt the football and get it back to the rams with about a minute to go with no timeouts you need a big return here from <person player="tavon austin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tavon austin</person> if im putting the football and im <person player="brett kern" race="nonwhite" position="P">brett kern</person> im not going to give that guy an opportunity to return the ball im going to kick it towards the boundary theyre trying to coffin corner kick i dont want to allow this rookie to make a big play he has already brought one back this year that got called back on a penalty but he is capable currently this court has got a nice job even just coming up with his first touchdown of the season timeout now called by tennessee well i like it i like the fact that mike munchak is going to talk about this with his his punting unit then at five remaining fourth quarter tennessee with a 28 21 lead on st louis the story for the titans miss johnson other 250 yards glugging is the most 500 total of last season and 195 yards two touchdowns in a game against the bills in buffalo mr kavon austin who has tremendous speed rookie from west virginia well dont give him an opportunity we saw just a moment ago <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate</person> kaiser the special teams coordinator for the titans talking with their punter <person player="brett kern" race="nonwhite" position="P">brett</person> turn of course there s a good look at jon postel the special teams coordinator for the rams he wants to give that rookie a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> kenan hit it into a corner dont give this guy a waco here s the other guy hector a town in the middle foster accelerates the sidewalk he s gonna and he stopped that about hey vaughn austin with a cleric with geritol is a beer brewery she s able to get it out of other people they spotted with 50 seconds remaining in this fourth quarter well i think he just barely steps out of bounds right there but again why give this guy an opportunity marv you and i just talked about it that s bad coaching it s a 51yard return i mean it s just a 24 yard return for alston well if you complete a ball in the playing field this offensive lines got a hustle up there and clock it quarterback <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> has to be able to use the boundary ram start out from their 39 yard line 50 seconds to go in the 4th theyre down by a touchdown in trouble squeeze it out he has things he looks to get to the sideline to stop the clock st louis out of timeouts sent out by collard picked up four different hurt you but you cant do in this situation with no timeout is take a sack throwing the ball away on first down is not a bad thing if youve got to be smart if youre running back or receiver ted in you get the ball youve got to try to find a way to get out of my room second out of six so that took seven seconds now you gotta clock it and no timeouts left they have to enter the line and spike it clock running just under 30 remaining and that stops the clock it was a 25 yard pass play or a really nice throw here by <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> weve seen a bunch of them here in the second half and he just throws it right over the linebacker in between the safeties to chris gibbons and gibbons is going to do a nice job just working back in the middle of the field does a nice job getting down so that they can get up there and clock it 26 seconds remaining brothers able to complete stacey runs it out of bounds able to stop the clock but just six more 21 seconds to go tennessee up 2821 well theyve got to be smart now third and four you got to be certainly cognizant of getting the first down but again 21 seconds left at some point youve got to start taking some shots at the end zone here of iran similar to monday night against seattle moving down the field on the night they had a <person player="chance warmack" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chance</person> to what it now the try to tie it lemons cut and fires off the ball while looking for an appearance in the end zone austin dennis looked like you took a shot <person player="bernard pollard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bernard pollard</person> was on the coverage let s go fly well youve got a fourth of four now with 16 seconds left and you almost have to to get one out of bounds quickly or take a shot at the end zone so once again jeff fisher and his rams come down to a fourth down play this time with 16 seconds remaining and going for the top entitled the penis an excellent cover it was a great idea but a poor execution and a poor throw by <person player="kellen clemens" race="white" position="QB">kellen clemens</person> i like the fact that you take a shot on fourth down but you got to at least give the receiver chant this one this one s too close to being out of bounds <person player="jason mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason mccourty</person> on the coverage and a box come out in graduates over hug the tenants have awkward with 10 seconds to go break up it s a big win for tennessee with indianapolis as i mentioned five and two they play in houston tonight tennessee evens the record had fallen for remember they got off to the good start three and one and then lost three in a row and st louis with another tough loss they now go to three of six farhad rich gannon saying so long from st louis let s go to new york <person player="james
