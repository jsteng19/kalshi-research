of an opener on sunday night football now michael is cris collinsworth michele tafoya welcome to denver where tivo mania has been supplanted by <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> mania you know the story payton 14 seasons with the colts has undergone four neck surgeries in the last year and a half hasnt played a game in 20 months and here he goes to mind in his broncos debut against the pittsburgh steelers will come off a year in which they went 12 and four had the number one ranked defense in the league where he s shocked to you in the wildfire game by denver and tebow last january theyve had a lot of changes during the offseason but once again a legitimate super bowl contender chris here we go <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> we watched in practice the other day we watched the preseason talked to maclean what do you expect tonight he looked pretty good to me so well see but you have to wonder what s going through his for neck procedures a new team a new city the steelers defense which was ranked number one in the nfl a season ago and it means so much to them you can just feel it when you talk to them but it s not going to be easy ive got butterflies for him he goes against the pittsburgh steelers as i say a lot of changes but once again the team that figures very much to be there at the end of year yeah and im interested to see what their offense is going to look like you know they have been thoughtless burger and some of the best wide receivers in the game and yet you get the feeling they want to go back to some of their old pittsburgh steeler ways and run the football but they dont have <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> tonight so is that really what they do best it s pittsburgh and denver what a way to open up the season meanwhile for the pittsburgh steelers one of their problems is the fact that <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> cannot play at high altitude for more on that lets go to michelle that s right now the pro bowl safety for the steelers has the sickle cell trait in his blood and that can become lifethreatening when he exerts himself in high altitudes he first discovered this danger back in 2007 when after playing a game here had to have his gallbladder and his spleen removed he hasnt played in a game here since and that includes last season s post game loss when the denver broncos completed four deep balls against the steelers secondary and not surprisingly <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> calls clark s absence tonight significant but clark told me he plans to contribute tonight he wants to be an extra set of eyeballs on the sideline for his teammates and how also out tonight steelers pro bowl linebacker <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> will miss the game he is still nursing a left knee injury ow all right thank you michelle also <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite"

presentation of the national football league mike tomlin turned 40 years old in march he is in his sixth season as the head coach of the pittsburgh steelers he s taken them to two super bowls winning one and his opposite number is john fox in the second year as the broncos hit folks after nine seasons as the head coach of the carolina panthers took them to one super bowl which they lost to new england in a thriller broncos won the toss they elect to receive that means we will see <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> immediately and on the spotlight in denver with the temperature in the mid80s the crowd will already in an uproar not a cloud in the sky <person player="omar bolden" race="UNK" position="DB">omar bolden</person> will drop back that shawn sleaze them and will kickoff for the steelers and now you just wonder will they come right out with the nohuddle offense we talked to several of the broncos players it s hot tonight of course you got the thin air your opening night or a lot of times youre not in the absolute best shape that you could be in will <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> come out attacking from the first play you might come out on the 20yard line because most of the kickoffs in this stadium at 5,280 feet lined up as touch backs last season 80% of the kickoffs excluding onside kicks wound up as such facts go from denver colorado into the stands and so here comes <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> now for the first time since he was at the university of tennessee in 1997 wearing a different uniform at least it s orange hasnt played since a wild card game against the new york jets following the 2010 season the four neck procedures and away we go with the <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> era in denver <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person> is his running back is a simple pain walk and the day he picks up five as he takes it up to the 25yard line tackle their b<person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> payton visited denver he visited arizona and tennessee and then the 49ers and dolphins visited him and a lot had to do with the fact that john elway is here running the show in denver which brings him to the rocky mountains from the gun now on second and five <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s first pass as a bronco right on the money to <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">eric decker</person> and a first down up to the 38 yard line <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> and thomas are his key wideouts and also <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> has come aboard as well as former teammate lindy the thing that stuck out to me most was watching the protection of the denver broncos they have been almost perfect during the course of preseason and you should see them practice it going over every little detail and you knew the steelers were gonna come test them early first one they answer correctly it s like theyre guarding a museum piece here s a fullback that s crisp on koski and the gain is 3/4 mcgehee and let s take a look at the bronco starters <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> university of tennessee <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person> miami <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> georgia tip <person player="eric decker" race="white"

<person player="orlando franklin" race="nonwhite" position="OG">orlando franklin</person> to you by way of tron county and tammy provides another link to the past played with him with the colts a couple of years back my second down and seven traffic tried to jam it in there too driessen who gets doubled covered and the pass is incomplete itll be third down and seven greece and coming over from the texans but one of the problems with safety <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> being out as you end up seeing <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> and a lot more deep coverage it actually got him in trouble in the playoff game because he s a guy that is so dynamic and makes big plays he wants to attack he wants to make interceptions and sometimes just sitting back and being the free safety can be a bit of a struggle and that s much been much more brian clarke s over the wall with this thing third down and seven now <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> which on again slides left and competes in and that s <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> cant seizure taken down by <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez</person> almond and the broncos up backtoback first down will dick lebeau the defensive coordinators trying to bring the pressure look at all the guys theyre coming right up the middle and trying to get <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> a little happy feet going but <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> on the outside now they have been doing this for a long long time isnt it amazing how they can just keep doing it sort of like johnny unitas and raymond berry they almost know what the other ones thinking out there timeless from the 50 now the blitz that was <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> the blocking but <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moreno</person> has no place to go he s the backup number one draft choice from georgia no9 but mckay he s number one <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moreno</person> coming off an acl tear is number two you knew he wasnt gonna sit back for very long theyre kind of <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> and stokely may have saved the day at least for my fumble huge collision in the backfield but when you talk to dick lebeau he said listen you cannot sit back and just wait on pain man and hell pick you apart you would have to take your shots where the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> is going in the endzone second opening drive that s coming again flag thrown first of the game in the past is dropped by <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> who made that catch for 80 yards on the touchdown in the overtime game to beat pittsburgh in january taylors covering first penalty of the game still the replacement official officials gerald wright who s done a lot of officiating in his career several conferences even going back to the old western athletic conference he retired insurance salesman from albuquerque mike <person player="jamie mccoy" race="UNK" position="TE">mccoy</person> is the offensive coordinator for so many years we were used to seeing tom <person player="rahim moore" race="UNK" position="DB">moore</person> on the sidelines at indianapolis sending in as tom used to say concepts and some <person player="jamie mccoy" race="UNK" position="TE">mccoy</person> with part of his system and part of what payton feels comfortable in on the headset <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> calling the plays into <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> s helmet marino stays in the backfield on third and 10 swallowed up and that s <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry</person> foot number 50 he s been around a long michigan who gets the sack and it s fourth down that time it s <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">knowshon moreno</person> who misses the block they really had this thing protected pretty well one on one pass protection he just lowered his head and that was what cost him and this is going to straight sound strange now but sometimes as a quarterback or as a player in the nfl getting hit for the first time actually is a positive thing because it settles you down a bit <person player="britton colquitt" race="white" position="P">britton colquitt</person> is the kicker <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> oh and a fantastic year not only receiving the running back kickoffs and punts he is the team mvp and brownies have snubnosed and cant get out of his own way and the bronco meanwhile <person player="ben roethlisberger"

redmond who had a pretty good day here in the playoff game last year after <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> had suffered his knee injury he s still recovering from that so here is <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and the big question is as chris talked about it at the top with tom haley coming in and bruce arians being let go and now an indianapolis there is last year s head coach of the kansas city chiefs and before that at arizona he s been a temper and his <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> said he s the only guy that could make kirtley on their curse second and seven to the outside the 17yard line sealers were right one dominant last year so this time they go to the left want to become more balanced of net reward and he doesnt like the cold a long time tithe and ethier at a virginia dad <person player="heath miller"

<person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> between two defenders <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> held out through all of cam just showed up last week hasnt practiced very much didnt play in a preseason game and he s very close to a first down <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> wasnt touched initially i dont think so he got to get up but he still was tackled by <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> who came over from the saints before he was able to pick up the first down that appeared and they will bring in the chain gang right now for <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> this is a new offense new terminology he s really only been practicing for a week and because of all the crowd noise they were concerned would he know all the hand signals and such that goes with a game like this and he s going to be a couple of links short of the first time then as much as that offense would like to go for it mike tomlin knows a little bit better youre not going to give <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> that around the 20yard line so now youve got <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">drew butler</person> coming into keck he is a rookie punter out of georgia and the former jet <person player="jim leonhard" race="white" position="DB">jim</person> <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> is back there to receive it so this will be <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">butler</person> s first nfl kick his father <person player="kevin vickerson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kevin</person> was the placekicker youll recall him with the chicago bears between the mid 80s and the mid nineties in fact <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">butler</person> won a super bowl ring his dad did with the fabled 85 bears and then ended his career with the arizona cardinals nice place to make a debut as a punter at 5,280 see i not get that average up around 68 and call it a career and the kick is a low line drive and <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> takes it back at the 28 yard line looking for room or on the outside and down he goes at the 40yard line this world makes the tackle batting out for the second broncos series <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> we heard about him a lot of people did when he was in great school son of archie and olivia went to dumon high school in the early 90s and then to the university of tennessee had a spectacular career in knoxville indianapolis the number one overall pick in 98 through 11 and here he is in orange again from rocky top to the rocky mountains <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> starts the game to a floor for 22 yards first down at the 40 with mcgehee the running back <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> swinging to the outside gain of four up to the 44 tackle by foot now you can do this as well as i can youve seen him throw as many balls maybe more than i have and this kind of looks the same there was a play against the san francisco 49ers in preseason in which he released one harris harrelson just absolutely thrilled him completed a long <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> down the field and that was kind of the moment that you got the feeling that he is back you know whether or not he s really sharp at this point you dont know but he s capable second down and six and that pass is brought on the outside by thomas and thomas is able to slip the initial tackle steps away from luis itll be third and short let s take a look at the defense regular missouri jc handsy texas <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> grable high school go buff lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> university of michigan <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry foote</person> michigan <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> florida state <person player="chris carter" race="UNK" position="LB">chris carter</person> fresno state <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">keenan lewis</person> opalocka high school <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> university of southern california ryan bundy woodland hills high school id c square university the pittsburgh dean number one last year and number one against the runner there s a fumble and it winds up in the hands of the steelers so on a third down one the pittsburgh steelers come up with a football as lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> is the beneficiary of the fumble <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> got the inside push initially right here but then i think it s <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry foote</person> number 50 who comes around and really just sort of flails at the football and knocks it out you can see him almost backhanded out of there just got it right on the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> there his back turn just gonna throw his body back at it and out comes the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> so this was a very good team running the football a season ago <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person> almost 1200 yards rushing but <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> disrupts a lot of things especially in the line in short yardage he had four thunders last year the state is amazingly with only 15 or season takeaways feuless in the league so they get it at the 47 now start with the <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> taking the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to the 44 let s take a look at the denver defense theyre cool cincinnati tie worn the real texas a&amp;m justin bannon colorado <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> do mcgill university of louisville paul miller texas and <person player="joe mays"

introduce himself 14th year 11 pro bowls this is <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">chris rainey</person> her and the rookie gets taken down by <person player="wesley woodyard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wesley woodyard</person> rainy is a working out of the university of florida thatll set up a third down and nine <person player="wesley woodyard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wesley woodyard</person> is getting a chance to play because <person player="dj williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dj williams</person> is suspended he comes right out of this side over here and it chase it all the way across he s been there leading special teams tackler for a number of years around here and his speed certainly adds an element this looks better to me and they later after dennis allen that guided that unit last year ended up the hip coaching job with the raiders play clock is down to one and the pass is caught and that will be <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> for a first down so much groundandpound through the history of the pittsburgh steelers but right now of course with <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> and <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> and <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> and the tight end <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> theyd love to put it up well theyve got his own blitz going and theyre gonna try and bring somebody <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> out across the way to get into that hook zone and he just couldnt get there he got caught up on the inside receiver <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> couldnt get over the top and the pittsburgh steelers picked up a big first down the third down and nine now redmond is back in the game from the 33 will be selling the running backs tonight stretch play went perfectly in a swarming defense <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> number 58 is there and then <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">porter</person> finishes him off for a loss of five it s so interesting <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> both thought he had a good block on this one right here on <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> he got him to the outside edge just let him go by inside but <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> is just so incredibly quick and strong we were talking to john box he said i have never had one like this guy he said when he comes off the edge of course you got to deal with his speed all the time but then all of a sudden he rocks down and blows up tackles right back into the quarterback they really think theyve got a superstar their oxygen tripoli model devote so much of no around a school he was the second overall pick in the draft he had only cam newton to and second and 15 left guard and <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> going next no were setting up a third down and long with a little over four minutes to play in the quarter so jack del rio had been the coach of jacksonville for nine years before that he was with john fox at carolinas an assistant helped him get the job with the jaguars got fired last year then when dennis allen got the job and opened the cola not to del rio to come here and walk this burger has to slide away and it s out there rule theyre looking at in cincinnati they didnt have a first round pick he got pick in the second round he was their number one choice and he can walk it down his first sack ever <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> in primetime they going to be happy with this with a little cross inside with the two tackles and <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> wolf who is as much a run player but when you watched him on tape coming out of the university of cincinnati the thing that impressed you most was just how tenacious the guy was he never gave up on a play always hustling and they really needed some help inside denver takes a timeout before a fourth down for pittsburgh and you can enhance your viewing experience by going to nbc sportscom s and at extra for a lot of good stuff dvr controller social media analysis with <person player="willie colon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">willie</person> parker avoid the night in that area as the steelers inside the five and that is a beauty at the oneyard line down there find the markhest banned by great pond by the rookie from georgia john elway shirtandtie executive vice president football operations for the broncos pat bowlen giving him the keys a couple of years back and very instrumental obviously in getting <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> here in those last two years for john 97 and 98 they won the super bowl he makes a lot of plays but on the oneyard line looking for breathing space fumble gave pittsburgh the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> but they were only able to net two yards total to the three yard line remember gang he was a great star in college suffered a really gruesome injury in his last college game for the university of miami nonetheless buffalo picked him in the first round sat out that first year then three years with them went to baltimore was their starting back for two years and then he backed up ray rice and then came here so here is <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person>

talking to him on the field before the game i said can you go to plays in a row because he hasnt had a lot of practice he said to plays is no problem i just hate running to the sideline of them now third and six <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moreno</person> flanking <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> in the backfield from the end zone and stepping into it and converts and stokely breaks a tackle to the 21yard in responding <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> down by <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> only donald driver is older than <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> playing wide receiver in the nfl and you can just tell where <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> wants to go number four teens out there im backed up on my end zone he s going to break a tackle and pick up a first down and that is a big one to get him out of a hole getting away from <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez</person> at the first down anyway the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> is at the 22 yard line number formatting right there for six 444 final minute opening quarter fake handoff and then he with a flag down gets sacked by jason walls so the fake inside handoff walls comes in off the edge and well see about the call here and of course it will be declined if it s against denver these are for making that mistakes on <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> he was sliding his protection away his back came to this side theyre all going this way but they came up one short and as a quarterback you have to know when you dont have that backside protected he just missed it that s something that <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> probably wouldnt miss in midseason maybe still shaken off a little rust eight yards sack <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s gone down twice in the quarter second and 18 <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moreno</person> is the back three receivers set to the left side to go three by one they give it to <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moreno</person> he slips the tackle on the back but then cant get past the 16 yard line very foot would make the tackle in the backfield but they stopped him shortly thereafter and that s going to take us to the end of the quarter unless the broncos and here they go the broncos go to the line without a hundred get the play off incomplete thomas was there the coverage was there as well the bronco bench wants interference and the clock is stopped was five seconds with no flag and a fourth down and 17 and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> s saying that he was not off the field they took a quick snap one of the steelers was running off the field and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> was pointing right in that direction saying he did not get off the field that should have been a free five yards for us but no flag and thus they try to catch the steelers with too many men on the field dont get the call and now the carbon end after the punt here <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> from the forty gets a block on the outside returning the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> past midheel and that will be the end of the first quarter with no score in denver sunday night football back after these messages oh sue aerial coverage tonight provided by geico rocky mountain sunset john elway went riding off into one of those following those backtoback super bowls announcing his retirement the height of his career at least in terms of start the second quarter al michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya and and waffles burger will handed take the below to the 35yard let s go back to <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> trying to catch the steed of defense with an extra man on the field actually he did watch this action right over here you see steve mcclendon right there just jogging his way off the field he s right in front of one of the officials but the official had his back turn to <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> probably couldnt see the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was snapped at that point so he couldnt make the call and just to clear it up in terms of the rules that was a challengeable play that they decide to challenge it but is still animated third down in 12 that will come along the 3071 and this is <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person> breaking tackles and <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">porter</person> still cant get him down by the facemask and that s gonna cost them extra yardage on a great run by <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> third year back out of georgia tech sixth round pick in 2010 in this first carry of the season here unbelievable justin ban and had him dead to rights and just couldnt hang on instead it s on <person

position="WR">wallace</person> with the hold and negate the big game here alright <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> right up here that s a whole and the gates a heqco play here justin bannon at wire wrapped up in the backfield and just couldnt hold on and but i will say one thing about the denver broncos with some of the additions theyve made now <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> and tie warren getting back and healthy justin bannon in there even <person player="robert ayers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert ayers</person> a good run player this team was horrendous a year ago against the run just left gaping holes for a middle linebacker joe mazed and the trying to make play better on the spot that s going to make it second and five now out of the slide and the patch goes to the other side and that is caught by <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> steelers this year using a fullback whose aryans always used to tell us when he s the offenses were dating to go around town and people would scream at him get a fullback got a fullback but they were kind of lucky david johnson was sort of their fullback tight in and this <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> was at a workout with somebody else that they were going to see ends up he s timed in the forties under four five and i go holy cow let s sign in and mike tomlin said a lot of people are going to take credit for well johnson it was just from the 21yard as for the shooters in the outside the flag is thrown <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> who does the same types of things for pittsburgh that jason witten has done four years for the dallas cowboys solid steady consistent an offside call here miller so then i think bond miller is getting a little frustrated because the pittsburgh steelers are doing a little bit more of this quick passing game than what youve seen out of them in the past this is a new addition i think by todd haley he really wants to give his offensive linemen a few chances against these topmatch rushers to go out and just let them be aggressive so you dont have to block for three for five seconds and it slows them down because they get frustrated first out in five <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> is 3 for 3 in the was <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person> setting up second in short bannon playing with his third team in three years makes the stop when big mac starts working on the outside that left tackle there was some question they drafted <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> out of ohio state whether or not he was going to be the left tackle but one of the reasons and they sort of felt like that starts was the better fit at least for now is <person player="willie colon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">willie</person> cologned a long time right tackle is now playing left guard in the half mac starts in there and able to sort of coach <person player="willie colon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">willie</person> along for some of these early games might help him there s <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> there right they drafted offensive linemen one and two the cast or the other but he s on injured reserve second down that cant pick up the first down his working <person player="keith brooking" race="white" position="LB">keith brooking</person> comes up to make the tackle in his 15th year working out of georgia tech the pittsburgh steelers the last few years have been so righthanded with their running game more often than not running off that way but now they feel like they can really pull both directions <person player="ramon foster" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ramon foster</person> a pretty good puller really cologne learning how to do that so there have a little more balance if you like out of the running game this down two and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> asks for a time on eleven and a half to go in a scoreless first half that is season of the

central michigan was a six round draft choice back in 2010 so he was really under the radar and then last year over a thousand yards receiving grew up in miami and then with the north carolina the prepschool return yardage over a thousand yards the steelers named him their most valuable player wire and rainier now both in the backfield on 1st and goal this burgers over the middle miller will take the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to the two yard line belair was only caught about 10,000 walls over the middle in his career second and goal there s a flag down the steelers are looking to get up to the line of scrimmage without a huddle penalty marker the 10 another one of those quick throws and one of the things that they really have been working on early down throws to their tight ends and their backs they felt like they were too focused on their wide receivers a season ago theyre trying to make that change before the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was snapped and cokes 199 on the defense and the frog replay first down that is bickerson right here and once you make contact we know that he made contact before that <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was snapped but either way it came out about the same way they just saved it down saved it down would have picked up a little extra yardage on the play but youd rather have it first and goal from the three and second and goal from the two and it s deflected an incomplete tried to get it the ground on a slant that s <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">champ bailey</person> sand up on machamp is seen more than a few of these you dont go to 11 straight pool balls unless you can break in on

enough to stay with him looking at flanks <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> in the backfield play clock column all the way down and you should have a delay here play clock at zero before the snap even signal to the team and guarded third and only come back they gave <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> a timeout but it should have been delay of the game you take a look at this there s there s a clock twoonezero he calls the timeout the bags artillery signaled way again but the referee said then got it off on time got the timeout for he didnt shoot him in the lines pass is deflected an incomplete knocked away by <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite"

and he didnt play well then joe namath went to the la rams and even play well that day either joe montana went from san francisco to kansas city and did play well over two years and the <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett</person> farr went to the jets from <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> bay and then on to minnesota at a decent start and here we go with <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s who tonight is four out of seven as is raucous burger so look at that youve got identical statistics for the two starting quarterbacks at this point three nothing steelers on top were <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> to the 20yard line that s a sixyard game is <person player="joel dreessen" race="white" position="TE">joel</person> driessen makes the cash in one of the things with <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> and with <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> is he want to go no huddle or not here he does he said in indianapolis by the end though it got to be more of a muddle than a no huddle now they definitely want to pick up the pace and this no huddle of maybe trying to wear the steelers down again it was a good idea altitude heroes mcgee he takes him out to the 29 yard line and i remember playing here on opening day one time he s one oclock in the afternoon probably wasnt any warmer than it is out here tonight i was so exhausted by the end of the game ive come lying down on the field just trying to catch my breath out there it is definitely a factor yeah but you still caught 10 passes that day third and that s caught for a first time <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> makes the catch <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry foote</person> making the tackle last time these two teams got together denarius thomas was run into the house with that overtime eighty yarder to send the broncos on in the playoffs and so far today the pittsburgh steelers were more conservative on the back end than what they were against tim tebow in that past autonomous is able to reach back and make the catch and then jaws with pike s wagon <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> id slag and <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> remember he was the one that thomas beat last year and they have been pushin and shovin and john and fightin all night long on the outside the guide tailors heard enough about that plate or i have to go in the half mowrey foot making the tackle on tammy is former indianapolis teammate v you know we got a kentucky and the other thing this does and we talk about it all the time but you trap defensive linemen on the field in this day and age theyre not used to having to play seven eight nine plays in a row and all of a sudden the pass rush starts to disappear second and six the 41yard line off the play fake manon has to run away does and pain out of bounds with the first down i ran by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> got away from <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence</person> and moved the chains one of the things that dick lebeau said that bugs them more than anything else about <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> are those little steps those little moves like tom brady makes inside the pocket well that time <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> saw <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> coming inside and he made a big move to the outside from the 34yard line <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s going to get it away and the past is gonna be dropped intended from the goethe but it was <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry foote</person> who had him and he was able to get it away before he was in the grass second down it s starting to come with some pretty clever blitzes now taking the tackles down inside looping the linebackers around and you know even for a veteran guy like <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> dick lebeau is going to surprise them from time to time there is is 75 years old today about the 75 year old dick lebeau the pass is caught <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> makes the catch and that s a first time saving tackle by <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">keenan lewis</person> but it will be third down and worden now theyre trying to bring some pressure on the fly now that time lebeau called a blitz coming off <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> s left side he just took a little step off to the right we found <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> this is an impressive drive this is a <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> starting at the 20 and inside handoff it s mcgehee so they have gone from their 20 to the pittsburgh 21st now now weve seen this one before a little indianapolis colts trap that they used to run all the time a definite blending of <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> s offense from indianapolis and what they do here although hard on the drive this would be the tenth play of the drive and kuwaiti offensive coordinator calling in the plays to manage his paw and forward progress might net the first down for tammy little juggle but right there well see where they spotted they only give him the 11 yard line pressure put on <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> that time he s a little short of the first down second and one hayden threw that <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> way before tammy came out of his break it was just and he actually took a little off of that throw because he threw it so early run it to the six it is mcgehee and it will be first down and goal susan <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> as his safety blocker over here sin wave him on he spelled the blitz coming off the edge just to make sure he could get that handoff off at the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person>

the answer and the denver broncos get their first touchdown of the manager 5:16 left to the hand seven three denver well one thing the broncos talked about is getting paid and comfortable at the top of the game so they got them comfortable in the huddle but he s far more comfortable in the no huddle and there are the numbers sure lurk like that yeah 80 yards no huddle seven to three <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> is back to receive the kick and bang crater with a big leg since seven yards in and <person player="emmanuel sanders"

how many times have we seen that i dont know it how did he even define that but that is what he does is a quarterback probably better than anybody just keeps plays alive and eventually the receivers uncovered on the 18 sixteen silver s have one time im talking to the <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> yesterday and talking about when <person

merville has not been a factor either his <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> much i begin 14 outside and incomplete off the hands of wire trails on the play by <person player="wesley woodyard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">woodyard</person> third law we have seen a lot of these quick throws and i think due in large part now to the fact that <person player="marcus gilbert" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gilbert</person> s out and theyre having to play <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> and they dont want to sit there and wait all day for the pass rushers to get in on the other side <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> just by having outside gives him simone thirteen the whites in brown over there with him walking down the middle throws caught at the 4yard line and he does it again <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> makes the catch tackle there by <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">porter</person> itll be first and goal is get them up getting ready to clock it but you add the pump fake that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> does to all the movement and by in time oh my a defendant first and goal at first we were talking about it and here it comes to fruition again haley comes in as the coordinator and people say well how are these two guys going to get along will they change them when they go back to more of a ground attack and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> says hey you know what i gotta be me and that s that s me right there and that s a whole lot of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> but you see that pumpfake which just freezes defenders it s remarkable they can hold on to the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> i mean swings at that heart and they just pulls it down and throws the other direction second goal we fade is incomplete good coverage that time <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> blanketed by <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">porter</person> he will be third down in gold they tried <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">champ bailey</person> last time so this time <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy</person> or on the other side and you just wonder how many of these throws been and <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> have had he s only been there for a week but this is a major upgrade at the cornerback position to get <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> of course the super bowl hero picked off the pass against <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> to saints but these two guys for the good pair right now thirty seconds for over the minute wide open miller for the touchdown <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> as he is done so many times in his career just finds it open space right over the middle watch this little double move down in and then back out little fake <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe mays</person> jumps it free little clever there s another pump fake right there say what these guys go no huddle theyre pretty good arent they up and down the field we go that s a 79 yard drive 14 plays sweden s extra point makes it a 10 to 7 pittsburgh lead with 28 seconds left in the opening half on open a night steelers on top ten seven what s your assessment over all these opening half here i think this is just pregame warmup right here you get the feeling these two quarterbacks are settling in a little bit right now and theyre getting hot you know the no huddle seems to woken up both of these offenses it s been fun to watch the last ten minutes like a great heavyweight fight maybe a little feeling out process early on that s exactly right we will deliver the knockout blow a little opportunity to run that one back so let s see what <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> has in mind view with 28 seconds to timeouts we wouldnt imagine too much here would you against the number one ranked defense i dont know maybe take a little shot here oh leon you know if you could get an easy completion a screen a draw and you bust it out of there then maybe but i would say if pittsburgh had all of its time absolutely a different story but youre right theyre just gonna button it up right here take a knee and go to the locker room and that is the way the half ends maddening was 10 of 14 for 98 yards <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> was 9 of 16 for 120 at a touchdown pittsburgh <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">drew</person> first blood denver answered with that nohuddle be the yard attack and then <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> answered with 79 yards of his own coming up next meet on a halftime show with bob dan ronde and these messages from your nbc station i t his first shock ever this burger in primetime that s shant <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bailey</person> santa that s just an outstanding how sweet was that and you can follow your favorite team all season long go to itunescom slash nfl as we start the second half al michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya opening night in denver opening night of the <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> error 10 7 steelers on top but pittsburgh will get the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> as we start the third quarter that freighter descended down toward <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">chris rainey</person> and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> well start from the 20 before that let s go to michelle what would right tackle <person player="marcus gilbert" race="nonwhite" position="OT">marcus gilbert</person> questionable with a left knee working <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> has stepped in mike tomlin told me to halftime that <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> did get some work in the preseason a right tackle he feels confident in him theyre not going to give him any help on the line and by the way right guard <person player="ramon foster" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ramon foster</person> is also questionable because of an eye issue i asked mike tomlin if wed see some more no huddle in the second half and he said you could see a heck of a lot more if it looks as good as it did on that scoring drive ill bet thank you michelle here s <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> w gursky has gone over to right guard he s the backup center to pouncy the drive begins at the 20 yard line with a blitz and the pass is a little under wires put on by the denver defense second down in ten it s kind of interesting that we didnt see a lot of in that first half and granted there were too steep safety s a lot of times for the denver broncos but <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> last year the wide receiver started the year eight for thirteen on deep balls was just a terror but they finished the season over eight trying to throw it deep and havent hit one yet today or even five one down the field ross also coming off playing at altitude his <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> runs into his own man and then is able to plunge the hit for gaming three will be third down and seven for the steelers you know and one of the real positives for the denver broncos so far as they have pretty effectively shut down the running game of the pittsburgh steelers these big guys <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> by warren justin ban and inside have done their job now theyve got to get off the field on third and eight this is the moment for the secondary pittsburgh is were so talk about what im saying the her we might seal florida no homo youre seeing it right here single coverage on <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> if he wants it and now you got something for off pinnacle still for down thatll make it third down and 12 now and this is what makes it really tough because now defensively you have a chance to bring a blitz then they get forced to throw one of those quick balls you know the hot throws and all that you make a tackle on third and eight you dont do that on third and 12 a lot of times that s what you see defensible sent for over the middle and the catch is made out of the 33 by emanuel <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> for a first now where <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe mays</person> has got to be saying what was that number 51 running right down the middle of field emanuel <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> it flips him around the tightest of windows and then is just having a tremendous game now you know why they abandoned the running game in years past the 33 to the ground to <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> and <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> not to the 39 if you take a look at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s for his head now they started with a lot of quick throws to try and slow down the pass rush when the broncos were bringing some pressure just get it out of his hands and then we all know what came next some of the pump fakes and the scramble and the <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> being <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> and then there were the touchdown throws so that s what you get you slow down the pass rush with those quick runs and him a chance to do his thing second once again they picked it up he goes to miller and miller takes the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> for a first time to the denver 47 yard line eve miller great read that time by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> blitz coming off to his right over here and theyre gonna have to try and cover <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath</person> from inside out and they just cant get there that looks easy but when youre a quarterback to try and figure out exactly where that blitz is coming from and where that next defenders baby come from pretty tough nice play the drive of the second half sliding it s complete the first minimal gain if anything actually a losses <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> gets taken down let s call it no gain line of scrimmage womack starts got beat on that one but he stayed with it just long enough and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> was able to help him by escaping out to the outside here he is youre going to see the inside move put on by <person player="robert ayers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert ayers</person> almost gets there but then <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> has that little slide to help his tackle out again mohan second down and seven seventh way of the drive coming here it s an action upfront and they you got a whistle before the snap he had movement with lagar ski and vickersontour neutral zone infection 99 defense fiveyard penalty second penalty on bickerson the second one and theyre trying to get after this offensive line right now the pittsburgh steelers have no depth left whatsoever <person player="doug legursky" race="white" position="C">doug</person> larger skis in at right guard for a <person player="ramon foster" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ramon foster</person> and of course <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> in for <person player="marcus gilbert" race="nonwhite" position="OT">marcus gilbert</person> so that s it they only dress 7 theyd have to be a tight end if something were to happen from here there sits <person player="marcus gilbert" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gilbert</person> on the pittsburgh sideline second down and five two receivers to the left and three to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s right and he comes to the left side it s juggled it s taken by <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> and revin is able to get to the 40 yard line where he s tackled by <person player="rahim moore" race="UNK" position="DB">rahim</person> more will make it third down and three and it s one of the problems not having <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> in there when <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> is coming out of the backfield with his speed some of those catches and runs can turn into 25yard plays not quite the same threat with <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> coming out can they injury making the trip hope to have him back the stealing s due next week third and three good protection that begins to break down that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s gonna pack it in he s gonna die and is going to come up a little bit short of the first down theyre gonna spot it just inside the 38 yard line which is going to make it fourth down and each s now they may give him the bounce on this one let s see if he was touched at all before he goes down do you get the balance you should well there s contact there with the naked eye right now he s a little bit short of the first down then what if your tomlin he was touched before he went down even though he was able to stumble ahead for a few yards and yeah but i dont think that put him down though i think he regained his balance after that no let s that s an official s call and take a look at this so he starts to lose his balance i dont think anybody touched we could read mike tomlin s lips he was saying let s go if you can challenge the spot of your table but im gonna see where theyre gonna move it any closer to the 37 yard line so for the moment anyway theyre going to line up to go for it more than a couple of inches <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">isaac</person> bradley one of the best in the nfl at this ban is going to keep it himself well see where they spotted <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> sliding to his left do merville was there he only needed an inch or two and he s clearly got the first now where he put the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> down the crowd hates the spot his knees i didnt see you guys here to the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> i ever got to the young not sure either and again that s challengeable and should have gotten the balance on the prior one by fox and got a good one on this one from the 37 yard line tonight that s cologne you know you wonder if <person player="willie colon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">willie</person> cologne might be getting a little tired in this thin air here he hasnt played but one game and that was it right tackle and now he s asked to come over here at left guard and believe me i have know from firsthand experience this is a tough place on opening day easy to wear down first and 15 from the 41 through the middle <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> again going to that running game tonight again with <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> out redmon s been the main guy but he is carried the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> nine times for 17 yards so that s less than 2 yards per tote it s kind of interesting for me to watch <person player="willie colon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">willie</person> cologne playing left guard pulling around on some of his power plays to work in progress for him second twelve and the sack chris paris flagged down comes in on the blitz anita i believe a false start against pittsburgh by guards back right they should have a whistle before the snap is was one of the mouse to so the play was supposed to have been blown dead and it looked like a lot of the steelers offensive linemen on the right hand side had sort of stopped on the play right like they had heard the whistle so that s a sometimes you get good penalties that was a good penalty if john fox is trying to he figures the replacement refs much might decline and even though i cant the coin take a shot take a look at that since 516 was left in the first half <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> is napping on the sidelines for about 45 or 50 minutes county halftime even <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> hair is dry now john doesnt look convinced doesnt know you know and after that two men had drive from paid <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> and the broncos youre thinking oh boy the steelers defense is worn down but theyve been able to rest now counting halftime for probably 45 minutes second and 17 this drive has consumed only 37 yards and has taken almost seven minutes and the past is gone on a slant and <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> gets a big chunk of those 17 before he s tackled by <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">porter</person> that s going to make a third down and short it s a good read by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> again they bring the blitz off of that side which means that <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> had the inside slant to himself you can see the blitz coming inside there from raheem more been sought he s doing a beautiful job reading these but since tonight third down and four that s the quarter is over that s another first night as he goes back to <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> again found the open spot walnut 223 first and ten you know <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> is gonna have to give him so much room he knows who <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> is one of the fastest receivers in the game and you know you just have to back off of him if theyre willing to throw those little dinky underneath passes to <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> it s kind of hard to get up there it almost may invite him to come up place and bump and run now he s much closer here the 13th play of the drive this raucous burger coming in and it s incomplete for brown as <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> got a hand in there he got an adam s on each side of the field one for pittsburgh and one for denver and <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> the veteran safety came from cleveland last year breaking it up boy just fractionally behind here but that s some play you thought maybe if he could have led them a little bit more but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> took a pretty good shot just as he was releasing it got a lot on that throw he s played by <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> second down and 10 those press coverage and the students keep it on the ground as this is <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> taking it to the 16 yard line come on help lead the way pulling with a block and it s going to set up a key third down see here s what happens when youre worried about the speed you play your safeties back there so if youre <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> you say okay fine ill bring big <person player="willie colon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">willie</person> coluan around run a little power play pick up about seven an injustice spectators almost an hour now third and three and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> they get to him and the pass is incomplete <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> came in and then knocks <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> to the grass and income suiza that side you get <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> do marvel here they tried to cut on that play there s a little bit a strange time to cut <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> who probably doesnt weigh as much as <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> was trying to get him down on the other side and that is 237 weekend s gotta buy a few here comes a 35yard field goal attempt by season and that one is good so they have the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> for almost nine minutes and finally get to see panic again 6:05 one for the third the steelers are up by six sunday night football being brought to you by directv the seasons nfl sunday ticket is included when you switch my nissan innovation for today innovation for tomorrow innovation that excites by frost brewed coors light the world s most refreshing beer and by the samsung s galaxy s3 the next big thing is here denver colorado sunday night temperature today get up put the high 80s clear skies usual full house here <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> against not playing for the pittsburgh steelers missing head missing florence five straight pro bowls <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> coming back rehabbing his knee so theyre fishing two valuable defenders and couple arm offense is well including seven into the enzone off the goalpost the minute or so and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> will go back to work see it in september 20th at sunset vista was the final stop of the pga tour playoffs for the fedex cup the tour championship coverage beginning september 20th on golf channel continuing on the 22nd on nbc mcilroy one today in indiana he s on top tiger is second watney and mickelson the top four now from the 20yard line <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> has not seen the football for 57 minutes and it takes the snack 29 yard line <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">eric decker</person> actually took one snap before the half but it was a kneel down so the last time he took a real snap almost an hour ago and <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> comes off limping in second in inches matthew willis comes in hundred career touchdowns from in this one natan saw the blitz coming it goes hot to that side they get blockers out in front and it is goodbye and <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> is a nightmare for this pittsburgh steelers defense he himself has made more big plays than the entire league did a season ago just beautifully called by <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> he saw it he took advantage of it about to go on so <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> doesnt see the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> for almost an hour and then in 36 seconds he gives denver the lead again 14:13 broncos very exclusive company the 400 club dan marino through his 400 at 37 years in a couple of months old farm a little before that he was not quite 37 and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> 36 and a half roughly 616 days since his last touchdown pass fewest passes of anybody in the club s he figures to get marino this year if he stays healthy and then well see about farmers over a hundred away but in 36 seconds and two plays he gives denver the lead again and another touch back which means <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> starts again from is 20yard line when we come back to denver on sunday night football <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> led a nine minute drive that culminated with a field goal has eluded the stove s on the defense google mm 36 seconds so that denver back on the field again traffic is incomplete intended for <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio</person> at the 50yard line <person player="ronnie hillman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ronnie</person> <person player="rahim moore" race="UNK" position="DB">moore</person> was there with the coverage almost intercepted on that one coming all the way across the field youre going to see the safety <person player="rahim moore" race="UNK" position="DB">rahim</person> more undercut this one and just miss it it s a heck of a play it s one thing they love about raheem morey at so much speed to the back end of their coverage second in town passes knocked down again this time it is crazy border on a pass intended for emanuel <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> itll be third and ten to the steelers the <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> is learning that just because you cover a guy for three or four seconds doesnt mean anything got away with a little grab there but i really had a great shot at a pick on that affects the pittsburgh so has the ten from the 20 tosod blitz shut up front and the pass is dropped dont let the hellmuth <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> right there and here comes the flag he got whacked helmet the helmet unless the flag comes in no question about it and tomlin comes out to check on <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> raheem or helmettohelmet does it matter if it s not a those blowers up around my hammock you can see why the legs either one of them could have been her van automatic first down so you miss two interceptions that you have great shots for and then a helmet the helmet and all of a sudden the drive that would have bended is still alive so theyre gonna march it off it s a 15yard penalty took it back to the 20 but it s pretty simple then those are the blows of the 20 improve it to the 35 crowd booing i think a lot of the flood was passing the fears that was cold it wasnt you have more experience in refereeing youre getting to looks like it at the 35 and dumps it in the traffic and that s <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">chris rainey</person> waiting to catch tackled by bickerson so <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">rainey</person> seeing his first action ever to that obviously 5th round draft choice and at the university of florida and a guy who can not only make make his mark out of the backfield with big plays but a great special teams performer and a guy who s a kick blocker supreme he ever gets in the open field youll see a little man on any jill <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mays</person> and <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> i salute they famous by terrell <person player="cj davis" race="UNK" position="OG">davis</person> now theyre giving some pressure right over here with this <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> blitz off the side in addition to what s happening up the middle of field uggla gursky trying to hang on and where they really think highly at <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe mays</person> dont they eight are bad when he hits you you know youve been hit that was a big the toil of mike conlon s solar hed seen with a pair of sacks tonight third eye the 27th throws and that s going to be a big first down ace miller to the 50yard line so one and that he goes to that security blanket he s done it for years 23 yards out nut move and he is tearing up these linebackers this time it s <person player="wesley woodyard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wesley woodyard</person> whove been on the fake there was no reason to bite on the fake if he had caught that out would have been no problem and mack starts inside tight for his life they got it done let him catch the absolute he s eight or nine yards so forth instead now they give it to <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> goes and that s going to be a personal foul humor bill grabbed him by the facemask seven penalties tonight against pittsburgh four against denver and a number of others have been declined well the broncos got away with a face mask on the prior drive against <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> but this one s pretty easy to see and now you have to start to wonder is denver s defense despite the fact that they live and work here starting to wear down just a little bit theyve been out there forever especially so on opening day and as you can see the time of possession is 2 to 1 in favor of the steelers pittsburgh has run 54 plays and denver is run only 32 personal foul will move the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> over 32 yard line and this will be the eighth play of this drive so pittsburgh in the staff has had the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> for 23 plays and denver 2 that makes the catch it sucks running staying in bounds adding extra yardage and he might have a first down by getting to the 22 yard line leading rusher and preseason for the pittsburgh steelers you just get the feeling that <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan</person> wire is desperate for the opportunity to get a chance to play <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> not known as a very good tackler showed you exactly why there would fight though that <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person> had turned the five or six yard game into an 11 word game and a first down reading back then is the running back middle and incomplete jericho naturally first time he s been targeted tonight the intended receiver and benches i missed it it s on me second down yeah but then didnt take a shot that time because <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">isaac</person> redmond is going to save his quarterback off of that play fakes so many times those running backs dont see that blitzer <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> a nice pickup there you dont get the completion but you save your quarterback a shot see when it s the play in the quarter to the ground again on second and one to the 19 yard line and really no semblance of a rushing attack the dwyers had a couple of decent runs <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> 10 carries 21 yards hailey calling the play third and seven jack theyre real going the defense good protection and again it s pillar and again it s a huge third down conversion form to the 11yard line goes <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> were just running some little crossing routes over the middle and <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> coming out of the wide side of that bunch formation helping on do merville and then as the criss cross happens <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> able to make the catch and pick up another first down good protection again four catches 50 yards from willow tonight and pittsburgh s only touchdown inside wire well break it to the outside and well leap in for the touchdown <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> dwyre takes it into the end zone and pittsburgh is back on top it s amazing how many times today that the broncos have had this thing locked up inside and then the backs of the steelers just bounce it out and around and there s nobody there to have the contain that time <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> in position but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> man he started to look a little unstoppable now look at that knee the knee looks down this gets reviewed upstairs remember all scoring plays get review and when they see this this should come back so it s very clear that it s under review and it s going to wind up back at the two yardline so for the moment that purse still has the lead this wont be a touchdown it s going to be probably second and one at the when the crowd lets out a big cheer that s the good news the bad news is it s second down and one at the two yardline contact brings them down the down there fall at the two yardline and with 24 seconds now to go in the third quarter and they can theyre gonna wine the quark so they dont have to run a play and then is that s exactly what theyre talking about right now he s the play clock would go to 25 the game clocks at 24 youre gonna wind it here and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> is basically saying im not gonna run it into this end zone im gonna take it all the way the other way so in the quarter the broncos had the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> for 36 seconds were going to go to the fourth quarter in denver at the bronco sir at the top a light moment between <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bailey</person> 1413 broncos sunday night football resumes after this to look at downtown

quarter <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">chris rainey</person> is the tailback they give it to the up pack who s read minute he gets stood up behind the line of scrimmage that s fun and that s going to make it third down on a couple like <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> got beat across his face on that one just couldnt quite get the inside gap right here tried to reach there and just was no way devon bickerson got in there and made the play on retina third and two who s the back the pass goes to loras for the touchdown and wallis outside they had miller going to the corner of the end zone and pittsburgh does get its touchdown that was reversed on the call to take the lead again 1914 and navigo for two what a throw by been back shoulder on a slant <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> could not have covered that any better it was just absolutely perfectly executed by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> that was the only spot he gets a completion on that one as i say go for two here to make it a sevenpoint lead <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> flanks wide to the left three receivers set to the right is batter that s infant try to get it to pose for justin fan and maybe done yeah tipped away to make it a fivepoint you this sunday night football brought to you by geico 15 minutes to save you 50% of the car insurance by tide and trusted by whole 32 nfl teams by audi truth in engineering and by at&amp;t the nation s largest 4g network a tmz rethink possible in denver now pittsburgh up by five with 14 11 to go in the fourth his times were about an hour and 20 apart from the plays he was involved in one of which was open me go ahead touchdown at sunday night to san francisco we go bertha s game of the week the detroit lions coming from behind the day stafford leading that late drive to beat st louis against the 49ers who knocked off the <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> bay packers and of course this is the renewal of the handshake in a manner of speaking sports <person player="jim leonhard" race="white" position="DB">jim</person> harbaugh last year in detroit can we all get along next sunday night throw the shotgun on first down who those minister baby for a gate of nain think about the nfl today i mean just look the wild endings all over the place philadelphia over cleveland detroit over st louis 49ers knocking off <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> bay it never ceases minnesota somehow wrangling one from jacksonville are you predicting something here another great one the game forty yard line on the second and one he gets 11 yards in the first now when <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> is playing the deep free safety i think that <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> feels a little more secure in calling some of these run plays so you dont get that xfactor down around the line of scrimmage now it looks like theyre gonna flipflop back there theyll bring palmolive back down in the action the outside here s thomas <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> misses him with an arm tackle at the 50yard line remember the stiff arm that marius thomas put on <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> for the gamewinner and over time this guy is six foot three 235 pounds even <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy</person> coho and a little trouble wrestling down the chains again is <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">knowshon moreno</person> takes it to the 48 yard line again you see <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> playing back here deep and so payton deciding that s a good time they are together as an offensive player more he is 15 yards away from the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> and half your eye <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> minnesota 43yard lonnie was their leading receiver last year of course a team that loved to run with tebow at quarterback second and four <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> not letting the defense rest for the 31 at a first down any questions you have about <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> s arm you can just put them in your hip pocket now watch this throat all the way across the field for hash drops it in their view and he has not been stopped since this is this is been near perfection 52:19 on the night 206 yards it s he s a little high and took <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">eric decker</person> louis on the coverage there there was definitely a little pushing and shoving but say i thought that is a pretty good nocall least the first glance let it look at second guns then soft second at 10:00 to the outside and that is caught and getting up and trying to get the first down his <person player="jacob tamme" race="white" position="TE">jacob tamme</person> man he does so tammy was about a yard shawn was able to get up and pick up two extra yards to move to change wellpaid man he didnt even step into that throw his feet were pointed up the field he sort of did to sidearm slingshot and <person player="jacob tamme" race="white" position="TE">jacob tamme</person> yes remember his old pal from indianapolis it s his receiver at the five and this is <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> taking the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to the one and he s down there the play was whistled dead at the oneyard line for a first and goal and manic says that s keeping up let s not let him change yeah im not sure he was down on this play let s take a look close the <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> wants to get the play off before there s any possibility of a challenge wines up as a no touchdown call just short of the goal line he saw what <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> was doing tomlin wanted a challenge there s the flag but once a play was run the next play was run you cannot challenge it he cant go back and time one s going to try to say that he wanted the challenge before him now youre gonna have a real brouhaha here when was the flat what was the challenge flag thrown here it comes there it goes just at about the time the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was snapped and did any officials see it wouldnt matter his day was down right anyway it s not going to matter except for the fact that it would cost pittsburgh a timeout right which may matter and a challenge he reached let s burn and of course you hear the the broncos all saying they ran to play well in any event the place that s gonna stand at the oneyard line we come back after all this puzzle ride we think tomlin talked himself into a challenge but this is still not going to come up pittsburgh s way after all this it s going to cost them a timeout and one of their two challenges because <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> s knee is down as he has possession of the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> and the way we see it the spot the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> at the oneyard line first and goal yeah and they get first down back because they didnt score the touchdown so it would have been second down so there s really no positive that comes out of this for pittsburgh here comes the flag remember here comes youll see the flag coming in there was the snap simultaneous the official has to see the flag before the snap now there is the possibility that another official not the referee saw the flag before the snap and then they get together and say yes i did see him throw the flag first oh here comes the door you ruling on the field is confirmed apply now first down on the oneyard line so it all turns out in denver s favor and john fox of course who was livid saying how can he make that call after the fact lines up is the beneficiary in every way and now because pittsburgh went for the twopoint conversion on the other end if the broncos score a touchdown theyll go for two and try and stretch this thing to three so a lot of giveandtake here good stuff 9:34 remaining and regulation this is a four and a half minute drive have started back at the 20 after a touchback three rushes and five pass plays on his ride man he s gonna set up initially in the gun with mcgehee right there the first things first when the steelers have really sort of shown theyre going to play bump and run man coverage and payton had time to go walk out and say something to his wideout touchdown <person player="jacob tamme" race="white" position="TE">jacob tamme</person> is 14:8 let s see if he controls this <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> going to the ground is it over the line of scrimmage and he s down i think he does control it all the way right there over the plane bottom hits the ground and that looks like a touchdown but the presnap was interesting <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> was standing at the line of scrimmage and the defense was already set for pittsburgh i think he came out and changed the play he saw the bump and run mantoman ran the pick play over here and got the touchdown all of his royals from indianapolis really silly going for two to try to make it a threepoint dean is caught for the conversion mcgehee broke the plane on brings them back again 923 left while opening night in damper inside to play fantasy football go to nflcom slash fantasy and sign up on this sunday night back and forth we go denver with a lead by three and later just one behind your <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">rainey</person> thought about it wanted to do it was told him up to back to the touchdown we go now they were all sitting around waiting for the referee to signal the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> ready but the defense it set itself the offense did so payton said look were gonna run the little pick play over here he changed the play before the referee even signaled the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> ready for play now you can see the referee come in but the look he got was good enough so he does the sprint out that way easy touchdown they taking advantage of every opportunity including a slow mark of the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> is the one event costume back the other way and rainy turns it into a sevenyard gain as it begins this drive by taking it to the 27 yard line itll be second down and three that was a deliberate play marques pouncy the center started to his right and then is going to circle back around this way theyre going to try and take advantage of chris reigning speed to the outside picked up seven inside nine minutes deploy going deep welcome <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> with <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> down the sideline it will be third down and three one of the rare times down that they come with a single safety this is straight oneonone coverage and <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> just learned whatever it was they were paying him that s one of the toughest assignments in the nfl and he played that beautiful they notice on the saints 33 the <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bailey</person> on laws this time to the right side as well theyre doing the coverage and then slings it over the middle of it is broken up by <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy</person> for room is by blowing the coverage it s fourth down they mix up over here and they dont cover <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> running down the middle of the field theyve got him for a touchdown vin never saw it they messed up the switch off had to freebie and just missed it this is <person player="jim leonhard" race="white" position="DB">jim</person> <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> bringing it back up to the 38 yard line so dental with a three point lead and the football they they seem to go well on tuesday night a new kind of family with the same old issues comes to nbc check out the new normal tomorrow after the voice and the series premiere tuesday night right here on nbc how do they do that that s great the future olympians over there back we covered the 37 and since we seem to see what denver s going to do on this drive in terms of huddle or no here s mcgehee theyve had so much success tonight running typical <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> nohuddle all of their scoring coming off of that but now at this particular point you want to begin to use the clock so maybe it s like it used to be in indianapolis then go up to the line but in a lot of a lot of the play clock expired second in five the third and two is mcgee he gets taken down by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> up at the 45 yard line it s kind of interesting to me and i know it hasnt been every time but it seems like every time <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> has been back <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> has checked to a run he s back again 32 and now they hand the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> off and it s going to be a first now of the shoot coming loose by <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moreno</person> <person player="knowshon moreno" race="nonwhite" position="RB">knowshon moreno</person> the backup loses his shoe but picks up the first down to the 48 yard line and <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">lance ball</person> number three back now comes in thanking <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> in the gun took him down to seven minutes for with a beak hole through the middle it s been a result in a first down contingent on the spot is alan and pola malo make the tackle they just lose that xfactor the move of field and he plays like a linebacker he slices through he s where you dont expect him to be and now he s making tackles ten yards from the line of scrimmage now he s coming up from the 41 yard line so he throws it off to the right side away from paul thomasson to take care of what in case she does handle of going again <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">lance ball</person> fourth year back out of maryland ran for over 400 yards last year in reserve role alama give you your analyst hat that s exactly what happened <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> was showing blitz so tomorrow s thomas comes down said that he cant he s gonna come shuffling down here to make sure <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> doesnt get there second down and eight <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> slinging it to the outside and getting free for a first alice <person player="jacob tamme" race="white" position="TE">jacob tamme</person> to the 20yard line well you just cant beat him you come up and bump and run he s going to check to the pig play come down this time hit the wheel up the sideline to <person player="jacob tamme" race="white" position="TE">jacob tamme</person> just no way for <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> to stay with it he knew exactly where it was he just looked off the safety and bingo now with the 20 on first down five and complete passes tonight no changes sling into the outside and getting back to the line of scrimmage is mcgehee as he takes you to the 20yard line ticking down to five minutes to play in regulation i dont know how <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> s next to him but his brains doing fine yes he is pick this defense apart now he comes under center on second down in time yes day i think it is in the field now theyre gonna switch back and use a lot of time off the playground with the game clock right the city wants to do perfectly perfectly executed these to that point and in this point as well as the day he was some tough running takes it to the 11yard line to make it third down and one tackle there by worlds with four and a half to play pretty nice job on the outside i think that was <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">eric decker</person> that came down and sealed it and he put on the tape of these denver broncos he s right out splott third down pullum oliver s running running right for the center for one of those dive over kind of plays paetynn songza backed out of there too smart for that here he comes he goes yep big pleco nothing he takes the time out of here with 3:56 has he really been away a year doesnt seem like it <person player="nate irving" race="UNK" position="LB">nate</person> <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> was under center and he was watching number 43 almost exclusively on that one his poem oh here you see him coming down here bopping and painting said ill hold on hold on and then pull him out of sight he s gonna back off now he s gonna come over from this side he didnt like that one either third down and two hell go not enough here you dont want <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> to be able to win with a touchdown going the other way 355 each seen two timeouts thirteen stole them all over again and tammy comes inside to take care of that and he ever whistle before the snap i think that it delay lay a teen offense fiveyard penalty goku bad that hurts off a timeout but it was the idea that <person player="jacob tamme" race="white" position="TE">jacob tamme</person> was going to have to come down and handle tori paulo malo here we go right here he s coming down to help clock goes to zero good call by the officials so fulla mono even though he hasnt made a play they havent snapped the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> that makes a third down and seven they pick it up in the passes with a flag clone incomplete intended for <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">keenan lewis</person> with him stride for stride <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">eric decker</person> made just enough people move back to the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> get this call every time as a receiver if you show an effort to go back to the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> watch at the top of your screen there the hands on he tried to get back the official determined then he had enough of a push and a little grab and that is a humongous column in top close call too late push force control stand up <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> as it takes along through the seven yard line now the steelers have to begin to think about taking a timeout but more importantly theyve got to stop him here and hold on to a field goal that s what it amounts to and there a timeout as we go toward the end of this game because of that challenge that didnt work earlier second goal to stokely in the back of the endzone covered well setting up a third and goal they tries to go to stokely there and youve got to think anytime weve gotten the oneonone situations it s been stokely he s been looking for if the bowen is sorry fifth birthday look like nothing here stoking slot left chalice wide left <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">decker</person> wide the good shot for tomorrow back of the day long eva s own read now for free sign he goes and that s incomplete trying to work the back solder of <person player="eric decker" race="white" position="WR">eric</person> deckard <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> covering on the play and they will have to settle for a field goal and it would still be a one possession game boy both of these <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">keenan lewis</person> doing everything he can to fight for it no call there no way and that is the correct call just two guys battling for the football and that is huge defensively because now <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> will have a chance of winning that traitor for a 26yard field goal and well make the store 25 to 19 with exactly three minutes to go well weve had a lot of stuff tonight obviously with <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> looking like <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> on his way back and a lot of credit go to the pittsburgh steelers obviously youre playing the game without <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> you playing the game without <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> s youre playing a game without <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> you playing the game with your offensive line is banged up and mixing and mastering pretty good yeah it is and you know <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> is almost a bit of a miracle he s here for procedures on his neck he says he begged doctors to tell him you cant play anymore youre in more danger than what you would have been otherwise and yet he said none of them ever said that to me so im playing maybe back to when he was with indy throwing that thing just under 50 miles an hour tonight say time to throw maybe a couple of miles an hour off the fastball but i think they can live with it here in the mile high city when to a slider and he said you know every day i go to rehab so i understand im still a work in progress at this point i have not a finished product but the product looked pretty sharp tonight i dont think <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> is the kind of guy who would ever say he was a finished brother pretty good point yeah pretty good for always learning always something new nobody works arteries in coach nine yards in wakeeney <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">rainey</person> wants to come out at the nfl right trying to come out of my store the track yeah his foot was actually on the back line couldnt have brought it out anyway he was looking for a cromartie run cairo pretty close yeah little half step here we go you cant ask for anything more than this you got a chance to see one of these in super bowl once they against arizona haley saw two at a time three minutes weve got two timeouts and the twominute warning and a low snap forward throws which brown and once again been turning junk into a jewel first down and it s just remarkable that he can take a snap off the ground pick it up find the coverage find the receivers and make this kind of throw it s remarkable and we have an injured bronco and a little helmettohelmet hit but at that point i dont believe he s defenseless now he s sort of in a running position and so i think that s a good nocall dare his <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> who is down on the ground but up now sitting up flexing sysm okay and of course has to come out for at least one ploy and he is there nickel guy so that does in this sort of two minutes situation if he cant go back in they take the next step down the ladder where there is so much speed on the field for the pittsburgh steelers these receivers so talented <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> so it s only carter coming calluses spawn <person player="jim leonhard" race="white" position="DB">jim</person> <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> is also in the game the veterans safety first in 10 from the 39 yard line and for that one is complete in the direction of <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> and they went right for <person player="tony carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tony carter</person> s man at that point second out of 10 the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> fly out of his hand with that pump frayed i mean it really just looks like as a defensive player this looks like a pass not that yeah there s one little pump here comes a big pump it s amazing his hand is humongous viserys comes back in the game just for the lung play sucking down a 10 daily playing press coverage on <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> not letting him get the release at the bend looks that way tracey poirier where we seen that before got the shoot the dancing with a pic of <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> walk this one up with a pic of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> what a game for <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> tonight little inside release didnt like it arrows back outside you can see <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">porter</person> looking back at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and there he goes and somewhere <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> is saying see <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> got me too im going to go for two here why do you want to make it 14 it s 12 right now man exam were gonna put the <person player="lance ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> down going to go for two and for a 43yard return and boy let the expectations go up in denver they were skyhigh anyway but after beating the pittsburgh steelers going to be a lot of super bowl talk around there takes us to the twominute warning with 158 left the opening night in denver 31:19 were back for the conversion here the officials mistakenly call for the twominute warning even though the clock is 158 you had a scoring play which of course gets reviewed there was no question about whether it was a touchdown or not but you have to do the conversion before the twominute warning even at 158 so a blown call 106 lee so here s your twopoint conversion with mcgehee in the backfield landing sending those three stats tomorrow he s going to come in but they keep it on the ground and they keep mcgehee out of the end zone that s <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry</person> foot so theyve already taken the twominute warning and we have 158 to play coming up after the game it s the wendy s postgame report michelle will interview the stars of the game and then bob <person player="tony carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tony</person> and michael break it all down and chris and i will take a look ahead to a very intriguing matchup at candlestick next week with detroit going to san francisco well <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> youre going to be able to see he s going to look to his left and get a good you there was no doubt in his mind what was going on he saw <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> there and just tried to squeeze one end that he really didnt have to do but you cant say he threw it blindly put staring right at it the whole time just thought that he could thread it in there and obviously big mistakes so pittsburgh needing two touchdowns down by 12 but what a difference <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> face you have <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">champ bailey</person> on your team so the other guys going to get a lot of throws over that way and <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy</person> word and i making them think maybe you ought to throw back over to <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">champ bailey</person> side <person player="champ bailey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bailey</person> telling this the other day he said i call my defensive line and look stop the run we will take care of the pass trust me pretty good job not complete stoppage of the run but a much better job by the broncos defensive front seven than what we saw a season ago well the steelers are averaging less than three yards per rush tonight and thatll win you a lot of ballgames you hear the defense ill tell you though you got to give some credit to the offensive line of the pittsburgh steelers the pressure really has not been a major factor <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> de merville <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> theyve not gotten there and this is a bangedup line that played with their final five guys available for much of the day on a winding with five and theyre gonna get cold and spinning man speaking the <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> for reals well they put the tight in that way but <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> under estimating the quickness of <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> off the edge and just couldnt get there miller ducks underneath and finally gets to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> s so second down 15 <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> makes attached itll be third down in about five from the 25yard line and it s 15 left in reg atlanta for their next game that s monday jetts go into pittsburgh under a minute now then is going to go down at the 15 yard line with villages been a tea bowl bringing everybody off the edge he s going to go back inside and get the sack dug litter ski kind of got lost on that one we get a tebow out of this one oh we do a little tribute to the guide of leather playoff game over pittsburgh last year though weve hit the milehigh solute in a tebow tonight now what was the stat though that tim tebow was the first quarterback to ever win a playoff game in his first or second year and then move to another team right but he completed only ten passes last year in that game
