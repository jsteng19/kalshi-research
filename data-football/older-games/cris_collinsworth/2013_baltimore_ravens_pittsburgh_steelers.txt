============================================================

to go with michele tafoya well coach you started the season oh and for but since then have won five of your last seven what have been the significant factors behind that turnaround i just think the single of focus of the guys just having the ability to zero in on the challenge of the week and and and void out the noise as obvious is a lot of noise but it comes with the kind of start that we have but theyve done a nice job but just being billie tough this is steelers ravens and in recent history is to be our guide this will be decided by a field goal or less how does the winning team generate an edge in this game you know you dont deserve enough negativity early on i think that s kind of been what has marked the flow of these games we got to avoid some negativity obviously weve got to make some plays down the stretch to the kicking game s gonna be big coach thank you thank you and the steelers will be without starting defensive tackle steve mcclendon the knight missing his first game because of an ankle injury theyll also be without linebacker who s missing his third straight game with a cat issue but they do get back defensive end <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> who missed the last two games with plantar fasciitis all right thank you michelle the bearded one there he is number 99 baltimore won the toss elects to defer <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> having a great year a very demonstrative kicker they kick off to emanuel <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> none of the steeler wideouts in on this chilly night in baltimore with a bouncing ball its fielded for yards in and <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> will down it there let s take a look at the pittsburgh star do <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> miami redhawks lady im bill michigan state <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> west virginia <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite"

david de castro stanford <person player="marcus gilbert" race="nonwhite" position="OT">marcus gilbert</person> university for students of late have been using a lot of extra lineman six offensive lineman on occasion right now in a situation where as you can see youve got three line into the white in know she goes jericho khatri who has scored seven touchdowns issues you know the the rookie running back levy on <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> who was their number two draft ice at a michigan state tackled by <person player="haloti ngata" race="nonwhite" position="DT">haloti ngata</person> i think a loading on is feeling better right now right over the nose tackle just takes a swim move and gets in the backfield and when he is athletically active like that to go along with that huge size of his on the offensive line it s a reconstructed revamp raven defense you know that <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray</person> lewis is retired it reads a lot of guys were gone from last year but they have really picked it up away the optimism around here to the outside and another reason for the optimism were plays like that ladarius weather gets him behind the line of scrimmage so two runs and a loss of two here third down and 12 banalakis berger fifth career start at baltimore steelers in those starts averaging only eight but he s 2 &amp; 2 as a starter in this third down to the light mongo s go so queen runs for the rookie and then of course it s pittsburgh in baltimore so youll see a lot of activity like that after the whistle tonight still trying to get the bunk piled fleet blakeman and his drew will have their hands full were a minute and a half into the game and we already have this i like it i hate to say it but this is what makes this game so great and it goes look at the hole in the middle here <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> saw it they stack everybody to the outside to try and get pressure so he goes okay im just gonna turn around and hand the thing off but in talking with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> last night and he said youd see stuff like that <person player="chris canty" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chris canty</person> sort of a mile drive and then a couple of shoves and the big guys get into it and we kind of got a pittsburgh baltimore game breaking out all over here happy holidays matt mcbride who was picked up in the middle of the season is the pittsburgh punter <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> to return the kick and he is always at work big booming kick <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe</person> answer was mine brings it back out to the 28 yard line tackled by antoine <person player="valentino blake" race="UNK" position="DB">blake</person> and then let s take a look at the baltimore offense <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> delaware <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> new rochelle high school toys smith marilyn <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> and mighty lang tigers small and brown university of georgia at dixon oregon ducks <person

player="gino gradkowski" race="UNK" position="OG">gino</person> grant kowski delaware marshall yonder iowa michael war university of ole miss so baltimore all season long trying to get some running game going strong with play action and franco going there s contact but there s no flag it s a little bit under thrown <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> was there <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> had beaten you but the ball hung and the pass is incomplete second time i tell you where the day got away with back into him to slow him down he knows he s beaten and then flips his head around the last minute so he doesnt get called for pass interference just a good veteran play <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> was great last week probably got away with a little something on that one but you got to give him some credit a very intelligent player ravens beat the jets 9 to 3 here on sunday the jones scoring the only touchdown of the game play clock at one out of the pistol on second down in town to give it to <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> unbelievably averaging less than three yards per carry tackled by paulo malo so <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> had a postseason for the ages he s terrific in this stadium 37 and 8 drafted in 2008 and started as a rookie he and john harbaugh coming in together and he parlayed that offseason into a 120 million dollar contract and john harbaugh has taken this team to the postseason in each of his years at the helm and at least one postseason win in every one of those seasons third and seven <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> gets it away it s caught on the outside by brandon and he asked enough for a first down one of the interesting parts about the pittsburgh s defense now is their great play maker <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> is now almost playing a linebacker position and dime defense and one of the things in talking to the ravens about that is it takes him out a little bit of that xfactor role that he does so well where you just dont know where he s going to be back in it linebacker here again on <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> is made by m<person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> as we take a look at that pittsburgh defense <person player="cameron heyward" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cameron</person> hayward be ohio state university vicki <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> missouri <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> worlds lunchpail defense lauren stebbins florida state <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> university of southern california <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> jordan a tsquare universe <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> lou <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> the state university b<person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> lsu <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> the citadel like the ravens a lot of changes with pittsburgh no jean cherish and okc hampton from last year and on second down there goes 55 yards so james on his first bomb have marked them a little short the crowd thinks he s into the end zone and now theyre going to mark the ball of the oneyard line where this allen makes the tackle take a look the safety in the middle appealed i believe it s <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> comes up underneath this route and <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> who has been seeing a lot of receivers in the last couple of weeks go by him and they just take shots down the field it s exact same way they played the game last week and just came up with a lot of big plays and now the ball down to the one one official came in to signaling touchdown now this is a score and not a scoring play so youd have to challenge it if bar ball wanted to he could challenge that it was a touchdown but instead he takes his chances on the first and this is <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> who wont get there so it s going to be second down and goal well id say a <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> this is sort of the opposite of what we see around the national football league with the baltimore ravens so many teams around the nfl now or throwing those little short quick passes all over the field in the quick screens and youll see a lot of that from pittsburgh tonight and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> and the ravens almost the opposite they just take it it s full of deep and take their chance five minutes into the game playaction <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> dancing and he s going to get sacked back at the 7 yard line <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> worlds is there but he s really come on he s playing extremely well of late and that s going to make it third down and goal one of the things that they do in protections with <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> is they expect him to be able to double reed here and here and sometimes it gets them in trouble that time <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> worlds just beat him around the edge so that first down and goal from the one all of a sudden doesnt look so good i split <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> wide to the right empty the backfield they go 5 wide on the third and goal closed car touchdown <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> this time it counts for sure so dori smith who looked as if he was in the first time spotted inside the one bar bar can smile right now otherwise he would have questions whether we should challenge that spot inside the one but it s all academic at the moment touchdown well m<person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> is going to be upset with this one because you see him waving his arms he started inside jumped to the outside basically telling <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> here you get a free release the inside because i have help in there the help did not help and they got in touch to <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> for the point anchors so the ravens first drive 71 yards each plays on a third down to smith for the td a mouthwatering a little bit now if we love being out on thanksgiving night doing the dares at all effort you do miss that turkey and we were stuck with brussels sprouts but what are you gonna do okay so here we are in baltimore and thanksgiving night seven to nothing the ravens on top the ravens in this series the team that scores first is twenty seven and eight deck is fielded in the end zone as <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> fix to <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> and <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> brings it back to the 21 yard line before losing his helmet then goes back to work on pittsburgh second drive when we come back

position="RB">leveon bell</person> and it s been a couple of years since pittsburgh had a real <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> count on slapping or saying that but

<person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> carlin long shot develop into something extremely special his partner willing to throw his first pass of the night and it s over the middle in his court getting away is <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> who leads the league in receptions that is his 81st of the season he was able to spin away from lord darius <person player="lardarius webb" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webb</person> and move the chains just coming right across the formation but you hit on it al <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> now leads the nfl in receptions had a monster year <person

<person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> it was up to him to fill that void now we get a little wildcat going for the pittsburgh steelers it was not well maybe here comes it looked like <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> was going to take the snap wildcat has been subject to a lot of talking ball the ball on the other side so <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> had flanked out then came in chris keith he is able to knock it down at six seven and thatll make it second down say it <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> s one that ball tips straight up in the air watch cant he he s not even russian he just playing that wherever the passing lane is and somehow that thing fell right in the middle about six guys ravens used a lot of walk that last week on the other side as you look at subs with his sights set on raucous board the first walk out of buoyed by the steelers in this town he spins around as <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> the <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> gets taken down at the 35 yard line but cory <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> todd haley in his second year as the pittsburgh offensive coordinator how many stories have been written about him then and you know todd is saying it is so overdone it is so ridiculous what do you think i think they do all right i dont think he s <person player="bruce gradkowski" race="white" position="QB">bruce</person> arians in the minds <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> he s his dear friend and vacation home together somewhere close in georgia but you all right it leticia time at after those comments hi im dan rooney id like to thank god for our many blessings and ask him to bring world peace i am art rooney id like to wish our many fans around the world a happy thanksgiving as well as our servicemen and women around the world founding families and there they are and the the unthought to the left of your screen is art son dan and dan s grandson as the former ambassador to ireland back in the states full time here the first flag of the game offside from the left side of the defensive line as <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> cant hold on and gets hurt on the play <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> do merville was jumping offside it gave pittsburgh a free play here s politte <person player="valentino blake" race="UNK" position="DB">blake</person> beside defense number 58 in the neutral zone of the snap fiveyard penalty still third down boy this hurts on every level you get <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> hurt but this is a freebie for an nfl receivers you get the offsides penalty so been rightly takes his shot and that is an easy catch that is not exactly a diving layout that s one he s going to make but he smacked his head on the ground i think we saw it sort of whipped down and i can tell you most of the tough concussionlike symptoms i had as a player go from exactly that your head somehow whipping onto the and conceive it took its toll bring marcus lee take his spot he s a work our state third round draft choice its third and two then a little shovel pass and that is caught by jericho contrary having a great season been around a long time ten years a lot of those with the jets but he scored seven touchdowns this year he s become like a second security blanket after <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> like this play called watch <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> do merville he sees <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> coming out and he has to respect that dump it down to <person player="jerricho cotchery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cotchery</person> underneath clever play at the 46 pittsburgh going nohuddle something theyve been great effectiveness in recent weeks which helped turn their season around after that started on four in september got this down five ravens both dressed in black tonight men in black taking care of my head a bow is the first to hit him second and nine now one of the matchups will watch tonight <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beecham the left tackle a <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> who really has had to sort of fill in took over for <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> and drill <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> is the <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> he s going to have to try and slow down in this no huddle they hope that at the very least the no huddle were down some of these pass rushers cuz to the very best on the baltimore ravens the steelers of sandy s sex back in that commission just a couple of plays it s second down and which coming again where he gets it away that s bought by me the 41yard line goes the venerable tightend <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> in his ninth season in the league he was their number one draft choice back in oh 5 and nearly a lot like <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> witten i mean he s always there yeah and he s such a big part of it you know he s coming off the knee injury last year and he just seems to be getting a little healthier each week their mvp use the best player you know bullets left in the quarter the ravens have had the ball once and lead seven to nothing and squirting through was bill nothing they were initially that he was able to turn no gain into a gain of about four second and six take a look at this the ravens defense through week till first and sacks second best in third down conversions first in red zone defense and seventh in points allowed this is a team no louis louis ellaby getting rid of a lot of guys in southern touchdowns they gave up on opening since then only ten passing touchdowns in the ensuing after that nightmare in the rockies and walkest burger go an incomplete good tight coverage on <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> by <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">corey</person> gray who had two interceptions against the jets three days ago good read by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> you got the oneonone coverage in <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> at the end of this route watch him he kind of slows down to try and pin gram in i think if he just kept running i went ahead and right in the hands seemed kind of slipped to him and tried to create a little space for him to go catch that ball if he just runs underneath it i think he has a touch voice on the third and six from the 38yard line which here and then stringent to the outside intended for jericho <person player="jerricho cotchery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cotchery</person> james ahead oboe on the safety blitz fourth down <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> came to the outside but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> shoulda stayed put here he comes out here and i think he would have been blocked because <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> did a good job picking up the safety blitz he had time but i think that pressure flashed in his face and made him feel like he had to bail out of there matt mcguire picked up about a month ago ladarius lip after a sheet requirement on <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> cowboy kicker one will bounce it to five and be down but about the 10 yard line black going cover to go to work that s fine thanks everybody seven nothing really tonight show coming up some of the guests will include the voices christina aguilera baltimore inner harbor they light it up on thanksgiving night <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> is now in as the running back and he takes it and gears up to the 14 yard line well <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> here we go again a little push you show me this was the case after the second or third play of the game weve got new players in this rivalry but the same result yes traditionally no other more than twenty yards from the line of scrimmage last year <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> s mine touchdown pass is that a postseason he was spectacular on their run to the lombardi trophy with five touchdown passes this year in 57 only one touchdown pass on passed more than twenty yards from scrimmage that was last week though tonight he came within the yard of doing it again with <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> making the catch and this would well there was the big throwdown to <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> they get them in line for the first touchdown looked awfully close to a touchdown their dude in it but this has been an interesting year theyve almost had to throw deep because of some of the losses of his possession receivers <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis</person> pitt in anquan boldin and even <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> hasnt been home <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> he fights his way before you first out but this is the baltimore running offense this year it s amazing when you look at it the league average is always around for this year it s 42 per rush but the ravens <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> is averaging 29 there is <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray</person> pearce is averaging 27 the team is under 3 as well in the 27th in rushing yards per game and next to last only jacksonville is worth that yards per carry talking about no london game the <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> breaks off about an 11 yard scamper well you know there s a lot of things different on this team my core over here on the righthand side making that block but no <person player="brian arnfelt" race="UNK" position="DE">brian</person> mckinney they trade for <person player="eugene monroe" race="nonwhite" position="OT">eugene monroe</person> here he is over here and to let you know assembly their outstanding guard who were all picked parts of that playoff run last year no longer here or hurt 34 has dropped <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> cutting to the outside running an out route second down and 10 with 48 seconds remaining and there is dick lebeau the great dick lebeau at the age of 76 55th consecutive season as a player or coach in the hall of fame was a great defensive back primarily with detroit 14 games on thanksgiving day with wise alaska alaska recall night like tonight 37 degrees and ask alaska circuit at 10:00 to the 39yard line he goes tackle by camera hayward and our third scrum of evening and not the last that a split decision going so far but these teams understand exactly what this game is about i mean this is almost an elimination game not truly the <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> and <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> on the outside going at it a little holding going on and then a little of that and a little of that you know wide receivers are pretty roughandtumble guys now excuse me yeah theyd like to sort of stir that stuff up and then look the linemen to help oh my gosh with baltimore takes a timeout and the the well the quarter comes to an end and they got the timeout before the end of the quarter it s gonna be third and five when we come back tonight s aerial coverage is being brought to you by geico buy a book downtown baltimore m&amp;t bank stadium near downtown al michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya happy thanksgiving and it s been a great day for you this is pretty tasty dessert we have second quarter well start before the baltimore timeout the clock had expired so you had the end of the quarter not charged at the timeout we start with a 35 and it s a first down as the pass is caught here his second grab of the night and that takes them all over the 41 yard line well weve seen <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> over the years not a young man by any means a little bit of that in and out route you see some wes welker of the world doing this kind of thing but guys that can move the chains on third down and five are always going to be valuable no matter how old they are still a 37 is the oldest wide receiver in the league races back in as the running back out of the pistol to the 41 nice got hurt second game of the season said it s the first time he s really been hurt hip injury and said he just didnt feel right until the end of october well if you saw the play he kind of went down in the heap he wasnt even hit just handed the ball was going around the right side and just went down he thought he broke his hip he went off to the sideline and goes guys i think i broke my hip he said believe you have to be walkin if you broke your hippety he s never pulled a muscle in his life i couldnt believe it when he was telling us that ive never heard of a football player say that second an eighth and the pack we cutting across was the tie then ed dixon there s still <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis pitta</person> hope to have him back when they play a week from sunday and it will be third down and a b you want <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> went to the baltimore sideline holding his hand and you know the ravens are going more and more to this no huddle as well they they really want <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> to begin to do a little of what eight manning and tom brady have done we need the defense that s the right call let him go black on third and eight bangs in the pocket that pass is incomplete trying to get it underneath to <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> and in comes the punting unit and as they work on the hand or arm of or risk the <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> on the sideline so much the big play threat first now it helps a little bit <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> back in action so you get that balance effect on both sides of the ball but here s one of the more exciting young players in the league this <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> his dad s in the arena league hall of fame touchdown eddie brown and he s been lighting it up and <person player="sam koch" race="white" position="P">sam</person> cooke found a pen inside the 20 and he does at the 15yard line try makes a fair catch early second quarter seven to nothing why im thankful im thankful for my wonderful family and the fact that i get a chance to play this great game im so thankful for my family friends loved ones this great country we get to live in the sport i get to play and obviously steeler nation nana <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> part of that great draft class of 2004 with eli manning philip rivers <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> horsa that 2008 class and has been the starter for baltimore since day one so raucous burger goes to work from the 15 miss burg trailing seventh inning man the <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> for a gain of 12 weve mentioned before chris a lot of the success that pittsburgh had came when they began to go no huddle in october b september was a total disaster for this dam yeah and you know he s now calling about 99 percent of the plays when they do get in the nohuddle he s even asked todd haley did not talk so much in his headset because he wants a little chance to think about what he s doing out there but like a lot of quarterbacks now they want a chance to see the defense there s12 get a look at it and make the calls and make the adjustments we gained a fire by the man you know you would think any coat any quarterback in his tenth year in the league he wants to call his own plays he wants to go know how to want everyone not just for a change of pace you know a quarterback in his 10th you who didnt want now i had never heard of it at all you know terry bradshaw used to call their own place but how he longs you say how hard could it be you only had four of them so you know and that s the way it was but it is because he is the one that that knows what the defense is he doesnt have to guess what it is to make the play ball here s the wildcat now and the snap the rex back to <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> and the rookie running back takes the ball up to the 37 yard line there s a little bit of the sign of the power of lady on bail on that one 240 plus pound running back that they love in pittsburgh kind of went nowhere but really needed this final effort to pick up the first down even the castro who has really been looking so much better lately the the cashflow hurt last year is at number one pick in a tooth twelve of stanford from the 37 yard line the city bills eight camera nice job bottling him up that s an <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur</person> jones the fourth year made from syracuse pulls him down eight terry s 21 yards september was a total disaster the steelers did not have a single take away in four games and they had 11 turnovers they are on foreign and included a trip to london where they lost to minnesota but since then you can see the difference especially with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> second and 10 of the 37 and the pressure off he goes and wampus burger dragon will goes right to the marker before he gets out of bounds itll be a first down for pittsburgh nice job here youre starting to see the steelers now do a much better job of understanding where the pressure is coming from remember they lost their signal caller marquis pouncy about eight plays into the season so all their plans of going to the no huddle basically went out the window and theyve been redeveloping <person player="fernando velasco" race="nonwhite" position="C">fernando velasco</person> i dont know where this team would be without him was cut by the titans he had started 16 games a year before for down so he was a veteran just learning the system and now that they are starting to get on the same page this offense is playing much better a microwave before we gave him until he cooked them completely pass thrown over the middle that little was a smith novus boomer go put the pressure on doing weirdo coming over from the broncos after that the contract fax machines snackfood little <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> tumor bill right out here just to quick on the outside for <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> completely misses this throw i think it was <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> wide open in the middle of the field he kind of took a step up and just threw it right in the dirt bin s strongpoints theyre making those throws on the move second of ten leverage up a block bundle crennel <person player="pernell mcphee" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mcphee</person> mix attacked on <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> and make a third down and nine and <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> needs the breather on this frigid night that s why <person player="pernell mcphee" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mcphee</person> was in the game that last tackle third night to the left then stays alive and hits <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> over the middle as he does so often and has done for ten years <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> extending the play staying alive tough to get that he will always been sacked a ton of times and she can do this a million times you know his ability for a <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> that weighs 250 pounds or whatever it is turn his shoulder slide up keep his head down field and just flip it i mean that s that s not like a 90 mile an hour fastball there was just he just kind of flips it down there to him and <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> goes up and makes the play but that s when you know the steelers are getting right when <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> starts to make those kind of play that was good for 15 yards from the left side the castro may have new leak blakeman false start offense over 66 i definitely still second down tis the cool <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin but you have two of the very best young coaches in the league i mean theyve been around i mean <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> s in his seventh season and harbaugh here since o8 some of the owners in the past couple years and they were looking for change who kind of say hey can you find me the next <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin oh john harbaugh first and 15 dump it off the <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> that was a good tough money before he is forced out of bounds one of the featured attractions has to be <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beach im a young man that had to take over he has played basically everything there is to play along that offensive line he started the year as a tight end the extra blocker on the outside moved to center when pouncy got hurt moved to guard when they need in there moved to right tackle now he s playing left tackle by far the most athletic <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> on that offensive line in halfway through the quarter second down and six it bends it incomplete intended for <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> itll be third down and six for the steelers ill tell you one of the guys that i think s made a huge difference for the rave and <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> the linebacker they picked up from jax here s a <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> that you know you lose <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray</person> lewis and all that better and leadership and all the knowledge of this game and he has simply been sensational this year i just dont know where they would have were talking to john the guys who have played best for him this year first name you mentioned smith pressure all the way across the board stealers classes behind <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> and incomplete so the drive bogs down started back at the their own 15yard line theyve run 11 plays on this drive but still havent even gotten into field goal range now and that was an interesting call there because you have really needed a completion of some kind you know this 47yard field goal would have felt a little bit better than a 50yarder on this cold night well indeed they have i said they have it but it s a 50yarder meaning something a little bit easier this shantz reasons have a terrific year is only miss to all season backtoback : living too soon that s reason to the right side and well go down he left before the balls before was down they break for baltimore to get it in this field so <person player="sean spence" race="nonwhite" position="LB">sean</person> sweden starts to move forward before matt mcbride is able to get the snap here s what happens it s just he knows there s no chance he can kick it and then he just tries to get the ball and go run whether it was interesting the ravens only had nine guys on the field in defense and luckily we were able to stop him for some run front so the ball at the 44 baltimore takes you there <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> goes to the outside and moves it to the 47 yard line and we check with michelle al steelers defensive end <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> is questionable with a left foot injury same foot that s kept him out of the last two games meanwhile wave is wide receiver <person player="brandon stokley" race="white" position="WR">brandon stokley</person> is questionable with a left knee he went back to the locker room with dr leanne curl for further evaluation all right thank you michelle as <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> does come back in after working on his hand for a while on the sidelines saturday at 7 and the past intended for <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> and he is slowing getting up hit by <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> and he will come limping off will jones one of the really good young players in this league right now is <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> getting a chance to play here but they think athletically and mentally now he is so much further ahead than most of the defensive ends and oh my goodness this is a story where he got <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> limping around over with the bad wrist whatever happened to him and exhausted the game he s in motion works out of the slot clock was gonna go down the left side for interference on m<person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> down the sideline reaching back up court and draws the flag well whether it s <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh</person> gordon or calvin johnson teams are now targeting <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> fierce defense in the 24 sometimes that do happen when youre near 11th year in the league yeah this is a veteran to say the least defense you can see but i sort of hooked that arm it s one thing to do a little contact that you could see you hooked it into his body good call by the officials 26 yard penalty puts the ravens at the 27 yard line you know chris we checked with the league it s interesting we should brought it up during the commercial break when suiza moved forward before the ball was down you could have called a false start on the kicker but it s something that the dean blandino the head of officiating said he s never seen but you could have called it yeah we might have to call john madden on that way yeah you see everything but ive never seen the kicker in an illegal motion second down and eight the ball is at the 25yard line at six minutes as m<person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> is there till that time able to swatted away from the grass script smith third and eight well this is pretty well done by <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> and talking to dick lebeau about ike i said how is he hanging in there because it s been a rough couple of weeks for him he said it s the great thing about <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> he said you would never know it he could give up touchdown passes all day long hed line up on the next one and he would just feel like im gonna win this one he always takes the best receiver the other team has and sometimes that s a tough assignment he goes he goes back to jerry <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> 3rd and 8 because <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is gonna take off and get the first down <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> not sliding knew he needed the first finally tackled by <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> and moves to change on a third date this get some credit to michael war on the outside here just barely held off <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> worlds and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> said you know weve been struggling to run the football so i almost feel like this season i have to do it myself a little more often i dont like to run but when necessary and in key situations i read that was huge there he said six third down runs this season all four first and he s averaged over five yards of carry when the other guys read all three offense number 68 fiveyard penalty still first half thank you <person player="aq shipley" race="nonwhite" position="C">shipley</person> <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> just come back into the game there he is boy what a playoff run he had a great super bowl game caught the pass against denver and probably the play of the year when you say that pass in a 40something seconds to go and look like the ravens were gonna be one and done and 70 yards later here we go nope <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> back up the truck for the bank youre 21 yards winders <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> we wont tell you who it is that one of the steelers we went with last night that he said he s he called somebody mister 120 we went one then we thought for a second 120 million dollars we cant give him up but he s clearly on the defense 120 i dont know what he s thinking about there we go maybe it was <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> but we cant quite remember there s still 120 second and 14 he s gonna lose the ball it s a strip sack ball is loose at the 29 yard line but recovered as <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> walls came in but baltimore is going to retain possession so strip sacked by number 93 the development of young pass rushers watch his hands here just smack the hands of <person player="michael oher" race="nonwhite" position="OT">michael oher</person> right off of them and <person player="michael oher" race="nonwhite" position="OT">michael oher</person> now is in a very interesting situation because of the trade of <person player="eugene monroe" race="nonwhite" position="OT">eugene monroe</person> both of those guys will need contracts i doubt very seriously they both get it and my guess is that you jeanne moreau is going to get the deal in or will not he may be somewhere else next year he did not play well last week third down and 23 second sack for shucks his way to the 25 to make it a little easier for <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> on the field goal attempt upcoming <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> making the stop and maybe we will see the holder go in motion this time now that was a good stand though after you give up the long pass interference call you hold baltimore two field goals that s better especially because <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> got the offense moving at least a little bit 22 straight successes for <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> this one will be a 43yard attack <person player="sam koch" race="white" position="P">sam</person> cooke

closing water there is a look at baltimore but a <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> who look like is the most decorated american olympian ever michael phelps right there this year in baltimore good nervous it s preferable you know we pass to the outside taken by brown but he cant get attractiveness mit coming up from the right corner to make the tackle after a gain of two yards its burg offense so the three play drive to open things out three and out and then an 11play drive resulting in a punt the 12 play drive resulted in the botched field goal attempts and weve had the ball a while and it s resulted in my <person player="felix jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">felix jones</person> the former cowboy good second of eight that pass is incomplete intended for ground over the middle itll be third down and eight and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> at the current moment is 10 for 17 471 yards <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh</person> pines that theyre inside backers falling back underneath that so far the ravens have been doing a look where theyre theyre putting three or four guys to the outside right three guys to the outside let them sort of leaving right my ceders who tries to back his way to a first down but the line judge comes into spotted about a half yard shy and we go to the twominute warning and <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> doom reviled as the injured baltimore raven itll be fourth and one at the twominute warning when we come back turn a halftime coming up the cowboys come back to not go up oakland lions get 37 honey shower garages cant get back past for <person player="isaiah green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> bay bob and heinz break it down the first half wall of the toyota halftime harbor of baltimore forth and one matt mcbride will punt and <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> sets up at his own 12 yard line for the raylan it s a line drive low bouncing kick pittsburgh s hop and out of bounds it goes at the 15yard line watch 52 the half ends to nothing paul jean sunday night football and thanksgiving night being brought to you by the brilliant minds and machines of ge by toyota care by the new windows one experience for everything in your life and by the hobbit the desolation of smaug in theaters everywhere december the 13th the it s the desolation of smaug meanwhile it was plymouth rock are you sure local shots but farewell christmases are coming pepto starts with a pass to <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> s it s broken up as he receives its ziggy <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> making the tackle ravens have all of their timeouts second and nine and depending on how this play goes pittsburgh has a couple two so see what happens here s the bashes caught at the 20yard line it s gonna be three and one is now a spark the longtime colt makes it a third and one and it s one of those situations now were in baltimore coming up through the line have all of those timeouts pull them all right rustling a hit is <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> and i can start thinking about those timeouts and they take it right here after a first down 64 ticks left so too much to time outs remaining for baltimore as you look at polo manos fairly quiet to this point tonight havent called his name from the 26 yard line sexy off juggling catches and he gets tackled up at the 32 yard line by <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> where if <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> starts making some catch and run plays again that has really not been around this offense because of his injury but that has been such a key component of the success of ravens over the years second and three hang at a false start on the right side that s or backing up <person player="michael oher" race="nonwhite" position="OT">michael oher</person> is trying to explain hey i know the staff can i moved on the snap counters because i moved ahead of there are other offensive linemen he does do that he times it up pretty well i dont know if he did that time or not but but he usually is the first offensive lineman to move in the tape ive watched right on the end of the line of scrimmage here youll id say that s a little before this yeah i would too ill start offense number 74 it s a fiveyard penalty in addition this situation requires a ten second runoff and baltimore has elected not to take a time out to save the ten seconds so the game clock operator please put 28 seconds on the game clock 28 that s a very interesting call right there im not sure i wouldnt have taken the time out and saved those 10 seconds right there i dont know what youre going to do with the right the sec second down and eight curious decision right there the pass is caught by <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> he gets to the 33 now you gonna take another timeout here but you only have 17 it s going to tick down and apparently theyre gonna be contentious to go in with a 10 nothing lead or are they yeah so that s the way they play it at the end of the crowd doesnt like it the harbaugh is content to go in with a tin avoid food even at the hand the ravens will get the second hands they go up into the first and for more 10 pittsburgh nothing peter the halftime coming your way next sunday night football on thanksgiving night from baltimore maryland tender nothing is our halftime score figured to be a defensive struggle figure to be lowscoring and really there s one big play is the difference in the game right now the long pass set up the only touchdown so far <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> throwing went in there to <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> so well make it the burger king inside edge how about that we talked about the fact that i taylor sort of set up to the outside and fighting <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> the in sykes he knew he had help on the inside there it is <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> is gonna drop underneath and he s gonna be the <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> to take away the inside throw unfortunately for kiesel he s not used to dealing with quarterback <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> looks them off just far enough makes them lean a little left plays it behind him and there it is inside edge but you only tightly touchdown the game check out more insights from tonight on nbc sports live extra and of course the big play that i refer to as the 54 yard pass that set that up that was initially ruled a touchdown and then they put the ball back at the oneyard line and from there they scored the only touchdown of the game rushing yardage boylan with 47 pittsburgh only 20 despite the fact those carried the ball nine times tonight totally arden s 151 to 98 it spurts out a little bit more possession time a couple of long drives resulting in no points careful with this <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> san francisco 49ers to tell you all about it john squeeze him a little adventure in the opening half jumping the gun on a field goal attempt well send it down to toby jones good to run this back from a oneyard line jones advances way ive passed the 30 to the 32 yard line as we go to michelle well i just spoke with <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin who told me he s not only concerned about his team trailing 10 nothing he said it s not what theyre doing to us it s our lack of execution weve got to pay greater attention to detail they will be without <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> their defensive end who is out with a left injury now as for john harbaugh he loves what his defense is doing he wants them to continue to prevent <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> from stepping up in the pocket and taking shots <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> to merville by the way left ankle sprain questionable all right thank you michelle keep an eye on him when the defense comes back out here s <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> of course harbaugh should be very pleased with that defensive performance only 98 yards for pittsburgh in the opening half and youre starting to get a feel for these two teams and the possibility of their getting hot the winner of this game is going to be very dangerous one second and six rataxes very big game obviously for both teams they come in five and six the winners going to get a leg up in the fight for a wildcard berth and maybe win a division title but if pull them over to lose the game doubly tough because they then will have lost both games to pittsburgh and that would be a huge tiebreaker both these teams still have a shot at good cincinnati as well they do bengals will play at san diego on sunday afternoon here s <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> to the 48 just to refresh the standings in the afc north and theyve tightened up in the past couple of weeks since he is seven and four whenever this game is going to go to six and six and the loser five and seven and the browns are four and seven right now im <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin pacing the sideline here second down and eight exhorting his defense is incomplete <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> with the coverage that time on jones <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> was blitzing third and 8 paulo malo right here is gonna get the immediate pressure and then it s going to come from behind watch the little pirouette here working against <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> and <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> and <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> worlds almost got there so you get the idea now dick lebeau unwilling to just sit back he s gonna fire a few bullets here in this out watch smith and smith strikes the stumble and something marcus forward progress make it i it looks well it s gonna be right on the line so it should be a first down and as they take a look at the side line goes down just at the 44 yard line in a measure id say yeah that s pretty close when that knee went down theyre getting a pretty good spot out of that very good spot you can tell tomlin hates that spot he s right there he can see it and looks like it s gonna be a first down that s interesting where was he touch to go down as one thing and to be touched when youre down is the other right now that was a third and eight so a critical spot on a third down play blakeman chaingang coming in chris tomlin could challenge this spot it s going to be a first down and there s <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> wanted challenge it and maybe lose it lose a second half time out you take a look knees down there s the ball the official sticks are actually on the near side as you look at it you saw those sticks theyre on the far side the official sticks are on the near side tomlin still pacing still upset but he s not going to challenge yeah i dont think you win that challenge if you do they probably go for it on fourth day makes his first catch of the night and that is good for a first down rookie out of georgia going to steeler scream right back at him here everybody s coming this way and kicking it out and <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> has really stepped up i remember watching this young man playing against carolina in preseason having a huge game he had monster games in the preseason and more and more now you really get the feeling that he s going to be a factor coming down the stretch for them and with five touchdown catches this season one rookie campaign at the 33 yard line caught by <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> tackled by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> after a short gain no <person player="eugene monroe" race="nonwhite" position="OT">eugene monroe</person> we talked about him came over from jacksonville right here working against the young phenom and <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> who they are so high on they think that his potential is just unlimited it s tough it s behind the line of scrimmage it really is amazing isnt it watch baltimore try and run the football after all those years and <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> and <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> seemed like they averaged up close to 5 yards per carry but totally different team and without coletti assembly you

course last year with the super bowl champions one draft choice back in on three nanosec raucous border more than anyone else and the pictures florida the sealer is in dire need of getting something going here down 13th or nothing early in the third well part of their success on that one is their double team and <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> on the outside and i tell you pittsburgh s got a pretty impressive streak going now three straight weeks mario williams and donna conclude phil taylor in the crowds none of those guys show up on the staff

complete ravens it does make the point chris so good in the red zone defensively and the steeler so bad i mean this has been sort of the nightmare matchup so far this year because the pittsburgh steelers obviously at this point in the game theyve got to put a touchdown on the board here but this is what the ravens do best so this final 8 yar go bra rushing touchdown all year for for <person

back of the end zone by emanuel <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> but that was all <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben

board was one right back and all the momentum is gone what a brilliant play by <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez</person> out i think anybody who s been attached to go to

play here back to back by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> to make the open field tackle then come back and make that one as well he has become the defensive signal caller in there when <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry foote</person> got hurt and weve got a flag down just came down well after the play i think weve got unsportsmanlike fleet blakeman after the play unsportsmanlike conduct offense number 27 wow 15yard penalty well <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> was joined with clark and then he continued that and that turns a chip shot field goal into something a little bit more only matters if you miss but turns a 23yard field goal attempt into a 38yard field goal attempt <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> 4th street and there s 25 to make it a twopossession lead again 349 11 to the third 67 baltimore that s the

gonna take any bullying on the field and everything point tackle by <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez</person> alum you gotta keep that in mind jesseman <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> s ticked off mrs <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> at the 20yard line 16:7 why am i thankful loving wife and three children obviously ive been blessed professionally ive got a great job i work with great people on a daily basis im thankful for my wife and my two beautiful children healthy children and just being able to live the nfl dream in baltimore and enjoy the fans and the great teammates and the great memories that ive had playing as a raven well the crowd was booing as we went to commercial and even more accurate and were going to show you what happened on that run back by jones with <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin along the sideline a threaten out of it the first exposure to first the stream about seven let s go back to that long 73yard return by jones here we go here s tom went over here obviously gopi jones there and tomlin is essentially on the field here and you just wonder and he s trying to get out of the way there but did that force <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> the lean back into the tackle by <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> dont want to in any way say that was something intentional but if he had picked off the official on that play or touch the player either way that s a big penalty exactly weve seen that happen a couple of times this year where coaches have been involved even officials along the sidelines they can actually if you impede the runner or come off the sidelines and make a tackle or anything bizarre like that or they can award a touchdown they can take the ball and say he would have scored a touchdown on that and award the touchstone so they played it back about five times and crazy third and three rhys using one this burger intended for bill far sideline i tell you i think <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> has done more in coverage to help the ravens than just about any linebacker you see it go out to san francisco theyve got great coverage guys as well but watch this theyre going to try and run a little pick inside but he just hugs right on to lay beyond <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> and does not allow <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> the opportunity that could have been about a 70 yard play there was nobody else out there theyve got the two combatants going tomlin staking his gravel on the sidelines matt mcbride avoids the first man yards marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> making the tackle and back we go to the earlier return by <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> well what s bizarre about it is he s looking the other way but glancing back over his shoulder that you can see he kind of did force <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> back into the field a little mission accomplished almost and he s sniggering i mean you know with my man he s a player now dont try to get anything bite him was a fourpoint play no matter how you want to slice it for the 36 yard line ears up to the 42 yard line tackled by <person player="cameron heyward" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cameron heyward</person> son of the late not to live but the iron head <person player="cameron heyward" race="nonwhite" position="DE">heyward</person> who played running back of course for new orleans one of the guys that s been causing headaches tonight is <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> world right in behind their 93 and so they just doubleteam them here go ahead were gonna make <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> come up and make attack second and four mrs peirce tackle by paulo malo you know it s been a little while since ive seen joy <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> play the way that he has of course missed all last year with that cap entries up there playing that linebacker position and the dime defense again but watch how quickly he closes on the ball when he sees him that pass in the air and he is right there right now and when he s playing like that the steelers are a different defense third and four good protection upfront great protection this lack a lot of time throw is cut inside the 20 like <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> paca by allen and what a job i that offensive 133 yards does this look familiar looks like <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> great protection up front <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> just keeps moving keeps wiggling around until he can finally fire went down the field that was third down and once again when he just has a knack for big plays and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> keeps giving him these opportunities and he keeps making him i thought his playoff run last year is as good as anything i ever saw sensational that s why they call him mr 120 and in the third 67 and tonight aerial coverage from baltimore being brought to you by geico al michaels cris collinsworth then michele tafoya on this thanksgiving night m&amp;t bank stadium each team 5 and 6 16 7 baltimore as we start the final quarter for the 1st and 10 at the 24 of the steelers havent seen a lot of the wildcat tonight out of the ravens definitely 120 said no we dont want any more a wildcat yeah ive seen it he went to commercial he saw jones on the sideline after a long catch you can paint a bit of a prices and it s gonna be but outofbounds and <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> was there couldnt even hold on anyway he was on the chalk and the ball came loose incomplete second ten five tony smith had this one they was just working oneonone on <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> and of course toria with that great speed this thing was a remarkable throw by <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> he was under pressure from two different guys <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> tries to fly back and get underneath it down was dropped right in a bucket and dropped period it was a perfect throw play stoppage for a false start false start offense number 74 alright got penalty so second out that s another one or that s three any time you end up with <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> on your side you know something s up and they had the stunts in the loops and but i will say this compared to what we saw last week against the jets and the jets have one of the best defensive lines if not the best in all of football but this offensive line is a major step up from what we saw last week black they retreat sets up the screen <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> and first include a break up the blocking convoy was <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> stopping met for a gain of two third and 13 now <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person>s starting to put a couple of good games together now he had he was terrific last week in cleveland and comes up with a play there when they need it most i mean they really this is a nodoubter they have to keep him out of the end zone now jones back in the game flank him wide to the left if lebeau watching his defense dig in third and 13 or backhoe throws high master s intended to <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> part so we forced that now and youre looking at about a 45 yard field goal attempt well you dont have to be big to be a good block or watch <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> here that we call this a chip that s a that s a big chip put a big <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> right there on <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> worlds they have turned their attention that way he s been disrupted blocked by <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> 3 for 3 tonight 48 34 38 this one 45 his banner season continues 13:59 left in regulation 1970 the quarterbacks as old as the rest percent was thought the biggest <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> in the world but a big heart kids playing football thanks of course enjoying every moment here to this point 1907 the force border bring it back out to the 40yard line so <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> of all things boots one away free kick

court it looked like brown hat it got a gripped away <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> covering on the play louis second down intend to tell you one of the guys who s really stuffed up this year is <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> he s a tall <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> long arms and he s been more physical this year than ive ever seen him those are plays he just wouldnt make in the past they just kept encouraging him and encouraging to get more physical use those long arms and now that he s doing it he s been tough to be were stepping up to award the pressure sliding and throws complete defeat <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> to the 46 yard line and itll set up a third and four i cant say enough good things about the left tackle of <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beach on the radar screen for the pittsburgh steelers when the season started got his chance because of the injury to marquise counsel the channel has to be 6a play left tackle he is and baltimore takes a timeout and let s go to michelle well guys i asked a ravens cornerback <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> whom youre talking about about what makes <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> difficult to defend and he said <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s awareness in the pocket is ridiculous someone can have a great sack on him and he escapes and throws the ball downfield he s like the king of loose plays right now that s his strongest point and that s something you have to try to take away from him and as weve seen that s easier said than done you bet thank you michelle is <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> gets ready to come to the line for a third and three and again every third now becomes pretty big right now this game be important so it cant be overstated in terms of the winners going to be in pretty good shape in terms of a road to the playoffs and the loser is going to be fairly close to dire straits dirty dirt he s able to convert as <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> hits the manual <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> across the 50 forward progress to the 49 yard line first down and just the old peyton manning play it s it s so hard to stop tony dungy here tonight hit an outside receiver comes and bends to the inside even if you know it s coming sometimes hard to stop and just such a significant driver but toss bill and well be running back for a gain of nine yards tackled by <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> itll be second down and one where here s the maturation of a young player <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> come with the slot blitz over here and he has the presence of mind to know that he s hot does not run into who is that <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> there on the outside <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> knew exactly where s that health and reporter back tells you out there that s five catches the life of as a carry 12 times for 70 arts at the big 44 yard and they give it the bill and he s sliding on the outside and has enough for the first down tripped up by <person player="pernell mcphee" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mcphee</person> maybe on bail what a great college career he had let the big ten was fifth overall in rushing in the nation and a big <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> like 245 pounds so you know he can pass protect it s proving himself as a good receiver after as the first three games of the season to the foot injury sir pinnacle debut in the september this boy here pillars taken down by <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> and you saw the flood coming holding defense number 21 fiveyard penalty automatic first down and that was lord darius <person player="lardarius webb" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webb</person> now they moved <person player="lardarius webb" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webb</person> back into that slot corner position and have improved as a defense since he went in there you know a lot of people think that playing cornerback on the outside is the toughest role in this nickelanddime defense by far it s playing the slots the toughest miss team ceo was doing ago with that bad ankle we did not want to put it in the ground and call them beach im taking care of him eleven minutes left in the fourth the blitz again and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s going to go deep and incomplete and a flag is thrown an tonio brown with cory <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> covering on the play and this one is going to go against the ravens like <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> gave a little late push off but the flag is already thronged by the pass holding defense over 24 finley like port <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> right off the bat here is going to grab the back of <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> shirt just a little jersey pole that is the only thing that everybody sees when they the jersey gets tugged and you could see the little give and take down to field the flag was already gone by that point so a couple of big penalties hillier here helping the steelers empties the sweat 27 first down to the end zone and to beef when the coverage is good on <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> youve doubled on the plate where i am is there with them itll be second and ten starting to see a lot more man coverage out of the ravens than what we saw earlier in a year theyve got faith in these three quarterbacks on the outside there s grogram little double move and he was beaten he almost grabbed him you could see him kind of grab for the hip but did not but the reason that theyre starting to do main coverages are certain have more faith in this pass rush from their front port they the second of 10 and it s tipping income trying to float it in to <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> and james ahead of oh got back there the safety the swatted aside third down what a nice play by james ahead of bo and a huge contributor he s been it was supposed to be michael huh that took over that other safety position worse both safeties leaving for the ravens and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> just tried to drop it in over his head but he had a bow able to get back and get underneath it would have been a touchdown third ten field goal still makes it a two possession game so a big conversion here for pittsburgh as hit the first time and set up a first and goal on a cats by <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> too just remarkable timing here ive been through that ball before <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> even thought about turning around working down the field he knew he s going to go to him and man coverage the whole way so he rolled that way to change the angle of the throw and make it easier great play by then maybe fourth catch of the season fourth tonight for the league leader in receptions brown now a timeout is taken by bull or their second first and goal friday that they have to thanksgiving a living a hockey for you tomorrow on nbc it starts at 1:00 oclock eastern time to the original six a new york rangers and the boston bruins got a touchdown last time there can they do it again against this top red zone defriend first and goal from the aid two of its time attics head to the finish and the pass is caught by nice to work his way into the end zone and it s going to be spotted just short of the goal line darrell smith saving the touchdown theyll go no huddle here on second and goal boys trying to keep anything de lyonne kind of defenses off the field theyre stuck over here on the boundary and maybe on bail walks in walks into the end zone now we see tom brady do this all the time he gets a big play goes right down to the goal line get him up there dont let those big monsters in there and <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> comes down and blows open another hole here he comes right down in here catches <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> and there s just nobody else there now we got ourselves a ballgame say well it figures it s pittsburgh and bullhorn so many of these games are decided by three points so many go right down to the end as did the one in pittsburgh on october the 20th beecham is shaken up to the left half that comes off for the moment under his own power sweden is in to try to reduce the lead to five so nine and a half to go giving night in baltimore 1914 im very thankful that i was born in the great old usa i was born to a mother who s just about the greatest woman a man could ever want to be around into a great family they taught me that service to your fellow man is a great thing were not the only people on the planet it led me to a life of teaching and sharing i hope youll all help somebody and remember what youre thankful for on this great day well were talking about dick lebeau for years and what a what a man he is and anybody who knows him knows he is really something extraordinary that the halloffame a couple of years ago and everybody was still for him as the kickoff is a bouncing ball that s fielding the 25yard line and then run back to the 34 does it lead back up fullback it s the oldest he has the oldest starting unit in the league they averaged 29 years of age and of course a lot of that s on the back end with clark taylor and paul amato and then im so <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett</person> kissel before he got hurt tonight in the game so theyre old back there well the bo s the youngest 76 year old weve ever known shoot his age on the golf course about any time he wants to and he is a part of the original sort of thanksgiving day packages that lone swimmer oh this is monstrous but back in 1962 an undefeated packers team came into play his lions and bart starr got sacked eleven times in that game and the lions broke their streak with a 2614 win fast forward several years dick lebeau got hired by bart starr goes down to the basement of his house and he sees a picture of eight lions sacking bart starr in a poster size thing on the wall he said you know i never really liked bart starr much until that moment but gained a whole new respect for the <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy</person> when i saw that picture so part doing a little piece on one of the earlier games today after <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> games through that passed to jones up to the 40 yard line so it s third and four interesting strategy here by baltimore going nohuddle with a five point lead and one time i thought they would start to take a little time to get a first down and take the mill inside the pittsburgh 40 to the 38 yard line big play gain of 22 now sometimes you have these three blintzes in which you come on the blitz unless the back releases you assume he s going to try and block you but in this case he released and my guess is that was <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> s man and when he released out of the backfield he had to turn and run with him there was nobody left to cover him six catches for <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> tonight 38 words his <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> and <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> looking for hall and closes very very quickly bonds up in the arms of <person player="al woods" race="nonwhite" position="DT">al woods</person> short game second and nine all of a sudden now that <person player="sean spence" race="nonwhite" position="LB">sean</person> squeeze them in motion fuel goal they never got off starts to feel a little bigger and bigger doesnt it halfway through the fourth quarter victoria smith jumped i think he did last week to vance number 82 fiveyard penalty still second down so many full arsenal against baltimore at home you know what happens and all right as a former wide receiver im going to say this if people say how in the world can a wide receiver youre looking at the ball you know all that kind of stuff you usually jump offsides at home because you could actually hear the quarterback make the calls youre used to not being able to hear second and 14 if we mix the catch that was the fifth false star tonight against the ravens so it s third down and 12 yeah and here s one of those you dont necessarily go for the first down but youd sure love to have about seven eight yards and give your kicker a shot at this one so this may well be was at <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> coming out of the backfield here trying to do a little catch and run action far down the 12 before day joshy gets it away and to the 30yard line tailor saves the first down cory smith makes the catch but it sets up a 47yard field goal attempt for <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> they spent the night taylor on the outside top of the screen there this is just turning into a slugfest between them is there a foul in there yeah probably but i dont think he s quite gets there and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> doing this pretty good impersonation of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> tonight some of his slides around the pocket but mission accomplished there dont get the first down but set up this field goal it s out 26 consecutive attempts have been made by <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> this one from 48 cuts it down and <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> s kick good that s five field goals for them tonight 537 remaining but it s still a onepossession game 22 pitch worth for jane well you can download nfl mobile and get live premium content smartphone will store animal down slash global to learn more 22 to 14 ravens on top 537 the temperature has gone from 37 to 27 clear my 6 yards because <person player="felix jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">felix jones</person> bitch cowboys its dumped at the 20yard line oh shucky brown well over and back on northern california john madden looking in tonight happy thanksgiving to you coach and your family which man s gonna do it he s gonna pick the player of the game good luck that s not easy tonight no it s a lot of candidates we we may still have the winner yet to come see how this thing goes all <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beecham s that they have exchanged he might have a chance <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh</person> not crazy about pickers that <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> is in the for the 21 yard line first down the pittsburgh steelers is what the score go and that shoulder shake in the pump a ton of time as the line does its job the cash is broken up jericho contrary the intended receiver and <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> reaches for his right hip every defense on the play there s a lot of things to talk about on that play but if <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">corey graham</person> is hurt that is significant on the back end that was he had to cover khatri on that one for about nine seconds ive never seen protection that good they left <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> in to help block and lay beyond <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> over here on this side and they just locked down that side of the defense and that clock just kept moving and nobody was getting open youre getting him solely as able to drive off so it looks like he can come back in shortly as to be after on this side <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> go that way on the second attack when he goes by a minutes brown to the 40yard line so brown wanted to get his hands on him at the line of scrimmage sake that is and it was <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio</person> who was able to avoid that and get loose for 19 one of the toughest guys in the nfl to try and jam <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> just makes shocky brown look awful on that play and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> was going that way the entire time bigtime play gram back in the game as you see so he goes on that s the receivers to the left side i think youre still at the test for grant the 40 yard line with 445 left in regulation the guarantee is somebody in the press box right now is watching every move cory <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> is making that is their number one receiver the top receiver in the nfl and tony theyve been giving safety help this way when he s been split wide and that 3x1 said and they probably will hear again position nice grip by <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> first down here s michelle well the steelers are conducting this drive without their starting left tackle <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beecham he is questionable with a right knee injury sitting on the bench right now it doesnt look like he s ready to come back in guys all right thanks michelle that means <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> the onetime starter there he is 76 secondround pick out of ohio state last year is the man in that spot be careful though now you got sucks with no help there get this without bad and he does and nummer makes the in the longtime security blanket the tight end picks up 13 yards and a first down well <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s just done a masterful job tonight seeing these blitz is coming and when they do he just takes it quickly and gets it out to the hot reed and picks up another first down gain to 13 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s phone for 207 yards smith was it even looking a signal safety and that s why it ended up inside three minutes to the outside were jamil mclean making the tackle and pittsburgh s gonna take its first time out before a second down and nine sometimes you throw those hot hot passes and you just get any part of the ball you can forget the lazy so pittsburgh taking a timeout they have to plus the twominute warning of an issue right now second down in 34 yo looks like single coverage to take a shot at 40 this time <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> is on <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> and it s incomplete as <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> went down as he crossed the goal one falling down reaching for it couldnt hold on third and nine oh my goodness he had it and there s a flag down but upfield and it s against pittsburgh second down <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> saw exactly what i saw and that was gloria grahame out here on the outside didnt even disguise it just showed the single coverage took advantage and <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> just could not stay on his feet yeah it was a facemask all to a big one on <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> the tackle coming back and the even with <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> over there to help <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> is unless he has improved greatly from or we saw earlier in the tough matchup for him on so it makes it a second at 24 there s heat the other side so no health dump it off underneath <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> has room inside the 30 and to the treaty on a second and 24 first down pittsburgh well that is a play that s relatively new now the offensive line here just come out and block in front of this screen it s like a middle screen with a wide receiver instead of the outside receiver going out they send the lineman down the field and that was huge by the center of the lascaux the ball is at the 20yard line raucous burger soon as he throws an incomplete intended for contrary and that s going to take us to the twominute warning at officially 157 to go baltimore in pittsburgh what else is new right down to the wire 22 to 14 after the game the wendy s postgame report the madden thanksgiving players in the game will sit down for a mini feast with michelle chris and i will take a look at hit to our matchup in three days the giants and the redskins on sunday night football come up right after the game now when you think youve got an advantage with something that sucks coming off the edge full screen right well be screaming from trying to get the set as who have been calls here on a second and 10 from the 20 to the goal line into the end zone eat <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> for the touchdown he s been doing it for nine years and clearly theyll go for two points here is hardball looks and checks it out on this on the board he does get into the end zone does <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> as they review it upstairs as they do all scoring plays <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> eight catches tonight 87 yards and <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> comes limping off but he did his job a little out not move we see so much down in the red zone outside then up the field <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh</person> buyings reacts to the first move and here it goes that doesnt matter it always comes down to the last two minutes with these two teams well id say i could call these games whoo that s close well you know the interesting thing about that it could actually benefit the steelers if he were down and they could burn a little track here right and just make sure they get into the end so uh yeah detail we saw a similar play in the first quarter which was initially ruled two cuts and then it was spotted inside the one previous play is under review you know and now those timeouts that baltimore took earlier in the game when we didnt think they were going to be very significant those timeouts are pretty significant now all scoring plays again reviewed upstairs taking a look at this right now to see if he does indeed get into the end zone and clearly the next big thing if we did get in is what are they going to call for the twopoint conversion some blakeman comes over possession possession meaning that or a little short yeah let s need there it is right there hmm i think he s short i think they have to run another play and there s another significant part of this <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy whimper</person> is now in the game so theyre down to their third tackle on that side now going against drill <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> and then right there yeah so that s where the ball is gonna be spotted at about the nine inch line so now let s say that they dont make it on first down baltimore is almost forced to take their remaining time out some bizarre way provided they eventually score that actually helps the pittsburgh steelers but again i mean theyve got to get it into the end zone you start fooling around with playing with the clock here and you dont know what can happen weve been talking about the battle <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> drill <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> almost gets there and goes down around the knees so that was a bit of a ticking bomb on that side and now with <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy whimper</person> who knows after review the play the receivers right knee was down with a ball position for pittsburgh so 152 again baltimore have spent two timeouts earlier in the half what would die <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">whimper</person> the number three tackle in there and now the ravens because of that time lapse able to get their big defensive lineman in the game only allowed a couple rushing touchdowns all year see now with the the different set of circumstances when they were able to make that substitution the various web came bursting through but there s that timeout though reckless take their third and final timeout okay it s a heck of a play by a corner to shoot through there and make that play in the backfield but they not they didnt even get back to the line of scrimmage on that one pastor run what do you think it s tough i dont think you can just drop back and throw one with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> standing back there for any period of time i mean <person player="guy whimper" race="nonwhite" position="DE">guy whimper</person>s been sitting over on the sidelines going to get sucks theyre on the right hash makes it tougher to do some kind of a move play this way there s <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike adams</person> im thinking youre going to get some kind of a pick play out of this one you know youre going to get some quick rob a pick and somebody s sneaking underneath you get the bunch down here to the right a lot of crossing action and see if you cant free somebody up second and goal <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> swings on the outside it goes flying but he s in for the touchdown it looked like they had him stopped but he s very low so he goes into the end zone he scores to make it a twopoint game but the helmet went off and clearly he is in distress oh my good and <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> is down to the rule now is the play ends immediately when the helmet comes off but my goodness helmettohelmet clearly smith comes in i thought he had possession crossing the line at least that is that helmet was coming off he took the second blow so both guys are still down and what a shot taken clearly could see it on the replay obviously the the helmettohelmet blow the concern about bail right now their rookie running back who then a late start this year because of a foot injury and now youve got a situation where you get two guys youre thinking about one in particular it s a twopoint game a twopoint conversion to come and fortunately bill getting up and even the ravens fans giving them a nice ovation here but you know this is a bitter rivalry but a classy one and ill tell you there s something else going to go on here right now too because it was ruled a touchdown theyre going to review this now the instant the helmet comes off and you pointer to this out kristen when the helmet comes off the play is over so as they review it with bill wofully going back to the sideline if the helmet is off before the ball is across the goal line this wont count one constitutes offed that s off that s what crosses the line it sure it looks like it yeah listen if i had to guess right now i think theyre gonna put this ball again at about the sixinch line because the helmet is off and when the helmets off that s the end of the play jerry or forward progress nothing else that s it right there oh boy so they look at it and theyre going to give him the touchdown they already took a look at him upstairs and gained the touchdown now the twopoint conversion so dryer has to come to the running button now over yeah no i think i think blakeman may have let him up to the line before they reviewed it he s playing is that a review that s what i thought i mean it there s no way theyre gonna let this go with that blakeman coming over and looking under the <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> well you know what the replay official does he takes every minute to review that thing and until they get to the line of scrimmage he can still be looking at it back and forth but i have seen that one before the minute that helmet comes off it is it s done and it is completely off there and the ball is not across the line trevor boys at the play with <person player="jason worilds" race="UNK" position="DE">jason</person> wouldnt wear the helmet came off and he ran about 15 more yards and and then they put this rule into a fun well and the reasons are obvious i mean and it s a good rule but an unfortunate rule for lay beyond <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> who gave himself up for that touchdown and now it s going to be take it back well if it if it s not a touchdown it s still gonna be third down and obviously two more shots at the end zone so figure i mean this is crazy you got <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> who looks like he s in but then they take it back then they dont get in with <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> then they get into a <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> but they may take this back because his helmet came off <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> is hurt wires in it and it may all benefit the steelers it s hitting two this time if they are burning time off the clock here i mean it s the most bizarre ending i think ive seen to a football game nuances of this wings coming into play it s it s crazy all right here s blakeman after the play there s helmet came off with the ball positioned at the 1/2 yard line by hole killed with dont we turn down and goal at the one yard line pittsburgh well as we surmised no bail the other backs are <person player="felix jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">felix jones</person> and <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person> and again obviously afford that situation so though get to christ and trying to get into the end zone and still need the twopoint conversion now <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> the fullback comes into the game as well running back in erica two blocks somebody s johnson number 46 the right slot and walk this burgers going to throw and it will be cracked at the goal line by <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> james ahead of oh is their fourth down i think it would have been a touchdown had he caught it he leaned it over the line james he had a bow with his second big play and oh my goodness it is just a train wreck down here for the steelers now <person player="fernando velasco" race="nonwhite" position="C">fernando</person> velasca the sinner who replaced marques pouncy goes down so you got your starting center at least tonight s starting center your one and two left tackles and your starting running back who will all be out of the game that s <person player="cody wallace" race="white" position="C">cody wallace</person> who s a tackle by trade and the backup center getting in some snapping practice here because he s gonna have to snap it on fourth down take a look at we can see what happened to <person player="fernando velasco" race="nonwhite" position="C">fernando velasco</person> od not a right here it just rolls right back on the back of his leg you cant make this stuff up cant disagree with the call he s got news catch it and it s a touchdown so they tend to <person player="fernando velasco" race="nonwhite" position="C">velasco</person> fourth and goal well ask go back to the sideline and you see <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin theyre said to take him out i mean he was still trying to determine whether or not he could go back on the field the last minute he said take him out and so now here we go with <person player="cody wallace" race="white" position="C">cody wallace</person> and you wonder if this limits does he do shotgun snap well as they take have they taken a snap on the sidelines i mean so many things come into play at this point it s only a half a yard could pin his quarterback sneak it but you got a lodi not in there there s everything in play it s the longest half yard 1,000 first camp in the back field next to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> he does brown in the slot to the right what this burden fires packs down sorry who s his main man in the red zone cautery with only thirty four receptions coming into the game but seven of those four touchdown they switch it off cory <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> thinks he s supposed to switch this off this pic but the inside defender doesnt do it so they end up with a walkin so all that mess that we just went through and all it did was take time off the clock for the ravens to try to go the other way zooming they can get this twopoint conversion metaphor ravenous la patrie water <person player="cody wallace" race="white" position="C">wallace</person> with a snack the first one was good say no hits the ground <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> put the hold on jackie brown was there with the coverage so it s an unsuccessful twopoint conversion but still an onside kick opportunity for pittsburgh couldnt hold on and a chance kind of goes right through his arms so two balls that were definitely catchable didnt work 22 to 20 obviously an onside kick to come in pittsburgh of course in a position where if they can recover it they would have a timeout and then you need a field goal to win the game is right let s go to michelle well meanwhile running back levy on bail was taken back to the locker room as you saw he is being treated for a possible concussion this is a young man who said it was his dream to play on thanksgiving he was lit up all week about it couldnt wait had a fine performance but back there being treated for a possible concussion now thank you michelle and there s <person player="fernando velasco" race="nonwhite" position="C">velasco</person> we saw beach and canal so <person player="mike adams" race="UNK" position="OT">adams</person> come out it s off the foot of suiza me then you have to go back to the motion by suiza on the kick ive never seen one botched in that way has to go 10 yards before pittsburgh can recover now he s going to switch around now he s going to kick it off his left foot not go the required distance man so he tries to fool them by initially looking he s kicking one way than the other then goes back to the original way and the flag is through the kick being out of bounds and not going ten yards it s interesting did that ball go out of bounds or was it an illegal touch by a stealer before it got out of bounds because it never made at the 10 yards and jericho khatri on the tail end of that recovered the ball it was it was actually off of i think marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> touched it first illegal touching 89 to fight a fit and ball spot first down you know the double trickery and the left footed kick it s not the pittsburgh steelers you know sometimes you can trick yourself in the things but what a football game i tell you if they played 16 straight times and they wanted us to do them all i would go 35 it s just a fantastic ride so nine of the last ten if this one holds that 22 20 will be decided by three or fewer points pittsburgh takes its final timeout but born war can end the game on to kneel down we have to think a little bit about the pittsburgh steelers now moving forward with the rash of injuries they got there on that last little series well theyre going to be five and seven they have three of the last four at home right now you got denver new england indian sensi as the division leaders kansas city would be the number one wild card at the moment of baltimore would be number two as this game comes to a finish the others are in the hunt but a huge win for the baltimore ravens and a bitter loss to the pittsburgh steelers a week and a half think on the miami dolphins while the ravens try to again only as well and take on the minnesota vikings here they have minnesota at detroit new england and at cincinnati there s not a reminder remainder of their schedule john madden marking his balance right now well find out who the player players of the game are coming up right after these messages from your local npcs days you
