you know all those guys it s gonna be a lot of fun and i i think this dallas cowboys defense may end up being one of the big stories this year they are deep on that defensive line and very athletic and explosive defensive side of the ball the nfc east a very interesting race coming up no question about that with the philadelphia eagles well see them against carolina in october the giants on sunday night all starts with carrie underwood getting us underway 10th season in three nights meanwhile here 14 to 3 new england s on top by 11 and they will get the ball to start the third quarter scobie line drives that one through the end zone start at the 20 yard line <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> tonight completed his last well he s 15 out of 17 two touchdowns both to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> who s caught three overall for 41 yards meanwhile the steelers <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> 12 of 17 for 166 many of those to <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> 33 straight games with five or more catches in the afl record that s every game into the equivalent of more than two seasons rady from the 2000 under the outside elements having a huge night that s a gain of 11 and a first down <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> his prime target 7 for 71 now this is not how it s supposed to go for the pittsburgh steelers tonight defensively even on the first snap after coming out at halftime they still were having trouble getting lined up with what the new england patriots were done through the middle squirting his way forward for a gain of about four <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dion lewis</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> when he came out about an hour before the game the ovation as you might expect was absolutely rady was going to contribute to get them going a little bit the entire first half i can remember one pass that he missed to any <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> down the sideline but he was pretty much perfect that first half for a gain of one stop there by ryan suze early third down third and four and here s where they need it the pittsburgh steelers defensively they need something big to happen here this is when you start looking to that front seven this defensive bunch is going to be built around the front seven theyre young on the back end theyre going to make some changes theyre going to try and keep it simple you need a sack you need something to happen up front to give this back in a little protection you nice to to get a third down stop here patriots have converted four or five on this down to make that 5 out of sexist <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> makes his pitch of the night to move the chains well <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> has beat him across the formation now he s coming out the other way and beating him so for antoine <person player="valentino blake" race="UNK" position="DB">blake</person> here s a special teams guy that played well in the second half of the season got a chance to come out here and start and got one of the toughest assignments that you can have in the slot <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> is incredibly difficult to cover 14 straight completions for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> to the ground big hole exploiting it first down <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dion lewis</person> talked about him earlier a guy who came up with philadelphia got hurt has not played at all in a regularseason game over the last two years <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> came shooting down inside and as <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">shazier</person> tried to come out around on the other side i think that was <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey</person> jackson that got him and so theyre firing some shots now theyre just not getting their vote only quickly to the line first time 44 10 inches in the wine country militia gang and <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> for a gain of 9 to the 35 yard line you mentioned it before question <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> telling us good is louis could become a cult hero up here yeah no doubt about he s getting some help by this from this offensive line up front <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey</person> jackson young right guard that time with a good fly and ola for a first down tackle there by <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> one of the things you do to a defense when you sense that there is a bit of confusion as you go faster and nobody can go faster than <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> now when they make some substitutions then the steelers get a chance to catch their breath josh <person player="daniel mccullers" race="nonwhite" position="DT">daniel</person> s the offensive coordinator a guy i think by the end of the seasons gonna be a head coach anything we used to be was it been her cuz he learned lay out there came back as an assistant figures to be a head man again sunday was great he goes deep but there s a flag too in fact as if there was any question portes allen had to reach out and try to stop him by grabbing them so <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> takes his shot at <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> and let s see what happens kind of hooks that hand and doesnt let <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> get it free i think <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> was trying to do what weve seen so much you can see the interlocked arm theyre sort of had it pin metalman tried to make that onehanded play 28 yard penalty get in on first down open itll be second down and goal on the opening drive of the second half and theyve got a new use for shaq <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> theyre fourthround draft pick a guard he lined up at pull back on that play just went out of the game we really like how athletic shaq <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> is kind of came from a run oriented offense at georgia tech figuring out that pass block <person player="scott chandler" race="white" position="TE">scott</person> tranter the tight end picked up from buffalo was it payback now goes into the stop basket goes outside five since in the past oclock so you put the two big tight ends outside crossing chandler goes to the outside <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> comes inside and the former buffalo bill now in his eighth year chandler for the touchdown steelers are being forced now to come up and play tight that youre asking an inside linebacker <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> the cover <person player="scott chandler" race="white" position="TE">scott chandler</person> and i think this addition of a second receiving tight end remember <person player="scott chandler" race="white" position="TE">scott chandler</person> with the buffalo bills has been a guy that s been one of their leaders if not their leading receiver there and you just sort of harken back to the days when they had <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron</person> hernandez here where s nolan tell that story but when they had the two receiving tight ends they were almost impossible to stop and theyre working loves it as a tremendous success with two three tight ends the extra point is good so 1037 remaining in the third quarter and the patriots move out to a twopoint lead 50 years ago they played one by green bay over kansas city there is the ring that was presented to the packers and on the right is the ring being worn by the patriots after the victory last year in super bowl xlix price of diamonds about a little bit too tonight twenty one two three they treated trying to repeat a super bowl champs it first happened in the first two super bowls bart starr <person player="vince williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">vince</person> lombardi and one and two then he had miami the second of those was the perfect season pittsburgh did it twice in the early 70s and then in the late 70s they won four in a decade 49ers did it in the late eighties jimmie johnson leading the cowboys mike shanahan john elway wrote into the sunset with their tube and now the patriots earlier in this century can they do it again here s to the races past the 40 to the 40 yard line 14 to 28 to start this drive they have had success running the football here tonight just gonna hit it right up in here theyve got the doubleteam block going come off on the linebacker good job and i tell you <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> for a guy that maybe carolina thought had seen his better days and he was out about 10 games last year with an injury lose it s 15 pounds and what s really explosive here tonight he has not been the issue cant you in the league 82 yards on 10 carries tonight <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> fires open court brown and he takes you to the 19 yard line so <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> that s a gain of 33 and quickly deep into patriot territory some of this protection inside here has been very good picking up that blitz there david on the outside that time got <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> tonio brown he s a handful williams cuts it back to the middle im angela williams taking it to the 15yard line you know i dont think ive seen a team have this many big plays this early in the game it only had three points on the board and it s got to be really frustrating for mike tomlin because their game plan is working offensive ly theyre going up and down the field they missed field goals they havent taken advantage and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> keeps taking advantage of every mistake pittsburgh makes yeah theyre on a pace to gain almost 500 yards tonight already speciously to the two yard line so the steelers pretty much in desperate need of making this drive hayloft down by 18 have a first and goal here the first ility of having a <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> i know he s much older now but able to get down the field and at least get a hand there on <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> as a guy that doesnt practice but about every other day but <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> has bit of an institution there in fitz and then it sets up on the right side and then his spade left side tries to practice way and stop a little short of the goal line second down and going up coming things that <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> talked about he said im so much better a runner now than i used to be because i used to run with my feet not my brain now i know how to press the hold be patient take care of and he said that that s the thing that impressed me most about lay beyond <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> it took me 10 years to figure that out and this guy comes in the league day one and seemed to have it figured out second down goal every <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> in both backs in right the fullback mouse running the running back spot <person player="roosevelt nix" race="white" position="RB">roosevelt</person> knicks a rookie 11 will take a timeout eletric took a look at pittsburgh lined up and says give me that t oh it s interesting and i think you summed it up perfectly chris the fact that pittsburgh is moving the bolt they just cant cash in you get the two mystically field goals opportunity at the end of the half bogged down they need a touchdown here though yeah and <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> we saw it all last year as well i mean teams just cant match up you want to try and play some oneonone because if you dont if you play off against <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> he just goes dingdingding krait down the field id speak in a super bowl i think the first 20 passes were underneath until he finally threw one deep so you got to get in their face but you get in their face hard to cover those two guys the <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> their daily news weighin is johnson but she does not cross the plane so it s third and goal <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> trying to go quick trying to tell the bench dont send anybody in here new england trying to make a defensive change they cant then on a third down and this time junction is a <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> the fullback running out of the tailback spot behind nixon they go in george and seven plays to get right back at it late shift down here actually work to the pittsburgh steelers favor they sort of went out of the hole and created just enough room there for willa johnson to get up and over the top another good block in there by <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> that was muchneeded and now that the pittsburgh steelers one of the better teams that converting twopoint conversions now theyre going to maybe take a look at that elbow it was down but now im gonna let them fire her theyre gonna go 42 to try to make it a 10point game under tomlin as you can see a lot of success keep in mind too if somehow the defense winds up at the football and runs a little way back they get two points we will <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> eleven inside faith pass is taken in by marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> for the conversion and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> because he goes to the sideline 21 to 11 the drive the touchdown set up by the pace to it ive been <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> needed a little bit of tension came to the side one looks okay right now was able to get his foot out of the ground chris yeah luckily so and it s got him sort of rolled up on that ankle and i go oh boy theyll have an army of doctors over to look at him nobody did <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> i guess they just say hell be fine stuff as a gun <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> is the backup quarterback sign him weeks ago they caught through the end zone so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> goes back to work again is 643 left into third 21 to 11 later tonight <person player="jimmy garoppolo" race="white" position="QB">jimmy</person> fallon welcoming yes open up our she s a new student in football you suck downtown boston massachusetts on this thursday night 64 degrees in fox pain <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> has completed his last 16 passes beyond moose 14yard it s over the right side people wondering who they gonna use it running back one is suspended they let gray go this guy takes over watch the move here on the outside i mean there are certain guys you just cant block right you just got to make somebody miss and he certainly did with antoine plate vision right to the line that hadnt doubles it even the rare times when he can gain no yardage in fact loses some as <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> makes the tackle <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dion lewis</person> really kind of a remarkable story he was injured in 13 was out of football last year didnt play at all and all of a sudden youre the starting running back for the world champions he cant go figure i mean theyve got stories like that all the time in new england it just nothing falls between the facts with you is that there s no group the university of pittsburgh fair fair second and 16 after the loss of six oh poor man was the judgment thanks to turn a second and long into a third and short is <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> well and it s great having young offensive lineman up there it s even better when you have a young offensive line and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> he just does not hold the football he s not going to make them look bad weve seen peyton manning over the years the same sort of deal but these guys up front are doing a nice job <person player="david andrews" race="UNK" position="C">david andrews</person> and <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey</person> jackson check <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> young guys are doing their job and third and four here comes the blitz through the middle and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gets buried by will safety blitz found the hole on the inside and buries <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> fourth down finally got something going here coming off of right here you come up and then <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> just doesnt see it there s a nice job of disguise by <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> he stayed deep enough that <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> wasnt suspicious and just never saw it coming dick lebeau would have been proud of that dangerous anytime he has his hands on the ball 24yard tries to go back to coverage defense special teams group related fees 27 yard line a 10point game was war 15 left in the third on the founding family the rudi s there is dan on the left who was the ambassador to ireland put that post in 2012 art ruining the second watching their team having scrambled back in the game trying to cut it even further williams goes to the outside craig s tacklers and runs out of bounds after picking up a first down a huge night for williams taking over <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> and a steeler debut he s now gained 111 yards well theyre trying to come up and create some problems but every time they try to squeeze down <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> he keeps beating them to the outside you just dont see patriot defenses historically give up the edge the way that they have tonight <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> has been sensational 15 carries and a yard to that total because i want to well fancy team name a great night here he goes again picks up about five war up to the 44yard line three and a half to go in the third these guys are in position on the outside and i think he is surprising them i maybe they watch some of his carolina tape when he was at 2:30 he s a different looking guy we asked him how he lost weight he sittings all diet he says no im a southern kid least the love fried foods just stop eating we fried everything down he really is a funny guy there it goes again that is tyrell niner first year with the pastries picked up as a free agent make sure he doesnt turn the corner and terrell brown is going to have a bigger and bigger role this year all those years with the 49ers and the raiders and matt patrician knows that this is going to be a growing experience rodney <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> talks about they start very simple in the secondary and build and build and put more things in then itll be 12 brown with a good roll on this thing six his main name better cuts over the middle does bad raucous burger throws pink s brown and brown picks the ball into new england territory to the 45 yard line <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> must have looked at four different receivers here he s like laughs and then back right and then just sort of flipped it over the top that has been some battle tonight look at this offensive line and theyre playing without their leader marquis pouncy up there youve got to have a lot of protection in order to hold the ball and look at that many people great job up front from the 45 weakness emotion man it is cold swings somehow getting both feet in working the sideline makes the grab gets both feet in big game 26 yards i thought that <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> was going to pick that thing off but been basically threw it out of bounds and somehow marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> catches it out of bounds and gets his feedback in we have seen some tremendous plays down the field tonight angela williams back in and threading his way through thirty twoyearold running back takes it for a gain of six let s just go back to the protection now two plays in a row for the pittsburgh steelers and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> he s just holding it nobody is even pressuring him 526 seconds in the nfl that is a lifetime we talked about marcus whedon he had to make some plays tonight without <person player="martavis bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martavis</person> playing in there so is <person player="darius fleming" race="UNK" position="LB">darius</person> a word back the 13 fausta looking back and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> protected well again yard line first down to be first and goal <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> made the tackle you know you want to say the tide is really turning here but i dont know that it is a pittsburgh has been moving the ball like this up on down the field all night long they just werent converting and now theyre starting to have some opportunities to convert anyway 382 total yards it s a lot two recorders from pittsburgh 21 through 11 into the 3rd 10point game back after these messages statistical update for each team is we go to the fourth quarter on the possession 24:27 for the steelers who led the lead in that category last year start the fourth now marcus cris collinsworth michele tafoya foxborough massachusetts to the first and goal who are the steelers from the eighth mr formation is fine they have lined up with that set second down and goal one of the things youll see a lot of is dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> comes shooting i think this is him right here shooting through the gap here he tries to play on the other side of the line of scrimmage and then it gives some of their guys along that defensive line that time rob make a bitch a chance once the bat gets diverted to then make the play second ego <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> comes in motion to the slide the shuttle goes to it s about the distance from the four yard line the third and goal from next pot sort of a semi shovel pass and not so sure pin couldnt have just walked that one into the end zone nobody seemed to really think it was a real run fake he was looking back inside and whirled the fence that brandon was right spreads enough mister this fella tried on third and goal and sliding left trying to get another and you got <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> with his back to the pass and flags all over the endzone three of them just a great play by a veteran their dude number 23 defense that pal occurred in the end zone the ball will be placed at the oneyard line first down then really had nothing there was nobody open here s <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath</person> right here and he realizes this ball is underthrown watch him just wrap his arms back around <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> like im trying to get to the ball he s not looking back at the ball that is automatic you didnt even have to think about it it was going to be pass interference walt died speeding through three flags on the play ball for the same infraction defected to them in the past out of the end zone so johnson went through the middle didnt play fake by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and then he throws it out of the back of the end zone second down the goal well the play fake you just everybody in the house knew what that was going to be extended his arm and then just sort of relaxed after he did that it break up defensively by the patriots and not fall for that that one s the easiest one second and goal to have johnson last time he goes forward wishes command to spot an entry shot of the goal line 13 rosabelle <person player="roosevelt nix" race="white" position="RB">nix</person> is the new fullback now and their former fullback <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> is in there at tailback so a lot of beef <person player="roosevelt nix" race="white" position="RB">nix</person> was a fourtime all mac defensive lineman now playing on the offensive side kept getting cut so they moved into the fullback and he is a force there and formation the tailback movement on the left side and that s gonna cost him five ill bet youve been offered the ship got him to jump but unless im gonna guess pin saying they screamed out something and simulated a snap count inside there and that s why they jumped now i dont know if they did or they didnt but back in the day that s the thing that the umpire would have been listening for in there will not win the argument it s going to move back to the fiveyard line is then put williams back in the game they need a snack they give it to williams barely barely got the play off and better serve had they not ball sheared though paying his first dividend coming out of <person player="asante cleveland" race="UNK" position="TE">cleveland</person> he s going to come out and right back in here and make this play did not fool him he is an outstanding run player and they think he s going to add a little edge for this pass rush as well they are pretty excited about jamal sheered coming to the patriots scobie now a 24 yarder he s too long the ones get on the short one of the and he turns it into a one possession game with 1139 left in regulation hatred plato vanson come in assimilate with super bowl wins great job here and i think it s a pretty good sign for the pittsburgh steelers that theyve come out early in this one defensively at least had a stop and offensively even without some of their biggest stars in this game here tonight theyve still been able to move the football very effectively and looked like we were buried down by 18 but back to a onepossession game bouncing ball is collected over the 30 by <person player="michael williams" race="UNK" position="TE">michael williams</person> and he brings it to the 22 at 11:34 level centipoid secretly thanks a night aerial coverage being brought to you by geico austin on this thursday night the openers the nfl season seven point game <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> who s completed 18 straight passes was 5y the year on first down from the 21 yard line oh sh t and the big truck rolling down a highway takes a little way to the 28 yard line 52 yards just a completely blown coverage out here there s nobody in the middle of field the safety goes to the other way when it s unbelievable how much the pittsburgh steelers have given away tonight <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> put of <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> incomplete second down and ten how do you get that wide open well here s the very next play and there he is again so this has been a bit of an effort here tonight defensively and yet here they are still hanging around and still with a chance to win this football game they just have to come up with yet another play they got away with the safety blitz came up with a sack maybe they just have to start trying to come after <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> then ended <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> string he completed 19 straight the nfl record is 22 in one day 22 straight so theon <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> takes the ball in out of the 22 yard line <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> so clutch of course throughout his career you go back to last year and the super bowl and they were down by 10 and look at those numbers in the fourth quarter two touchdown passes and a third mvp award against the seahawks and the more defense in the league third down and follow them from the 22 ninetyfour right pocket pass is caught cracking attack oh taking it inside the 10 then losing the ball but there is one caste <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> launched the ball that <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> alertly is their <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> signals touchdown away to the officials the brake the brakes luis breaking tackles trying to get into the end zone and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> is right there for the hat trick watch this throw by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> how precise out in front i mean within inches of where it had to be to beat <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> on the play and now <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> is going to call fit up a chance for the steelers and guess who that was a perfect throw and now were starting to see what <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dion lewis</person> can do he thought he was going to score got a little loose that was mike <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> ripping that thing out of there and they just couldnt find it my goodness gracious <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> just living on the field on the touchdown is under review theyre gonna see if <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> recovered the ball in the endzone all scoring plays are reviewed the berkeley comeback if you have gronk in your fantasy league sorry about that but theyre gonna take this touchdown away and make it first and goal then doing the player did recover the ball but he was he recovered the ball short of the goal line and was down by contact with the sixinch yard line it will be first and goal new england so <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> back to two touchdowns my three first and goal inches away now the ball was on the line but i was <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> sort of swatted it back tried to get it back to one of his guys and then down by contact from there so normally a place where <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> were trying to sneak it in himself the sea phase two really big guys if he tries to do that <person player="daniel mccullers" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mccullers</person> and steve mcclendon will be guard and cannot get in itll be second down and goal a little under 10 minutes to play in regulation these are two monsters inside and sure <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is thinking out ill turn around give it to somebody else here weve seen really good movement the entire game by that front but that time those two big guys took advantage of the young guys in there nation is the fullback <person player="brandon bolden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bolden</person> is the running man the left side well throw that on that out of the end zone by <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and easy getting in third and goal <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> with a fool me once kind of a play there he needed to make that onehorse <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s lobbed that one up a little too high if you pre about took brandon bolton s head off and then by the time his feet come down both out there s the rookie boy they draft a lot of outside linebackers in the first round around here nanga chandler is the fullback holden is the running back jaylyn ah spits inside <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> this time <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> chairs have to touch down had to put the linebacker <person player="terence garvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">garvin</person> on him and he just couldnt handle them so brock eventually gets into the end zone you have no choice you got to put your goal line defense in there terrence <person player="terence garvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">garvin</person> out there and now he s gonna say rut row here they come and everybody in the house knew where the pole was going once you put an inside linebacker out there a goal line linebacker you just throw it up at the very least you got to try and put some hands on that guy to disrupt him a bit we heard all week they were gonna try and get hands on <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> but that was a nowin situation for <person player="terence garvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">garvin</person> there for touchdowns for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> tonight what just asking for the extra point so new england was able to limit pittsburgh to a field goal they answer with a touchdown and the lead now is 14 was not wanted to go in foxborough from richmond saturday at 5:00 eastern by smithfield tomorrow 7:00 eastern with the xfinity series racing presented by far better on the extra point holding number 90 on the defense that penalty will be enforced on the kickoff course they had the option there they could have gone for two breaking it down to the oneyard line the whole thing there s it takes a math wizard to figure out all the options on extra points down a lot of new stuff going on you gotta hold stuff going on with <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> what else is new he kill strikes and carried over he just kills the student whose meat does in their way his whole career so braden to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> seven attempts tonight completed five three touchdowns plus one that almost got in but he made it pay off at the end of that last drive 94 yards you know last year when you think about the patriots ago after such a slow start they were 2 &amp; 2 the sky was falling all of that and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> was hurt when he got healthy away they went tended to down the stretch and then the three wins and post mankins prey doesnt settled them in the offensive line williams continues his big night gain of seven yards for him well they have not missed <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon bell</person> i mean let s just say that at <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> has been sensational id say if they miss somebody tonight his <person player="martavis bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martavis bryant</person> all this man coverage all over the field and he got a guy six foot four who runs in the 43 five range can go up and get some balls that would have been nice to have that big guy on the outside but receivers overall for the steelers that night have done a nice job in <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> rain falling and some heavy rain not much during it <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">collins</person> was there covering itll be third down and three that was not one of those fun ones if youre a receiver <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> let him right into <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> their linebacker here he is going to drop back into coverage and if this ball had been complete it would have been a major headache for <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> third and three the steelers away the pain do go for it and send the fieldgoal unit out a little too early to go for it this deep in their own territory fourth and three i thought they might actually run the football there and see what happened you know it okay youre running games going rate great you might pop one and then if you do or if you just get close then you make a decision but a lot of time left in it <person player="jordan berry" race="white" position="P">jordan berry</person> good preseason the jonbenet come and brad wing at a flag at the snap very short at the 36 and another flag comes in at the end as well of course if it s against the patriots via first down right it was fourth down and three you got a huddle back at about the 30 with karl jefferies the offensive foul as you say chris a first down rate he warming up on the sideline and it s gonna wind up being against well you got two flags so youre gonna get offsetting here so regardless of the outcome maybe a few exam that where is roger it might be im trying trying to decipher i think that is often that file is missing holding number 53 of the the family will be in for well there was the firstever where is roger chant you know if he came to the gate that i where we gonna put him are you two right i think anyone who knows <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> expected him to come out tonight and play extremely well and he has not disappointed 24 28 for touchdowns another super night for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> who now figures to slow down the pace of it over the 14 point lead natan had to go from the 26 we start with a 1 by louis you know <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and weve known a long time chris is able to compartmentalize a lot of stuff and he had to over the last seven months but i mean the wounds are still there yeah and i asked him pointblank i said did you destroy your cell phone and if so why and you know he didnt mince any words he said my representative said no way are you turning over your cell phone they have no right to your cell phone whatsoever and he said i delete all my messages anyway they even if they had gotten it what difference would have made casspi going down the sideline and it s no good because he is out of bounds so that is incomplete theyll bring that one back and it will be third down in 12 and just to finish the story so he said you know they had all those texts anyway with just rimsky and jim mcnally and the guys in question they had their phone so it wasnt like they didnt have it so he was all fired up then at the end of it he goes i cannot believe that you guys got me sucked back into those emotions but we saw just how raw it was from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and then he sort of just took a deep breath and settled back in and came out and played like <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> always those third down and 12 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> interesting comments insurance postgame press conference belichick will say were on the buffalo that s when i go next week third and 12 rain coming down a harder night i ran most of the game down at the line of scrimmage then make it fourth down so pittsburgh needing a quick three and out and that s exactly what they got yeah good job by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> on that one getting his hands on the football exactly what they needed almost no time taken off the clock and the decision to punt on the last one for the steelers the right one allen s punt brown has to back up is a flag down wow catches it on the run going backwards into a decent run back but the flag is down at the line of scrimmage it was fourth down and 12 theyre gonna have a little motion that s an interesting call there do you want to add five to that or have them re punt that one i think youre gonna have them reap on it you have used to punt it s too good 68 for 62 yards fiveyard penalty replay fourth down yeah then you dont want to you dont want it to be a 57 your net punch sunday night football and it comes away in three nights as we take our traveling circus down to the lone star state football night starts at 7:00 eastern time new york giants and the dallas cowboys that s what 7 yeah early on the giants kind of dominated when this stadium opened i think they want at least two in a row down there right i should know we did a loss including the opener he begin to run together a little bit it s not <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">alan</person> s quite a much shorter one and we fear caught at the 35 yard line by <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> so we are halfway through the fourth quarter you know the one thing about the patriots ooh i mean and you got to bring it up the fact you have all this stuff it s a neverending thing you have the two longform pieces that i mentioned before coming out this week sometimes too much winning breeds contempt and there s no question there are some teams in the national football league that dont like the patriots for a lot of reasons we had a conversation with 15 opinionated guys the other night and nobody had strong feelings about what really happened in this whole situation there s just unanswered questions everywhere <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> throwing and and he picks up a first down in patriot territory spotted at the 46 yard line well now youre starting to see the patriots back up and give a little room so there s plenty of room out here to the corner route this is a young secondary for new england growing up as well and i think <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s taken advantage of down just a bit here tonight they desperately need this drive and need it to happen fairly quickly good protection the double coverage intercepted inside the 10yard line doron armand coming over from the safety spot help over the top picks it off it helped that doron hartmann was moving in that direction here he is here he moves that way but he had a running start on that ball because they were doing that rotation he was moving that way gave him a great jump and was there to make the interception much better job that time as well by <person player="bradley fletcher" race="UNK" position="DB">bradley fletcher</person> he was all over <person player="darius fleming" race="UNK" position="LB">darius</person> hayward bay not easy to throw those deep balls into the in the rain either so with exactly seven minutes now it s the first interception theyll be inefficient <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> last year the patriots take a look at that over the last nine games six in the regular year all three in post fourthquarter touchdowns allowed zip you got top in leverbacks playoff game with your now it just didnt happen well became a 10point deficit in the super bowl to 14point deficit against kowski ziggler s the first down but he s not going to get it and be third down and inches in the penalty you know but this game really shifted with that goal line stand by the patriots when they the steelers were down to the oneyard line and then they jammed it out from the one your first down well that one on <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez</person> <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">alan</person> tomlin will take his team back home they have their home opener a week from sunday against san francisco well i would say the issue for the pittsburgh steelers coming in was their young secondary i think it s the same issue going out i think you have to feel pretty good about what this offensive line did even without announcing what this partner has been sharp tonight good play from the receivers but theyre not the first ones that couldnt stop <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> offensively a couple of mystery girls and says with the offense itself but but not very good in the redzone one of the big questions with brian <person player="bryan stork" race="UNK" position="C">stork</person> out there starting center put this guy <person player="david andrews" race="UNK" position="C">david andrews</person> holed up and i think he s played an excellent game he was a college creation undrafted but he was the mvp at the university of georgia and their team captain so here s a guy that got to play all the preseason and got a lot of experience they played together and for a guy that went undrafted and started for the world champs i have to say that was pretty well done there s the sidelines elements things around man stays in and gets the first down during opening night for <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> has now caught 11 passes for 97 yards you know you go back to the playoffs a year ago and all he did in the playoffs was catch eight against the ravens at nine against the colts and nine in the superbowl and maybe the biggest play that nobody talks about was that third down in 14 when they absolutely had to have something going and he made that catch and just got absolutely drilled by kam chancellor his arm was pretty good too yeah yeah really had that throat <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> was huge in the baltimore game ii while <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> comes off the field stop the clock momentarily we expected a lot of rain that i didnt get it but now it s coming down pretty good how happy you think <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is right now on a scale of 94 that s a really smart aleck remarks im what i notice when im talking to myself brands who boldin up to the 30yard line patriots can begin to think about chewing up the clock itll be second down matt patricia boy is he a good guy smart guy a science guy and fell in love with football and his i said it was a loneliest feeling hed ever had in his life and they were down on that one yard line and belichick wouldnt talk to him and theyre screaming to coach you want us to take a timeout and he doesnt say there s no just played im not giving them a break bringing up working out perfectly you knew that going on defense in if theyre gonna beat him probably that best chance creating eats up all of the plane climbs or amusing <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> gotta love that patricia look to you know the full beard hat backwards i want to make sure the defense sees them all in red and of course the number two pencil ala bella trick well some things you have to bear when you come here to cut yourself go with rookie free agent <person player="david andrews" race="UNK" position="C">david andrews</person> in there again and that is a big man he is going against able to get some movement and keep this running game going any more first down and have issues on 3rd for grady approaching 300 yards when it s lower and that is a complete lob pass incomplete intended for <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> and women will punt it away boy steelers got away with one there they didnt have anybody at all in coverage and now <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s going to get one more shot brian allen with his fourth punt of the night and <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> they could change and that one the flag down at the line of scrimmage it was fourth down at four the penalty was against pittsburgh will be a first down but it s gonna be against the england theyre gonna go over and explain the options here to tomlin again you had a touchback and i think he s saying it was a hold on them so you can march them back and make them kick it again but youre taking time off lot im not sure what it made him kick again just so that brown gu get a chance to run it back yeah whatever get it out to the thirty so not all bad yep so a tick under three minutes to play pittsburgh with two timeouts make it three so <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> has the time and well see what he can do see if he can move him around with those pump pegs were asking him about those pump fakes the other day and he said you know 60 to 70 percent of them are balls im actually intending to throw but i just hold on to you know i changed my mind at the last minute it s not some intentional make to move guys i im really thinking about throwing it harder to do it in this weather there goes <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> escaping extend was he just so bullying and nasty the years incomplete intended from <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> second down it was really fun to watch the patriots practice what <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> does best extend those plays and theyre screaming stay on your guy chase your guy and they would make him cover for six or seven or eight seconds down the field and back up because so many times when <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> gets in that scramble mode he wants the big play he doesnt want something little and so youll see their defensive backs they werent questioned at all despite how long it took to get that play off play clock at three secondly ten licking off with the mill away back this way to the left side that is various a word may respondent let s talk a little short of the first down keeps on a woman and it s gonna be third down and inches and daria s a word bei kind of collapsed on the tail end of that plate he should have had that first down and you a precious seconds come off the clock as well third initials a while seconds go up that s <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> well take the ball go to 46 yard line if you want to take a timeout on this side of the twominute warning they got to go they got to go they got to get another playoff here you go to think about the timeout on this side of the twominute warning otherwise okay you got the twominute one an opportunity for you to get an extra play in the corner pretty much like the end of the first half not very good clock management too much to go in foxborough 2014 new england oh were not there for sunday night sunday night it s the giants against the cowboys season number 10 volkswagen postgame report michelle on the field with an interview bob tony rodney and heinz will break it all down take a look ahead to sunday night in arlington texas and carry two kind of mr tonight wont get it on thursday night know that part of our deal for the 46 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> traffic booth and it s incomplete three patriots converging on marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> second down to ten <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> right there and <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> was one of those guys in high demand he was a lot of people interested in him <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> there s <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mccourty</person> and gordie converted over from a corner but one of the things you always worry about taking a corner to a safety position is really technical and we had someone on once and he had to make against marshawn lynch in that super bowl and he managed to get him on the ground it was impressive dont you and unable to do it say word bae <person player="bradley fletcher" race="UNK" position="DB">bradley fletcher</person> corralling plot keeps running 140 lat i think having to switch sides of the field you know a lot of times then the hurryup offense you wont see those guys having to go back and forth they just get wherever and that s heating up a lot of clock trying to theyre done and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> will convert that s brown making mckenney cheese inside the pink tree at 40 for a first down any timeout taken by the steelers so it s opening night be one of 256 another big night for braiding starts the year with 14 days bloodthirsty catching three of those matches great job in relief of thesis three straight games over two years worth every game with five or more countries pretty remarkable really there s a guy that in the last two years more catches than anybody in the national football league slight guy one big smile very pleasant sixth round draft choice back in 2010 central michigan and that is caught but a flag is flown back behind the line of scrimmage and that will stop the clock with 1:10 youve got one player for the patriots which of all shared with his helmet off dont know if somebody knocked it off or not hands to the face number 68 offense first which the left tackle <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> btrim take a look 68 right there on your screen definitely hit the helmet the kind as he was going down you know what i mean it looked like he sort of slipped on to play and then takes away this which would have given the steelers a chance glancing blow still yelling first in 20 from the 49 yard line for milliwatt and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> that s all i can do to hold on to the limit helmet comes to play that must just barely have his helmet that s the second play in a row and he gets credit for the sack doesnt need a helmets gonna come right around the end here that s a pretty good pass protector out there in <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beach him too and look at the way he uses his hands they have been working a lot with his technique here they think physically he has all the tools and they can just upgrade that technique a little bit he s gonna be scared and anxious finding anybody so he goes to <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> to his collection of catches over the years he s up near the top of the charts in the tree at the 38 yard line they needed 27 got 18 so it s still third down and nine <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> most wins as a starting quarterback for one team 160 and farmed with 160 but tonight add 1 in 27 official seconds and then well put him atop that leaderboard and <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> now the second alltime leading receiver passes john stallworth tonight with eight catches ways to go to hit the hines ward though yeah bar man hines and even thousand third nine dancing and setting up the fourth down intended therefore wheatland so new england will start the year with a victory they will go to buffalo next week and of course that means when rex ryan meeting belichick there s <person player="robert golden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">robert</person> kraft the owner this team bottom in the mid90s as watch them go to seven super bowls four wins three losses no denying what that guy has done for this organization well and for the league itself fourth down and nine from the 38 yard line <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> escaping looking firing and it s caught at the 22 yard line for a first down and well take a timeout one of the thing about bob craft just to bring it up i asked him about his relationship with roger goodell i mean he s always been goodell biggest booster among the owners you know it s a twosided thing he s got to wear two hats one is as the owner of this team he hates what s happened over the last several months hates it thinks it was unnecessary on the other hand craft is so important owner because he s on the television committee the relocation finance all of the recipe and goodell have to do a lot of business together on that end and you talk about compartmentalizing things that s what kraft has to do yeah and let s face it there s a lot of pressure from a lot of people around the league who think the patriots dont always play by the rules so the minute something came up it was hey you got to go get these guys now this is not right this is a nut once again a spy game and all that stuff so it has been a strange political mix this year for the national football league and then <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> throwing thought stops the clock weirdly enough for people who are just tangentially interested in the game they maybe arent marched in what s happened off the field and on the field not made should not mean either not wait for it the end yeah were were not quite team jen sohyun yeah i only want to get into the yeah i only want to get into the legal side of it i stated in the one oclock in the morning the other night reading that whole legal thing they didnt really get to the facts of the case it was all about due process and lack of notice and all that stuff <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and that is caught by brown for a touchdown and make a couple of people happy in a minute here because <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> gets beaten and hickson an eightpoint game for the moment a couple of things that are gonna be in play here right now <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> just dead perfect position maybe used up all its luck in the super bowl but we couldnt depend on better spots looking at the ball and somehow it missed his hands will speak about tangentially interested there are a few people more than tangentially interested right now scogan and that created a few boos and ahhs around the country believe me i dont need you to get me in trouble i can hear that on my own me too so that makes it a seven point game with two seconds remaining in the fourth quarter brown <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> going head to head tonight you know <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> certainly made his plays but when you lose throw revis and urine end up with one of your guys who wasnt even a starter in the super bowl that youre gonna say okay go cover the best guy or one of the best wide receivers in the game i dont know that bill belichick would go that s one side it at all ill take that effort tonight from <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> and that one of course the touchdown ends up really in garbage time at the end of the game that garbage time for some some way to keep an audience i know that two seconds remaining to miss field goes for big red zone fall pause were big is it folks paul or faux pas you going home you know and really that you take the two most field goals in the blown chance from the oneyard line that s the difference in the game right now one drive after they cut it to ten it bogged down get a little onside kick here palestine will be there and that will do it so the season has opened with a victory by the super bowl champions never trail <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> for touchdowns another big night 25 out of 32 for 288 was grady tonight <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> corn 11 <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> caught three touchdown passes michelle on the fieldfox only rodney and hiya strip it all down both with postgame report stay tuned next
