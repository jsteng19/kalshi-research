one time under their new head coach charlie <person player="bill bell" race="UNK" position="TE">bell</person> and again hoping to salvage a measure of satisfaction from what has so far been a very disappointing season relief for these people in the victory over florida state would be big satisfaction indeed hello im jim lampley it has been more than a year and florida state university lost the football game it has been more than a year since the university of florida won one during that time a lot of things that happened carly <person player="bill bell" race="UNK" position="TE">bell</person> has arrived at florida to take over and begin rebuilding the <person player="gator cherry" race="UNK" position="RB">gator</person> football program and <person player="bobby butler" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby</person> bowden and the seminoles have continued what is now one of the most unusual and interesting success stories in all of college football a success story we wanted to show to all of you across the entire nation here with me today to watch the seminoles in the <person player="gator cherry" race="UNK" position="RB">gator</person> a former quarterback who can still throw it pretty well in our tech football game league rose cup and tougher this should be your kind of ball game i think we will definitely see the ball in the air line you know we could see a record number of passes florida started throwing the ball recently with <person player="larry ochab" race="UNK" position="QB">larry</person> osap today their backup quarterback john elberon will be playing at the tailback position so we could see him throwing the run fast now you know about florida state already they have a tandem of quarterbacks who have really become a household word in college football and im speaking of course about<person player="wally woodham" race="UNK" position="QB">wally woodham</person>and<person player="jimmy jordan" race="UNK" position="QB">jimmy jordan</person>now between those two guys they have combined for over 7,000 yards of career total offense now finishing their third year of sharing the florida state quarterback

fraternity brothers they have roommates on the road they are like in so many ways and yesterday i talked to them about the unique situation in which they scare the quarterbacking duties of florida thing while a you and <person player="jimmy jordan" race="UNK" position="QB">jimmy</person> has had a fascinating experience these past several years have you ever thought back that perhaps you would have been happier being at another school where you could have had the quarterbacking job all to yourself rather than to have shared it with them well not really it s been a <person player="mike good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> situation at florida state over the last three years weve only lost five ball games and im i really enjoyed it as far to stay and of course im from tallahassee florida and i im kind of glad to be staying at home is there a positive aspect to the sharing of the quarterback job in the sense that you dont feel the pressure to have to do everything on your own you know that he s there if something isnt going like for you yeah there s that security there for that and also it s just that it s worked out for our team you know when when guys not doing it other guys come in done the job and it s worked out the last three years and were just glad it has this week youre starting what does that mean to you well it means um you know that weve been starting on and off all along and i im just my jobs to go out and get it started and get it going and im kimmy could come on or i dont know i might go all the way it s just what coach bowden feels <person player="jimmy jordan" race="UNK" position="QB">jimmy</person> this weekend youre in the situation in which youve been so frequently while they will start the ball game what are you thinking about you sit on the bench and watch and wait for when your opportunity is going to come yes so you know ill be you know trying to be ready when if i get called upon well you know i got to start the lsu game goes to televised in touch about tostito be fair while i store distances to be on tv that s <person player="mike good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> you know were winning and that s what

fights about about this you know it could be you know when i was were really sorry about the situation we were not a decision typical of the way <person player="bobby butler" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby</person> bowden has handled the two quarterbacks all along<person player="wally woodham" race="UNK" position="QB">wally woodham</person>will start to because<person player="jimmy jordan" race="UNK" position="QB">jimmy jordan</person>started the lsu game earlier in the season which was telecast to most of the country the two teams that played 21 times florida has won 16 of them since in the 1950s the florida state legislature decreed that they must begin playing each other however florida state has won the last two and they are the dog which is on top now florida will try to reverse things when we come back you heard late roast up say that freshman reserve quarterback john elberon would be playing a tailback today for florida he has also been selected to return the opening kickoff for the <person player="gator cherry" race="UNK" position="RB">gator</person> and back to kick it for florida state is number 17 bills compete a junior from miami who handles only the kickoff shores for the seminoles the field goal kicker is another man so here s the pizzicato all the way to the end zone without the <person player="tyrone young" race="UNK" position="QB">young</person> men will be on the offensive line for the gators <person player="chris faulkner" race="UNK" position="TE">chris</person> partner a walkon freshman tight end an outstanding

field in yard loss let s take a look at lefty number 72 as jim lampley just pointed out the strongest man on the team who was demoted to a second string player because of attitude problems earlier this year has regained the starting role and there you see some of that awesome strength and quickness fourth down as florida state fails to convert on their first turned down opportunity wrong son number three goes back to front number 21 is he proposed in a way i just it takes the florida state goal inside the 25 to the 23 yard line before <person player="gary henry" race="UNK"

weeks ago him sober <person player="gator cherry" race="UNK" position="RB">gator</person> had trouble on offense this year but he has made a difference as you pointed out against auburn he threw for 269 yards and he has given them something going through the air that is something they did not have prior to that as we look over at<person player="wally woodham" race="UNK" position="QB">wally woodham</person>who was sacked and that was always a nice sack of the year florida state offensive line is generally done a great job if it s all important no sad relation the <person player="cris

screen <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> and he comes in most unnatural memory oh ja he was under pressure and no one was open i work with the man clearing out the protection look there but he s through other way ive read bill hunter with the <person player="mike good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> coverage on <person player="curt garrett" race="UNK" position="DB">garrett</person> now<person player="gary henry" race="UNK" position="DB">gary henry</person>is deep to receive for florida state as again<person player="bill conover"

ball to bounce the florida cover his head to get downfield guarantee midland was signed a block in front of him but they could not open up a hole in florida safe well start on the 38 yard line when we come back charlotte the lead lineman for bear bryant in alabama and the bulk of that career coaching record some vials at jacksonville state and then at clemson he jumps off side for florida and so the seminoles of florida state are the beneficiaries of the first penalty of the ballgame and that will move the football to the 48 not lucky runs another <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> chunk of the quarterback salivating after that first act right well make it first down five now for fsu sardis johnson is to the bottom of the dream jax flowery janaki

player="michael whiting" race="UNK" position="RB">michael whiting</person>who jim lampley has really made a difference in their running game and he s also effective as a receiver he took over right after a game that i covered earlier this year against virginia tech was by that time they had lost two of their tailback you might want to amplify we look at <person player="bobby butler" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby</person> bowden along the sidelines they have had trouble at the tailback position losing greg ramsay and and the big pullback is inside the 30 to the 25 yard line lucky dragged him down from behind 14yard pickup for life so another first down for fsu this part of their running game has not been week however there s not much of a hole here but he has been known to make his own holes and that of course is big<person player="mark lyles" race="UNK" position="RB">mark lyles</person>who is second in career rushing now for the seminoles and has been a consistent ground gainer for them all year long <person player="juan collins" race="UNK" position="DB">juan</person> collin slowed him down before lucky dragged him down is his first down four floors made at the 26 <person

fernando <person player="spencer jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> a freshman linebacker and the penalty is apparently going to be in off there you saw a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> bit of the sophistication of their passing attack they have so many different ways that they can hurt you they there is the call right there they do a lot of screens a lot of draws they use the set to a liberty play they really vary their protection a lot they use play actual classes and of course they have an outstanding drop back series pass depiction has been one of the keys they pointed out only eight sacks coming into the day walli water and give me george the opportunity artists duncan to the top of the screen here the freshmen received of the field one weak side the hardest james <person player="tim golden" race="UNK" position="DL">golden</person> number 57 batted the ball down for four<person player="tim golden" race="UNK" position="DL">tim golden</person>is a guy that charlie tell like the lion he is very high on the potential of this defensive line it was thought that the front seven of florida would be as <person player="mike good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> as any front seven in the sec but they have been decimated this year by injury they lost starting defensive tackle steve tanner they lost starting defensive tackle<person player="david galloway" race="UNK" position="DL">david galloway</person>a long<person player="yancey sutton" race="UNK" position="DL">yancey sutton</person>for several games made compelling is on to attempt a 41yard field goal for the seminole this kick is low the fella was 13 of 18 in the field goal department before that we make 13 of my team holder rick stock sales pelin hit it high capela already the career scoring leader for florida state before this season even started he added to that but that time you miss connection the blood will have the football what was the line of scrimmage the 25yard line and the seminoles have wasted the first scoring opportunity at the game three wide receivers 51 is<person player="james gilbert" race="UNK" position="DL">james gilbert</person>a sophomore defensive tackle from miami he was the major who s got the football another criminal had deflected it into the air watch very carefully youre going to see the bulb tip before <person player="james gilbert" race="UNK" position="DL">gilbert</person> comes up with the interception there is the tip right there and here comes the key interception that jen laughs lead is foucault s and now excellent field position for the seminole who got the fifth number 16 got mclean and sophomore defensive end from clermont florida was the man who tipped a reserve defensive end is on this hot day <person player="bobby butler" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby</person> bowden has already gone to some substitution defense to drag miles down as he gets inside the 15 to the 14 yard line there is named <person player="james gilbert" race="UNK" position="DL">gilbert</person> one of four defensive tackles whom <person player="bobby butler" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby</person> bob uses interchangeably on defense for florida state and the sophomore from miami his first major seventh of the that is a rare experience for a defensive tackle and herself the path goes on his face he is the envy of all the other defensive line right now why couldnt it see me second down six yards to go bill williams to the bottom of the green fighting it folks we tried to release the ball number yesi <person player="yancey sutton" race="UNK" position="DL">sutton</person> got this yesi <person player="yancey sutton" race="UNK" position="DL">sutton</person> who also went to tallahassee leon high school same place that wally would him and<person player="jimmy jordan" race="UNK" position="QB">jimmy jordan</person>went to school an enormous urge to play today and he s coming back off of an injury having missed five games just to play in this one very inspirational story because yes he is deaf our if he lip reads very well in fact last year he s apparently lip read a fake punch in a ball game against georgia tech while he would have only two out of five so far on the ball game for 23 yards third down six they must get the ball to the eight yard line for a first down <person player="wally woodham" race="UNK" position="QB">woodham</person> doesnt like what he sees on the florida defense and so far the florida defensive line has been very active much more so than i think the seminoles had expected them to be possibly because of the reemergence of doc lucky the man who they felt would be the best man along that front wall certainly he is the physically strongest he has a militant press of over 500 pounds and that does not mean that he bench press is a 500 pounds pin i wanted to clarify that because someone asked me about that reason theyre down 11 now but nobody was open downfield timbaland got there first <person player="robin fisher" race="UNK" position="DL">robin</person> fischer followed it well if we were going to do any of the keys today i would have said that the key for florrum that was to establish a past life they would have to do that the propeller is highly sophisticated crashing attack up florida state so far they have done that and done it very well this is the identical spot from which davy compelling miss just a minute to half ago only pin back to season two of them so far here in the first court florida state is now old for for on third down conversions and in preparation for this field goal they have called timeout criminals brought 10,000 fans over from tallahassee well be drying from 41 yards out to give that rescue this one s <person player="mike good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> six minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter the defensive tackle<person player="james gilbert" race="UNK" position="DL">james gilbert</person>florida state was unable to move the offense but they picked up the field goal by dave develop and lead it 3 nothing there is a man who is having an incredible year he recently had his 50th birthday 30th wedding anniversary he has a brand new contract you might want to talk more about and just three days ago he received his first franchise and oldest son getting him with a grandson named bo so found and considered this kind of a turning point year he has turned bid week still <person player="tyrone young" race="UNK" position="QB">young</person> enough the car about another opportunity but reaching the point where he wanted to find a place where he might settle down he has florida state for security when he was getting offers from other schools he was contacted specifically this year by lmu and they gave it to him in the form of a fiveyear contract total package over six hundred thousand dollars there s janelle <person player="johnell brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> he wait stick you call from compete like wind is behind bill capisce and you saw him knock it all the way out of the end

player="keith jones" race="UNK" position="DB">keith jones</person>both had a shot at that ball was made of the fact that john l <person player="johnell brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> was starting at tailback for florida today but has not yet touch the ball from that position however he is the leading ball carrier on the team he has been a backup quarterback he wasnt mailed back first and he can run and he can throw oh 3 of 8 for 19 yo standings after bullhog and he had to wait permit play a<person player="keith jones" race="UNK" position="DB">keith jones</person>is coming into your coverage this ball is well thrown along the sidelines biochem their goal and here is<person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">cris collinsworth</person>showing some of the form which i think next year is going to make him an allamerican here he is isolated he reminds me a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> bit of an old teammate of mine del cauca in 64 192 pounds and he is fat on first down from the fsu 49 yard line that is perry williams with the football do you think im sexy i think it s probably about yulin you think im sick well ask <person player="larry ochab" race="UNK" position="QB">larry</person> in there marty cindy or elaine well apparently they do and thank you dont thank me thank you bet oh dad that is salim fourth in defensive end got <person player="scott warren" race="UNK" position="DL">warren</person> who went all the way downfield 20 yards past the line of scrimmage to cover that s a tough assignment when a defensive end has to cover<person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">cris collinsworth</person>all alone because of the nature of the coverage is open but it s a <person player="mike good" race="UNK" position="OL">good</person> call by the official that s what florida was able to affect that time by putting two wide receivers to the top of the screen they got the defensive end covering collinsville exactly what they want to do today is mix up their formations a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> bit more we might even see them using the shotgun which they have not used this year the penalty now being walked off against florida holding call against the gators so it all would have gone for not even if allensworth had stayed inbounds and that moves the football back to the floor 38yard line were now in a second bound 23 yards to go for a first down john whitaker number 34 in the game is pull back for florida oh castro almost every day donnell <person player="johnell brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> jarnell not too happy about that you mentioned him just a moment ago that we hadnt seen him get his hands on the football the first time he does get his hands on the ball tempted past reception he dropped it he frustrated there is number one gone van wie who is the long field goal kicker for florida and also the kickoff man and he is practicing into the net third down 23 yards to go for florida first down the fsu like that keep dome knock them out of bounds and thatll make it fourth down

gone down since jones the freshman defensive tackle number 86 was the man who stopped wild after a couple for now it will be third down a yard to go for a first down all is at the 28 they must get just inside the place up not necessarily a running situation for florida state i think every situation is a possible passing situation and they could go play austin pass and trying to go for the touchdown right now william to the bottom of the screen the second time today the like getting started when you turn a certain one into an obvious running situation you really have an obvious passing
