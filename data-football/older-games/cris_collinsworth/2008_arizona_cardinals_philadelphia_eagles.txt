starts first and ten with <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> in a one back set <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> on the season at 59% can throw on first down nice safe throw <person player="jason avant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jason</person> upon picks up about five of the play as we take a look at the arizona cardinals starting defense and they can get pressure up front brian <person player="bryan robinson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robinson</person> s had a good year <person player="darnell dockett" race="UNK" position="DT">darnell dockett</person> with three sacks on the season very good active line backing core gjo kiefer <person player="gerald hayes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gerald hayes</person> and carlos <person player="karlos dansby" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dansby</person> nandi with 83 tackles on the season <person player="ralph brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ralph brown</person> in for the injured <person player="roderick hood" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roderick</person> could the former philadelphia eagle the safeties and good ones with <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> and <person player="antrel rolle" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antrel rolle</person> <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> will work out of the shotgun on a second and 5 <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> as a first down to the 42 yard line it s a gain of 7 well for the philadelphia eagles kind of a nice start for them your quarterback <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> who has been completing less than 50 percent of his passes over the last three games which is never good for a west coast quarterback comes out in hits mine and then <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> who we were told before the game he feels pretty good well he hasnt been feeling very good lately in this season so that s also a good sign for the eagles yeah we talked with him on tuesday talked about the high ankle sprain and the knee problems he s had on the 1st and 10 here s <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> again up to the 45 mixup on the tackle but boy <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> is really the engine to this offense isnt he chris when he s healthy and right this offense could be unstoppable at times yeah and you know you talk about <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> and he s been the focal point of this football team for so long but if youve watched the eagles over the years you know that that young man right there <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> is the guy that makes it go how many times have we seen screen passes or punt returns or big runs or whatever the case he can make everything that s wrong right with his eagles offense when he gets it going and the eagles like to pass the football and they empty the backfield out on the second and 7 for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> plenty of time im vaughn again for rogers cromartie on the tackle chris what about you know taking some pressure off <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> as far as what you do in the passing game well i think youre seeing it already the last few weeks weve seen <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> taking a lot of shots down the field trying to come up with a big play well that s not really the essence of the west coast offense the west coast offense has it s run by andy is youre supposed to complete a high percentage go back to the days of bill walsh the running game is essentially your passing game and theyre going to throw the ball about 60% of the time in this game so <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> has to complete a high percentage if they work out of a traditional eye but <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> will throw under pressure that a screen the basket gets a block on the edge of basket run out at about the 41 yard line looked like the left guard <person player="todd herremans" race="white" position="OT">todd</person> harriman s sprung him for a few extra yards so even in a traditional eye they throw yeah and i think marty morning products doing a great job calling plays thus far in this one youve got a quarterback who by his own admission is in one of the worst lumps of his life making more negative plays that he can ever remember you come out what do you do a couple of dinks a couple of dunks a little screen pass all of a sudden now he s got a perfect night going and he s starting to feel pretty good about himself marty mourning weakened his third years offensive coordinator <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> jyp s near the first down marker cut down short 937 about a yard short <person player="antrel rolle" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antrel rolle</person> to 4th year pro out of miami on the tackle so one of the things that i have brought up with the philadelphia eagles and they typically are not a football team that runs the ball alive but they are an nfc east football team and theyre playing against a team coming in from the west who traditionally the nfc east teams can run the ball i think well see a little more running tonight out of the evenings that we typically do <person player="kyle eckel" race="UNK" position="RB">kyle</person> eckle comes in a 2 back sat eckle has a first down secondyear man out of navy sunday october 21st then he says im not going down not going down but you listen to the crowd ive got to have to laugh a little bit if you followed the eagles at all this season you know and as they convert a simple third one the crowd goes berserk yeah <person player="kyle eckel" race="UNK" position="RB">kyle</person> akal is born in south philadelphia so playing for the hometown eagles pretty good moment for him to see the third down conversions teams in the nfl hit it at about 66% so good drive for philadelphia which started at their own thirty first and ten the arizona 35 mcnab with some pressure mcnab finds the agent makes something out of nothing and picks up a couple not to change christian his game from earlier in his career there s no question about it i used to talk to defensive coordinators all the time when wed come in and do a game and you say okay what s your numberone concern and almost every one of them would say <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> running the football because we can defend their running game we can defend their passing game he doesnt always hit a high percentage of his passes the thing we could never stop was him running the football but <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> his sort of stopped doing it on his own and i think it s hurt his game second and eight he picked up two on the play <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> the tailback in the eye <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> squeezes through her <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> has a first down for yard line that s the old <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> visited chris it really was and he showed great patience on that when dan pleco the fullback the former defensive tackle watch this block he gets late <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> s going to sit there and just wait wait wait and then <person player="dan klecko" race="UNK" position="DE">klecko</person> comes in and gets the block and he shoots it right through it s kind of entertaining to see a fullback that also has two sacks on the season leading the way for <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> gang <person player="dan klecko" race="UNK" position="DE">klecko</person> the son of former jet great <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe</person> clock oh a threetime probowler were made the pro bowl in three different positions on the defensive line so on a first and ten the 24 <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> checks down <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> he dives down at the 11 yard line it s another first down gain of 14 boy chris it s been a while theyre getting closer to that end zone now 21 consecutive drives without scoring a touchdown and this is an offense that has simply made a lot of mistakes but were seeing a lot out of them tonight not only running the football <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> running the football the rollout moving the pocket a very wide assortment of plays thus far in this one all right <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> has split out wide to the right <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> who has 13 rushes this season will take the direct snap for the five yard line and <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn</person> jackson has a rushing touchdown this season and ive had a couple sunday nights ago against new york well weve seen the wildcat offense everywhere in the national football league you dont see your smallish wide receiver very often though taking it in between the guards and running that way but i think for the philadelphia eagles theyre throwing out everything they have in the playbook tonight they understand for them to stay in the race for them to stay alive this season they have to win this football game 12th play the drive coming up for philadelphia <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> big flat going to split backs at the shovel pass to <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> and he s in for the touchdown <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> needed in the worst of ways was 15th passing touchdown of the season so a 70 yard drive for the eagles <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> to <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> 704 on the clock in philadelphia out to a seven nothing lead is give acres banks on the oh <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> took the shovel pass good blocking up front and <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> says thank you a lead for the eagles philadelphia then the shovel pass to <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> and the touchdown 704 on the clock for philadelphia boy well executed by the eagles acres on the kickoff jayjay <person player="jj arrington" race="UNK" position="RB">arrington</person> from his own sex erikson had a 55yard return last week but he s stood up and dropped at the 24 yard line by <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn</person> concen don other eagles hope they can feast tonight against <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> in the cardinals keep us of time for the eagles ryan <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> and the eagles with a seven nothing lead against <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> and the arizona cardinals <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> with 21 touchdown passes this season <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tim hightower</person> dragged down from behind by chris go cong we look at the starting offense of the arizona cardinals and <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> five consecutive 300yard passing games that is the secondbest streak in nfl history <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> the rookie out of richmond has been a key contributor <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> 73 catches <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> 72 the strength of the offensive line the left side with <person player="mike gandy" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike gandy</person> and <person player="reggie wells" race="nonwhite" position="OT">reggie wells</person> second and 11 for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> and the cardinals checks down underneath bouldin tripped up by quentin <person player="quintin demps" race="nonwhite" position="DB">demps</person> short of the first down marker at the 29 yard line so we get about five of it back well we saw the arizona cardinals come out and give it the obligatory one run in the first drive and say okay that s it for work let s put the ball back in the hands of <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> you know they have so many guys that were back with that pittsburgh offense then they want to pound the ball but they know their best chance is with <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> and these two great receivers third and five for water and the cardinals as they try to answer the philadelphia score <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> with time <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> to the sideline and what a catch by <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve breaston</person> bolden and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> get a lot of the pub but breasts in the second year man out of michigan having a great year let me just tell you this if you havent seen the arizona cardinals play very much youre going to be in for a lot of these kind of catches tonight i think that this group as a team probably catches the football as well as any team i have seen in a long long time and <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">breaston</person> is the third of those <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> and bolden are just sensational catching the football gain of 17 <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> found a bat sit outside shut down by quentin michael and stuart <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> as we take a look at the philadelphia eagles starting defense up front chuckwei farkas at a great year five sacks and 63 tackles the tackles are stout and <person player="brodrick bunkley" race="UNK" position="DT">bunkley</person> and <person player="mike patterson" race="UNK" position="DT">patterson</person> good young line backing core <person player="akeem jordan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">akeem jordan</person> has been inserted into the starting lineup from arthur with <person player="asante samuel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">asante samuel</person> out in the secondary the cell johansson gets to start at one of the corners loss of three second and thirteen bolded in motion <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> michelle johansson off the deflection turn over <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> had a chance couldnt convert but <person player="joselio hanson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hanson</person> gets his first sack of the season i was just about to talk about what a huge loss <person player="asante samuel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">asante samuel</person> was going to be in this game trying to defend these great receivers and then his replacement jose leo hansen comes up with the interception <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> tries to drop this one in over the top to <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> but the tip pass was the difference so many times <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> tries to just throw the ball high enough to allow his receivers to go mouth up and make a play that time just not enough bite on the ball and for hansen not only his first pick of the season the first pick of his fouryear career and he s keeping it so after a 70 yard drive now <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> and the eagles have a short field from the 41 of arizona <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> stood up and drilled in the hole by the middle linebacker <person player="gerald hayes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gerald hayes</person> there s a sante <person player="asante samuel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">samuel</person> who suffered a neck injury last week suffered a stinger in the football game and you know out for tonight didnt practice it all this week it was a bizarre play to is it just he sort of broke down on one of the receivers and just wasnt expecting guy came in to him and ended up hurting himself a little bit but i tell you sante <person player="asante samuel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">samuel</person> watch him on tape that guy breaks on the football like havent seen in a while second and five <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> with some rockets first down and more shakes off the tackle of <person player="aaron francisco" race="white" position="DB">francisco</person> and it picks up some extra yards 16 on the carry well i just wonder how much longer the arizona cardinals are going to be able to stay defensively with this nickel defense that theyre playing typically when youre playing against the philadelphia eagles you really want to make sure youre strong against their passing game because they only the ball about 40% of the time there s a defensive coordinator clancy pendergast but so far that hasnt worked the one has been the difference in this one yeah if you let the eagles get a running game going boy open up the entire playbook jackson in motion <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> skips to a big hole gets a block from <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> and takes it inside the five before 17 more for <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> id say im a little stunned because we watched them against the giants a week ago and what were they doing they had <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> up there they had they were playing big against the run at eight nine men at the line of scrimmage theyve come out against philadelphia and allowed <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> to run crazy i mean theyre basically playing a deep shot back there and theyre just running right through and after the end of the play a personal foul call against arizona so theyll foot the ball just inside the two yard line so the arizona cardinals for the chance to win the division on their own find themselves down 7nothing and second touchdown for got one receiving and one running he has put a stamp on this one <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> it s still a pretty soft look here youve got some pretty soft gaffes inside as again the eagles are going with that spread formation and just simply running the football out of it i know this is atypical but believe me until you start dropping <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> or an trouble down in that box theyre just gonna run it all night acres for the extra point it was roll who committed the personal foul and roll who got rolled over by <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> eagles up by 14 from the field again and for <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> only the second time in his career that he scored two first quarter touchdown field a different look on the face of <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> standing over here with the park on after two touchdowns as opposed the last week in baltimore one of the low points of his career last week harrington with a crease tripped up as he got to the 35 yard lines with <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> who was picked off on the cardinals first possession will try to dig out of this 40 nothing hole for arizona 14nothing eagles the water it was his ninth pick of the year run it with <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> up to about the 38 yard line no talk with <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> yesterday when they got in chris and he said it was an advantage he thought at least playing the giants last week and now philadelphia four days later because <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve</person> spagnolo comes the defensive coordinator from new york comes from the eagles in jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> style of defense how much of an advantage so far 14 to nothing out there but for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> what an interesting trip it s been i mean certainly with <person player="matt leinart" race="white" position="QB">matt leinart</person> being essentially named the starting quarterback coming into this season for him to battle back win the job and now be in the <person player="tony hunt" race="UNK" position="RB">hunt</person> for the mvp this year pretty amazing water on the pump fake looking for <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> he could not reel it in <person player="lito sheppard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lito</person> shepherd on the coverage well one of the things the philadelphia eagles in jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> are always going to try and do against <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> is get some hits on him because they have had success in the past getting turnovers they already have one on the interception that time he was hit just as he threw the football of course <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> has a history of fumbling the ball under pressure has lost six already this season so third and six for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> as sometimes fastball hi intercepted by quinton michael his third pick of the year at the 44yard line two possessions two interceptions by <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> ken whisenhunt the cardinals turning it over quit michael with a pick most sell johansson with one earlier high and off the fingertips easy one for michael youre going to see all the way across the line of scrimmage man underneath coverage current <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> under pressure is going to have to try and throw it high it goes off the hands of <person player="jerheme urban" race="white" position="WR">urban</person> and quinton michael comes up with it last time wanted threw to first quarter interceptions 2001 as a member of the rams against new england meanwhile <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> is five for five make it six for six if <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> makes the catch at the 39 yard line <person player="dominique rodgerscromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique</person> rodgers for marty on the tackle and for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> but this has been some start one of the things that the eagles wanted to do today was get away from rotating so many wide receivers in the game they simply felt like the <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> wasnt getting any timing with these guys so tonight it s going to be predominantly <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">kevin curtis</person> <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> and then theyll roll other people in based on formation but those two guys are the starters now theyre the odd man out is <person player="reggie brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie brown</person> as <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> on a second down is going to get sacked at the 47 yard line chiqui oh keefer and <person player="antonio smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">antonio smith</person> got there to get the hit on <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> well one of the problems you have is when you have a fullback here used to be a defensive tackle number 49 dan cleco trying to bloat block in space he does a better job of getting there in space than parking in space that time a key for goes right around and that was a mismatch chuckles been on the other side of the ledger ooh she s got two socks bad for a fullback third and 13 for mcnab skips it to jackson and in illinois yeah maybe his first inclination on tonight and he gets the boo birds and you know the funny thing is if you see it from where i see it that time jackson was covered on to play <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> said i im gonna throw it loan away if he happens to get there fine but on 3rd and 13 im not throwing an interception after what ive been going through it actually was a pretty good play salve rocco to punt got that reverse spin breast in a fair catch at the arizona 12 yard line well nfl play 60 the league s youth health and fitness campaign is committed to fighting childhood obesity by getting kids active for 60 minutes a day learn more and donate by logging

about 120 <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> on a first down picks up about a yard and a half foot michael and <person player="trent cole" race="nonwhite" position="LB">trent cole</person> on the tackle she gave key fish <person player="travis laboy" race="white" position="DE">travis</person> the boy cardinals trying to get a line defensively <person player="mike patterson" race="UNK" position="DT">mike patterson</person> was involved in the middle of that last running play for philadelphia to take a look at the play so far 19 offensive plays for the eagles saw him in the fall way as they were coming out i cant imagine final one at my house or run around them for that matter was hard to get around him in the hallway second and eight with 30 seconds to go here in the first it s been all philadelphia <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> haitai to drop hansen slowed his progression and then help came in akim <person player="akeem jordan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jordan</person> closed on the ball nicely well what weve seen so far is the philadelphia eagles have completely taken away the running game of the arizona cardinals and it s going to all be on <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> as we go for it but this is a team that s averaging almost 30 points a game they are fully capable of all philadelphia the eagles have been flying water picked off twice good start for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> philadelphia by 14 after 1 that s what the bear something wouldnt eat harrington will not get the first down quinton michael padded right perfectly well sometimes youre in man coverage and it helps you in the passing game sometimes youre in man coverage and it helps you in the running game quit michael right here is going to come up in man coverage and make the play because he s simply chasing the man he s supposed to be covering there they gonna throw it to him i got him going and it to him i got him to michael s done a nice job for the eagles when michael <person player="greg lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">lewis</person> signed the free agent deal with san <person player="aaron francisco" race="white" position="DB">francisco</person> <person player="sean considine" race="white" position="DB">sean considine</person> last year was the starter <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> just got it off to sean jackson explosive jackson trying to find the wide side of the field and then just covers it up at the 40 yard line well it has been a great night thus far for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> just a few days after being benched in baltimore weve seen the full repertoire not only throwing the football pollution percentage running getting out of the pocket on the move looks very accurate and really we thought coming in the absolutely perfect weather that we have here tonight in philadelphia probably favored arizona with the way they throw the football but it is certainly awakened <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> in this philadelphia offense but again i say you dont want to allow <person

position="QB">donovan</person> beat you first in 10 <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> in the one back set <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> gets a block <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> down by <person player="aaron francisco" race="white" position="DB">francisco</person> after a nice gain on the play picked up seven well for people that dont see a lot of <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> this is what he s capable of but clearly the cardinals have come in here thus more tonight anticipating <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> having the greater of the two moles and they dont have enough people up theyve got a great player in <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> who s almost a linebacker like guy who plays around the line of scrimmage can help with that i think you have to take your chances with these eagles receivers theyre not that talented second and three from <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> 24 creeps up at the line <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> fights down yardage might be just a hair short <person player="bertrand berry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bertrand berry</person> on the tackle <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> s tenth carry already 470 yards and it is a first down will you look at some of the great backs in the history league as far as highest yards per play from scrimmage and <person player="greg lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">greg</person> pruitt and <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> and jim brown right there at the top of that list this season however because of some of the entries to <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> his number dont nearly approach that but as we talk to some coaches on the field before the game they were all smiling saying i heard <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> feels good he says he feels good they were excited that little spring in his step and he showed it 71 yards officially <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> to the side nice diving catch at the 30 yard line by <person player="hank baskett" race="white" position="WR">hank baskett</person> you know that s the other thing about mcnab s recent slump he needs some help from people you know in talking to <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> he said i came into this season thinking i were im gonna do what a lot of quarterbacks do im gonna give my guys a chance to make plays im gonna throw it up and jump all situations when it s a tie down the field give my guys a chance and it hasnt always worked out so well is <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> another chance and <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> picks up about three and a half on the fly you know one of the problems that theyve had <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> the tight end has had a case of the drops theyve had a lot of drop passes this year theyve had you know <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> being banged up a little bit the offensive line is getting a little bit older it you know the quarterback some think it s a lot more playing than they deserve well last couple of weeks he s earned the blame on the space that he did but i also think one of the issues theyve had is at the tight end position just blocking <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> <person player="brent celek" race="white" position="TE">brent celek</person> two guys that not too bad catching the football but knowing they have to line up and play a little smash mouth that s not really the strength of their day and remember theyre missing <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn andrews</person> theyre twotime pro bowl right guard this time it s <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lorenzo</person> cooker and he dives ahead for a first down <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">booker</person> s acquired in a trade from miami in the off season again youre just going to see six in the box in here right now and theyre basically playing soft in the secondary <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> way out of there and drove all the other safety out of there <person player="aaron francisco" race="white" position="DB">aaron francisco</person> happen to come up and make the tackle but when youre not making contact on a running back nine yards down the field were in for a long night know how long they can stick with his strategy how about the left guard <person player="todd herremans" race="white" position="OT">todd</person> herman s he had a combo block he got two guys in one class <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> this time gets nothing he stood up with the 20 yard line loses a yard <person player="antonio smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">antonio</person> spent got the first hit on it yeah the answer would be no much not much longer because <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> the safety that time came down on the line of scrimmage and theyre gonna have to have more guys in the box to have a chance here <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> and his eighth year out of north carolina state pro bowler in 2006 arizona needs to keep philadelphia out of the end zone already down 14 nothing second and 11 <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> wide open jackson at the 10 tripped up at the 6 first down philadelphia once you get the feeling this <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> could be really special weve seen him on punt returns weve seen him all season long as a looking one of the leading receivers in the game today the leading receiver for the philadelphia eagles and it was just a matter of time but when they went in made the call hey let s face the facts this guy s our best player let s get the football in his hand and let him make plays coming into the season with him being drafted said wow he s added a whole different dimension to their offense <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> on a 1st and goal <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> gets a hard yard antral wall cut him down for smith only his 20th catch of the season often you see an offensive tackle make a tackle but that time john runyon gave <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> a good shot at the end of that play he tried to make a move on the tail end of it and <person player="jon runyan" race="white" position="OT">jon runyan</person> who hasnt been the best of years for him or the other tackle for that matter great what was out there in space it should say happy birthday to john today is his 35th birthday thanksgiving day second goal <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> looking for his third touchdown he s got one receiving one running takes it down to the two you know watching this drive im just reminded of how good i think the nfc east is you know some of those teams like the philadelphia eagles sitting there at five five and one but you wonder if the eagles played in the nfc west with some of those teams what their record might be i just think that right now it s a this is a huge offensive line are just observing their will on arizona at the moment third and goal for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> and the eagles he s got <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> wide open and a walk in third touchdown for <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> here in the first half and for mcnab his second touchdown pass in philadelphia pushes their lead to 20 for the next twopoint pending that time <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> was coming off the edge but on the other side the philadelphia eagles got a nice little rub on the outside coverage of <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> and that s why he was able to pop absolutely wide open anchors extra point is good so the philadelphia eagles have forced two interceptions <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> has thrown two touchdown passes and the eagles by 21 and just simply think he s going to get a pick right here and then youre gonna see the tight end come out and <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> out here but there is nobody covering either one of them that s just the blown coverage on a good play and for arizona it s been a little embarrassing so far <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> with two receiving touchdowns and a rushing touchdown here in the first half harrington for arizona does not even make the 20yard line <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn</person> <person player="sean considine" race="white" position="DB">considine</person> able to wrap him up <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> has been picked off twice he s got to get the offense going in a hurry because <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> has the hot hand eagles by 21 he goes in this ballgame so far 17 runs 11 passes and <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> has been outstanding using this guy using all the abilities that he has well i gotta tell you as productive as <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> has been what will get you beat even quicker is a blown defense and if you watch this they had a bunch formation three receivers in one area one guy got picked from the cardinals but just a bit and he continued to rush leaving a <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> wide open in the flat and that that just cant uh if they do that they should be in the mace wrap up their first division title since 75 and you can just feel the raw emotion from this football team so far cancer i feel it from the eagles yeah first down pass the breast and <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dawkins</person> grabs him by the leg and throws him down you know it s interesting to with the arizona cardinals at seven and four on the season they lead the west theyre gonna win the west but the question is are they ready for primetime chris they lost to the redskins they lost the jets a good team they lost to the giants lost carolina all good football teams now they did be buffalo earlier in the year when the bills were playing well but this is kind of a statement game for them in a lot of ways oh theyre making a statement it s not a good one but there may the statement second and eight for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> has a first down of the 31 yard line <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> it s 73 catches now on the season is first of the night quint michael on the tackle with hansen well that s what you have to do with this football team and i think you have to get away from the running game they came out here and they tried to keep running on first down there put themselves in second along come out do what you do throw the football get the ball in the hands of these playmakers and let them go this football team if you just complete some short balls to these wide receivers they are very difficult to get on the ground <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> to the bottom of your screen on the first and tenth <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> under pressure got panel by <person player="trent cole" race="nonwhite" position="LB">trent cole</person> well <person player="trent cole" race="nonwhite" position="LB">trent cole</person> with the spin move that time working inside of <person player="mike gandy" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike gandy</person> and <person player="trent cole" race="nonwhite" position="LB">trent cole</person> when you look at his 40yard dash time it s not very impressed if you watch him play football and this guy is something special he really is he has a knack of getting to the quarterback and i tell you if the arizona cardinals dont do any better job protecting <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> after what he faced last week against the giants and now taking the kind of hits he s taking here tonight he may not survive the evening call a pro bowler last year with 12 and a half sacks has seven this season bouldin in motion and quan bouldin on the run bouldin fumbles the football it s loose on the ground and arizona recovered it so nearly a third turnover it was the left tackle <person player="mike gandy" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike gandy</person> who recovered the football well id say i dont think the arizona cardinals survived that one if they have another turnover their quarterbacks already thrown to to the other team and then your star wide receiver comes up in ladies another one on the ground this is a physical beating that weve seen so far that the philadelphia was a phenomena she was <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve breaston</person> who recovered it as bolden took the shot jeremie <person player="jerheme urban" race="white" position="WR">urban</person> comes in on a third and to arizona needs a timeout with the play clock down to one 6:05 to go on the second a very important drive for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> and the cardinals is bouldin nearly turned it over the possession saved by preston i tower in the backfield with <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> i towers wide open with room to run finally dragged down by michael at the 35 yard line and that s a gain of 26 and a muchneeded first down for arizona well weve seen the arizona cardinals blow a coverage at that time the philadelphia eagles did their inside linebacker and man coverage simply did not get out on that one looked like that was stuart <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> who sort of got stuck looking in the backfield and allowed that big first down first intent <person player="stephen spach" race="white" position="TE">stephen</person> spock the tight end emotion <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> with time wanted with an open man downfield and completes it to <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> cope the tight end he had a step on the defense and the second year man out of georgia with his eighth catch of the season well i hate to do it on thanksgiving but i think it s stuart <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> again number 55 the middle linebacker who got caught up on the play fake you know these eagles linebackers are trained from day one to attack downhill they want to get in the backfield fill their a gap and attack and sometimes playaction can get these guys that s two times in a row now <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> s been caught peaking in the backfield the brian docket said these guys are young and athletically still sometimes could be a little that s knowing exactly where their fits on but weve got a challenge flag and he reads going to challenge it looked like from the replay we saw that <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard pope</person> was able to cradle that football and the <person player="jr reed" race="UNK" position="DB">reed</person> wants to challenge the catch you know the question is if you go up if you go out and catch the football you have to and youre going to the ground making the catch you have to maintain possession all the way to the ground will <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard pope</person> s 25yard catch stand theyll go to replay to determine in the game so this is this is great if it s right into the defensive scheme that they use a philadelphia tackle tackle tackle the 25 yard catch if youre going to the ground on your own making a catch you have to maintain possession all the way through going to the ground as the receiver is going to the ground the ball does move however he does not lose possession the ball does hit the ground but the receiver maintains control therefore we have attached philadelphia s charm to a timeout now were on out referee and that s you know that s the burt emmanuel rule from the tampa bay bucs in the nfc championship game against the st louis cardinals so the ball can actually make contact with the ground but he maintains control even though it moves chris the ball once he had it pinned to his shoulder even though the back end of that ball was on the ground didnt move sufficiently for the official to make the call or make the change and remember the ruling on the field was catch so you need something conclusive to overturn the ruling so arizona would first down at the 10 <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> met by <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dawkins</person> and then hit by h<person player="akeem jordan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">akeem jordan</person> picks up a couple on the play too about the eight yard line where <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> can sure close danny i mean <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> was standing ten yards deep back on the goal line when that play started to break to the outside and he came up and maketh made the play <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dawkins</person> a guy that at one point in his career was probably so much the best safety and the game of football wasnt even fair i think he s a very legitimate hall of fame candidate so the emotional leader of that defense as well as thirteenth year out of clemson second and goal for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> as time delivers it to the two yard line to bolden we get stopped short right there michael was there to jump on his back there is a flag on the play as well first year s referee for al river on he lead a contact number 27 defense team addition to the automatic first down first down well quinton michael did all that he thought he could do <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> went to the goal line and then simply got rebound position on him you see number 81 there s the illegal contact going to turn around and just shield off quentin michael and make the catch and that s what he is capable of doing probably the most physical wide receiver in the national football league and when you get him inside it s tough now if the ball is not in the air chris when the contact is made you are allowed five yards to hit the receiver that s a chuck youre allowed to chuckle receiver we suddenly our yard line first down the ball was out in the air and it was over the five yards because it happened at the one the ball was at the seven but they reset the half the distance they put it inside before there s jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> the defensive coordinator and this is typically blitz time for him let s see if he comes after <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> play clock at 8:00 <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> by bouldin he doesnt drop many of those wow i dont know that ive seen that much at all from <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> you see the blitz is going to come in from the right side so colonel <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> goes back left and that s just an easy pitch and catch right there you just nevin <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> was closing in and <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> we talked about out tuffy is but we may have taken a peek at <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> on second and goal fights to the one wave <person player="juqua parker" race="UNK" position="DE">parker</person> on the tackle i want to welcome those of you who are joining us on nflcom welcome to head of film network thursday night football you can log on now dan fl comm slash live for enhanced coverage of tonight s game strategically here i think this is without question four down territory feet up in the nothing you take two shots maybe it s another situation you might not run here for the cardinals maybe they do take a shot at running this but if theyre going to do it twice third and goal <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> in the one back set on a blitz <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> aint complete but a flag as bolden was held so theyll put it back at the one itll be first engulf the cell johansson the guilty party holding it in the 21 well say leo hansen once again working oneonone against <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> not a lot there with a pretty good strip chris and then the strip from behind but i didnt see anything at all as far as pulling a jersey or hooking an arm or and that would have been fourth and one wow at some ball so now its first and goal smith the fullback in motion <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> just dumps it away to quake <person player="juqua parker" race="UNK" position="DE">parker</person> got the pressure is to take one more look at the penalty on <person player="joselio hanson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hanson</person> on the third and goal pass to bouldin <person player="joselio hanson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hanson</person> s lined up inside going to try and take away this slant and the only thing i cant see it may have been with that left hand if he grabbed the jersey and folded it all right there at the official standing in behind saw any material at all being pulled from the shoulder pad dont call that i didnt see it obviously the official saw something else the flag didnt come out though before the drop so maybe he saw that tug second and goal <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> again this time <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> has the touchdown so <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> with a seventh touchdown catch of the season 11 plays 81 yards on the drive and a stabilizing touchdown for the cardinals do you ever think you get to the point where you youre watching a football game and saw so many balls on the fourth and inches or 1st and inches and everybody s throwing the ball now but when you have a receiver like <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> and oneonone coverage say hey youre gonna go out there and play man coverage on those guys were just gonna take advantage rach there s extra point is good <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> fights off the lead oh shepherd jam easy touchdown the cardinals receiver to match a flooding of the area and that many guys do that but this is a testament to to the fact that theyre willing to change and make those adjustments but three times this year they have allowed 35 points or more but you have to go back to 1997 since that s happened to him so with this partners offense it is still game on rockers with the kickoff <person player="quintin demps" race="nonwhite" position="DB">demps</person> with a head of steam next trying to turn the corner and it tripped up at the 33 yard line nice returned by wynton dems well earlier today in detroit dante culpepper oops dave ball with the pick6 titans roll 47 to 10 then he tried to fly at the end i like that meanwhile in dallas third quarter <person player="tony hunt" race="UNK" position="RB">tony</person> romo hooking up with tio dallas made at 31 9 they win it 34 to 9 on this thanksgiving do you get the feeling if anybody is going to truly have a shot at the giants this year it may well be those dallas cowboys would be coming up at the half it s the sprint halftime show analysis of <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> costly win for the cowboys and a different side of <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> he s had a very good first epi as all three touchdowns to the eagles on the carry or an l docket on the tackle you just get the feeling this is a really significant part of the ballgame here the cardinals down 21 7 if they can hold the eagles here finally make a defensive stand even if they get the ball back and dont score at least the momentum will have shifted a little bit conversely if the eagles can take it down and even put a field goal up it really shifts it in their favor and arizona will get the ball to start the third play action <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> got a sideline to sean jackson as a first down there s deshawn jackson really is something special a smaller guy very quick receiver that time working against cromartie on the outside one of the fastest guys playing in the national football league and despite his speed he was giving a lot of room to jackson that s the sign of a great receiver when theyre backing up is if you back a little afraid <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> got benched last week great first half eagles in front 21 7 at the twominute warning it was incomplete you know i really think the story of this first half has been the ability of the eagles to run the football there s been so much conversation in philadelphia under andy reid the run pass ratio andy reid s team s run the ball only 41% of the time since he s been here and that is the least amount of any coach in nfl history and yet today because they were able to establish <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> in this one takes some pressure off <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> this eagles offense looks really dynamic saw <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> s numbers he has all three touchdowns for philadelphia who received rushon <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> under some pressure buy some time <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> avoids the hip gets out of bounds and picks up positive yardage to the arizona 48 the xfactor there it is i mean when <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> is playing his complete game and i understand he wants to be known as a pastor and all those things but when you can do this as a quarterback and watch him break through these tackles there are not many quarterbacks in the national football league they can make that play now instead of a sack or instead of a third down in 10 you end up with third and 2 and a chance to convert he should do that more philadelphia to 43 on their third downs theyve all been manageable theyve all been short <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> tonight 11 of 13 big difference from four days ago over the middle and his got <person player="hank baskett" race="white" position="WR">hank baskett</person> for first down it just people to the inside all of these eagles receivers have gotten a bit of a reputation this season for drops well <person player="hank baskett" race="white" position="WR">hank baskett</person> has made two really nice catches so far he goes use a timeout trying to add to a 217 lead when and philadelphia someone with some other quarterbacks that run the ball a lot literally with all day checks down to the 39 yard line and <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> fights a couple of before he gets tripped up well this hasnt been a great year protection wise for the philadelphia eagles they have certainly chipped and helped with their backs and tight ends more than i can ever remember them seeing shipping and helping with the trade <person player="tra thomas" race="nonwhite" position="OT">thomas</person> and john runyon on the outside but that protection was perfect second and five <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> with some room <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> he s got a first down and <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> will get out of bounds at the 24yard line warren sapp almost made the tackle over there and this is the difference this is <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> from five six years ago i mean i can i can still hear the defensive coordinators that i talked to said that is what we cant stop we dont have anybody on our football team even if we spy that can bring him down in a oneonone situation now defensively what do you do now youre trying to cover up the receivers they have youre trying to cover <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> and all of a sudden big number five comes running at you marni mourning wig and youve told us before the game we were pretty good offensively until this last little slump <person player="travis laboy" race="white" position="DE">travis</person> gets out of a tackle and then stood up at the 16 yard line and a minute to go here in the half philadelphia does have the one timeout remaining do you get the feeling that maybe the best thing that ever happened to the bull was benching <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> i think they got his attention he is playing <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> style football in a way that i havent seen in a while at five five and one they probably need to run the table in the nfc to get into the postseason <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> cant reel it in reading with the coverage the double move on the outside by <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> you know i dont think so i wouldnt have called interference on that one either and im widereceiver the hands on him right at the right time sort of a bangbang play close call but i cant disagree with that one she s pretty good defense by ground third and two for the eagles <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> basket makes the catch did he get the sticks close eugene <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> well that one looked like a sure first down but <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> came in closed fast and it s and that s not yards short that s not the mark now there youre going to get help from the official coming across the field who s going to say that s not close or momentum is up here and this officiating crew is now going to work together that ball i think is clearly at least on that yellow line the line judge on this side came all the way across the field and the marquee at originally was probably another half guard ahead of that look theyve changed the bark down yeah they did they moved it up that gave him the first down good job that time of officiating the lines judge on this side of the field came all the way across and made the right call you can see that basket clearly had the 14 yard line when he was contacted because were inside of two minutes that could have gone to review from a booth upstairs view a spy but the officials on the field cleaned it up nicely so first and ten for philadelphia <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> again with some room the ron mcnab has a flag in the plays it gets out of bounds at the five the flag came from the umpire where you normally get offensive holding and there s an injured eagle on the field as <person player="max jeangilles" race="UNK" position="OG">max</person> jean gilles the right guard who s in for the injured chosen number 67 sin death penalty the hold is on center jamal jackson brilliant it was a collision between jackson and xin gillis that created that it was not good for the philadelphia eagles this is a team that s already been dinged at the guard position and see jean gillis getting rolled up on the back of his leg and now you go down to your third guy at the right guard position i think it was cheeky okeefe er who fell on the back of his leg and maxine gillis has had to play all season because of <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn andrews</person> injury will bring <person player="nick cole" race="UNK" position="C">nick cole</person> in at the right guard spot eagles bite a 217 lead with 12 seconds to go in the half first down or i can run and get it myself either way and so usually they take upon themselves make that happen when theyre younger to this offensive line and sean andrew is one of the most physical players in the game today and he s had to replace him take a look at the playoff picture in the nfc the division leaders are to your left to see philadelphia five five and one most likely youre going to need at least ten wins to earn a wildcard spot in the nfc and that would mean philadelphia has to win tonight and their final four games and then suddenly that tie might come in handy it looked pretty bad you know two weeks ago but if they were to run the table i mean that tie comes in handy because if win percentage ten five and one is better than ten and six you dont know that youre ever going to convince them that that tie to cincinnati was a good thing the third year man fourth round pick in 2006 out of georgia <person player="max jeangilles" race="UNK" position="OG">max</person> jean gillis would only started one game prior to this year in for the injured <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn andrews</person> suffers an injury to his right leg as cheeky okeefe er inadvertently fell on the back of his right leg well you just hate to see that yeah and really the offensive line has been completely dominant in this one so far for philadelphia is this crowd gives him a nice hand going off philadelphia had to use their last timeout because 12 seconds to go as a holding penalty but because of the injury the clock did stopped for 21 seconds with 12 seconds to go in the half the eagles up 217 philadelphia was charged with that timeout chris because they committed that penalty you know mcnab got out of bounty was a holding penalty with 12 seconds to go in the half <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> on a first and 20 <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> will leave it to the end zone intended for <person player="jason avant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">avant</person> incomplete recharge with the injury timeout because you know weve seen before they change that rule a lot of times teams that were behind guys would suddenly up i got an injury stop the clock well i used to play in a few of those games with the buffalo bills and there are a lot of guys that seem to sprained her ankle right about the time that we were trying to get our nohuddle going theyve cut out the acting now acres to try a 42yard field goal 22 of 26 snap is good and acres knocks it through so with one second to go in the half now a 24 to 70 it s been a great first half for the philadelphia eagles and <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> a couple of touchdown passes well in the big thing i think is the fact the time of possession is so onesided you know the eagles have just maintained control the ball <person player="nick cole" race="UNK" position="C">nick</person> off every sunday with nfl gameday morning the first and best pregame show 10:00 eastern spiro dita s and all pros warren sapp and marshall faulk get you started at 10 am eastern on nfl network and you dont want to miss warren sapp interview with chris jenkins well the new york jets those two have had a running feud for a long time and that should be an interesting little conversation kind of dates back to their playing days right when they had a few things to say about each other out there well what about this first half for philadelphia just what the doctor ordered especially for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> you know and maybe it was a good thing you know kevin cobb came in last week it probably made <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> a little bit mad i think it definitely did i talked to him up a little bit about it he wasnt happy at all he wasnt happy with the fact that andy <person player="jr reed" race="UNK" position="DB">reed</person> didnt tell him personally and what has he done in response he s gone out and played one of the best half of football weve seen him play all year and what did andy <person player="jr reed" race="UNK" position="DB">reed</person> say last week sometimes you have to take a little step back to move forward that was part of his explanation they have certainly leapt forward tonight no question about that one small step a kers just knocks it down feel they pitch it to <person player="jerheme urban" race="white" position="WR">urban</person> and that s the end of the first half so <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> and the eagles that have very impressive opening first half 247 the score as they force a couple of turnovers and get some touchdown passes from <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> the eagles leading the cardinals 24 to 7 at the half stay tuned for the sprint halftime show it s coming your way after this break nfc west where oh and 14 against teams in nfc and afc let s get back to our ball game and join the commentators bob papa and cris collinsworth and they really buy their own alignments and soft play sort of allowed <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> to get comfortable <person player="jj arrington" race="UNK" position="RB">jj arrington</person> to start this third quarter harrington fights his way up to about the 30yard line and that s where <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> and the cardinals will start first intent well it wasnt a good first quarter for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> who got intercepted a couple of times only 90 yards passing in the first half well and you talked to <person player="todd herremans" race="white" position="OT">todd</person> haley the offensive coordinator and he said the big thing that i had to convince <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> of a was ball security to quit fumbling it but b quit making bad throws in the middle of the field the way the <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> started this game was exactly what he was talking about you cannot give it away to the philadelphia eagles bouldin goes in motion <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> to throw <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> harassed <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> in the middle of the field to <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> and <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> able to pick up five yards as <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> made the tackle and you know i know what he wanted to do he wanted to come out and try and establish the run but against this philadelphia eagles defense maybe and years gone by you might have been able to do that but they have so vastly improved their run defense and arizona is so bad at run football is sort of wasted downs <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> on and put them in some tough situations second and five <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> gets you yard and that s it sheep way <person player="juqua parker" race="UNK" position="DE">parker</person> on the tackle just to clean up the end of the first half <person player="max jeangilles" race="UNK" position="OG">max</person> jean gillis went out of the ballgame for philadelphia the right guard suffered a fractured right ankle yeah hate to hear it he was having a terrific season and there s ken head coach and thus far what weve seen is the cardinals cant run the ball at all their running backs thus far in this game were averaging one yard per carry edwin <person player="edgerrin james" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james</person> got one carry last week against the giants now averaging 33 yards per rush the season the lowest in the nfl it s been <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tim hightower</person> shell the last couple of weeks he s to the right of <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> on this third and four <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> just gets it off and it s incomplete pressure coming off the edge from <person player="chris clemons" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chris clemons</person> and there hasnt been a lot of pressure in <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> s face but there s always been one free rusher we havent seen the typical jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> three or four guys meeting at the quarterback a lot of blitzing a lot of high pressure stuff right now his defensive line without blitzing is getting there and getting in the face of <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> so a three and out to start the third <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">dirk johnson</person> he s had his struggles with the toppling punt <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> just gets tripped up and a flag comes in as well <person player="michael adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael adams</person> made the tackle well check the flag i wonder if <person player="michael adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adams</person> was illegally blocked in the back while making the tackle see the field judge with call that s what it is illegal block in the back receiving team number 27 and you clinically push down when michael called for the penalty when <person player="todd herremans" race="white" position="OT">todd</person> haley and <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> trying to figure out the eagles defense feeling some heat eagles in front 24/7 hurt wandering the highflying cardinals have struggled <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> with a crease right takes it up to the 21 yard line and tro roll on the tackle <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> 15 carries 80 yards yeah so many times during the course of this season the philadelphia eagles have been stopped in short yardage and goal line situations and you just have to wonder what would their record have been if they just had the ability to convert a couple of third and ones and fourth and ones and all these games that were either losses or ties and it was just so strange to watch this two game after game get embarrassed in short yardage situation dad cant find <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> brown on the coverage and they had one third and one tonight they brought in <person player="kyle eckel" race="UNK" position="RB">kyle</person> eckle who was signed on october the 21st and the south philadelphia native picked up the tough guy you know maybe they finally found somebody and you know i think there s a little bit of a mindset when youre in a west coast offense that you know youre constantly past protecting and dropping back and trying to help your quarterback but this is the biggest offensive line the nfl i mean occasionally you got to get a big back in there and let him go and echo at least came through in that situation think about their playoff win against the giants a couple of years ago on the gamewinning drive it was all <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> running the ball right blitz on <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> makes <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> missed great move by <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> it s incomplete intended for <person player="jason avant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jason</person> of honor but but where was this in the first half you know all the arizona cardinals did in the first half was sit back and allow easy throws to a quarterback who is clearly struggling yes <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> misses but he forces <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> off the spot and then he throws inaccurately that is what you have to do to <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> i dont know what they were doing in the first half they just made it so easy allowed to run and easy completions by mcnally see the fact is if they were playing against their own receivers <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">breaston</person> from his own 35 and it picks up a couple of king <person player="akeem jordan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jordan</person> on the tackle a <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> will try to jumpstart his highpowered offense which has been dormant tonight from the link and philadelphia for 60 minutes a day on this day of giving donate now at nflcom backslash play 60 to help kids get active and healthy in your community <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> and the cardinals trying to get things going and that passes dropped by <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> that s his second drop tonight one was a touchdown wow i dont know if there s something wrong with the <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan</person> or not we saw him limping around a little bit earlier but i mean that s now right in his hands and arguably another one that he should have had that got ripped out of his hands but now were seeing the cardinals be the cardinals spread it out and let s go to work third quarter has been a big corner for the cardinals this year huaner on a second and 10 completes it up to the 45 yard line the <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve breaston</person> <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> on the tackle yard short of the first down that s one of the few blitzes ive seen so far out of the eagles in this ball game im going to bring pressure right up the middle here but watch how the arizona cardinals pick it up beautifully done that time <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> steps up big completion they theyre starting to get in a little more than that third and one arizona goes spread <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> with time <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> drop by well this is a team that is known for catching the football and three huge drops im gonna bet they have dropped more passes tonight and then they have dropped in any two games this this is and this is probably the most perfect night to play football to play pitch and catch weve seen all year nice cool night absolutely know when to speak up and the cardinals are simply blowing that would have been a first down <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> im trying to keep it away from jackson and that is not a good one as it sails into the philadelphia bench official spots it at the 32yard line 23 yard fun nothing going right for the cardinals tonight because reputations of numbers as well content for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> pass batted by cheek aoki for an incomplete and a lot of talk about <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> coming into this game for more on that check in with adam schefter happy thanksgiving bob if the <person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> bay packers could trade brett favre last season then surely the <person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> bay the philadelphia eagles to trade <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> this offseason if you take a look at <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> contract and read the fine print you see an easy out <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> is scheduled to count ten point three million dollars against the salary cap next season one point one is an accelerated signing bonus so if the eagles were to trade <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> they actually would three nine point two million dollars with the salary cap space mob very interesting and you know with the backdrop of last week chris and getting mention is it kevin cobbs time he s probably quieted that tonight but there s a lot of football left to dominic man who just turned 32 on tuesday well to give you some frame of reference peyton manning s 32 jake colognes 33 matt hasselbeck 33 tom brady 31 i mean these are guys in the prime of their careers and you can talk all you want about trading the guy my goodness gracious why would you want to trade somebody like this over a couple of bad games third down <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> <person player="hank baskett" race="white" position="WR">hank baskett</person> has the first out of the 48 yard line editor his pressure anytime that you draft somebody as high as as they did with kevin cobb and you know randall cunningham was drafted high and then it was <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> and then it was kevin cobb and last week he came in and yes there were some disastrous plays and he had one beautiful drive that he took him down the field very west coast looking style of play delivering the ball quickly accurate guy so yeah i think he s gonna be a good player but i dont want to hear about <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> getting out of here for somebody you dont know anything about <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> picks up about four well motor jeffrey lurie and team president <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe</person> banner in this run with andy reid have done a wonderful job of making dollars and cents right now theyve always managed their salary cap so a lot of things come into consideration when you look at the overall picture whether it s some of the other guys as to how you move forward well how much you think the minnesota vikings might be willing to give up with the get <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> to go along with <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian</person> peterson and the running game and the defense that they have up there so dont you have to be careful what you wish for dab on a first and ten that s <person player="brent celek" race="white" position="TE">brent celek</person> tight end tackle by <person player="gerald hayes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gerald hayes</person> near the first down marker and it is enough for a philadelphia first down well the arizona cardinals keep trying to send a little pressure now and the philadelphia eagles offensive line just continues to dominate i think the unwritten the story so far and this one has been the play of this offensive line and defensive line from philadelphia they have simply man in a very nfc east way the arizona cardinals 50 offensive plays for philadelphia the 28 for arizona <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> was in motion some fracture underneath <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> makes a juggling catch at the 37 yard line today one of the guys they brought in on that offensive line to replace <person player="max jeangilles" race="UNK" position="OG">max</person> jean gillis this guy <person player="nick cole" race="UNK" position="C">nick cole</person> he looks like a fire hydrant out there blocking but nobody has gotten through so far with them and once again were seeing an eagles receiver after having the most drops in the nfl this season make a big play catching the ball it s amazing how your quarterback looks better when these guys start making plays they have a tiny 18 of 25 now the 131 yards and a couple of touchdowns second and six fastba deshawn jackson for the 20 yard line another first down for the gain of 18 on the fly i want you to watch the protection on this play there is just you want to be simply nobody even get within the vicinity a <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> i mean if youre going to give any quarterback not only that kind of time but that kind of space what quarterbacks will tell you is the most valuable thing an offensive line can do is allow me to step into my throat that time he could have jumped into the throat <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lorenzo booker</person> in a tailback and that timer falsestart against the philadelphia eagles false start number 72 offense fiveyard penalty fourth down you know it s straight <person player="tra thomas" race="nonwhite" position="OT">thomas</person> yeah and it s not just <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> the eagles are gonna have to make a decision on this year theyve got a lot of star players that have been around here for a long time that are up <person player="jon runyan" race="white" position="OT">jon runyan</person> the right tackle trade <person player="tra thomas" race="nonwhite" position="OT">thomas</person> the left tackle got <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> in the secondary their longtime star at safety so it is move time for the eagles when this season is over so on first is 15 <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> it s some pressure to just flips that one way they may hit by brian rod has to be intentional grounding their names pointing to where a receiver was but the ball wasnt even close the line of scrimmage is the 25yard line now the flag comes out intentionally editing on the floor back send your penalty the down counts second down or <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lorenzo booker</person> the running back was on that side of the ball number 25 but youll see <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> never really even tries to do anything but dump it and it doesnt even make it back to the line of scrimmage there i think that s a pretty good call by the official familiar just trying to avoid the sack the line of scrimmage was the 25yard line the ball bounced at the 30yard line but wasnt close to the line of scrimmage and nowhere near hooker so they lose the downtown second and 25 for philadelphia halfway through the third have bought the motion manners <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> turned in the corner cant stay inbounds to turn it upfield carlos <person player="karlos dansby" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dansby</person> knocked him out of bounds we take a look at this for of the philadelphia eagles in you know this veteran group that s been together for such a while trade <person player="tra thomas" race="nonwhite" position="OT">thomas</person> in his 11th year out of florida <person player="jon runyan" race="white" position="OT">jon runyan</person> in his 13th year out of michigan <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> in his tenth year out of syracuse bryant <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dawkins</person> in his 13th year at the clemson you know and the other guy you have to include in their that sounds strange at age 29 but as a running back depth include <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> as well that s a guy that you know as you start approaching 30 years of age you start doing a little thinking in a little shop and if youre an organization and clearly <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> has had a tough time staying healthy but boy you can still see what he can when he is and it was funny i was asking him i said dont you think maybe it s time that they draft the big back that can take some of the carries away from you he s like are you kidding me he says i only get to run about 15 times a game i dont want to split those tonight he s been a little busier well 18 carries for 93 yards and here s what <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> can do you can see him down at the bottom of the screams blanked out <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> at the 15 jackson down the sideline and he s got a first down up down at the nine that s the new dimension that he brings the philadelphia offense yeah i always love punt returners as wide receivers because when you get the ball in their hands and you get them in some space they look like palmer turner s in the open field theyre simply the vertical route going up and jackson saw the open space in there and he nearly broke that one he is just one of those dynamic players i can remember watching him coming out in the draft and you kind of went wow when you saw him do some of the things that he did in college five catches for 71 yards for jackson he got 24 there and he s just tied a franchise record with four touchdowns in one game wiping out this arizona cardinal defensive line <person player="todd herremans" race="white" position="OT">todd</person> harriman just blowing away arizona on that run what a hole <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> 102 yards rushing two rushing touchdowns to receiving <person player="david akers" race="white" position="K">david akers</person> with the extra point and what a night for <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> he said 20 of 28 and <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> has tied a franchise record with four touchdowns and engaged the last and a half left commended by amway on a clear crisp evening and philadelphia lincoln financial field on a thanksgiving night castillo the offensive line coach got to be pretty pleased with the way his team has dominated at the point of attack men against boys so far <person player="jj arrington" race="UNK" position="RB">jj arrington</person> from his own three 19 we wrapped up with the 24yard live by <person player="tracy white" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tracy white</person> chris another look at the touchdown for <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> yeah watch <person player="todd herremans" race="white" position="OT">todd</person> harriman right here is he s going to simply take it 330 pound gave <person player="gabriel watson" race="UNK" position="DT">watson</person> and blow him out wipe look at this hole hopefully cap from <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> had to be cutting back and going are you kidding me i mean you just certainly dont see holes like that in the nfc east and you see the diets enough to know that was kind of holes dont pop open what a block by harriman the last philadelphia eagles scored four touchdowns in a game irving prior back in 1996 thirty one to seven and he s hit by basilio hansen well the key for the arizona cardinals is theyre just simply going to have to try and get the ball in the hands of these receivers and let them go <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> is one of the best players in the nfl at the one after the catch he ranked second in yards right now but what the philadelphia eagles have done all night is get in the face of these receivers all those brick throatslitting the giants league last week bolden had 11 catches but for only 88 yards <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> dangerous nearly picked off by <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> you know weve seen curt one or do a lot of great things this season tonight has just simply been a struggle and maybe the philadelphia eagles have hit on something i this is a team that likes to blitz a lot and yet tonight they have basically been rushing for remember <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> has the nfl s highest rating when he s being blitz 120 two point six so i think jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> has said were not going to give him any advance quick throws and make him look down the combined bolden and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> four catches for 18 yards there s <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> but short of the sticks <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> on the tackle his classic jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> again you get a third down in ten situation jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> is going to blitz force you to throw hot have his corner come up and make the tackle send your punter on the field please hey youve seen that if you watch the philadelphia it is probably 95% of the time you get third and 10 that s what you get <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">dirk johnson</person> s last punt was 23 yards got some pressure from <person player="kyle eckel" race="UNK" position="RB">kyle</person> echo sean jackson yelled scatter and jackson latches the ball and it looks like arizona has it i think jackson was convinced that somebody on his team touched it and he felt like he had to recover it im not sure that they did though i think he thought the ball hit the back of <person player="greg lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">greg lewis</person> and that s why he went after the great i think that s exactly what happened he yelled scattered took a kind of crazy bounce maybe it was <person player="jason avant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jason</person> tavon s foot that he thought it hit well but he wouldnt have been diving at that point i think it probably happened earlier as it was bouncing around some of these other players but for arizona boy you needed a desperate sort of break to go your way and there you go now at least you have an opportunity and remember this eagles defense gave up a ton of points in the fourth floor against baltimore so who knows well that was the best play of the night to call out and again from the 35 water bouldin flowey is with the 15yard line gain of 20 on the play for antoine <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boldin</person> s longest reception of the night only his third catch yeah and now here you go arizona coming up in the nohuddle and that s exactly what theyre going to try and do youre into trying to for the breasted couldnt handle the high throw brown and the coverage well dont forget now the philadelphia eagles have made a few changes back there in the secondary <person player="asante samuel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">asante samuel</person> being out so weve been talking about wholesale johansson in there quinn dimps the kick returner has been playing the slot corner and that to bouldin was against so he may not be quite as comfortable in this situation when arizona starts into the snow huddle see if the cardinals can take advantage of the special teams snafu warrant watertube rest in at the six yard line he s a yards short of the first down four minutes to go on the third bob one of the differences ive seen in arizona s offense tonight is theyre not using as many of those tight bunch formations theyre spreading it out the belief is if they can give her <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> a little more time to see the blitz coming he can take advantage of it and that s the reason you see split much wider than what they were we could go arizona over one on 1/3 and 1/2 of 7 overall <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> in the backfield with <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> gets it out quickly wandered the goal line to <person player="steve breaston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">breaston</person> and it s a touchdown lido s shepard on the coverage breasted caught it at the goal line ken whisenhunt saying let s go for to toledo shepard it s been a tough couple of weeks he gave up a long when the bus at the game opened last week against the baltimore ravens and this time just giving up a ton of cushion right on the goal line exactly why you would do that is looking in the back field and simply couldnt get there the official is positioned right on the goal line so arizona will go for to hear a good a 16point dave and their one session one four four on the season <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> has it batted away by quentin michael he s had a heck of a game tonight there is a flag on the play illegal use of the hands hands to the face number 24 defense with the penalties they had another retrial working against <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> on the outside weve been talking about how theyve been getting physical you cannot do that good call by the official in a head linesman was right there so arizona gets another crack the twopoint conversion with 321 to go bring tight ends and be interesting to see if they think they can run against philadelphia something they have not been able to do all night long weve got smith and <person player="tim hightower" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hightower</person> in the back <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> flips it luck that it s knocked away from <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> by <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> we atones for the penalty the twopoint conversion fouls <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> right on <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> got his hand in there at the last second harkness were both injured for the cowboys in that game and there s been discussion in the past whether the detroit lions should always have the thanksgiving game or spread it around a discussion they grow a little louder after that performance <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> wide open <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> shakes <person player="ralph brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ralph brown</person> and picks up ten more with 48 yard line a gain of 25 chemin courtesy has been through so much this year started the season with a sports hernia surgery and is just now coming back to form but he is an explosive player on the outside and he s finally starting to get his quicks back and who is taking the lead position now along with the <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn</person> jackson of this receiving court you havent seen nearly the rotation of receivers in this game that weve seen in the past few <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> with four catches for 50 yards <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj</person> <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> inside the 30 and dragged down by <person player="aaron francisco" race="white" position="DB">aaron francisco</person> at the 27 yard line and trail roll missed a tackle for arizona nice hot read that time by <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> he saw the blitz coming over here with too many for them to block so <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> is simply just going to turn it out here against man coverage break a tackle and come up with a big play nice read by <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> nicely by <person player="lj smith" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lj smith</person> the cardinals really with no choice but to try and bring pressure and <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> just made him pay for it <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> grabbed by <person player="karlos dansby" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dansby</person> after a gain of about a yard and a half maybe two because it looked like the eagles found the fountain of youth or something tonight i mean <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> s looking better than ive seen him in a while <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> obviously looking better than ive seen him in a while the offensive line the defensive line this looks like what i think a lot of people thought of the eagles and yet here we go again <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> coming out and you could see him limping on that leg 20 carries for 105 yards remember how excited offensive coordinator marty mourning wig was when we saw him on the field sounds like <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> feels really good but that s what it s been and he talked to brian he says i cant get out of a game healthy high throw by <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> intended for <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> you know and it s so frustrating because so much of this offense is built about around <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> and morning wiggle talked about it he you know he says we cant practice all the things that we do they love taking <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> flanking him out and working the screen game using him in all these sort of tricky type of formations but he really hasnt practiced for a month so what do you do last year <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> had 368 touches 278 carries for 1,300 yards and 90 cats chronic knee a high ankle sprain and he cannot stay healthy <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> on third down he s got a lot of room and he gets tripped up from behind <person player="darnell dockett" race="UNK" position="DT">darnell dockett</person> pro bowler from last year you know one of the great things about donald <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> is he has the ability to joy enjoy himself even when it s maybe everybody else in this crowd doesnt always think it s funny but this was a race between two big guys here docket and mcnab and there he was went down at the last second and four to laugh before down from philadelphia flag had come down but because mcnab was scrambling and out of the pocket running you can then put your hands on a receiver downfield so they picked the flag up 41 yard attempt for <person player="david akers" race="white" position="K">akers</person> snap is good <person player="david akers" race="white" position="K">akers</person> has it lined up and he knocks it through so in 23 seconds to go on the third nope you now in front 34 13 <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> 22 of 31 223 yards tonight well live thursday night football continues on nfl network with an afc west showdown the raiders redhot came off big win last week in denver they take on the chargers dont miss thursday night football live next thursday 8:00 eastern on nfl network cristiano you take a look at the oakland raiders and when you look at the landscape of the afc west which is a big struggle denver losing last week to oakland denver has to take on the new york jets in new york this weekend san diego has to host a good running team in atlanta and the oakland raiders are at home against kansas see they can insert themselves in the afc west race keep a straight face on this one but they are phil simms was roughing me up earlier because i was saying that the raiders were back in the <person player="tony hunt" race="UNK" position="RB">hunt</person> but in that west and is banged up as the denver broncos are they have six wins but they are going to struggle to get anymore out of it so san diego is still alive even the raiders still alive so well see you next week i mean jamarcus russell s coming off a 10 of 11 game they ran the ball well last week in the win against denver theyre getting good special teams play acres on the kickoff to <person player="jj arrington" race="UNK" position="RB">arrington</person> harrington across the 25 to the 26 yard line will some huge games chris in the nfl this weekend the carolina panthers who lost in atlanta last week now have to go to lambeau field to take on the packers a big nfc south showdown saints and buccaneers giants and redskins these are some intriguing matchups yeah they really are and for the <person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> bay packers they need to stay alive because somebody s getting a loss out of this game down here those two teams battling for first place but clearly that s one of those divisions looks like it s going to go right down to the wire now about matt cassel this season is gracious ive back 400yard passing it just remarkable and it s quite a tribute to bill belichick and his coaching staff up there that they can take a guy that had not started the game since high school and slowly develop him to the point where he looks like one of the better quarterbacks in the league and he s going to be a free agent at the end of the season panco tunga foul was the shaken up arizona cardinal who will gingerly walk off the field under his own power he saw <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> he got nicked up earlier it looked like they were fooling around with <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> stowe s now theyre gonna tape that up and im a little surprised you know maybe you want to get them ready and just in case and all those sorts of things but i mean there s your franchise right there youve seen tonight what this offense looks like when he s on and when he s healthy im not so sure well see him again unless <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> and the cardinals can get hot in a hurry <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> in this football game 15 of 26 146 yards two touchdowns and two picks on first and 10 <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boldin</person> there s the power of <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> and finally dragged down from behind at the 48 yard line so the final play of the third quarter goes for 25 the cardinals will need a lot more of that trailing 34 13 after three quarters of play thursday night football on nfl network from philadelphia mitchell tell me about more carries for 24 yards and the eagles in control 34 13 and that s <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> that s the same way he was before the game to is we have the battling birds i guess the cardinals need to battle back from a huge deficit first and ten for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> under all kinds of pressure and he cant get bolden stuart <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> got through along with victor of beer mary we came in talking about how talented these two receivers are and certainly they have put up numbers second to none especially over the past five weeks but tonight the philadelphia eagles with a great game plan applying pressure at the line of scrimmage not allowing <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt</person> those quick throws that he s known for and it has thrown the cardinals off their day and bouldin has had two drops including one in the end zone <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> with a great catch inside the 10 ledo <person player="lito sheppard" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheppard</person> beaten and there the hands and the strength of <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> a gain of 40 well this guy i think has as good a hands as ive ever seen in the game and im talking about jerry rice chris carter you name whoever you want to he just makes circus catch after circus catch and the thing that he s done to improve his game this season is the one after the catch he s nearly doubled that and he works for in practice first and goal quick pass to bouldin might have been tipped at the line as it sailed over his hat maybe looked like he just sailed over his head im not sure <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> quite understood what <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt</person> was trying to give him on that one and really wasnt looking back i think <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt</person> just saw a little gap in the defense and tried to get it to him quickly bouldin wasnt ready for it arizona offense has been out of sync water again <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> touchdown arizona there s the strength and athleticism of <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> where <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> with a delayed count that time did a tremendous job of making the eagles show blitz theyre going to show everything here so he knows as long as he can get it out quickly he s going to have man coverage zip it in there big strong receiver in good hands touchdown arizona and <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> said he adjusts his body while running full stride better than just about anybody he s ever worked with he s something special he really is <person player="neil rackers" race="white" position="K">rackers</person> with the extra point so fired <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> with a couple of touchdown catches a long way to go still for the arizona cardinals they trailed 34 20 here in the fourth a lot of time youre right about that 14 15 to go in the fourth quarter so can arizona make that comeback now they now the offense is starting to click become the defense make a stop that s another question all together but bouldin for whatever reason is just having troubles tonight so you can see waller decided well the guy that s got the safest hands out of the two of them is <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> go to the guy with the safe hands it s just one little slant very very tough to defend that right and the set up was the correct one they have a better coverages <person player="neil rackers" race="white" position="K">rackers</person> as a twp 30 tick away short kick <person player="quintin demps" race="nonwhite" position="DB">demps</person> from his own 15 dents runs out of a couple tacos gents up to the 44 yard line they take a look at <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> chris first nfl player since 1975 a hundred yards rushing two rushing touchdowns to receiving games in one game go back to lydell mitchell in the baltimore colts with bert jones s quarterback i remember lydell mitchell he was some player but <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brian westbrook</person> has been a guy that over the years has created just about as much excitement for a football team as anyone i know and they need a little bit that was a big kick return i dont think there s any question arizona can score on the philadelphia defense the question is can arizona s defense stop this offense they havent done it all night dab under pressure <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> throws it away pressure by <person player="darnell dockett" race="UNK" position="DT">darnell dockett</person> and now arizona lobbying for another intentional grounding i dont think theyre going to get it because he was outside the pocket and got it back to the line of scrimmage or there he went straight back chris now the original line of scrimmage was the 44 yard line intentional drowning the original line of scrimmage all right well he looks like he s on the left hash mark when it gets outside that hash mark well actually no chris he was on the right hash once that s a college huh youre exactly right that s for one they have college games here that s i think that s a pretty good call yeah clone is great but i think it s close ill give you close but ill give you this huge call for arizona because now not only do they get the downed but they lose what 20 years on the play so now it s second and thirty mcnab you can have the holiday thank you very much appreciate that one yard gain when you need 30 well now you may youre in an interesting situation now you know the eagles defense gave up 24 points in the fourth quarter last week against the ravens alrighty arizona has taken it down the field in a big hurry and scored but what you cannot do here is turn the football over but you do not take a big chance obviously youre probably going to have to punt the football here wouldnt be surprised to see him even hand it off <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> to the right of <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> will throw a little screen for <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> with soon <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> to the 39 <person player="reggie wells" race="nonwhite" position="OT">wells</person> short of the first down <person player="karlos dansby" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dansby</person> on the tackle that was a tremendous series of downs for arizona s defense probably the best of the night aided by that call but now this offense and we have 13 minutes of football at the play with one of the most explosive offenses that hasnt been showing that thus far in this game but believe me they can go up and down the field with anybody so ive rocket a punt just under 13 minutes to go in the ballgame mid high kick preston inside as i resting way out of danger does get it back to the 10yard line a <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> can air it out he s down 14 but getting back on the field in arizona back at their own 10yard line yeah but it s go get them time so whether youre on the 10 or the 20 or the 40 the style of play has to be basically the same now for <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> i tower to one back set <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> gets hammered but he gets it off water got it off to bouldin who s had the drugs tonight and he coughed it up boyd ran quan <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boldin</person> this has been a rough night <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> is going to get ripped as he lets go this football but he does his job gets it in the hands of his playmaker and for <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> tonight i have just never seen him have a night like this and who else <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> for the helmet right on the football once again the hall of famer getting it done and for <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> such a brave year this year after all the facial surgery coming back but this has not been his night <person player="akeem jordan" race="nonwhite" position="LB">akeem jordan</person> on the recovery so philadelphia where the 14point lead is <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> picks up a couple you mentioned antwon bolden earlier this year against the new york jets final seconds of the game he gets hit by eric smith talking with some of the cardinals people they actually had to sever with whoever was left of his jaw that was connected in order to get his bite realign they actually took his jaw almost out of his mouth and reset it and he refused once he was in recovery to even take any painkillers and came back in two games unbelievable that <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> was able to do that yeah and it was <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> who said that after seeing that hit and seeing what happened to him that he contemplated retirement so dont ever question the toughness of <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> this has just been one of those nights for him he has dropped the football he is fumbled it a couple of times and <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> is gonna go over im sure and say hey guy another night and bolden said the doctors were amazed three days later he s in the weight room lost about ten pounds something that only takes six to eight weeks to recover from first and goal for the eagles <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> has four touchdowns <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> picks up a yard to the five traffic schoolboy and <person player="darnell dockett" race="UNK" position="DT">darnell dockett</person> on the tackle yeah dont expect the eagles to take any chances at all in this situation because now if you can take it from a 14 point game to a 17point game obviously you are in an awfully good shape and your kicker <person player="david akers" race="white" position="K">david akers</person> has now made 39 i believe it is fuel goals in a row from 45 yards or less so this is almost guaranteed as long as you dont turn it over here <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> tying franchise records tonight with four touchdowns to running to receiving <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> under some pressure and just throws it away intended for <person player="brent celek" race="white" position="TE">brent celek</person> the tight end good job by mcnab obviously getting rid of the football and for guan bolden not much fun party morning wag has done a tremendous job tonight getting his quarterback back in rhythm again i thought from the very beginning you know moving him out of the pocket trying to establish a run some screens drawers <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> taking off and running with the football this was five years ago <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> and the philadelphia leaguers third and goal from the five <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> with time underneath <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> gets the touchdown offensive explosion for the eagles on thanksgiving the bolden fumble results in sex for philadelphia <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> chest bump at andy reid i bounced a little blocked by <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">kevin curtis</person> on the outside to finally get him in the end zone but <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> you can see a more prominent role and i like what the eagles have done tonight they put the ball back in the hands of their primary playmakers <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> jackson <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> and those guys have gotten a tunnel maker s extra point makes it 41:24 <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> six catches 76 yards in hey go coach rookie im fired up go run for their money but they got warren sapp on the set you better guard that puddin who would you god or i think <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> there they do youve been sensational even with all the controversy surrounding <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> by rights putupon barrington takes it up to the 30yard line alright but take a look at <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> and the cardinals weve had a chance to clinch the nfc west with a win tonight 7 and 4 coming in for no on the division theyre gonna win the division yeah that s the safest guess is it and if the 49ers lose tonight to go along with the fact the seahawks loss i think they do actually clench it backing in so you know it s going to happen eventually but they certainly on a chance and a night they had a chance to do it themselves did not want to put on a performance like this this has been a little embarrassing well i think more importantly for them to it s you know look at their losses against the better teams in the nfc as <person player="jerheme urban" race="white" position="WR">urban</person> makes the catch you know losing it washington losing to the giants losing the carolina volley losing here to the philadelphia eagles and you wonder how viable having to go on the road and closing they can be nice there s probably people in arizona laughing right now saying we dont care were just glad to finally be in the playoffs it has been quite a dry spell trying to get their first division title in 33 years they last qualified for the postseason the 1998 s breasted cant reel it in that s been that s been one of the odd things about tonight chris is the fact that mount rock passes by the arizona court or something they think yeah you know i mean statistically i think this team arizona was in the top three as far as fewest drop passes and the philadelphia eagles were in the bottom three as far as dropping passes and yet weve seen time after time the eagles receivers making plays and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> but <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> and others putting it on the ground brenda s not been a factor it s not ridiculously cold a good night to play football blitz on breasts in the 36yard line when tense quentin michael converged on preston where they are coming from deep now theyre coming all the way here to come up with pressure from the secondary and actually youd think this is a pretty good call you end up with a quick screen to the direction of the blitz put the philadelphia eagles and <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> has had a terrific game tonight there to make the play boy you do not want to be in this situation trying to play catchup against jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> and company <person player="sheldon brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sheldon brown</person> with the big hit fourth and talk about our time out tomorrow s slash play 60 saw the frankford chargers leave the eagles out earlier tonight we were helped on to play 60 program and the generous donations from you the fans arizona go for it here on a fourth and four down 41 to 20 <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> with batted down at the line incomplete frank coal knocked it away well mission accomplished for the philadelphia eagles tonight they wanted to make <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> sit in the pocket and pat the ball watch it usually pat s at once and throws it once twice three times four times tries to get it out pressure gets close cant get it done i think this has been a tremendous game plan against this arizona cardinals team theyve taken away the quick throws they havent allowed these receivers to get the ball in their hands where they can catch it and make a run with it jim <person player="dirk johnson" race="white" position="P">johnson</person> once again coming up with a scheme to stop one of the nfl s hottest quarterbacks and hottest often hey that wasnt only a multiple pat that was also a double clutch in there sure was he s a double clutch equal to pat s <person player="kyle eckel" race="UNK" position="RB">kyle</person> out beckylyn and hell pick up two yards on the play <person player="karlos dansby" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dansby</person> on the tackle you know weve talked about <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> and what this would mean to him tonight but how about andy reid i mean there was some grumbling going on around here about andy reid and i when i was interviewing andy as you know grilling him about the <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> benching and why didnt he tell him himself and then i started getting on him about the run pass ratio and he goes ho ho cuz im gonna fix that tonight and i said really he said yeah im goin the wishbone you know what he said thanksgiving right you know so i mean you cannot the guy has something at least a sense of humor about everything you know he s not going to get down he s been in philadelphia for ten years you cant scare him <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lorenzo booker</person> dives inside the 30 the 29 yard line of course andy reid i mean coming into this game 93 wins 61 losses 5 nfc east titles took the team to the super bowl i mean his reign here has been fantastic now but maybe they have won more they lost some of those conference championship games at home could they have won a super ball you can make the case when you look at the overall program what theyve built here it s pretty impressive you know the hard part is for any coach is 10 years in the same city is a long time because fans have long memories and they tend to drag up the real worst moments which after 10 years they can be pretty extensive <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lorenzo booker</person> extends the drive he gets the first down theyll head some fans to the exit here at lincoln financial field but they came to see what they wanted to see and that s a wellplayed game by the eagles with 723 to go and philadelphia month and ill just say this it s not over for the philadelphia eagles i mean this is a team fully capable of going on a streak and getting in the playoffs remember two of the last three years weve seen a team come out of the wild card slot to win the super bowl the pittsburgh steelers did it as the sixth seed the giants did it is a five seat i believe that was out of the wildcard so a late run can often propel two for philadelphia last year with new england you had 90 carry a 33 carries for 90 yards he picks up 14 there you know i like colic yeah i thought one of the big plays of the game was when he picked up that first down on a third and one that has been the achilles heel of this eagles team all night but look for them fighting yardage for yardage in there that s that s pretty impressive that s an element they really havent had on this thing 576 yards on the ground 53 of top you know we talked about the eagles you mentioned about you know the wild card what teams have done over the last couple of years exactly picks up a couple but you know you look at the numbers here chris on their way to six five and one theyve got to get to ten five and one to be included in the conversation because i think that you need 10 for a wild card in the nfc yeah but ill say this though that the one thing about the philadelphia eagles is that they can stop the run better than they have in a long time averaging under three and a half yards per carry and you have to go back to 1991 to find a philadelphia xik eagles defense that could stop the run at that pace so when youre playing the redskins when youre playing the new york giants that s the formula you have to be able to stop the run so at least they have a chance second and goal <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> the salic over his head and incomplete <person player="adrian wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adrian wilson</person> and again youre gonna hear a few squawk sighs not accurate he didnt throw that one in there in reality what it was it s not a clean look if it s not wide open just overthrow it will take another shot take a little more time off the clock now his guys made some plays for him tonight <person player="kevin curtis" race="white" position="WR">curtis</person> couple nice catches basket along the sidelines dough laid out made a catch form you know it was interesting and talking to <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan</person> about you know i go what were you thinking over there on the sideline when he got benched last week for kevin cobb i mean here you are youre benched essentially for throwing interceptions and yet historically youre number two in national football league history top line intersects third and goal no interceptions just touchdown this works fourth touchdown pass from <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> and you could just see his confidence grow and and i think to some extent when he got out and got involved in the game and was running the football <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> on in this one it was just like everything started feeling like it did a while ago and and he has been impressive tonight no question saw <person player="jason avant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">avant</person> extend the ball just enough to break the plane right before his knee hit the ground so <person player="jason avant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jason</person> a bond with his second touchdown catch of the season forth from <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> tonight as far as touchdown passes philadelphia with a seasonhigh 48 points leading 48 to 20 with 5:19 to go can i go through the list of things that we were talking about the philadelphia eagles coming into this game hey let s talk about it <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> was bench that he s playing horribly <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> has dinged up and he cant run the way that he used to be able to do the wide receivers are dropping more balls than anybody the two tackles cant protect and yet what s happened tonight the tackles and his offensive line have dominated <person player="brian westbrook" race="nonwhite" position="RB">westbrook</person> s looked better than he has in a long time <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> has been sensational and the receivers have been catching everything has been groans oh he s so the birthday boy <person player="jon runyan" race="white" position="OT">jon runyan</person> he s now you look at defensively a couple of pics cosell johansson quint and michael <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> in the ballgame you know the cardinals averaged almost 391 yards a game as an offense by now they have 251 yards even all over the place and arizona s going to go home and say we beat ourselves because of the <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> interceptions because of the <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> drops because of the fumbles they really didnt give themselves a chance in this football game but defensively they have to be better than this i mean the philadelphia eagles arent exactly an offensive juggernaut and now theyve put up 48 i would maybe disagree a little bit with them if that was their assessment i think the eagles beat them in every which way is harrington takes it across the 30 i mean theyve made all the plays they you know philadelphia has taken advantage of every opportunity and theyve converted on third downs they played good defense there s the pudding pie coming up on the home depot postgame show <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> oneonone highlights and cowboys and titans in the second annual pudding pie what kind of pie is that as i kept i was looking all over to see if warren and maybe taking a swipe with his finger through the thing but i didnt see it which isin will give you all the details on the history of the foot and five errington on iran but would you would you kind of agree with the cardinals that they lost oh well they they certainly you know the two <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> interceptions <person player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> just completely turned this game around and certainly <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> got hot and took advantage of it but this has been a whoopin you know this is old fashioned nfc east im bigger im badder than what you guys are and they have just taken it to the arizona cardinals from the very beginning west coast team is about to go to owen fifteen when playing in the eastern time zone <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> harrington dropped it again welcome those fans joining us on nflcom two nfl network thursday night football or mano you can

coming in there and play in that slot corner has been terrific tonight they have shut down this highflying passing game arizona go for it on fourth and one <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">warner</person> looking for <person player="jerheme urban" race="white" position="WR">urban</person> intercepted by <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> his first pick of the year he s run out of bounds at the arizona 45 yard line third interception by water and the second force turnover by <person player="brian dawkins"

player="early doucet" race="nonwhite" position="WR">early</person> and it s going to be no contest easy pick for <person player="brian dawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian dawkins</person> the veteran who once again has come up with huge plays in this one he s just tied to eric allen and bill <person player="stewart bradley" race="UNK" position="LB">bradley</person> with his 34th career interception well wonder if were going to see kevin cobb were seeing him but in the role that <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> and eagle fans probably want to see him up 48 to 20 yeah this is a little different than it was last week gives it off for the pile echo it bounces his way for five yards you think it was a little bizarre just the whole concept of you know typically when coaches make quarterbacking changes and they want to work in one of their younger players you end up putting him in a soft spot well how about in a 107 game the road against the baltimore ravens defense that s a bit nightmarish there saw mcnab s numbers spectacular tonight and he threw in 24 yards rushing table taken in the second round last year from the university of houston second and five <person player="lorenzo booker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lorenzo booker</person> about 1/2 yards short of the first down 323 to go i know the politically correct thing to do here is to run out the clock but if i were the coach and you know me im a little bit of a jerk anyway but i would give this kid a chance to throw the football i mean how many opportunities is he going to have to come in in a game and live action with your starting offense and work and he doesnt need to practice handing it off he needs as much experience throwing the football as he possibly can and i know that upsets people when youre running up the score and all that kind of stuff but it s really not that it s an opportunity to develop the heirapparent philadelphia on third down six of six on three yards or less eckle near the first down marker he hit the big third and one on their first drive and he gets another third and 1 maybe that was the answer to their entire season pileup remember they had dorsey levens they used to have at least one big back to kind of move the chains yeah and i guess maybe they thought forel buck halter was going to that let say a ech hole to me has a very definite role on this football team and if he can just pick up one yard weve documented it before this is a team that may well have had eight or nine wins at this point if they could pick up one yard at various points in the season now the eagles will take it down to the twominute warning in total control theyve had a feast on this thanksgiving night and none of that was there picked off three times tonight talking with mat liner mat liner was none too happy when he lost his job and basically the message that came from the organization was you know what youre not getting beat out by just any <person player="joe mays" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe</person> here this is <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> this is the twotime mvp maybe instead of complaining about it you should watch how he prepares watch what he does to get ready for the football game and there s no question that this is made <person player="matt leinart" race="white" position="QB">matt leinart</person> mature a little bit and i think he needed that theyve said that he has clearly come to work with a different disposition and the fact that <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> s had so much success with the amount of preparation that he does they think ultimately that s gonna rub off on matt and really going to help him cobb takes a knee on first down cardinals do not use any of their timeouts i just want to get home well take another knee all right so the cardinals lose another one of these defining games and theyll fall to seven and five take a look at their remaining schedule chris depending on what carolina does and tampa i mean they still have a shot to get the number two seed but tonight would have been a little bit more defining had theyve been able to lock up the division and get this one on the road yeah but theyre going to have a home playoff game no matter what but youre right trying to get the number two seed is so key obviously a tough shot there against the patriots in new england but the other three games at home so they still are in the <person player="tony hunt" race="UNK" position="RB">hunt</person> because that nfc south those teams are going to knock each other off on any given week this appointment for ken whisenhunt who s really gotten this program headed in the right direction but andy <person player="jr reed" race="UNK" position="DB">reed</person> after a week of turmoil with the benching of <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">donovan mcnabb</person> his team took that little step back and then the big step forward tonight chris excellent ballgame by the philadelphia eagles on both side down to the <person player="donovan mcnabb" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnabb</person> stands up to the crowd for his team and plays superb football <person player="kurt warner" race="white" position="QB">kurt warner</person> tough day for him and the arizona cardinals they still have to get that victory to win the division
