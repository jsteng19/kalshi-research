============================================================

cincinnati just simply, the meteorologist put it this way "it s gone from bitter cold to brutally cold" did you ever play in anything like it? &gt;&gt; i didnt play in this cold of weather i played in some cold games, dick, but nothing to match this &gt;&gt; for don coryell, the temperature differential from last week, when he was in short sleeves, 84 degrees in miami, when they defeated the dolphins in overtime minus59 today well, youve got to be a mathematician to figure out the difference and that s about the difference, today, between the temperature if this game was being played in san diego or here in cincinnati forrest gregg, the afc coach of the year some vaseline applied to his face to protect him from this bitter cold he remembers a day in the early 60s when, with the green bay packers, he played in new york, came out of the game with a limp ear he said it just looked like a dead rose just flopped right over he thought hed never retain the right position of that ear and, fortunately, it came back for him it was that cold that day, but it s colder today &gt;&gt; both coaches going to be hardpressed today to find a way to cope with this situation, to find a way to win were going to find out how resourceful these two teams are in combating this cold &gt;&gt; the good news and the bad news for san diego the good news is they will get the ball first the bad news is they will get it going into the wind, going left to right the quarterbacks will be throwing into a wind that s gusting up to 25 miles an hour <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> is the deep man for san diego led the entire nfl in allpurpose yardage <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">jim breech</person> kicks it off it s short, and that figures brooks at the 9 15 20 and he s down at the 25yard line <person player="rick razzano" race="UNK" position="LB">rick razzano</person> and <person player="tom dinkel" race="UNK" position="LB">tom dinkel</person> downfield for cincinnati <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person>, another banner year recordsetting nfl year for fouts, throwing the football <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chuck muncie</person> tied an nfl record with 19 rushing touchdowns <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> led the nfl in allpurpose yardage <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">charlie joiner</person> his best year ever <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wes chandler</person> certainly has found a home in san diego and the tight end, <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person>, an allpro from the 25 well, the crowd is cold, but it is noisy it s <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> a gain of about 3, maybe 4 to the 29yard line <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">glenn cameron</person> made the tackle here s the offensive front five for san diego <person player="billy shields" race="white" position="OT">billy shields</person> at left tackle the left guard, allpro <person player="doug wilkerson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">doug wilkerson</person> the center <person player="don macek" race="UNK" position="C">don macek</person> at right guard, four times in a super bowl with minnesota, <person player="ed white" race="white" position="OG">ed white</person> and <person player="russ washington" race="UNK" position="OT">russ washington</person> he said, "i wont let you take my picture, cause the last time i did that, i injured my knee and i was out for the year" so <person player="russ washington" race="UNK" position="OT">washington</person> would not pose for our cameras &gt;&gt; maybe something in that first play they came out running the football let s see what <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> does on second and 6 &gt;&gt; <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> in motion they run it to the left to <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> and he has a first down as he crosses the 35yard line <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">bryan hicks</person>, number 27, came up from his safety spot to make the tackle so, the chargers run wide right and wide left on the first two scrimmage plays and have a first down cincinnati, defensively and it was a better defense than the chargers on the course of the year <person player="eddie edwards" race="UNK" position="DE">eddie edwards</person>, after an injury, back in the lineup <person player="wilson whitley" race="UNK" position="DT">wilson whitley</person> on the nose of the center and <person player="ross browner" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ross browner</person> the other front lineman <person player="bo harris" race="white" position="LB">bo harris</person>, one of the four linebackers, with <person player="jim leclair" race="white" position="LB">jim leclair</person> the leading tackler, <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">glenn cameron</person>, and <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person>, who leads the bengals in sacks and <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> calls time ball at the 36yard line and <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> looked at the cincinnati set and, with the play called, decided hed better exercise a timeout boy, that s got to be a long way for everyone to call a timeout in this weather no one s going to relish any timeouts the rest of the bengals defense, the back four <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> had that 102yard touchdown against san diego veteran <person player="ken riley" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ken riley</person>, over 50 interceptions in his fine career <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby kemp</person>, eighthround draft pick what a job he s done at one safety spot and <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">bryan hicks</person>, another <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> safetyman for cincinnati &gt;&gt; dick, a couple of things we ought to consider in the early going here first, the one thing that the players have out there, it appears, is good footing today this turf is frozen dry, and the footing should be pretty good, except for the treacherous far corner of the end zone one of the other big things to consider this day, on a cold day, with any team, is fumbles and turnovers, especially so with <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chuck muncie</person> if theyre going to rely on him, he s had a history of coughing the football up, has a hard time holding it, appears to run in a straightup position and, a lot of times, those helmets bang right into that football but a costly turnover in the wrong part of the field could be the difference in a game like this &gt;&gt; it will be an interesting contrast in the two top runners muncie, although he s a big man, likes to run wide, use his speed johnson, a burly fullback in the traditional sense, at 250 pounds, runs tackletotackle, primarily, and rarely fumbles first down, san diego, at the 36 <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> first throw of the game and he misses <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> at the 40yard line <person player="ken riley" race="nonwhite" position="DB">riley</person> over there, along with cameron, but <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> was alone now, defensively, merlin, cincinnati is going to try to check <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> as much as they can &gt;&gt; theyre gonna have someone with him all day let s watch the football looked like it got away from <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> a little bit here the ball just took off on him already, <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> showing the effects of the cold, as that ball got out of his hand and that s one of the things you lose you lose the feeling in your hands, and that football gets hard and slick &gt;&gt; second down and 10 <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> breaking all of his own nfl records that he set last year another pass this to <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and he gains only a couple <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> and <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby kemp</person> were on top of <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> as soon as he caught the ball &gt;&gt; in that big game early in the year, when these cincinnati bengals embarrassed the chargers, one of the things they did early, defensively, was to really shake up the receivers when they caught the football with that same kind of hits &gt;&gt; you saw the statistic on <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> 52 catches counting his receptions at new orleans earlier this year, he finished with 69 third down, 8, at the 37, against a fivemandefensiveback set gonna be intercepted oh! it was not that ball just died out there it was a sure interception about halfway there, and then the ball just floated and allowed the offensive player, joiner, to come in and break it up &gt;&gt; dick, it s apparent that the chargers still feel that they can throw the football, although <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> has had trouble here early he had the one pass get away from him and this one appeared to get away, too watch the ball just die and it almost came down right in the hands of <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">charlie joiner</person> he almost picked it up &gt;&gt; now, remember, san diego was throwing into the wind the bengals will get the ball with the wind at their back <person player="george roberts" race="white" position="P">george roberts</person> with <person player="mike fuller" race="white" position="DB">mike fuller</person> at the other end short kick and it goes out of bounds around the 35yard line the bengals have the ball, for the first time, at the 36yard line &gt;&gt; on that last play, <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person> was bumped just as he threw that football, if youre wondering why it died the way it did watch him just as he gets the ball off &gt;&gt; <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person>, the nfl s passing champion this year, allpro performer, and named mvp in the league his first attempt and he has a man, alexander, at the 41yard line 5yard gain for <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">charles alexander</person> "alexander the great" they called him after last week s fine performance <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> at quarterback for cincinnati here s the rest of their offensive set <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">charles alexander</person> had his best day of the season last year <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> he s the man they like to go to when they need the yards their great rookie, <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> the veteran <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">curtis</person> on the outside <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person>, who set a new cincinnati record 71 catches at tight end second down, 4 <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> close to the 45 short of the first down while cincinnati is attacking a defense, san diego, that was not good at all against the pass they were fairly respectable against the run <person player="anthony munoz" race="UNK" position="OT">anthony</person> muñoz <person player="dave lapham" race="UNK" position="OG">dave lapham</person> the center, an underrated <person player="blair bush" race="white" position="C">blair bush</person>, has done a great job all year <person player="max montoya" race="white" position="OG">max montoya</person> and <person player="mike wilson" race="UNK" position="OT">mike wilson</person> the offensive front five &gt;&gt; quite a few of those offensive linemen out there with bare arms today they dont want to give those defenders anything to grab on as theyre trying to <person player="bob rush" race="UNK" position="C">rush</person> the passer &gt;&gt; two tight ends and <person player="david verser" race="nonwhite" position="WR">david verser</person> the wide receiver he s the flanker to the near side on third and more than a yard and it s gonna be close depends on how much he was able to yes! first down, cincinnati the chargers, defensively, have <person player="leroy jones" race="UNK" position="DE">leroy jones</person>, 68", defensive end <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">louie kelcher</person>, considered one of the top tackles in the game <person player="gary johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">gary johnson</person> he made the pro bowl and <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">john woodcock</person> on the right side for <person player="fred dean" race="nonwhite" position="DE">fred dean</person> linebackers <person player="linden king" race="UNK" position="LB">linden king</person> their best linebacker <person player="bob horn" race="white" position="LB">bob horn</person> in the middle and woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> good against the pass on the far right side, or weak side first down for <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> he dumps it out in the flat oh, you could see, again, that pass just died as he tried to find <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> defensive backs for the chargers here are their four deep men <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person>, the veteran from san diego state, at the left corner <person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike williams</person> on the other side <person player="pete shaw" race="nonwhite" position="DB">pete shaw</person>, a hitter, at strong safety and <person player="glen edwards" race="nonwhite" position="DB">glen edwards</person>, the veteran, called back out of retirement earlier this year by san diego &gt;&gt; it would appear, dick, that both these quarterbacks have decided to throw shorter passes today i think that s a good choice no one has really tried to get deep yet &gt;&gt; first quarter weve played about 4 minutes second down and 10 the draw to <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">louie kelcher</person> stops him at midfield 74, kelcher, from smu, the same school that produced forrest gregg &gt;&gt; one of the important responsibilities for <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">kelcher</person> on that defensive line is to read and react to the draw he s lost a little of that quickness in the pass rush, but he certainly read that play well, put himself into position had he not been there, <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> would have made a little bigger gain out of it &gt;&gt; they have the hot seats that have been transported to cincinnati, both teams, the heated benches, which will help somewhat at the 50yard line, it s third down and 6 <person player="steve kreider" race="UNK" position="WR">steve kreider</person>, 86, is in for <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> three wide receivers <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> in a pass situation <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">kelcher</person> appeared to be offside flags down caught by ross! he s all the way to the 33yard line! <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person>, from northeastern, in boston he caught 71, a new cincinnati record and you cant throw that ball any better &gt;&gt; he certainly figures to be a big part of the game here for the cincinnati bengals theyll try to take away the wide receivers and single up on him with a linebacker woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> is no match for <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> there s the quick shot of <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">kelcher</person> getting off early a little anxious of course, theyll refuse that penalty theyll take the big gain on the pass the bengals moving the football here early theyre doing surprisingly well in this bitter cold &gt;&gt; <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person>, who wanted not to be a football player but a hockey star when he was a youngster his dad, in massachusetts, used to flood the backyard and create a skating pond for him he wanted to be a defenseman decided hed stay with football, and regarded one of the top products out of the northeast in the last few years &gt;&gt; the telephones have gone out on the far side the cincinnati coaches have just had to take off their headsets now that s a rule in the nfl if the telephone communications between the coaches upstairs and the coaches on the sideline go out on either sideline, both coaches, both coaching staffs have to do without now youll see some scrambling youll have some questions down there that will go unanswered &gt;&gt; all right, this is an official timeout first down, cincinnati forrest gregg s bengals are in san diego territory, at the 33yard line and theyre working with the wind at the bengals back &gt;&gt; theyll be looking up for some signals from the coaching box, but the offensive coordinator for the bengals, lindy infante, is on the sideline hell be signaling in the plays from there he actually doesnt signal them in himself he calls them aloud, and a couple of the players and coaches signal them in to the quarterback, <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> &gt;&gt; johnson drives to the 23yard line he may have a first down <person player="linden king" race="UNK" position="LB">linden king</person> finally dragged the big <person player="guy frazier" race="UNK" position="LB">guy</person> down &gt;&gt; both offenses going to the big backs early <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> with a couple of good gains but johnson gets a huge hole on the left side behind muñoz over there breaks it inside, gets a big gain &gt;&gt; 11 yards on the play, merlin, for <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie</person> <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james</person> hammock that s his real name when he was a youngster <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> weighed 180 pounds when he was in the seventh grade, in brooklyn, and used a false name <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> played seven years of highschool ball inside the 20, before <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">louie kelcher</person> can drag down that was <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> that time 18yard line, mark it a gain of about 4 it s second down and 6 &gt;&gt; when youre playing against him, you dont ask what his name was you just say, "who was that big guy?" [ laughs ] he weighs about 260 pounds last year, got as heavy as 267 but he is one hard back to bring down &gt;&gt; built for this kind of weather and the tradition of paul brown s teams in cleveland, he always liked that big fullback marion motley one of the best and is happy with these set of backs <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> is no midget he s 221 this is johnson big hole and he s close to the first down stopped at the 13yard line now both coaching phones are back, so theyre now in telecommunication with the press box <person player="gary johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">gary johnson</person> finally making the tackle theyre checking the sidelines it appears to be short by about a halfyard &gt;&gt; one of the questions i asked forrest gregg yesterday was, "what are you gonna look for early in the game out there?" he said, "i want to find out, very quickly, which players want to play and which players dont" he said, "if a <person player="guy frazier" race="UNK" position="LB">guy</person> doesnt want to play, hell come out of the game and we got to find out, on the other side, which of their players dont want to play, because well go after them" &gt;&gt; third down, cincinnati theyve made good on their first two thirddown conversions on this drive playaction <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> s going for it all and misses <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> he wanted to go in the end zone and look who was wide open <person player="david verser" race="nonwhite" position="WR">david verser</person> was all alone in the end zone &gt;&gt; an obvious running situation <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> really crossed them up they were able to get a piece of the receiver as he got out of there <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> getting out clean in spite of that but the pass simply overthrown and, again, the difficulty of throwing the ball deep today so hard to get a good grip on that football, to control it with any finesse when it s so bitterly cold &gt;&gt; little <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">jim breech</person> 56", a size5 shoe is trying to nail a 3pointer from 31 yards away and cincinnati has the lead! riverfront stadium these fans, who have waited 14 years for this, their first championship game and the bengals lead, 30 brooks at the 15, the 20 fumble! there it is! and the bengals recover! number 84, <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">don bass</person>, fell on the football hold on now may yes, it is cincinnati s ball <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bass</person> recovers well, you know those are going to happen that wont be the first fumble we see today &gt;&gt; very difficult, again, to hang on to that football when it s so cold you just lose the feeling of it the ball is stripped away beautifully <person player="rick razzano" race="UNK" position="LB">rick razzano</person>, number 51, the man down to knock it away and they are right on top of it let s see if they can take advantage of it, dick &gt;&gt; the ball is at the 12yard line <person player="rick razzano" race="UNK" position="LB">razzano</person> s tackle, <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bass</person> recovered <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> gives it to <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> and he s to the 9, maybe the 8 woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> led the defensive charge for san diego so, a big break for the bengals they won the toss and elected to take the wind in this first quarter so san diego took the ball bass, for the moment, the star for cincinnati give to <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> 4 yards on that firstdown carry and it s second down and 6 for the first down, 9 yards for a touchdown they go with two tight ends, ross and <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person>, with <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> out collinsworth, the rookie, bottom of your screen <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">curtis</person> on the far side <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> to throw touchdown, <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person>! <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person>, who came to cincinnati with forrest gregg from the toronto argonauts he may just like this kind of weather scored two touchdowns during the year, had just 13 catches michael lee harris makes it 90 &gt;&gt; a crisp pass and a fine catch <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> able to spot the open receiver one of the advantages hell have today he throws more to the receiver <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> tends to throw to the spot that s difficult in this kind of weather &gt;&gt; <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> s try for a point is good the bengals get an easy one after brooks fumble on the kickoff, a 4yard run by alexander, and an 8yard touchdown pass <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> kicks it off for the third time in the first 8 minutes and brooks will try again got an opening! 30! 40 and finally down at the 43yard line oh, you have to admire the rookie from auburn he comes right back and gives san diego good field position 35 yards on the return <person player="mike fuller" race="white" position="DB">fuller</person> made the tackle &gt;&gt; let s go back and look, quickly, at that scoring pass to <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person> get a chance to see him as he gets into the pattern here just starts across, gets a good bump in there from preston, and then cuts back into the corner of the end zone the ball quickly thrown right on the break there s no chance for number 27, <person player="glen edwards" race="nonwhite" position="DB">glen edwards</person>, to get over there and defend &gt;&gt; near the 45 that s <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">charlie joiner</person> in motion <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> tries the middle and gets out to about the 47yard line <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> had a banner year for the chargers 1,144 yards, 19 rushing touchdowns his average right there on his back 46 it s interesting the two cincinnati backs johnson, 39 average, and alexander, only a 3yard average, where <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> is a 46, and brooks a 48 average &gt;&gt; well have to look at the averages today i think they might be a little different on the day &gt;&gt; trailing, 100, midway through the first quarter <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> trying to get outside cant do it <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">cameron</person> finished him off, but it was <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> who made the play from his cornerback spot <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">breeden</person> from north carolina central &gt;&gt; dick, mike adamle made the point, early in the pregame show, that, today, it s not so much a matter of what you can do it s what you want to do, a matter of will both these teams are going to have to press their pain thresholds today to see which one wants to stay in there the longest it looks, right now, that the bengals certainly have the most enthusiasm, the most intensity in the early going <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> better get his gang together &gt;&gt; on third and 9, over the middle nice catch by <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and he gets a block downfield at the 40 and out of bounds at the 34, 33yard line <person player="ray griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">ray griffin</person>, number 44, in the nickel defense, ran him out of bounds nice throw <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> to <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> first san diego completion &gt;&gt; a chance to watch the drops there a 21yard completion to <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> but let s see if we cant see how he gets open there 53, <person player="bo harris" race="white" position="LB">bo harris</person>, the man in the middle <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> dropping back but they threw underneath theyre dropping the linebackers on the zone <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> getting across, getting a block from number 87, <person player="dwight scales" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dwight scales</person>, and picking it up nicely san diego moving the ball &gt;&gt; so much concentration on winslow, they used <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> as the decoy and threw underneath him and now a flag, as fouts, on a problem with the snap false start, san diego 5 yards &gt;&gt; one of the concerns that don coryell had was for the noise level in this stadium talking yesterday at the press conference, he said, "i hope we dont have the noise problems that we had in miami, that they had here in the stadium with buffalo last week" a real disadvantage for a visiting team the crowd will quiet down, very often, for their own team noise level high it s hard to hear the signals over the crowd &gt;&gt; san diego fourth this year in most penalty yards buffalo leading the way so, it s first and 15, san diego, at the 38 of cincinnati 100, the bengals lead it, first quarter <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> he loves to run left and he s down to the 32yard line a gain of about 6 brings up second down and 9 &gt;&gt; i dont blame him for wanting to go out there he ran into the sunshine a little bit warmer out there the one advantage that the chargers will have in the early part of this game they are sitting in the sunshine it s got to be a bit warmer it s shaded on this side of the field, the near side, where the bengals are got to be a few degrees colder &gt;&gt; there s the sun on the far side second down and 9 <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> and brooks in the "i" and that s <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> in motion brooks ooh, did he take a lick, but hangs on to the football and is close to a first down at the 22yard line &gt;&gt; <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> what an outstanding addition to this charger offense that <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> man is a lot tougher than his size would dictate and im sure he is very determined to make up for that fumble that cost his team a touchdown he makes a good cutback you can see him taking advantage of the footing good footing even in that part of the field gets down for the first down &gt;&gt; the exauburn star, who replaced bruce harper, who has had a lock on that allpurposeyard record, but this year, it goes to brooks first down so, they were able to overcome the 5yard penalty on first down and here s brooks again up the middle to the 20yard line a quick shot for about 3 &gt;&gt; you can see that part of the area down here is shaded, part of it is in sunlight see that strip of sunlight going across the lower part of your picture? the receivers dropping into that area are gonna have a problem looking into that sun &gt;&gt; we also might point out, as we pan now to the right, the end zone down here in the far right is the frozen end that s where they like to cincinnati receivers like to get their man turned around we saw a touchdown last week when a buffalo defender fell, and <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> scored &gt;&gt; oh! &gt;&gt; almost intercepted by 55, <person player="jim leclair" race="white" position="LB">jim leclair</person>! the veteran from north dakota had that ball bouncing right in his lap &gt;&gt; <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> trying to dump that ball off both these quarterbacks like to throw that quick dumpoff pass chance to see it in action <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person> making his mind up, very quickly, to just throw that ball out to muncie, who then will become a pure runner with it that s like a long handoff but <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> unable to handle the football almost got it taken away from him by <person player="jim leclair" race="white" position="LB">leclair</person> &gt;&gt; third down and 7 at the cincinnati 20yard line remember, the chargers going into the wind <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> doesnt get much you see those bengals stripes, and it s like trying to fight your way through a jungle there were three or four orangeandblackuniformed bengals on top of muncie, and he gains but a yard in comes <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">rolf benirschke</person> to try a field goal that will be beyond 35 yards they will mark it at about the 27yard line <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> s numbers on the year and career what a solid kicker he has been inside the 40 &gt;&gt; although we have winds swirling, looking at the flags at the top of the goalpost, very little wind right at this moment in that area but the banner is blowing hard behind the goalpost hard tell, for a kicker, which way to try and kick the ball just drive it right down the center and hope youre right &gt;&gt; if nothing else, those banners have to make him think he can see them wiggling and wavering in the breeze and he must wonder what it will do to his kick well, cincinnati took the wind in this first quarter let s see if it pays off on this 37yard attempt <person player="ed luther" race="white" position="QB">ed luther</person> to hold &gt;&gt; it s got to be difficult to hold that football and get it down perfectly &gt;&gt; no good! dick enberg, merlin olsen cincinnati, ohio the coldest day on this date in the history of this city perhaps the coldest conditions an nfl game has ever been played minus59 wind chill <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> draws a crowd the differential between last week, in miami, when san diego played in the heat and humidity, 84 degrees, and today is a 143degree turnaround &gt;&gt; wearing gloves and thermals, you can overcome some of that but a good deal of the playing ability of these players is just the ability to withstand this terrible cold in a way, dick, it s easier for the players who are on the field, who are moving around, than for those who have to sit on the sideline and wait &gt;&gt; and theyre not going to get any warmer that s why the early 100 lead had to be a true advantage for cincinnati anderson, who is very mobile and led the nfl in rushing, quarterbacks gets about 5, maybe more to the 27yard line <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> throwing a block out there gain of maybe 6 to bring up third down and 3 318 yards for the veteran from batavia, illinois theyre going to have <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> day tomorrow in that city that city also produced another great athlete, dan issel, the allamerican at kentucky and the great pro and it s been issel s town until this year and tomorrow, it will be <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> day &gt;&gt; you saw, there, one of the reasons that he is so highly prized as a quarterback it s that running ability he s averaged 6 1/2 yards a carry during the season &gt;&gt; <person player="steve kreider" race="UNK" position="WR">steve kreider</person>, thirdyear man from lehigh, an extra receiver and that was <person player="steve kreider" race="UNK" position="WR">kreider</person> that he was trying to hit, but the pass was way off the mark it appears, merlin, that the passes toward the sidelines are doing tricks, that the ones that have been completed have been those where the quarterback s thrown straight ahead &gt;&gt; well, i think youre gonna see the ball doing tricks all day, dick youre going to see some good passes, but youre going to see a lot of them, like that one, that go off target again, that ball is difficult to grip the hands are cold it s hard to get a feeling on that ball and the winds here are swirling those three factors make it difficult to put it in the air anytime, but especially so on a day like today &gt;&gt; <person player="pat mcinally" race="UNK" position="P">mcinally</person> to kick the rock brooks at the 27 of san diego boy, that ball &gt;&gt; that just doesnt go anywhere, does it? &gt;&gt; chandler, the short man, at the 39 45 and out of bounds into the cincinnati bench ball at the 45 san diego trails cincinnati, 100 <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> up the middle and he fumbles! and i believe san diego one of the trailing linemen fell on it at the 50yard line &gt;&gt; and that s that straightup running style that we talked about earlier that s going to get <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> in trouble, because it s very difficult to clamp on that football they just snipped it right out of his hands <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> in there ahead of him as a blocker but the defenders going for that football, able to strip it away san diego lucky to have it winslow, right at the top of your screen, one of the blockers, trying to seal people out watch <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> now watch him try to cover that football <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">glenn cameron</person>, number 50, one of the men in there but they just pull it right out of his hands &gt;&gt; veteran guard <person player="ed white" race="white" position="OG">ed white</person> appeared to be the man who fell on the ball second down and 6 a 4yard gain <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> again into cincinnati territory, but short of the first down at the 47 <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person>, from dartmouth, made the tackle, number 57 4 yards on the play clock running down to 50 seconds left in the quarter &gt;&gt; in last week s big victory over the buffalo bills, this bengal team did not turn the ball over at all chuck knox said he thought that was one of the big reasons for the victory in the game today, weve already had a costly turnover san diego had 39 turnovers on the year the bengals only had 24, the lowest number in the entire nfl &gt;&gt; third down and 3 for the first down and <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> driving hard hell be close bengals good penetration &gt;&gt; it appears that theyre gonna give him the first down i dont think theyre gonna give it to him i think he earned it &gt;&gt; boy, that picture is deceptive the sunshine, the blue sky, the color of the crowd yes, it could well be 40, 50 degrees, but believe me it is not it s a belowzero temperature, and the chill factor with a wind minus59 can you perspire in weather this cold? &gt;&gt; dick, as cold as it is, these players work so hard on the field when theyre going that they will actually perspire and it becomes a big problem, because your gear gets wet, and then if you stop, you really get cold in a hurry &gt;&gt; we open the second quarter and, statistically, the first quarter was even on the scoreboard, cincinnati leads, 100 &gt;&gt; 7 of those points directly out of that costly fumble by <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> on the kickoff &gt;&gt; from the 45 of cincinnati, san diego begins the quarter with the wind advantage that s <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> his first catch and he s to the 38yard line <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person>, the leading receiver in the nfl this year, with 88 catches, just one less than the year before what an athlete and what a performance last week in miami &gt;&gt; everyone is gonna have to make adjustments today winslow, youll notice, as hell make his turn out there, will just kind of plant, get those feet on the ground, and take short steps to keep his feet <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> definitely throwing the ball a little less crisply than he would on an ordinary day to make sure that <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> has a chance to handle it but that s a good play well probably see that one again shortly &gt;&gt; 7 yards before <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> make the tackle on second and 3, it s <person player="john cappelletti" race="white" position="RB">john cappelletti</person> in the game and he has a first down at the 33yard line of course, played his college football and had a heisman senior year at penn state &gt;&gt; one of the reasons that well see some of <person player="john cappelletti" race="white" position="RB">cappelletti</person> today is playing in the cold, as he did at penn state, he knows how to handle that football he s also a very fine blocker, and well see him leading <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> on a number of plays &gt;&gt; i asked him, yesterday i said, "penn state this is your kind of weather" he said, "ive been in california so long, that seems like no pun intended an ice age away" he said, "im as cold as anyone" &gt;&gt; the chargers now have the wind at their back, dick let s see if they can take advantage of it &gt;&gt; trailing, 100, early in the second quarter <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> in trouble but gets it away and <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> has blockers 30 25, 20 15, 10, 5! touchdown! <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person>, a 33yard pass play and was that set up beautifully they caught the bengals in a blitz from the very side they were throwing the screen &gt;&gt; you like to be lucky, as well as good <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> was lucky the man that would normally be responsible for getting out on that screen was, indeed, on the blitz watch him coming right there that s <person player="eddie edwards" race="UNK" position="DE">eddie edwards</person> driving hard firing it out to the outside to number 80, <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> and <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> just using his athletic ability to turn it loose down the field they spread the defensive backs with the receivers, and <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> able to run it on in for the touchdown &gt;&gt; so, all the points have come with the wind and here s the try after by <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> oh, he just does sail one through less than 3 minutes for the chargers to score on that 55yard drive <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> <person player="david verser" race="nonwhite" position="WR">verser</person> at the 5, the 10 has some running room! he s got one man to beat, benirschke! and <person player="dwight scales" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dwight scales</person> came over to make the tackle at the 45 <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> slowed him up enough that <person player="dwight scales" race="nonwhite" position="WR">scales</person> was able to make the tackle but a nice return by the top draft pick of the bengals this year, <person player="david verser" race="nonwhite" position="WR">david verser</person>, from kansas &gt;&gt; <person player="david verser" race="nonwhite" position="WR">verser</person> comes right back to shift the momentum of this game, much as he did last week looked like the buffalo bills were getting going, and <person player="david verser" race="nonwhite" position="WR">verser</person> made a big runback last week does the same thing here beautiful job of cutting away from the possible tacklers <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> slowing him, as you said, dick and that s a shoestring tackle if ever there was one &gt;&gt; from the 45, the bengals leading, 107, early in the second quarter fake to johnson <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> complete to <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> and the tight end has 10, maybe 11 yards let s go down to mike adamle on the field &gt;&gt; dick, one of the things the chargers have been doing to keep their hands warm and combat the cold they have these hot compresses a chemical reaction takes place, and their hands warm right up <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> is using it, and so is his wide receivers i think that s one of the reasons why theyve been successful throwing the ball &gt;&gt; mike, were you at cleveland last year for the ice bowl? &gt;&gt; yes, i was &gt;&gt; how do you compare the two? &gt;&gt; dick, i think it s colder down here than it was in cleveland, if you can believe that &gt;&gt; thank you for your report stay warm &gt;&gt; there s <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> on the sideline im sure he s happy to get over there, get a coat on, and get a little bit warm &gt;&gt; second down and inches for cincinnati so <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> with a down to play with goes to <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> 35, 30 first down at the 30yard line <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person> finally made the tackle wed asked the question can these quarterbacks throw the ball on a day like today? theyve given us the answer &gt;&gt; and he s throwing into the wind &gt;&gt; <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> doing a good job here little shaky, that ball is, but it certainly is on target and <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> knew what to do with it <person player="pete shaw" race="nonwhite" position="DB">pete shaw</person>, number 44, the man that dropped him out of bounds theyre moving &gt;&gt; alexander, who had a couple of rushing touchdowns last week in the buffalo win first down at the 30 after that 15yard gain and open again this is <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> and he has another first down, at the 19! that face tells part of the story this kid is so happy to be here &gt;&gt; and he s happy to be on the end of this reception, too got himself in good position working on number 51, woody lowe, and in front of the right cornerback, <person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike williams</person> able to find the room and a zipper from <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> good play &gt;&gt; collinsworth, who, as a prank, sent <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wes chandler</person>, of the chargers, a popsicle in his room last night special delivery first down inside the 20 a reverse <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> and read pretty well by the chargers they stop him at the 16yard line &gt;&gt; <person player="leroy jones" race="UNK" position="DE">leroy jones</person>, number 68, the man who was upfield to turn it back inside, got a piece of <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> but bengals pulling out all the stops here, dick watch <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> now hell come back from his receiving position and hell take the football after the fake right there now watch <person player="leroy jones" race="UNK" position="DE">leroy jones</person>, number 68, come from the outside gets a piece of him there the pursuit, then, from the inside big <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis</person> <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">kelcher</person> there, along with <person player="gary johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">gary johnson</person>, to finally put him away &gt;&gt; a gain of about 3 second and 7 from the 16yard line anderson, who is 6 for 9 make it oh! johnson unable to hang on a reliable receiver, the big <person player="guy frazier" race="UNK" position="LB">guy</person> out of the backfield johnson, who caught 46 passes this year &gt;&gt; that s one of the favorite plays of the bengals we said, earlier, that <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person> uses that kind of play as a long handoff i think maybe the bengals have used it even more and, normally, johnson just catches that one as a matter of course but the cold weather made it difficult there and i think maybe saw a few bodies flying at him, too &gt;&gt; third down <person player="steve kreider" race="UNK" position="WR">steve kreider</person>, number 86, is into the lineup for cincinnati, with <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> out, as <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> will use the three wide receivers curtis, kreider, and <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> are all to the right a tripleright formation on third down, a long 7 plenty of time caught at the 1yard line! <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">isaac curtis</person> so, he s using all his receivers &gt;&gt; the last 3 or 4 games of the season, the bengals used 48 different formations they throw everything in the world at you they came with the three wide receivers on the same side theyre attacking a pass defense that was last in the nfl and they show you how to do it right here, as they get across in front of <person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike williams</person> right there with a big, big reception let s see if they can get it into the end zone &gt;&gt; first and goal at the 1yard line theyre already chanting, "pete, pete" and he gets it and he has a touchdown! he goes steady with that end zone johnson, all through his years at ohio state and now in the national football league, you can usually find him in double figures in that touchdown column every season &gt;&gt; looking from the end zone, youll see him just use that piledriving size and strength to push his way into the end zone &gt;&gt; <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> s try for a point <person player="steve kreider" race="UNK" position="WR">kreider</person> to hold and it s in there the bengals leading, 177 here s <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> s kick taken by <person player="pete shaw" race="nonwhite" position="DB">pete shaw</person>, one of the up backs and he doesnt get to the 30yard line the tackle made by number 21, <person player="oliver davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">oliver davis</person>, of cincinnati let s go back to the touchdown <person player="anthony munoz" race="UNK" position="OT">anthony</person> muñoz, the big left tackle, led the way for the bengals &gt;&gt; watch muñoz, number 78, working on <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">john woodcock</person>, number 90 they go right in behind the big allamerican and allpro he s just driving, laying on top of woodcock, just burying him underneath <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">woodcock</person> actually keeping his ground, but unable to overcome the momentum of muñoz <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> went right over the top of him &gt;&gt; allamerican at sc, allnfl rookie last year, allnfl this year, in his second season here s <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> crossing the 30 and dragged down at the 33 <person player="bo harris" race="white" position="LB">bo harris</person>, whose wife presented him with a couple of dozen roses in the locker room yesterday kind of an obvious thing to go through the locker room, and here are two dozen roses, in number 53, <person player="bo harris" race="white" position="LB">bo harris</person>, locker and he says, "the wife just wants me to know that she cares" &gt;&gt; hard to realize, sometimes, that these football players are just real people &gt;&gt; that s right and what a nice touch by the <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> lady &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; second down and 6 at the 33 <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> again too many bengals and <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby kemp</person>, 26, the rookie from cal state, fullerton, finished him off &gt;&gt; mike, youre down on the field tell us can you feel any tempo down there? who has the edge down there? &gt;&gt; well, cincinnati, merlin, definitely has the edge i thought that san diego, perhaps, would have the advantage theyre on the sunny side of the field, and it is significantly warmer over there if someone would have told me before the game these two teams would have 24 points at this point of the game, i would have told them they were crazy &gt;&gt; that just gives you an idea, mike, what it might have been like had we had decent weather in fact, both teams agreed that the losing club might have scored 30 points in good weather third down and 6 complete to <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> and the veteran from grambling has a first down at the charger 45yard line <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> and what a season for the 33yearold he had 70 catches he came to san diego from cincinnati in a trade for coy bacon &gt;&gt; he s certainly been valuable and so dependable and secondoldest active receiver in the league he still keeps right on chugging along put that one away, picked up the first down good pass by <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> &gt;&gt; on third down, breadandbutter play joiner, who had that big catch to set up the winning field goal in overtime at miami last week <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> out of the backfield <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> oh, as soon as he caught the ball, <person player="jim leclair" race="white" position="LB">jim leclair</person> and <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">cameron</person> were right on his back 6 yards on the play &gt;&gt; you can see the wind whipping the banners around this stadium not quite as windy out in the middle of the field, but the wind kind of swirls in this stadium you could be standing out there, it would be calm, and then, suddenly, you feel the surge of wind that s very difficult to deal with when youve got your hands on that football or youre trying to get it from one person to another &gt;&gt; we can measure it, mathematically, too, and well give you that right after this play second and 4 from the cincinnati 49 draw play to <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> he s got a little running room and a first down at the 41 the temperature is around 8 degrees the chill factor is almost minus60 that gives you an idea of what the wind does to the effect &gt;&gt; wind and humidity being right next to the river the way we are, we do pick up some of that, as well but i am really impressed, dick enberg, with the way these two teams are handling the cold weather they are here to play football it s apparent that theyre gonna do it in spite of the cold &gt;&gt; and, quite surprisingly, as mike indicated, were going to have a fairly highscoring game there are the game conditions &gt;&gt; "bitter cold" well, they didnt miss that one &gt;&gt; "brutally cold" is what the man said on tv last night here s brooks on first down to the 37yard line, before <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person>, threetime allivy league linebacker at dartmouth, makes the tackle and <person player="jim leclair" race="white" position="LB">jim leclair</person> has to be restrained &gt;&gt; you dont want to lose your cool in a game like this &gt;&gt; wait a minute &gt;&gt; theyll toss you out in a hurry &gt;&gt; no pun intended, i hope [ both laugh ] &gt;&gt; brooks, by the way, averaged 48 yards per carry every time he touched the football during the season we talked about his importance to this team as a specialteams player, but he also can carry the football great quickness &gt;&gt; less than 6 minutes left in the second quarter cincinnati leading, 177 second down and 6 for <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> dumps it out to brooks behind a block good cut, but not a first down he s stopped at the 33yard line <person player="don macek" race="UNK" position="C">don macek</person>, the center, 62, was the man out in that pulling out away from center and leading the block <person player="bo harris" race="white" position="LB">bo harris</person> and <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby kemp</person> made the tackle &gt;&gt; one of the ways you try and combat the <person player="bob rush" race="UNK" position="C">rush</person> is to use little screen plays, like this you let everybody penetrate and slip in behind them good play and good moves by brooks, but he finally ran into the bulk of the cincinnati defense, and they stopped him cincinnati had six sacks in that earlier game you obviously want to try and avoid that <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> has been able to avoid the sacks so far in this one &gt;&gt; it s a short 3 third and about 2 1/2 <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> going for it all to <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> intercepted by <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">breeden</person> at the 5yard line! <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> obviously thought that he could catch the bengals looking for a run on third and 3 but breeden, who was the nemesis when he intercepted a <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> pass, went 102 yards to tie an nfl record, a touchdown, in the regularseason game, was right there well get to this formation, the last play, in just a moment right now, cincinnati with the ball at the 6yard line they lead, 177 the interception by <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">breeden</person> the second turnover so it s 20, the bengals leading, in that department cross buck to johnson and the big fullback is out to the 13yard line let s go back to the play <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> was arguing, vehemently, after that last play let s see what happened <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> over the middle that s <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">glenn cameron</person> well, a little extra work there by <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">cameron</person> <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> said that he should have had a penalty &gt;&gt; well, here s the man he wanted to go to, number 18, <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">charlie joiner</person> <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> getting deep on this play but look at <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> get great position on him slipped right in in front of him and take the football away from him &gt;&gt; so, a couple of turnovers a fumble led to a key touchdown only a 12yard drive in the first quarter for cincinnati second down, 3 <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> met sharply and a good defensive surge by the chargers it was <person player="gary johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">gary johnson</person> and <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">louie kelcher</person>, the two tackles, pinching in on the running back from lsu &gt;&gt; down at ground level, you can feel what it feels like to lineup in that backfield a little misdirection they started to the right <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> coming back to the left but no one moved out of the way and they swarm over the top of him and big 99, <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">wilbur young</person>, getting a piece of him there these chargers do a better job of playing against the run, by far, than they do against the pass the bengals finding that out today &gt;&gt; third down and 3 with 3:40 left in the first half <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> open oh, and a fine play by woody lowe! <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> was open, and <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> just diving out and batting the ball away an excellent play by the former star at alabama &gt;&gt; anytime you get a fine receiver like <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> oneonone, you want to go to him and there he is oneonone on a linebacker that s the setup they wanted but woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> just said, "no, sir youre not gonna take that football" fine play by the linebacker, <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> &gt;&gt; well, the chargers, with 3:35 left in the half, will get another chance, before halftime, to cut into that bengal lead of 177 <person player="pat mcinally" race="UNK" position="P">mcinally</person> will kick from around his 3yard line &gt;&gt; chargers have 2, 4 now they move one up 4 men back and just a few up &gt;&gt; short kick to <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and he lets it bounce and takes a kind cincinnati roll to the 45yard line wlw, an nbc affiliate, channel 5 here in cincinnati we want to thank them for their hospitality san diego with the ball at the bengal 45yard line, trailing, 177 <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> to <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> well, there s that timing pass and never better illustrated you talked about that so many times in the past, merlin, how <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> throws to a spot the ball was there as soon as winslow, who turned almost too soon <person player="pat mcinally" race="UNK" position="P">mcinally</person> you wonder why it s tough to kick the ball in this weather? well let the punter himself tell us &gt;&gt; cold weather it s difficult to compress the ball and, you know, you just hope that you get real good contact and you can follow through youre just not gonna kick the ball as far when it s cold &gt;&gt; said it s just like kicking a rock &gt;&gt; second and 10 from the 45 fouts, a little fake flanker screen and then he goes to his tight end, <person player="eric sievers" race="white" position="TE">sievers</person> to the 32yard line that s a first down <person player="eric sievers" race="white" position="TE">eric sievers</person>, from maryland, a rookie picked in the fourth round that was a play that we have not seen before &gt;&gt; were going to see a lot of plays today we havent seen <person player="eric sievers" race="white" position="TE">eric sievers</person>, the numbertwo tight end and they were playing two tight ends in there today the cincinnati coaches very impressed with that <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> man and all the concentration on <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> allowed <person player="eric sievers" race="white" position="TE">sievers</person> to get open on that play it was a little fake to the outside, a little screen fake but <person player="eric sievers" race="white" position="TE">sievers</person> finding the open room in the defense and then just protecting that football with both arms to pick up the first down &gt;&gt; clock is running 2:38, 2:37 left in the half up the middle goes <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> and the big back from the university of california gets to the 26yard line before <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">bryan hicks</person> can make the tackle and that kind of hit just makes you wince you had to play in this kind of weather are you so numb that it doesnt hurt or can you express what it feels like? &gt;&gt; believe me it hurts down there the body gets cold, and your body is just not flexible in the cold and every one of those hits goes right to the core of the body with great pain &gt;&gt; in case youve just joined us, were at riverfront stadium in cincinnati 2 minutes left in the first half the bengals lead it, 177, over san diego two weeks hence, indoors at the silverdome in the super bowl &gt;&gt; little conference going on on the far sideline with <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person> and the coaches oh, you can see the effect of that cold, especially in this shaded area of the field, here <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> over there you can see the warmer in his hand see the chemical warmer that he s using to keep his hands there? only one penalty against the chargers so far in this ballgame and, certainly, theyre in good position here with the winds at their back like to take advantage of it and get it into the end zone &gt;&gt; ball at the 26yard line it s second down and 4 it was in this situation last week, late in the game, that buffalo, after a timeout, did not engineer the play in the necessary 30 seconds and perhaps lost the chance at a tying touchdown and the chargers a little confusion, but theyre apparently set to go and in time <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> running hard and close to a first down at the 22 it would be a first down &gt;&gt; the cincinnati bengals have great respect for the center of that san diego line, a very big line two great guards they say the best tandem of guards in the nfl watch them right here <person player="ed white" race="white" position="OG">ed white</person>, 67, out quickly to work on the linebacker, <person player="john cappelletti" race="white" position="RB">cappelletti</person> through to block, and big <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chuck muncie</person> just lowered his shoulder, went through the opening to pick up the first down that s the kind of play that the bengals dont want to see much of today &gt;&gt; don coryell, who was a ski patrol in the army in world war ii first down at the 22 clock running 1:20 left in the half <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> could be intercepted! and it is! that s <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">bobby kemp</person>, who takes it out to the 18yard line! <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> threw right into two bengal defenders and <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> is down in the end zone &gt;&gt; <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> tried to get up to make that tackle and may have gotten himself injured on the play <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> appeared to gamble on <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> s ability to take that football away from the defender he could see that <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> was covered he threw the football in there, taking a chance that <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> could go up and outfight the defender watch <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> now kemp, number 26, has been mantoman with him almost all day and watch what happens when that ball is thrown it s simply underthrown <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> comes up, gets a hit right there, got his arm stretched out a little bit, and stayed on the turf he s still on the turf <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">kemp</person> makes the most of the interception finally tackled inside the 20 but they took the ball away from the chargers when the chargers were moving it &gt;&gt; and it seems that <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> not only threw into good coverage by kemp, but <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">bryan hicks</person> had <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> covered on the other side the third turnover by san diego second interception of <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> &gt;&gt; two interceptions of fouts, and a fumble by brooks &gt;&gt; both deep in cincinnati territory <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">breeden</person> s interception was at the 6yard line, and this one in the end zone &gt;&gt; it would appear that he is not getting a full throwing motion on that ball, and that ball dropping short again, maybe the effects of the cold on the quarterback he s simply not able to get that clean throwing motion &gt;&gt; it figures, with a 10point lead, that <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> will play it safe, but that hasnt been his style through the normal weather of this season give to <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> wrapped up by "big hands" johnson, number 79 clock running less than a minute left in the first half so, although cincinnati leads, 177, it s taken two interceptions to stop san diego drives in this second quarter &gt;&gt; we saw the battle over on the lefthand side between <person player="anthony munoz" race="UNK" position="OT">anthony</person> muñoz and number 90, <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">john woodcock</person> watch <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">woodcock</person> stuff it in there and then <person player="gary johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">gary johnson</person>, right at the bottom of your screen, 79 now, that s dangerous, <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> standing up that way that ball is exposed you dont want to give them a chance at that football in your own territory &gt;&gt; 29 seconds could be the last play of the first half clock running &gt;&gt; ooh! &gt;&gt; johnson just protecting that football and <person player="louie kelcher" race="UNK" position="DT">louie kelcher</person> there to put the hit on him &gt;&gt; big <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis</person> stacked him up at the line &gt;&gt; that will be the end 10, 9 neither team trying to wait around theyre gonna head for the locker room three turnovers by cincinnati the difference in this first half one led to an easy touchdown and the crowd cold but loving it &gt;&gt; chargers had the choice in this half, the option of taking the wind they did what they have to do they took the football theyve got to get the ball and get it into the end zone to get back into this game &gt;&gt; san diego moved the ball well enough, especially in the second quarter but two interceptions one at the cincinnati 6, and the other in the bengal end zone stopped charger drives and they trail it, 177 cincinnati opportunistic, as they have been all season long &gt;&gt; dick, just sitting out here were open to the air in our booth here you can feel it getting colder that s a trend that will continue throughout the game it s going to be tougher and tougher to play football but i am really and truly impressed with the quality of the performance of these two teams under these terrible circumstances im really impressed with the way theyve both handled themselves &gt;&gt; absolutely they are sitting on an electrically heated bench, but you know that that isnt helping an awful lot and there are the big blowers that also provide some warmth the second half begins short kick at the 15, the 20 and up to the 30yard line go the san diego chargers, as it s return by <person player="doug beaudoin" race="white" position="DB">doug beaudoin</person>, former new england patriot the chargers take the field, offensively, with <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> at quarterback <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chuck muncie</person> fumbled once, but it was recovered by a teammate <person player="james brooks" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james brooks</person> his fumble, on a kickoff return, recovered at the 12, led to an easy cincinnati touchdown <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> and <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> outside <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">winslow</person> shaken up in the end zone at the end of the first half, and well have to check his condition he s in the lineup and okay shields, wilkerson, macek, white, and washington, a big forward wall from the 31yard line <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> hit in the backfield breaks one tackle and loses a yard <person player="wilson whitley" race="UNK" position="DT">wilson whitley</person> and <person player="eddie edwards" race="UNK" position="DE">eddie edwards</person> and it was edwards, on the back of muncie, who secured the tackle <person player="ken riley" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ken riley</person>, up from his corner position, also in on the tackle edwards, whitley, and browner, all numberone draft picks and all <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> <person player="bo harris" race="white" position="LB">bo harris</person>, leclair, the leading tackler, cameron, and <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person> <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> had one of the interceptions in the first half the veteran <person player="ken riley" race="nonwhite" position="DB">riley</person> at the other corner, with his career 52 interceptions <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">hicks</person> and kemp, two <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> safetymen second and 11 tripleleft formation only <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> in the backfield into the wind a man open and it s <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">charlie joiner</person> hit immediately at the 39yard line, short of the first down, by <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person>, number 57 williams had a great year for the bengals there is the thermometer the fahrenheit on the left and that one shows it s about 4 degrees above zero, but the official reports from the meteorologist say it s below zero, about 5 or 6 third down, call it 2, a short 2 <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> has the first down, i believe they spun him around at the 31 it appears he has the firstdown yardage <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person> down low to submarine on the tackle, along with <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">glenn cameron</person> &gt;&gt; number 77, <person player="sam claphan" race="UNK" position="OT">sam claphan</person>, the backup tackle, used as a tight end, as they come with three tight ends in the game <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person>, number 80, the man that s holding off the linebacker on the inside, <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">cameron</person> and, of course, big <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chuck muncie</person> using all of his strength theyre gonna measure it and he did, indeed, pick up the first down &gt;&gt; <person player="fred dean" race="nonwhite" position="DE">fred</person> silva the referee and for this officiating crew, an honor to be in the championship game, as it is an honor for us to be here in what is nbc s super bowl, our final telecast of the year and there are the men who have earned the privilege of working in the cold of cincinnati today and if they had a choice, even knowing the weather, you know theyd be here, as with all of us first down at the 41 <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> up the middle for 3 yards, to the 44yard line <person player="ross browner" race="nonwhite" position="DE">browner</person> and <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">cameron</person> made the tackle second down and 7 for san diego at their own 44 paul brown in the left corner of your screen, a hall of fame, the great coach great lakes, ohio state, cleveland browns, formed this franchise president and general manager of the bengals and former coach <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> had trouble holding the ball for a moment and that s <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> at the 45, 40 and out of bounds at the 38 and some fancy dancing by <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wes chandler</person> and a first down for san diego &gt;&gt; <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> s running ability one of his great strengths you saw it last week on a great punt return youll see it here again once he has that football, eludes <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">louis breeden</person>, number 34, manages to keep his feet, pick up about an extra 8 or 10 yards after he caught that pass &gt;&gt; now watch <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">breeden</person> on the replay he misses the tackle here but doesnt quit on the play hell still come back and youll see 34 in on the tackle well, we didnt quite see the end of the play, but he got a piece of the action first down, san diego <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> fumbles! and i believe the bengals have it! yes! four turnovers go to cincinnati and the bengals, as they have been all year long they dont give it up very often, and, yet, when it s on the ground, they get more than their share <person player="reggie williams" race="nonwhite" position="LB">reggie williams</person>, standing far right of your picture, makes the hit &gt;&gt; watch williams, now, just stepping inside of the block and he puts his shoulder right into the football that s the straightup running style that we mentioned of muncies, and it s gotten him in trouble again, as the ball bounces away cincinnati has it, first and 10 &gt;&gt; from their own 40yard line <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> had a good first half gives to <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> short yardage not much there <person player="linden king" race="UNK" position="LB">linden king</person> made the tackle it s interesting that the bengals, this year, playing against a fourman line, defensively, were 70 and they beat some good teams in the process the jets, they beat pittsburgh a couple of times, and others &gt;&gt; they beat los angeles, beat the chargers all fourman teams there they are there are the teams they defeated, all fourmanline defenses and well talk about the reasons for that in a moment &gt;&gt; second down and 8 <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> this is what he s done well all year and a first down at the 47yard line of san diego! &gt;&gt; quarterback mobility is such an important thing on that interception, the last one that <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> threw, he had a chance to run, didnt run <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> wont hesitate he sees the opening, hell take it gets away beautifully here gets downfield, picks up the first down takes what could have been a broken play, a bad play, a loss, and turns it into a big gainer &gt;&gt; first down at the san diego 47 the bengals lead, 177 little over 4 minutes have been played in the third quarter and he s gonna do it again 45 and down at the 42 and <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> didnt like the way <person player="linden king" race="UNK" position="LB">king</person> came in [ crowd boos ] nor did the fans pickup of about 5 &gt;&gt; looks like he may have bounced himself a little bit as he gets up off the ground i got to tell you that turf is awfully, awfully hard let s see what happened to <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> on that play again, quick recognition of the defense he does not see an open receiver hell pull it down right here, under pressure, and dip his way up into the secondary watch him slide here hell try to go under the defenders he takes a pretty good hit over the top three bodies &gt;&gt; gets your attention down the middle! what a catch by <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person>! oh, my! that is an outstanding catch if it s 80 degrees &gt;&gt; on any day <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> singled up, oneonone <person player="linden king" race="UNK" position="LB">linden king</person> he breaks away from him and he s in front of the secondary right on his fingertips he pulled it in what a great catch, just hanging on to the football 19 yards on the play &gt;&gt; another angle and the ball was actually by him when he caught it first down at the san diego 23 the bengals very impressive on almost every chance and <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> staying in the air and he gets away again! 20, 15! to the 9yard line! [ crowd cheering ] listen to these fans [ cheering continues ] &gt;&gt; three big runs by <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> on this drive again, spreading the defense he feels the pressure needs a little room takes advantage of it a smart offense takes exactly what the defense is giving them in this case, they were giving <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> room to run he did it very quickly &gt;&gt; full 10 yards to go for the touchdown first and goal here s curtis! and it s knocked away by <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">buchanon</person> at the last second two veterans, both from the same school san diego state and a key confrontation in the end zone, and <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">buchanon</person> there to make the defensive play &gt;&gt; <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person> had 5 interceptions on the regular season they threw at him a lot they moved him from safety back to corner he seems to have played better there during the latter part of the year, but he makes a great play here, arriving just in time to take that touchdown away from <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">isaac curtis</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">buchanon</person> was the numberone draft pick, out of san diego state, by green bay in 72 don coryell was his coach <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">curtis</person> the numberone pick by cincinnati the next year second and 10 almost intercepted picked off on one hop by <person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike williams</person> for the first time, a charger defender put direct pressure on the quarterback, <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> &gt;&gt; been tough to get to <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> today, a credit to his offensive line muñoz, lapham, bush, montoya, wilson all doing a good job up front for the cincinnati bengals &gt;&gt; in contrast, san diego had 37 turnovers and theyre down 40 today third and 10, or third and goal from the 10 <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person>, the second tight end, is in there plenty of time and finally throws it away <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> was the closest friendly jersey to the ball so, <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">jim breech</person> comes in to try the field goal for cincinnati <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> kicked one for the opening points of the game &gt;&gt; san diego chargers obviously pleased to avoid a touchdown here, down 177 theyd like to see if they cant get in and block this field goal it was a blocked field goal last week that really ignited them in the second half of that game against the miami dolphins &gt;&gt; they actually wound up with two one by <person player="leroy jones" race="UNK" position="DE">leroy jones</person> and one by <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> this will be about a 28yard attempt oh, a fake! and it s going to work! kreider, touchdown! &gt;&gt; i believe weve got a flag down &gt;&gt; if it s against cincinnati, it would nullify a touchdown and be the first penalty of the game against the bengals and they are going to call it back so, those cheers become moans and groans here in cincinnati &gt;&gt; what a smart coaching play a very smart call from the bengals sideline they elected to take advantage of the frustration now watch the play, a designed play it s not just a bad snap theyre up quickly and i think there s an opportunity to toss that football, if <person player="steve kreider" race="UNK" position="WR">kreider</person> was pressed but he went right into the end zone with it &gt;&gt; number 52 holding fourth down &gt;&gt; a holding call against the bengals &gt;&gt; and that s <person player="tom dinkel" race="UNK" position="LB">tom dinkel</person>, number 52, reserve linebacker, that they called the penalty on you see him right in the middle of the huddle there you may have wondered why there was so much why it was so open on the lefthand side number 52 is the up back over there, and he s the man who is responsible for pinning in the contain man on that defense &gt;&gt; now it s a much tougher fieldgoal try this will be 38 yards he does have the wind at his back and he does kick it and right down the middle <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">jim breech</person> 56", less than 160 pounds it s interesting chris bahr was the bengal kicker he went to oakland, was using <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> s house <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> came to cincinnati they just traded homes brooks at the 20 30 flags are down brooks, 40 all the way to midfield, but it s gonna be called back because of a holding penalty so, the bengals lost a touchdown and now a little extracurricular on a holding penalty, and the chargers lose a long return <person player="jim laslavic" race="white" position="LB">jim laslavic</person>, 54, apparently was the culprit all the way back to the 24 &gt;&gt; on the runback, number 54 holding &gt;&gt; so, instead of starting at the 50yard line, san diego will begin at its 24, trailing, 207 well see how important the switch from a possible 7 to the 3point field goal is as this game develops <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> back to the air almost fumbled the ball he did fumble and had to fall on it tried to pumpfake and, in this cold weather, almost threw the ball right out of his own hand &gt;&gt; dick, weve talked about the fact that that football changes in characteristic it simply gets harder the leather itself contracts in the cold, and instead of having that grainy surface that has a little give to it, it s a hard, slick surface <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> trying to grip the football back there, looking to his receivers the ball just slipped out of his hands he had to dive on it &gt;&gt; second down, 15 57yearold don coryell, a native of seattle, <person player="russ washington" race="UNK" position="OT">washington</person> he was a university of <person player="russ washington" race="UNK" position="OT">washington</person> defensive back down to the final seconds they just beat the 30second clock <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> down the middle incomplete almost intercepted through <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> s hands and deflected to <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">kemp</person> <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">bryan hicks</person>, 27, the defender <person player="bobby kemp" race="UNK" position="DB">kemp</person> when he joined that defensive secondary, merlin, that really was the final mortar he started about the third or fourth game, and forrest gregg said, "that s when we really got tough in the deep secondary" &gt;&gt; theyve had a couple of experienced corners riley, who s been around a long, long while, and <person player="louis breeden" race="UNK" position="DB">breeden</person> they needed the strength in that safety position he certainly has provided it they got a lineman at linebacker &gt;&gt; edwards and he comes in on a blitz third and 15 and they throw it up almost intercepted <person player="dwight scales" race="nonwhite" position="WR">scales</person> the intended receiver griffin, ray, <person player="archie griffin" race="UNK" position="RB">archie</person> s brother, the defender and theyre on their feet in cincinnati [ crowd cheering ] &gt;&gt; five defensive linemen, and they jumped around at the last second <person player="eddie edwards" race="UNK" position="DE">eddie edwards</person>, number 73, up at the middlelinebacker position fouts, feeling the pressure of that blitz, threw the ball with a hope and a prayer, but it was well over the head of <person player="dwight scales" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dwight scales</person>, number 87 the chargers have not been able to move the ball here in the second half, into the wind theyre gonna have to kick it away &gt;&gt; <person player="george roberts" race="white" position="P">roberts</person> boy, tough to handle that snap and a very short kick gets a good bounce across the 40 and to the 46yard line 49yard line of cincinnati cincinnati s ball apparently, a timeout here &gt;&gt; there are always a few nuts in the stands taking off their shirts, but some of the people i was concerned about, dick, were the san diego fans i dont feel that some of them would know how cold it is on the field today &gt;&gt; now, there are the guys i want to talk about our cameramen today now, the players have hand warmers and heated benches and theyre able to move around our cameramen are standing in position, shooting these great pictures today weve got to take our hats off it s cold for everyone, but theyre really winning the nanook of the north award for their great effort and we thank them <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> hit from behind and still gets the pass away! and <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> is to the san diego 33yard line! &gt;&gt; the nfl rule on quarterback says if you have them in your grasp and in your control, it s considered a sack on this particular play, he was not in the grasp that s woodcock, number 90, who hits him but he just flipped the ball on the way down, knew where the receiver was and <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> did the rest of it he s had a fantastic game, dick &gt;&gt; and great year ross 71 catches comes back with four in the championship game <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> dumps it off to <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> for another gain and just as they were getting to anderson, and it must be tremendously frustrating for the charger defense just when they get to him, he completes a pass, and if they dont put on pressure, he runs and picks up valuable yardage on that last fieldgoal drive &gt;&gt; i was talking to bob trumpy, who lives here in cincinnati we were talking about the two quarterbacks who trained under bill walsh and, of course, <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> worked under him here, and then <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> worked under him out in san diego and it s interesting, because when walsh went to san diego, he took all of <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> training film out there to show or all of <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> s training film to show to <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person> &gt;&gt; yeah, <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> said that bill walsh, the coach of the 49ers "he was my teacher, but <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> was my model" flags down and i think it s against san diego wont matter <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">curtis</person> has it at the 17yard line &gt;&gt; dick, one of the san diego defensive linemen moved before the snap, was offsides if so, theyll mark the ball down where the ball was caught &gt;&gt; that s it 13 yards for cincinnati on the pass from <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> to <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">curtis</person> and the bengals are down in fieldgoal range again, already ahead, 207 &gt;&gt; i think that s the longest pass in the air that weve seen caught today, dick wellthrown by <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> let s watch the play couple of defenders moving, of course and you saw the penalty called good protection for <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> <person player="isaac curtis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">isaac curtis</person> just finding a little space too much room in front of <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person>, number 28, and he catches the football cleanly &gt;&gt; now <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> with those two big running backs <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> and johnson behind him and it s johnson to the 16yard line a gain of just 1 for the former ohio state star he scored 58 touchdowns with the buckeyes most ever in big ten history &gt;&gt; one of the chargers trying to protect his face from the cold, trying to get warmed up <person player="jack thompson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jack</person> pardee, on the righthand side of your screen, responsible for the defense of the chargers a man under a lot of pressure during the season, as his defense has not played well they have played better toward the tail end of the season, but theyre not getting as much as they would like to out of their performance today &gt;&gt; 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter bengals lead, 207 ross again woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> made the tackle at the 11yard line and a fumble and san diego has the ball the chargers <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person> picks up the fumble by <person player="dan ross" race="white" position="TE">dan ross</person> the first mistake made by the bengals today &gt;&gt; first turnover in two championship games for the bengals it certainly could be a costly one, had they been able to take that in for the 7 &gt;&gt; even the 3, merlin &gt;&gt; or even a 3 could have iced the cake &gt;&gt; more than two touchdowns on a 3 &gt;&gt; watch the play here stripped from behind number 51, woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> dropped right into the lap of <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person> &gt;&gt; don coryell his san diego chargers mistakes have led to cincinnati s lead, 207, and now they have a fumble recovery <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> down the middle to <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> and he s got him at the 40 so, that was, by far, the best throw of <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> today and, again, when he throws over the middle, he seems to be a different passer &gt;&gt; let s look quickly at the fumble that allowed san diego to get the ball &gt;&gt; watch woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> reach in from the back side with his right hand the ball, now, will pop loose and it goes right into the hands of <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person> buchanon, realizing he has the football, is up quickly makes a few yards before he s pulled down <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> coming off the bench hands are warm went instantly on the pass good job &gt;&gt; both wide receivers to the right <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> and <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> in motion from the 39 throw to <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and he steps out of bounds around the 47 firstdown play good for around 7 yards, as we pause, briefly, from cincinnati for a station identification this is the nbc television network it is tough to say the words the old jaw gets in a locked position in fact, bryant gumbel you should have seen him in rehearsal he tried to say "memorable" and he took about 10 runs at it and realized were only gonna have to do twosyllable words today little reverse and he s got some blockers brooks, 50 and he s to the cincinnati 44yard line and that is a first down for the chargers <person player="glenn cameron" race="white" position="LB">glenn cameron</person>, number 50, finally made the tackle &gt;&gt; the old statue play brought it out, dusted it off brooks takes a couple of steps over <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> fakes the pass, hands it off to brooks the <person player="wilbur young" race="nonwhite" position="DE">young</person> man from auburn accelerates quickly gets a good gain out of it weve seen a couple of reverses today both have worked, but not for big yardage &gt;&gt; clock running down 3 minutes left in the third quarter cincinnati 20, san diego 7 little draw to <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> 40 and he s whacked at the 35yard line you know, merlin, one of the things that strikes me once a player gets a reputation of being a fumbler, he takes much more punishment from the other tacklers, cause everyone thinks, when theyre tackling, theyre gonna jar the ball free <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> really takes some vicious licks &gt;&gt; well, certainly, when you start thinking about going after that football, putting your helmet or your shoulder pad to the ball, you can cause more fumbles and, certainly, looking at <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> on film, seeing him cough the ball up for those hard hits, all the defensive players that go up against him have to be thinking about that before and during the game &gt;&gt; second and 1 <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> again first down and more and he almost got outside for a touchdown he s to the 25yard line and another first down that s 10 more yards for <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> he has fumbled twice today, one recovered by the bengals &gt;&gt; talking about the fact that he has coughed the football up, and some of you might ask, "well, why does don coryell keep him in the game?" they keep him in the game because of this <person player="chuck muncie" race="nonwhite" position="RB">muncie</person> is one of the great running backs in nfl football, a man with tremendous size, great speed, and a big heart hell run until he hurts himself &gt;&gt; first down at the 25 with 1:40 left in this third quarter brooks great penetration by williams and then williams made the tackle and brooks fighting just to get back to the line of scrimmage boy, 57, williams a big play for the bengals &gt;&gt; he s had a lot of big plays during this season he s their blitzing linebacker very big in the sacking department he had a fine year chargers being a little tricky bring <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> in motion he stopped about right behind the center and went back outside to become a blocker but the bengal defense was not fooled and <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> is faced with a second and 10 &gt;&gt; four straight running plays for fouts, but he s in a pass situation second and 10 and stays on the ground and he doesnt fool the bengals brooks gets only a yard and there are 50 seconds left in this third quarter <person player="ross browner" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ross browner</person> was the first man to make the hit those look comfortable, dont they? &gt;&gt; i wonder if they have any in my size [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; those look your size &gt;&gt; they certainly do crowd obviously trying to stay warm, as they get on to the shady side of it those in the sun still enjoying a little bit more heat but it is cold anywhere you are in this stadium today &gt;&gt; two running plays, both stopped for no gain third and 10 <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> left, <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> to the right and, <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> tripping over his own blocker, is downed back at the 31 and that may well have taken san diego out of fieldgoal range now there s 10 seconds left, and the clock stopped because of the sack now, the chargers would like for the quarter to end, where at least their kicker would have the wind advantage &gt;&gt; not only do your hands get cold, your feet get cold <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> hooking the back heel, it appeared, of his off guard that would be <person player="doug wilkerson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">wilkerson</person> and he actually dropped that football and had to scoop it up &gt;&gt; and despite the fact weve lost equipment due to the cold today, you wouldnt notice it a terrific job by our technical crew a long fieldgoal try of 50 yards by <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> and it isnt even close and, so, cincinnati will take over in reasonably good field position <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> has been able to kick well <person player="rolf benirschke" race="white" position="K">benirschke</person> has not &gt;&gt; lots of pressure on everyone you see the cameraman on the left the wind whipping in his part of the stadium got to be freezing cold up there 6 degrees now again, the 59degree windchill factor ooh! gusting to 40 miles an hour you can feel that wind it goes right on through you &gt;&gt; cincinnati takes over, after the missed field goal, at the 32yard line &gt;&gt; draw &gt;&gt; <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> clutching that football out to the 35yard line horn, kelcher, and company on the tackle &gt;&gt; dick, it s no wonder that some of the bengals have been able to handle this cold better than the chargers having had a chance to practice in it, intermittently, during the latter part of the season and many of them, for many years in the past, they have had to learn how to handle the cold and you have to make adjustments you have to throw the ball a bit differently you have to understand that a lot of that is concentration if youve been through it a number of times, it s easier for you &gt;&gt; that s a point welltaken, that youre not thinking so much about the weather because at least youve gone through the experience you dont like it any more <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> fumbled, but he recovers it and what a kind bounce for cincinnati that ball hit the frozen turf and kangarooed right back into <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> s mitts &gt;&gt; <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> doing exactly what <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">fouts</person> has done as he and his receivers came off with warm hands, he goes deep instantly, gets the first pass in good pass right there and the ball did, indeed, come up to him like a yoyo &gt;&gt; <person player="cris collinsworth" race="UNK" position="WR">collinsworth</person> on his way to warmer climes the pro bowl out in hawaii as a rookie receiver <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> way out to the right side both wide receivers to the left from the charger 49 it s johnson flag down, as the bengals ran out of pass formation someone lost part of his shoulder pad, it appears &gt;&gt; a holding call against the san diego chargers will march the ball back 10 yards &gt;&gt; against cincinnati you wonder why the hole was so large somebody just tackled one of the defensive linemen in there &gt;&gt; offense, number 65 holding first down &gt;&gt; it s interesting in games that involve physical contact im thinking of hockey and football as two examples, and even the nba or college basketball when you get down to the final game, there are less penalties called and the players know that they know that the officials are only gonna call the clearcut fouls and the smart player recognizes that and uses it to his advantage first down and 20 from the cincinnati 41 and here comes <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> chased by <person player="leroy jones" race="UNK" position="DE">leroy jones</person> and down he goes at the 45 boy, he got hit in a sandwich and gets up again gain of 5 woop little woozy <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> being helped to his feet by his teammates he took quite a pop, as two men hit him simultaneously and im not sure he has all his faculties &gt;&gt; no, he s out on his feet one of the dangers of a running quarterback is that he then becomes a running back he does not have the protection that s afforded to a quarterback you wonder why he s woozy? he really took a shot there are the stats comparing the two quarterbacks on the day not that different in number in fact, almost identical, except for the interceptions &gt;&gt; <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> being attended to and will be replaced by a man who was born in american samoa, which conjures up thoughts of palm trees and zephyr breezes, 80, 90degree temperatures <person player="jack thompson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jack thompson</person>, who played his football at <person player="russ washington" race="UNK" position="OT">washington</person> state, has taken over second and 15 at his 45 and he gives to <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person>, who cracks his way for 8 yards to the 47 of san diego let s go back to see the play on which <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> was injured &gt;&gt; dangers, again, of running the football apparent on this play <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> has had big plays running the ball all day nobody open dives up through, finds some room to run watch him sandwiched right at the end of this play he drops to the ground and takes a shot right there to the head he thinks he can get up starts out and literally almost dropped back to the ground &gt;&gt; three wide receivers in for thompson on third down and 7 and that s johnson a great catch and a first down! to the 31yard line! that s a remarkable catch under the weather conditions every play is, i guess you can repeat yourself the rest of the way and here comes <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> back in to a standing ovation! [ crowd cheering ] &gt;&gt; ironic, perhaps, that thompson would make that appearance, because at the beginning of the year, many people said, "this is our numberone quarterback" <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> was fighting for the starting job thompson started a couple of games and it was his injury that allowed kenny to get back, claim the starting job, and then become the mvp of the nfl &gt;&gt; it s storybook stuff <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> was booed off the field in the opening game, when he fell behind 210 to seattle johnson gets the carry and good yardage on first down to the san diego 26 he was yanked out of the game in the first half against seattle, down 210, and thompson was hurt <person player="turk schonert" race="white" position="QB">turk schonert</person>, the thirdstring quarterback, from stanford, engineered a comefrombehind 2721 bengal lead and then forrest gregg made the biggest decision of the cincinnati year he had to decide, in game 2, what quarterback to start and <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> convinced him, as the veteran, he should gregg went with his veteran, and here he is the nfl man of the year second down, call it 4 <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> bolts inside the 25, to the 23 and that looks as if it s going to be close enough for a measurement &gt;&gt; running in, again, behind muñoz and <person player="dave lapham" race="UNK" position="OG">lapham</person> on the lefthand side thompson returning to the headsets, where he provides some valuable duty and, certainly, an extremely capable quarterback to have on the sideline, but im sure hed a lot rather be starting the ballgames than being the numbertwo <person player="guy frazier" race="UNK" position="LB">guy</person> &gt;&gt; here comes the measurement while they do that, here s an idea of how the city of cincinnati and the stadium has prepared for these inordinately cold conditions the coldest day this date in the history of cincinnati they have several paramedic rescue units on hand extra blankets have been brought in from area hospitals two firstaid rooms for emergency treatment the buses the metropolitan buses are being used as warming rooms for fans pa announcements are being made to advise fans about frostbite there s a police scout car an ambulance is on standby area hospitals have been warned that they may have extra business so they have really done a good job preparing for emergencies third and inches <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person> <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> diving forward appeared he might have gotten enough for the first down, but going to be close and we may have a timeout for another measurement <person player="jim laslavic" race="white" position="LB">jim laslavic</person>, former penn state star same highschool team as cappelletti, and, of course, they both migrated to penn state &gt;&gt; looking at this game on paper coming in and without taking into account the weather, the three units that matched up well were the two offensive units and the cincinnati bengal defense the unit that did not appear to match up the san diego offense and that s really been the way it is today the two offenses are playing well, but the bengals have been able to overpower this charger defense &gt;&gt; here s the reason why <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> did not make the first down a tremendous hit by laslavic, number 54, and shaw, 44 &gt;&gt; oh great shot great shot picked him off right at the peak and dumped him back over &gt;&gt; <person player="pete shaw" race="nonwhite" position="DB">pete shaw</person>, who played his football at northwestern, where he had plenty of chances to make tackles &gt;&gt; theyre going for on fourth down not gonna take a chance at the field goal into the wind &gt;&gt; it s johnson this time and he s got a first down and more! to the 14yard line! and where did they run? right behind muñoz &gt;&gt; and they go right for the money big <person player="anthony munoz" race="UNK" position="OT">anthony</person> out there doing his job he s on woodcock, number 90 he gets help from the tight end, the doubleteam good block by number 40, <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> and then that bulldozer, number 46, <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person>, just flew through there &gt;&gt; and now the clock becomes more and more important less than 10 minutes left cincinnati trying to make it a twotouchdownplus lead current score is 207 johnson try the 10yard line did you see somebody i think it was muñoz again yes, it was muñoz he knocked <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">woodcock</person> 5, 7 yards off the line of scrimmage he is a ton 66" and 278 and muñoz has really trimmed down he was much heavier at usc &gt;&gt; i watched him in his college days got to watch him in practice a few days he had great agility and strength then, at 300plus pounds but he s even more brutal these days because he has great quickness, even greater quickness you saw him knock there he is right at the bottom of your picture knocked <person player="john woodcock" race="UNK" position="DT">woodcock</person> 4 or 5 yards off the line &gt;&gt; second down and 6 up the middle and inside the 10, maybe to the 8yard line goes johnson bring up third down and about 3 that offensive line of cincinnati has done a good job the entire day <person player="blair bush" race="white" position="C">blair bush</person>, the underrated center, <person player="dave lapham" race="UNK" position="OG">lapham</person> and montoya, the guards, muñoz and wilson, the tackles &gt;&gt; we talked, earlier, about their success against the fourman front one of the reasons they have been so successful <person player="blair bush" race="white" position="C">bush</person> is so quick from that center position, has the great ability to reach out and cut off those defensive tackles and also to be a great pickup man while the other four play manonman &gt;&gt; this is the 13th play of a timeconsuming drive of over 6 1/2 minutes <person player="charles alexander" race="UNK" position="RB">alexander</person> it appears he has the first down stopped right at the 5, inside the 5 going to be close i think he s got the first down, judging from where they put down the ball although, we may have a measurement &gt;&gt; watch <person player="fred dean" race="nonwhite" position="DE">fred</person> silva, the referee &gt;&gt; man in the black hat [ crowd cheering ] well, you know every one of these fans will go home, and today, tonight, tomorrow, and 20 years from now, they will tell the story of this bittercold day in cincinnati when the bengals played a very hot game &gt;&gt; what do they say? "cold hands, warm heart"? cold day, warm crowd theyre hot in cincinnati &gt;&gt; and theyve been a factor today, they way theyve spurred their favorite team on johnson and a touchdown now would all but seal the chargers fate they were able to stop cincinnati, the last drive, on a fumble by ross but, at this point, with 7:22 left, the bengals have clearly been the superior team today ross, <person player="ml harris" race="UNK" position="TE">ml harris</person>, and <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">don bass</person> three tight ends in for cincinnati <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> 63 yards rushing today and he s the man they like to go to inside the 5 <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> going to throw touchdown, <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">don bass</person>! and now they know <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">don bass</person> did not catch a pass all year he recovered a fumble, that brooks fumble at the 12yard line, that led to an easy touchdown in the first half and his first catch this year is for 6 points &gt;&gt; beautiful throw right there over the outstretched hands of <person player="willie buchanon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">willie buchanon</person>, number 28 <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bass</person> is celebrating &gt;&gt; try for a point by <person player="jim breech" race="white" position="K">breech</person> and he is dead center again the bengals 277 on <person player="don bass" race="nonwhite" position="TE">don bass</person> 3yard touchdown catch what a drive 8:04 the bengals chewed up 68 yards in 15 plays that was right out of gregg s playbook again, it s <person player="doug beaudoin" race="white" position="DB">beaudoin</person> on the short kick across the 30, to the 34yard line while we have a moment, we want to thank two men with whom weve worked all year our director, ted nathanson, our producer, larry cirillo it s a professional joy to be able to spend each sunday with them paul brown, a man who knows how to win almost as if he s trying to choke back a smile, licking his lips he s ever so close to a trip to the super bowl he knows the meaning of a championship, as the cleveland browns champion coach fouts, desperation to <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and a fine grab at the 40yard line by <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> <person player="bryan hicks" race="UNK" position="DB">bryan hicks</person> saved a touchdown by hanging on to the floridian &gt;&gt; well, showing some of that explosion coming right off the bench and, again, having warmed up on the sideline, able to throw that kind of pass the receiver able to catch it he may try again to go deep while theyre still relatively warm, before that cold can get to them and numb the hands &gt;&gt; <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> s really had a fine day, hasnt he?

[ crowd cheering ] i was searching through some notes at the start of the year, and in reno, the wagers at the start of the year said the odds on cincinnati winning the super bowl were 60to1 san diego was the preseason favorites 4to1 the bengals are going to be there for the chance at it and johnson rips and he fumbles and that s a rarity and recovers it or someone helped him out nope he got it himself 2 minutes to go at riverfront stadium and these fans, who have weathered a brutally cold day to cheer their bengals, have been rewarded cincinnati 27, san diego 7 the bengals have the ball at the 10yard line a cincinnati team that won only four games in 78 two years ago, they won only four games last year, won 6 and lost 10 and then, suddenly, just reversed it all, finished with the best record in the afc, 124 beat buffalo last week and apparently have won the big one, the championship of the afc, today on their way to the super bowl in the silverdome and, as <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> told me, "the nice thing," he said before the game, "whether san diego wins or whether we win, you know in the super bowl, youre gonna get at least 35 to 40 passes" &gt;&gt; [ chuckles ] well, and if the san francisco 49ers get there, you might see three times that many &gt;&gt; i want to ask you, when we get a moment were gonna have a timeout here, apparently i want to ask you how cincinnati, in your eyes, matches up against san francisco or matches up against dallas no, theyre not going to call time id like to remind fans, if they have forgotten, san francisco and cincinnati played during the course of the regular season and played here and the score of that game was the 49ers 21, the bengals 3 1:50 to go boy, now it is really cold on that side of the field &gt;&gt; and it s starting to sink in over there theyre not only feeling the cold, theyre feeling the pain of that score on the scoreboard &gt;&gt; <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> the clock is running, and he s gonna let it run all the way down to 2 or 3 seconds on the 30second clock before he makes a play 1:24 on the game clock <person player="pete johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pete johnson</person> hugging the football and tackled immediately at the 16yard line timeout called by the chargers to stop the clock gene klein, owner of the san diego chargers, survived a heart attack the middle of 1981 you knew that recognized the problems coming into this kind of climate but he s a great sportsman and gentleman, and hed be the first one in that cincinnati locker room to congratulate the bengals &gt;&gt;

and what a year for that man, <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">ken anderson</person> he s been maligned in this city theyve booed him paul brown he s been there before he s able to hold his emotions perhaps better than it s something about that first time, whether it s your first love or your first championship you never really forget that one and for forrest gregg and for the cincinnati bengal fans, this is their first, and theyre in love with this ball club &gt;&gt; well, they certainly have regenerated the enthusiasm and the interest of this town in football this place is going crazy &gt;&gt; johnson hit at the 21yard line and the clock runs 1:04, 1:03 the chargers cannot stop it now theyll get the ball, but that will be about all congratulations to that man all his honors and intelligence, physical talent he outpassed the opponents, he outran all the quarterbacks in this league, and, at the age of 32, has enjoyed his finest moment in the meantime, just for fun, he earned his law degree that s a busy man and paul brown &gt;&gt;

the final seconds in cincinnati <person player="pat mcinally" race="UNK" position="P">mcinally</person> gets his kick away when it comes down, the bengals are champions! and forrest gregg survived a bitter firing in cleveland, stayed out of football, went to the canadian league, was regarded by some of his players as too tough but you listen to every bengal, and they say, "the difference is that man, our coach" he survived two cancer operations and the bengal stripes they really earned them, didnt they? &gt;&gt; they earned their stripes and theyve earned their victory today, their trip to the super bowl good football on an incredibly bad football day but it was the bengals who wanted it the most, who were able to take advantage of some miscues by the san diego chargers some costly interceptions by <person player="dan fouts" race="white" position="QB">dan fouts</person> able to grind it away <person player="ken anderson" race="white" position="QB">anderson</person> able to throw the ball effectively it was a bengal day &gt;&gt;
