the division title since landing that s the second longest current streak the browns have the only one that as long as you can see the crowd is all revved up they moved here from the silver dome in 2002 have yet to post a playoff game as <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> gets ready to kick off for green bay packers won the toss elected to prefer <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre roberts</person> would run back man he s returned two punts for touchdowns this season runs back the kicks and the punch towels twirling at ford field <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> awaiting his turn and off we go the final game of the regular season and it will begin with a touch back let s take a look at the lions starters <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> georgia tech center south dakota state <person player="golden

player="larry warford" race="UNK" position="OG">larry warford</person> kentucky pro robinson south carolina robinson as michelle mentioned a late start youve got two rookies on the defensive front and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> lines up in the shotgun well talk about his finger which was injured three weeks ago a bit of addiction and they start on the ground and they start with zack center who had a nice first half last week against dallas so take a look at <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> eighth year could be his best in a way 22 touchdowns and nine interceptions completing about twothirds of his passes and he will hit the 4,000 mark again and before the night is done hell be the fastest ever to get to 30,000 from yards sideline and incomplete and first let s take a look at that finger and what he has to do to even get a grip on the ball yeah he s got that little mini brace on the thing and basically it s his top knuckle that he has to keep straight so there s just a little piece of plastic underneath there that keeps that straight and and sort of a weird twist he doesnt put that finger on the laces of the football it s a very unusual grip ive really not seen that grip before but i think it may play to his advantage just because that doesnt have to be raised up on that lace one thing it makes him do is take almost every snap from shotgun is left an incomplete beverage is good on <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> if ever there the linebacker <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> going over to take him out of the play and it s fourth down but what a play by <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> to open this game this is one of the most elusive wide receivers in the game and <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> he gets locked right on him and makes the play and stops him short of the first down bigtime play there by <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> so a fast three and out <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">sam martin</person> and the benefactors in the league he sends a beauty down to the 15yard line mica high goes to his knee and runs it back 10 yards to the 25yard line as we take a look at the green bay offense <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> cal tom <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> leland stanford junior university <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> kansas state <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> fresno state drawn while <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">allison</person> illinois jerk ooh south carolina <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> the university of colorado boulder wayne taylor oklahoma state cory lindsley bistate tj <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane</person> eastern michigan <person player="brian price" race="nonwhite" position="DT">brian</person> belaga iowa good offensive front <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">lang</person> will be going to the pro bowl lot to talk about with this team with <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> a wide receiver by trade that s why he wears number 88 coming back halfway through the year he s done a great job and they give it to him and he finds a little bit of a crease and he s able to move forward out to the 30 so <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> about you know six or seven weeks ago everybody s talking about what s wrong with <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> what s wrong he s back in the mvp conversation clearly 36 touchdowns seven interceptions if you closed your eyes and put all of his numbers together you go that s an mvp yeah if you close your eyes and put his numbers together for the last five games and say he s the greatest player but this time it has been remarkable that he s done second down and six and you spread the ball around levante <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> in the backfield and heat goes out to a wing on the right rogers as it does so brilliantly and so often and has for years extends the play that turns it into a nice little game after the 34yard line davon taylor chased him and weve seen aaron of course do that for most of the 12 years he s been in the league certainly the 9 as a starter <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> does this better than anybody just so athletic the average is over 3 seconds per throw which is an eternity in the national football league and that time because he did not slide feet first he gets the full advantage of this slide forward here and almost picked up that first down and nobody touched him he s a yard shy from the 34 third and 1 theyre gonna fall back with caskey in the game and also <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers bulk on the left side the middle is the fullback ehrenreich caste playing the role that john coon filled so brilliantly four years first half a green bay i dont know that either one of these guys over here are particularly known for their run blocking but this is pretty impressive at any time one of the things i like about mike mccarthy s offense is they can spread you out but they can also play a little power football bringing <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> back in there in the backfield aaron rip kowski so in that short yardage situation they able to just plow through there for the big first down they leave rakowski into flank rodgers give it to him again punching forward to the 49 let s take a look at the detroit defense devon taylor south carolina asian on robinson alabama popping up organs ekadasi you are you yeah theyre <person player="deandre levy" race="nonwhite" position="LB">levy</person> wisconsin tiger whitehead temple josh bazar burn place late mississippi state <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon</person> austin illinois hello burke when you and them lobos navin <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> utah state whitehead their leading tackler another linebacker second down and five playaction under pressure and that was <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> former patriot he blitzing through and knock him down to the sack come off right off this side over here it comes in and riff kowski is going to end up missing this block beautifully done you get a guy that came out of the new england patriot organization and of course mr quinn knew all about him drafted in the second round and they knew he would be a perfect fit here for exactly how terrell often likes to play <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> five years in the league that is his first career cent <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> and that <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person>er in the vacuum in the block look who s had a good six weeks even hurt and has come back he s made a difference couldnt hold this one then fourth down yeah im not sure that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> was even throwing it he kind of ended up with two guys on the same level and it looked to me like maybe he was trying to get it in behind there <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo allison</person> but it was cooked it deflected it you could see him grab his helmet i think that s exactly what he was doing they could shun to punt <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roberts</person> going for the fair catch and reel has been at the 14 yard line and 24 left opening quarter in detroit no score sunday night football being brought to you by lexus who wishes you happy holidays by microsoft surface the official tablet of the nfl by geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance and while horizon join a better network because better new year to you all last night at the top in downtown troi from the 13 yard line lions begin their second drive zack center in the backfield <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> in the piston to the outside and that is caught by the tight end <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">eric ebron</person> whereas now let s take a look at the green bay defense the truck ariana breathless cue tornadoes like dale s isle julia s purpose north carolina <person player="jake ryan" race="white" position="LB">jake ryan</person> michigan <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> like bill south carolina <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> us see the bear is gone you <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> georgia to oakland dicks the university of alabama went wrong with miami ohio get married found oh arizona state what dex is on his way to the provo four yard game to the 30 <person player="zach zenner" race="white" position="RB">zach zenner</person> the only man in the history of the national football league whose initials are zz that would figure better than that how about gigi <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">graham glasgow</person> here look at the way he snaps his football back in the day when youre playing in the street you did some of that he just flipped it back but that s what makes him comfortable and it kind of works now because stanford has to work out the shotgun so he just flips it back there use the backup center for <person player="travis swanson" race="white" position="C">travis</person> wants new bills snap in the boss like to get a new football and youre in the street you dont want to scuff it that s exactly right turn it on the point exactly right you just snap it up there like that and i guess you know if it starts raining or something and bad through stanford said it that did rain one game and he had to kind of change it do a little more traditional but that s what makes it comfortable that s what andy rethought was last week he used to get a football as a present and it was all they could do to make it look pristine at least for a couple of weeks now theyre all void footballs all start offense number 65 drug penalty well speaking of glass guys youre on bogert tells us he s the man well he is the backup <person player="travis swanson" race="white" position="C">travis</person> watson who was playing very well out with a concussion there was a few sort of flying rumors out there that <person player="travis swanson" race="white" position="C">swanson</person> might be ready to go this week you dont know how much of that was there s <person player="travis swanson" race="white" position="C">swanson</person> you know how much of that is a view detroit trying to throw off green bay a little gamesmanship going on but third down from the 27 very one staff word in the pocket and three down the sidelines is <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden</person> tape but they cant wheel it in with one hand so it s for town oh my goodness that s where the detroit lions killed them down this right side and all season long when you look at the numbers for the green bay packers teams have absolutely scorched them at all levels down the right side and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> just cant miss that one that was a touchdown and the score she very often has been <person player="damarious randall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">damarious randall</person> that time he got lucky the second part of the game here mike to hide a flag is down back at the 37 yard line for the moment height takes it to midfield more than likely coming back yeah look like a block and during the return illegal block in the back receiving team number 23 10yard penalty green bay keeps the ball first on motown dont miss a moment of tonight s game with the nbc sports app you can watch the game anywhere live on your laptop tablet and connected tvs will work downtown the fist course this is the hometown of the great joe lewis back to ford field from the 27 yard line <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> is the running back <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> who slips and falls picks up about yards of <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> had knee surgery last year remember he got hurt in preseason missing entire year came back he got off to an okay start but he has been redhot over the last month and a half no question about it over the last five games nobody has more receiving yards or touchdowns in <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> 528 yards and five touchdowns and he is a huge reason why they have been so hot during the streak <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> has now caught 9dt the season second and the deuce <person player="cole wick" race="white" position="TE">cole</person> opens for ripping ski in the fullback not to the 50 yard line so reminiscent of the types of things that john coon did for so many years out of the green bay backfield well we are seeing some tremendous blocking inside here i think that s going against the rookie a jean robinson but that double team right up to the linebacker position and tiger whitehead never could escape it so far we have seen some power football tonight handing the ball to aaron rip kowski more than time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> in fact they have two fullbacks that time and that said the jo carriage the rookie out of michigan also in the back here weve got a false start here on the right side hilti still perform bryan bellanca an offensive line has really done a great job this year and belaga the number one pick back in 2010 and bryan blog has probably had his best season so far and as a matter of fact i think you can say this is the best pass blocking offensive line in football malaka <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> the other two arent bad either but those are the standard bearers at their position this is a team that shockingly with josh sitting out the door just before the season i let him go to chicago and that pass is incomplete intended for <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> everybody looks for a flag at least on the green base i dont get one <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> so you go back the first nine games 22 touchdowns seven picks good numbers let me see what s wrong with him last six games 14 touchdowns no interceptions well and i think the thing that s been the most impressive of all is most quarterbacks see their quarterback rating go down by 33 points under pressure <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> during the streak his has gone up under pressure nobody ever does that second down and 15 so dangerous when he does that this pass incomplete though unconnected for the vontae animus was a guy who has dropped a lot of passes through the years but actually this year planned a heck of a lot better and comes into the game is their number two why that was sixty nine receptions third and fifteen theyll go without a huddle at least trying to have the huddle up again well this was really great protection but it was <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> with his ability to dance and move i think at a certain point the clock goes off and says okay ive got to get out of here but they did a nice job with jaron cooked there but he has sort of those ballet feet they can always get in great position to throw the football just missed that one dancing with the stars of his future third and 15 a dangerous pass intended for <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> over the middle of passes incomplete so rogers has started the game and uncharacteristic one out of five and dreamed a two punch of the second time let s take a look at this guy <person player="don carey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carey</person> haider who i think has really been one of the unsung heroes of this detroit lions team he leads them with eight sacks i dont think anybody could have named him at the beginning of the season ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> really has fallen off but only two sacks on the year because of a leg injury and it has been tighter getting it done jacob chums punt fair catch it at the 11 yard line left in the opening quarter no store in detroit preparing tomorrow a new celebrity apprentice meknes boss in town arnold ricky williamson <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">eric</person> dickerson among others a new celebrity apprentice premiering tomorrow right here on nbc third lions drive begins at the 11 yard line goes he s become a crowd favorite last week big first half i didnt see the ball very much in the second half at a south dakota state nice little doubleteam coming right down here but this believable he s a guy that s rushed for over 2,000 yards three straight years in college now i know it s south dakota state but over 2000 yards that that has to get your attention against anybody in the 26 yard line after a greater than 15 what s the one thing the lions have not had all year za1 in game 30 for a nineyard game by <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> came over from the bengals in the off season got off to a hot start but not much in the last few weeks well i talked about it a little bit earlier but that right side has been a real issue 0 to 9 yards at 126 essentially raiding 10 to 19 yards look at that 134 and 20plus a 118 rating those are way over like 30 40 50 points over the nfl average trying to defend the right side for the green bay packers control coach would know as enter it stopped at the line of scrimmage by day tone jones making it third down and one for the lions and for <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> you know this is one of those games dont you think that he just this is <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> against him no matter how you want to slice it and the idea of playing playoff games and this town means so much to him and this organization eighth year in the league third get the first down here thirty nine goes in i mean stanford came in muchheralded of course grew up in dallas went to school at georgia he was the number one pick and oh nine and he says some some really good years but he hasnt been surrounded with the best talent he s had obviously some really good guys like calvin <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> are retired last year but youre right this is it s to the point right now or it s hey when are you gonna do it when do you get over that hump what is the tan get over the hump yeah and what better than to have green bay packers in your house let s go get them this is our night and it s <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> taking you to the green bay territory to the 44 yard line first down working against <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius</person> gunnar well <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> he is probably as elusive a runner and route runner as there is in the game about 50% of the completions to him are at or behind the line of scrimmage he s essentially like a running back playing wide receiver get him the ball get out of the way let him make somebody miss 17 yard gain lions going nohuddle to center and he gets popped after a gain of two we go to michelle well this is the type of split that <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> is wearing under that glove it is designed to keep the fingers straight at all times because he cant bend it that that that knuckle that s right underneath the fingernail cannot be bent if this is going to heal properly so he s wearing it 24/7 he said itll come off in time for the super bowl so they make it on guys now there it is good look at what what it looks like on the field and of course as we mentioned before almost all snaps he takes out of shotgun or a pistol second and nine it s coming in the passes in complete peace the pressure the pressure was put on third down and nine now let s just take a look at that grip and you can see that the the bad finger if you will is it on the laces of the football and i dont know we asked them you know does it hurt you does it irritate you and he basically it s locked out but he cant really tell the difference he said can i feel it every time i throw the ball absolutely i can feel it it s just to touch thing you know youre just used to throwing up with one grip and now youve got to kind of improvise with that the nine three out of seven for 39 yards two and a half to go in the quarter and that is caught is able to make the catch <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> slammed into <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> as he released first down here gain of 17 julia s pepper is going to go out and back in against the new right tackle <person player="corey robinson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">corey robinson</person> and gives <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> a shot but as he s done all season long with those eight comefrombehind wins just hangs in there takes it tough spit out gets back to the huddle <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> was telling us there are times that he cant even talk when he gets back to doug <person player="corey robinson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">corey robinson</person> it s to the 23yard line theyre leading russia this year the lions would be <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">riddick</person> who s been hurt this last several games 357 yards there is that s his total hell probably wind up leading the team in rushing you think you know adrian peterson ran for what 296 in one game yeah and their leading rusher for the seasons going to be in about three and a half and <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> one of the best receiving backs out of the backfield that there is a national football league and little <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david</person> <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> only the wound a little bit better second seven on the sidelines it is go up and a flag goes down for the moment it is a completion take doing the toe dance their cape may have pushed off as he made the carrot off its number 15 to the opera indeed let s see usually can get away if you have just slightly bend your arm right get from the elbow but you give both hands in a push yeah that s a good call when ellen s out there saying it s hard enough over here on the right side makes it second and 17th : loves to call center to the 30yard line again if you missed some of the earlier action today the redskins could have in effect cemented a spot in the playoffs barring a tie in this game but they lost to the giant so each of these teams is in winner stays home next week against the giants and the loser goes to meet the seahawks in seattle 1315 to pick up some blockades and is able to sitters way down to the 20yard line to make it an easier field goal attempt which we will probably see as the first play of the second quarter so <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">prater</person> will come in to try to make it a three nothing game after we go to the break that s the end of the first quarter with the score green bay nothing detroit nothing and sunday night football resumes after these messages now michael swiss cows were at michele tafoya sunday night football wrapping up the regular season <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">matt prater</person> to try to break this scoreless tie on a 39 yard field goal attempt for guy who holds the nfl record 64 yards when he was a 2013 and the kick is no good so it remains scoreless good snap good old foot kick you can tell when it s spinning sideways he did not hit that the way he was trying to do it a guy that had a pretty terrific year this year but missed the big one there we can tell you that tonight s aerial coverage being brought to you by geico but those arent the ruins before those are the rooms i guess of the old silverdome in pontiac which was the mall of the lions for so many years and the site of a super bowl back in the 1981 season as green bay starts this drive from its own 29 yard line with repoussé key in the back field and rogers to throw that pass is incomplete intended for <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> so what did you do to the silver dog chris collinsworth played in that game that was bill walsh that was joe montana the first of their five victories snowy day remember i think the the buses broke down friend and then the 49ers had to walk to the stadium the last model so yeah i feel so horrible for him i really do but it really was one of those circumstances the president united states was coming in the motorcade slowed us all down we got there about an hour and a half before kickoff second down and ten that s a gain of eight they give it to ripped ascii third that so that was taken that shot on saturday theyve taken the roof down obviously and im not sure what theyre doing with that right now but inviting look right there and this is a ford field which has also hosted a super bowl we were here back in ojai when bill powers stealers eat mike holmgren see box 32 all kinds of action up front and we got flags stopping the play or some jumping <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> moved but berthe yeah that s <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> so youve had a penalty on each of their two tackles who both have great years but both penalize tonight to this point third down to seven well obviously with the crowd noise watch the way they do this they look in with their head then theyve got to come back and try and find the guy that theyre blocking theyre devon taylor and obviously the louder this crowd is the more difficult that process is but it s a few times now that weve seen mistakes by this green bay offense that has pushed them back third and seven crowd and full throw rogers is able to escape a first down <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> how in the world to get out of there zekiel answer came in and looked like he had him in developed and somehow rogers is able to sneak past them remember when you asked him last night something about how do you know people are coming do you just feel it and he basically said sometimes i surprise myself there is one of the most athletic pass rushers in the league ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> who flat out missed from the 43 off the play fake fires over goes to the tightend quick again and <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> takes it to the 32 yard line and what a difference <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> has made since he got healthy pick them up as a free agent this year yeah we said what s been different this year and during the win streak here and the very first words out of his mouth <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> you get a big lanky wide receiver that you can flank out that can put pressure on the middle of the field it opens up everything else you saw it there look for moran former tightly eight you in the lead first the green bay call the 33 it s something ripped ascii to the 20th they lost that he <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> after five games and lost <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> he was involved in an auto accident so theyve moved <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> in the backfield not tonight they go with ripped aus key just like theyve never the pole and everybody off the bench to play running back yeah they had a little problem with <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> last week in protections remember is a wideout you dont spend a lot of time blocking 250pound line back maybe <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> said just make sure im protected ill take care of the rest second and five the pass is caught on the outside by <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> and on the sideline he goes to the 14 yard line rogers the man who last year broke everybody s heart in this stadium and he caught the hail mary at the end of the game the game extended by a personal foul against detroit to win the game down there of a 14 im surprised that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> didnt hit one of the rafters in this building you threw that ball so high one of the more remarkable plays weve seen by <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> now three straight games against the lions he scored a touchdown 57 yards caught on a slant to the 8yard line that s <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite"

getting back up his broker get set to tell us in a moment holding defense number 26 five dr nadim automatic first that would be the safety don <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kerry</person> yeah and this is a good strategic move by the green bay packers they have basically taken aaron rip kowski and put him in the backfield for protection we saw some of those thing there those green dogs and read blitzes where the linebackers really in coverage and then he would come late and he would kind of run over time at gummer ii aint nobody running over aaron rif kowski so far green bay was seven runs so far if kowski has five of them for 43 yards first goal takes the ball to the 7yard line itll be second down and goal <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> talked about that interception streak that he has over the last half dozen games he s now thrown 215 consecutive passes since his last big longest

so quick with his feet on the other side and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> taking care of the rest and aaron rip cows keyes had a heck of an impact on this game so far he has two rushing touchdowns that s his first receiving touchdown the extra point by <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> is good so after the miss crater field goal we make those 71 yards eight plays three runs five passes at lead seven others sunday night football brought to you by bmw we only make one thing the ultimate driving machine

scoring a lot of points on offense but giving up 38 points per game and 421 yards and that fivegame winning streak heck of a lot better seventeen point six fourteen takeaways no giveaways and that really has been the key but you also have to remember that <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> was out three games during that fourgame losing streak <person

to step up in the opening head is up by seven the blitz through the middle staffer <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david</person> a step away from the and then with a flag

this pill this decline will result of the play third down the rookie center <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">glasgow</person> gonna get the cross blitz going here and then it s gonna be the center <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">glasgow</person> who is going to end up with the hole you see that a lot with the pittsburgh steelers and of course dom capers their defensive coordinator has some of those roots go all the way back to the steelers as well but that is that s a big play right there because <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake martinez</person> was out weeks 12 through 14 with an en francais to keep an eye on him to that that looked pretty good i understand working promises tablet on the sunny patch right now 3015 by tj george to get him out of a big hole secondyear guy at a notre dame there s six round pick couple of years ago 35 yards on the third and 15 the notre dame flash there he is again working down then take an advantage we talked about it in the open the cornerbacks of the green bay packers theyre young theyve given up a lot of plays they have very good safeties if youre gonna tag green bay you go after the corners that s exactly what stanford s doing he missed one hit that way to work on robins on that play first down the jugular take gets into the 27yard line mean of about six second down yeah and that s what they want to do with <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> right 506 yards of yards after the catch on the season just the ability kid on the ball they dont care how reverses little pitches quick screens just let him catch it let him run with it second down and three and he takes it to the 13 yard line where <person

year joe lombardi was here they made a change in midseason the lions were able to ratchet it up in the second half of the season the <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> and the whole staff speak glowing and a fee on glowing that you think almost like the guy is remarkable credible memory they were second they gave me ten days worth of work and it came back the next day perfectly done free play here and stanford still got to pay a <person player="brian price" race="nonwhite" position="DT">price</person> as he gets sack he had dean lowrey and then it was my ferry coming across number 95 540 still up day tone jones is the guy theyre gonna whistle here flag him for the offside but let s give some credit to dean lowrey the young rookie for hanging in there on that one because those free plays turn into touchdowns we see a lot of those out of <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> he stayed with it he didnt let up and that prevented <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> from going first can go to the 2yard lines so the lions

race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> high second and goal from the long joe sakic side is covered there by <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> sitting up a third and goal and if you feel like youre watching peyton manning s offense you kind of are jimbob cooter of course the history and jim caldwell with the indianapolis colts with peyton manning and so theyre going to give <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> a lot of latitude at the line of scrimmage but two straight passes now once they were down inside the 2 yard go search center for detroit touchdown and they had five first downs on that drive all three blocks perfectly done let s watch a sinner though you got to be able to cut off that inside linebacker <person player="jake ryan" race="white" position="LB">jake ryan</person> and he does ryan moves right and center sticks it in there that was a huge recovery run there after two failed passes to come in and get the touchdown anyway <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">prater</person> now for the extra point it s hold and we are tied at 7 big play

watson defending champ georgia speak the headline of winners handed field in hawaii coverage of the tournament of champions begins thursday at 5:00 eastern on golf channel decisions next weekend on nbc news noaa jet detroit river the boundary between detroit and wooden certain canada menzer ontario on this sunday night back here and drive from the 25 774 field packers against the lions great rivalry going all over back to 1930 but in recent times green bay has dominated 36 wins to 13 and two postseason wins these teams met back in the early 90s in the playoffs twice with green bay winning both three starting quarterbacks with the packers and 15 for the lions so that has settled down in recent years and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> took over here you know jim paul well third year jim took indianapolis to the superbowl in his rookie season there when they took over the tony dungy when his first 14 games and i want to say he s on the back seat here some people take on sanwa from the 25yard line the running back is kristin michael he moved from seattle those rogers again they have a first down bob quentin is the gm here he took over in the middle of last season they had a big shakeup here in detroit he did not know caldwell so he got together one at that point and jim with time left on his contract you know when you look at it if he gets him to the playoffs which he has that s twice in three years and that hasnt happened around here very often yeah i dont think he s going anywhere i really i think this place has a pretty good feel right now with quinn coming in he s making the catch and gets it across the 50 that a flag comes down and for the catch it the boger call here momentarily holy office number 83 okay first of all it takes an 18yard gain and makes it a 10 yard loss showed you quinn the gm one of the new england trained that guys this would be gonna get trained to be a gm or whatever gonna train for foxborough is not a bad place to learn the craft huh yeah but there really didnt you get the feeling you know jim caldwell has been around for a little while quinn s a new general manager you got a little young older and but they kind of have spent a lot of money updating everything in this detroit lions organization youve got the feeling you walked out of there that it was going in the right direction id be really surprised with the relationship that he has with jim bob cooter if this whole thing i just dont see that happen at all id be surprised to first in 17 a couple of changes gary kubiak it was surprising when we everybody found that about this weekend but probably because of health reasons more than anything else gary has decided to sit down after two years is the bronco coach and san diego after the game today parting ways with mike mccoy where s the san diego you dont know where theyre playing next year to begin with yeah and congratulations to gary kubiak one of the really truly great guys second down and 16 from the 29 yard line dancing his eyes downfield you saw the play and for the moment it s to the 36 yard line you know sometimes you scramble the right way and sometimes you scramble the wrong way there was a one receiver on that side of the field holding office in a 72 youre kidding oh dj <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">lang</person> have known the pro oh dj <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">lang</person> have known the pro bowl there s the hole by <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> and now look rogers out here he s going to pump fake and there isnt one receiver anywhere on that side of the field you were just trying to pull the pursuers so at the 33 declined so it s gonna make a third down and polo option takes it down make a third in 12:30 12 at the 33 with over three minutes to play in a 77 game steps away again he makes the catch the hill he stops short of the first time in a flag comes into the end of the play who over quinn made the tackle i think the indicate indication is green bay illegal block in the back office from 81 date the car result for the play for five so they decline backtoback penalties because it makes it fourth down fourth and four now speaking of hot seats for mike mccarthy it got a little toasty earlier in the year as well and i thought mike had a great answer standing up in front of a press conference and said you know the numbers show ive been a pretty successful head coach in this league and i think he was stunned by some of it and of course the turnaround why did all that good kick and it s going to go out of bounds oh marcus it s somewhere around the 30yard line we finally finish line in this enough with the surveyor and it will be the thirty one two and a half to go in the handle <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> eighth season throws close to 40 passes the game there it is thirty nine point three most an nfl history per game any risa s the 30,000 marquee does that tonight in his 109th game nobody has done it quicker than <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> marino and kurt warner would be next meets played five more games to get to that magic figure sahara is now at the 31 yard line starting this drive give it the sinner just one thing about botwin because he s actually higher at the beginning of this season what rod wooden is the president last year they had a big you know palace coup here last year and trying to get everything in order both on the field and off in detroit and on their way to the playoffs second and eight in omaha thrown in there too and that s the jim bob cooter peyton

player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">taylor decker</person> but he s also going to get a little help from zack zhen right it was <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> a week ago who was flying around looking like he was about five years younger he s incredibly nice to go snapper so for the middle of <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> hadnít easy interception just holding his helmet right there they had it all set up so theyre gonna bring the blitz here so what do you do you got to cover with <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> from the backside he runs right underneath this step never saw him oh my goodness we have seen some blown opportunities already in this game and <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> does not miss that they catch passes every day at practice off the jugs machine way he is going to be dying and he might have taken halen all the way yes second down he came from the 42 which is that one is caught and a sniff on their back to green bay territory for a first down no <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> was one of those guys that quinn definitely wanted here here s a guy okay he probably runs about a four eight forty at this point in his career but he s so physical he s so tough they wanted a third down guy and they wanted a red zone guy and they got absolutely one of the best nobody will ever question that guy s toughness forty two in detroit alert psyops first 97 center the double z the bounds at the 33yard line moving the sticks again first down well you love it when you see this happen and you want to run a screen let s put a perfect scenario together let them bring a blitz that side nice job by <person player="larry warford" race="UNK" position="OG">larry</person> worf were getting out there and getting morgen <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">burnett</person> hooked and then here we go this is a good looking offense it looks like bill paid manning offense doesnt it absolutely that s dinner 83yard sheet scrimmage it s only touched to the 29yard line second down and six we talked about that the peyton manning offense mr coyle all spent a little bit of time with manning that s how they got around to jim bob cooter they had to have somebody with a strong enough will the match peyton manning is that s not the easiest job in the world we found somebody special second and six it s enter to the 23 get out of south dakota state free agent two rushing touchdowns last week last year on injured reserve with a collapsed lung inside the 20 for a first now 37 seconds timeout taken here and were back in 30 seconds to 37 seconds to half time and matthew said that great that <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden</person> opportunity and let it go awry first half from the 18 yard line he wants it 13 yard line jones coming back for it taken down right away and detroit s uses its second timeout zener told you about south dakota state look look at those numbers dont care who youre playing it s three years over 2000 yards each season i mean that s really remarkable but it s showing up here tonight and he s a pretty complete player dont you think weve seen him block and we seen him chipping on the outside weve seen him catching some balls but really so far it feels like the key to this offense is much like it was back in peyton manning s day the pace is wearing down the green bay packers and they are getting these effective runs now remember in the game last week against dallas center had a great first half was nowhere to be seen the second half so well see now they go into the spread thirtyeight plays to green baize 24 second down that s part of a lot of traffic and that s bold into the four yard line and detroit is going to utilize its final timeout here with 26 seconds but a first and goal fourth coming from the four yard line yeah and the reason you hesitate a little bit to use that final timeout is that you can leave the running game in play right and so that s what makes that decision a little bit tougher but here we go and quan bolden one more time and he s playing with a bad finger he really did not catch the ball at all during practice this week he would run the routes but when they threw in the ball he just simply tried to catch it with one hand but you knew when the money was on the line there it was <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> on that zone blitz at one and thrown great in his hands that may have been a touchdown the other way and instead now math <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> may put a touchdown up to the lions two <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden</person> coat that masked bad fingers <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> with the middle finger taped first night and goal center in the backfield he s covered the past 16 times touchdown <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> slides to the inside six of these i tell you the other thing better and wide receivers do is they dont get called for picks even when theyre picking that was duke just perfectly done they had six first downs on that drive they had five first downs on their previous touchdown march they have 16 in the game to green bay s a either to the point after 23 seconds remaining in the half green bay well get the ball to start the third quarter watch antoine pullum you see that white border that is within one yard of the line of scrimmage you cannot be called for a pick play within that territory but fulton didnt even take that chance you went out there he made the defensive back randall stop and hesitate get it in there to <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> that s why you signed veteran football players they make key plays like that and what a drive by <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> one mistake and he got away with it to claim a dance team with his fourth touchdown reception of the season leading the team in receptions command e is for of the area s 89 for receive otters a little stunning if you watched the first game between these two teams the packers led that one 31 to 10 at the half in detroit almost caught up at the end that wanted lambo week three so <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> is back now to receive the kick see the green bay does very little time theyve got the timeouts but would probably need a decent run back here from <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> san martin puts the ball in the air and <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> roll through the end zone so chris but you thought your fantasy season was over right did you never it s never awake youre right your legs not signed a freaking winter trip you can win a trip to super bowl 50 well be there join today at nfl calm boil challenge this next year s super bowl in minneapolis what s at stake here tonight the winner clinches the division and will play the giants so that game will be either at lambeau or here and the loser will go out to centurylink next weekend to take on the seahawks to be determined that s the final game the 2016 season you do not want to jump offsides here to give that guy a free to be delay before the snap the layup days often your clothes that brings it back to the 20 23 seconds you know how it s interesting because both these teams clinched playoff spots before the game i was thinking it might benefit detroit a little more just to take a little pressure off and then come out a little bit of a slow start but boy theyve been sharp here late it could be in the sense that each team went into the playoffs yeah it s a little bit of pressure off the other hand he s weak weve been to think about up here the loser of this game you would have to win three broad games to get to the super bowl rogers fires that feel catson getting out of passes <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo</person> allisyn working out of illinois with 15 seconds the ball is at the 41 so theyd like to pick up a little bit more yardage for <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> that s a 39 yard reception so green bay with its whatever amount of time nice to have it barely matters theyll only have time probably here to use one <person player="max mccaffrey" race="white" position="WR">max</person> to as rodgers tries to position <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> for a lastsecond field goal what an unbelievable mistake by the lions defense how can you do that do that rahu s survey deep that a few too high completed intended for alison again that took five ticks off the clock soared out of ten the lions had two guys covering the underneath guy over here youll see and they basically had nobody down the field on alison racked up the carrot <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> the clear route went deep i mean that is the simplest of all routes youd go three levels one deep one to the flag one at about ten yards and somehow that up second of ten outside of getting out of bounds his <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> was six seconds so that s the 35 line of scrimmage youre looking at a 53yard field goal do they try one more play it looks like they will this better be quick varies and with <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> you always have to be a little careful you think okay just protect the boundary were gonna make sure we dont get that but you never know with this guy got a little hail mary history here a little bit that s alison in motion the time rogers looking for a little offside there in a free play i tell you i think i would have taken the extra five yards there they were just giving it darron rogers im sure they were told that were just gonna try and draw him offsides across we started out onto the field and now he retreats back to the kicking net i think mike mccarthy saw what i saw that if theyre gonna play 10 yards off let s go ahead and take that extra five yards let s see if they do it again make it crash note they change the defense the receivers now just flings that one out of bounds and that <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> will make his way onto the field for about a 53yard field goal very interesting there because aaron was obviously told no snap youve got to play like that in your repertoire no snap means were not snapping at no matter what im sure it was killing him up there because any words you say at the line of scrimmage there is null and void because youre trying to draw him offsides probably wanted one more shot 53 yard attempt to end the half and he bangs it through so rodgers gets him down the field at 39 yard pass to <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">allison</person> the key play the score is 14 to 10 coming up next to the halftime but first here are today s top performances presented by microsoft tonight s firsthalf highlights are brought to you by chevrolet <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> cant reel it in all my goodness and this is ripped asti the sudden star touchdown go sack sinner what a greatlooking dry was mass here caught touchdown <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row on to the third quarter al michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya sunday night football from detroit 14 to 10 <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> held to 130 yards that one touchdown pass on 10 of 17 meanwhile <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> 183 yards snapped a streak of 118 without a touchdown center 16 carries 63 yards and three catches he s already picked up 98 from scrimmage and sake of course the winner clinching the division hosting the giants the loser goes to seattle next weekend well the key play here in the first half was this one <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> perfectly designed defense im sure dom capers about jump down the booth he misses it and then walking back to the locker and watch this im not sure exactly what was said probably something along the lines of grow me one more and you see <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> if chuckle out of it but we got away with one theyre probably saying you lucky something it s the interesting thing about the league right now though is all these players know each other so well theyre at offense they do various things and so there are relationships that really didnt exist back in the day right youre the guys around with carrie underwood when we were filling the the open this summer weve been to get the ball as we start the third pick is fielded by judge anise in the endzone to the 25 vote comment we go to michelle well mike mccarthy was most upset about all the penalties his offense committed he told me 7 damn penalties you cant win a football game at wayne six of those penalties were accepted and he also said this game is about making big plays and that <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> should have made that interception as for jim caldwell with his team 30 minutes what could be their first occasion title since 1993 he was calm told his team play better tackle better keep running the ball and simply take it up a notch thank you michelle and of course this is the team the lions they know how to win from any vantage pool their wings comebacks as <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> takes the ball out to the 30 so <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> has been the primary running back had a tremendous day a couple of weeks ago in chicago number 88 of course she was a wide receiver if they make him a running back next year left to change his number but theyve been gold with kowski that s only the second carry tonight for <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> six yards per pot if it is week free for a first down up to the 38 tackle by terry that s interesting <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> here to start the second half with some quick throws because it s been a nice mix of coverage zone and manned by the detroit lions and one guy in particular darius leigh youve got to give him a little credit only one catch allowed for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> so far for eight yards after he torched him for a hundred one first the last time there she s escaped to the 40yard line short eve there is <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> going against <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> both these guys at the top of their game and it has been a lot of oneonone matchups but remember darius slate didnt even play in the dallas game last week with a bad hamstring but here he is really in the key pivotal moments of this game who did not against <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> second and seven <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> is the running back bang boom <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> spurred making the catch but <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> you can see stumble and he is down at the 34 yard line so off the play fake something happens to him and hell move over to the sideline theyll check him out and well check out the penalty from jerome boger well you dont want to volunteer to play running back for the lakers defense number 26 that pill did decline the result of the play it s the first time climb because it s an 11 yard catch by <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">allison</person> bizarre almost like coming out of the stance was <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> s number 88 right there just looked like something sort of cramped or pull dirt fortunately for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> it was a bootleg play and he wasnt going to hand it off to them but one more time the green bay packers running back goes down so rapacity comes in it had five different starting running back so soon <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> who has propelled in check to this point tackle by clover quinn dienophile and that s what you do sometimes when you have a great player that really has not gotten going in a game you just get the ball in his hands and im sure that s what <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> was doing there okay we may not hit a big play here but let s get our guy involved here slide in the way and once again running for a first down if all of his numbers and then once in a while you have to you have to go down the leading the snatch feet and go hey by the way he can run yeah there s <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nevin lawson</person> the other cornerback who had not such a good day against the cowboys but he s able to do it and on the other side darius lay on <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> so we are starting to get some oneonone matchups now well see who can win the longest bob juices rush roll speed 50 yards this season in a 57 pick up a little bitty yardage to the 34 yard line we second down and six hey sean robinson here is going to miss that one and what really should have been a tackle for a loss for these two teams now are going as fast as ive seen any football game this year second in section a flag thrown theyre going to get her she s going to get to a segment number 70 properly recognized devon taylor was coming across the line and green they was trying to get an offside but instead they get the full story remember you have to cross the line of scrimmage and if you dont then the offensive lineman cannot react once you get into that neutral zone then if the offensive line reacts it is going to be on the defense and leslie the senator got of the move by lifting his head up second down and 11 mccarthy telling michelle of course all those penalties would kill them at 7:00 now for 45 yards against green bay the lions have been penalized only three times flag comes in and geordi who picks of albany tea yard line while the quarterback was in the pocket illegal contact defense number 54 that build is declined resulted a play is the first time twenty yards for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> because <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> is out youre starting to see some of these officer and routes inside by <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> you can see them working against <person player="deandre levy" race="nonwhite" position="LB">levy</person> right there that s what theyre going to have to do and for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> you saw him moving around a lot more in that first half i think now he s going to get his guy get the ball out of his hand and start working <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> inside it s <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> taking the ball to the two yard line there you go beats lay first and goal you see the man coverage and rodgers did able to get in and get underneath that coverage and for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> once you get him the ball in his hands good things start to happen it s <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> right there and active tonight he s caught 60 this season <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> the team lotion farce of a shot at 100 first and goal for bucks down the ponte <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> and hell get flagged for using the goalpost as a product so thatll cost them on the kickoff but he s into the endzone and they go 75 yards 10 plays five and a half minutes to retake the lead basically <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> coterminous lives right here let s both like conduct offense number 17 while hanging on the gold page this 15 year up earlier fourth on the kickoff and then it was <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> running the underneath route there s a pretty good dunk not allowed but pretty impressive so <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> into the endzone so that s 38 touchdown passes for rodgers he is tied for the league lead with matt ryan of atlanta and that s the category in which aaron has never led the league one war and hell do it at 1714 after the extra warning sunday night football being brought to you by southwest yes to low fares with nothing to hide that is transparency by patriots day now playing in select cities everywhere january the 13th i should relay the most awarded car company two years in a row and by subway search for better well you go back to the 93 lions the last time this franchise won a division title some of the guys of course included barry sanders who retired in 98 martha firestone ford the widow of believe william clay ford who bucked team back in the 1963 he died in 2014 very classy man and this is four distinct she s made her mark in the last couple years from the 18yard line <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre roberts</person> it s taken down good tackle at the 28 so the packers they performed what s known as the double down scoring on the final possession of the first half and again after getting the second half kickoff theyve done in 11 times since o8 fit most in the league it s something that the patriots do with regularity theyve done it 19 times and theyre number one you do that a law it s black jackson no and im a crapshoot from the 29 yard line milan islands come up in the pistol center is running back that totally it s 63 in the opening half 16 on 17 carries exactly four yards per total now im pretty close to what he did against the cowboys a week ago at 64 yards in the first half against dallas and only two carries for three yards but here they come right out give it to him theyre not making that mistake chicken in five let s hurry she never first down and does he s tackle thereby hot hot clinton dicks presenter now it s a 109 yards from scrimmage in this game yeah and youre starting to see haha clinton dicks who s pulling around a little with <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> he was down at the line of scrimmage and then when he backed off <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> said okay ill just take that one right in a flat against your man garbage here comes radar too that is incomplete intended for <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin</person> jonas <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> in the first band tonight yeah it s just working in an unbelievable pace out there he is missed a couple of big opportunities beforehand that final drive before the half he was firing the ball round got away with one two <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> that the big play <person player="tj jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tj jones</person> down the field i would think more of those opportunities on this right side are going to be available extortion to the 45yard line goes bran and that one too well make it third down and five <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">eric ebron</person> was their number one draft choice back in 2014 at a north carolina good past cancer and a little bit better in terms of blocking very high 55 receptions but just one time as he got into the end zone the feeling a little bit better as far as why all right minimal it s a really good basket give it some sugar third and five from the 45yard line under pressure and down he goes <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> i just was thinking about mentioning the fact that <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">perry</person> and <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> theyre two big stars and very set of great years got the club on the left hand i havent mentioned their name at all tonight then <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">perry</person> comes in gets the shack it s really the first time weve seen had a couple of sacks coming back last week and i obviously cant do a lot with that club on that left hand but he did have two sacks last week and so much the key when he gets it going everything seems to start having a remarkable year for him <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">sam martin</person> would <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> hi dancing and darting and takes them all to the 15yard line so youve got 6 am to go in the third 17:14 packers defensive coordinator taro austin of the detroit lions came over here with colo in 2014 they were a great defensive year his name has been bandied about as one of those assistant coaches and probably will be again and another guy who just got fired today was chip kelly at san francisco so already the dominoes have begun to fall and the question becomes who are the ascendency boston s names will be going into the hopper no question no question i bet she gets at least three or four so from the 15yard line the green bay packers up 53 trying to win a home game against the giants and the ball is handed to her kowski good step on kowski up to the 22 yard terrell austin was talking about trying to play against <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and the hard thing that you have to do is try and keep him in the pocket they want <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> throwing out of the pocket not getting outside not getting all those movement plays they want him throwing from right there it leads the league by a mile and touchdown passes from outside the pocket to keep them in this time before <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo</person> allisyn the rookie out of illinois italy s third down well we talked about the pass blocking of these offensive tackles and you see <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> right here working against ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> who really has been hot here lately a couple of sacks the last two games he had 14 and a half sacks a year ago in just two this year so a nice test for <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> but he s been up to it so far we wont answer it has to come off he got shaken up on that play his helmet back on we saw him limping off last night in green bay the ball six minutes left in the quarter third down and three <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> back in the slot again who would have ever thought chris you come into a game it s week 17 and were talking about rib kowski and zener as you to top you know running back here it is a war of attrition and it s one of the things that bob quint did when he came in here you know know calvin <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> they had a little more money they added some depth to this roster you have to be ready to play with second and third string guys as you head into the playoffs from the 27 carry either 61 we saw in the lobby 291 corral jerry hider gave him a bit of a shot there watch it the tail into this and youre gonna see <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> knee buckle hiders going to come in from the left and that looked a little nasty luckily <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> didnt have that foot on the ground and there goes <person player="brian price" race="nonwhite" position="DT">brian</person> belaga off the field right tackle walk to the sideline second down and six <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">jason</person> sprigs a working number two draft choice out of indiana comes in along the front <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">spriggs</person> their second round draft pick good player <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> back in viveca spins to the outside time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> picks up a first down we were kind of joking around with time mcdiarmid last night he runs a little like leveon <person player="joique bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> the pittsburgh steelers watched the patients and then the bounce out with the speed of a wide receiver had a huge day against the chicago bears 160 plus yards there and you know for a guy who used to play white out that is all pretty impressive stuff know exactly what it was the horsham off the field when he looked healthy there first down from the 42 memory the back and chris you know it s you got to give a little you know sports illustrated had a really good piece on mike mccarthy where s the love from mike mccarthy me well he s done now he s gone to the playoffs eight straight years even had to go in and the press conference talking about bank you know he s been a successful nfl coach 11 years only vince lombardi coaching in more games in green bay but dont you think a little that is the curse of <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> it s like hey you got <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> you should be one in the world championship every second or third year the most and he s put some more games in lombardy than aggrieved a second and 13 little shovel pass to <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> he s interesting mccarthy had to have a clock basically with time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> and say listen i know you used to play a little running back i need you i need you to switch and go back there and play running back for us and he said can i go to the running back room right now i mean it was like a 1 second decision i think it s something he s been wanting to do as well as he looked around at some of the other talent and that wide big third down plays we come down toward the end of the quarter third and seven to go against the pakmara often in the 65 blayne taylor left guard make a third and 12 it has definitely been a factor and youre talking about such a huge difference if the detroit lions can get out of here with a win and play a playoff game here as opposed to going on the road and hearing all that noise and seattle <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> goes into the slot and five receivers out fortyfour sake packer punt oh youre seeing tara <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> unwilling now to sit back and let <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> take his time we saw this a little bit in the second half against the vikings they brought some pressure and were able to get there but in that long yardage situation force the ball out of his hands and force a putt now it s up to <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> to get it going they can show so <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roberts</person> whose run back to punch four touchdowns as she s in at the 8th and then deaden and be downed at the 4yard line so <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roberts</person> lets it go and shove into the deep of the minute a half to go in the third back by three a couple of big names have left the lions as fast as maybe the prime of their careers calvin <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> nine seasons 1214 receiving yards last year so he was a long way from being done so is barry sanders who played 10 years in retired at age 30 he had 1491 yards in his final season the interesting thing is that both of the teams have who succeeded the retirements of those two guys made the playoffs detroit went to the playoffs in 99 lost to <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> in a wild card game and the lions would be in the playoffs next week oh yeah stop at the line of scrimmage by <person player="zach zenner" race="white" position="RB">zach</person> center so it s great when the end of the nfl season comes down to this with <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> losing today but these two teams did into the place but still a very significant difference in this game theyre both in but either you have to win three on the road or you get at least to get a home game and all that really matters is a shot at the super bowl i dont care what anybody says in a home game and the next round of the playoff definitely chances that opportunity they dont figure when great may won the super bowl in 2010 they were the sixth seed and one the before winning the super bowl in dallas against pittsburgh second in 11 at the 42yard line by <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> the former bengal fled a big day against the packers in week three and guess which side one more time working on the right side over there which is the easier side for the quarterback to see but time after time this season the packers come with a blitz and they just cant match up with their corners on the outside and boy from arvind jones it has been a big year injury timeout here twelve million bucks on the line it s the wall that s the name of the show two night premier starts tomorrow 10:00 eastern and pacific 9:00 central and mountain right here on nbc downtown detroit on the sunday night meanwhile the injured player is the cornerback quentin <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> and well take a look at and see what happened to him but he is still down on the lions sideline watch his head here as he rolls over the top bangs it off the ground after making contact with <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> boy that has just been a hard hit area of the team they started with <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> and matric <person player="demetri goodson" race="UNK" position="DB">goodson</person> and <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> marius randall s had all kinds of injuries darius gunner had to leave the game last week with an elbow boy anytime they start taking your helmet off slowly and all that all the players and his teammates assume the position medical folks taking every precaution with quentin collins who looked like he was moving right after the play was over but and then theyve strapped into the board and one more look at it it points up on the helmet it hits the turf right in front of the detroit bench so he will go back to the locker room obvious in the show well have an update very shortly they also a mac inton doorly aunt they back up cornerback a working at northern iowa who was taken to the locker room on a cart i know there are a lot of family members this is awfully tough that the there was a bit of good news as soon as he rolled over he did see him put his hand down and there was a little movement and at any time there s any kind of a any issue at all with the neck they are going to do exactly that so we will get you information as quickly as possible <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> back to the packer locker room and when play resumes 53 seconds remaining in the third quarter green bay is up by three <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> now who is a safety by trade may have to play the role of a corner and as detroit has it at the 34 yard line they also bring intro bryson he is a rookie out of louisiana tech undrafted rookie he s in there and play resumes with the lions at the 34 yard line and they have safeties guarding wide receiver he s one on one it s a single hi here they put mine in the corner and keep it on the drive here and cheddar goes in the final half minute of the third quarter so for detroit as we go to the fourth quarter in 15 of their 16 games this season they have trailed in the fourth quarter lions that one right where they want yeah in a way they do this is where they operate best if it does ford order rallies and the expires into the third quarter sit down the stretch we come 1714 brain bay and sunday night football from detroit back after these messages tonight s aerial coverage is being brought to you by geico look into the southbound be contrite river canada on to the left downtown detroit right underneath you what s at stake winner wins the division and meets the giants on their home field loser goes to seattle start the fourth al michaels chris collins with michele tafoya on a second and 13 for the lions from their own 31 yard line is incomplete third and long and here s michelle well you saw quentin rawlins leave the field on a cart he has been taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital he is out with a neck injury as for <person player="damarious randall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">damarious randall</person> he is questionable within the injury and mckitten dor leon who you noted left on a cart as well is questionable with a knee injury so the secondary this green bay packers team hardhit tonight very much so and chris mentioned go all the way back to sam fields and all of that so they just plug it in people all over the joint right now safeties and corners in the slot well see if <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> can take advantage of it third and 13 you have time overthrows the intended receiver deep downfield miss <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre roberts</person> ill tell you what you know im watching the detroit line chris theyre doing a great job on <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> tonight he just cant get in there yeah and theyre having to resort to this to man coverage here comes <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> off the edge and <person player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">taylor decker</person> the young tackle doing a nice job but you see the man underneath coverage with the two deep safeties that <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> not used to having to cover a wide receiver in that kind of situation kick we look at the length where s <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> hide he gets tackled in his tracks twentyone seconds into the fourth quarter oh you talked a little bit about the offensive line though the green bay packers how good are they here s how good those three guys are the best at their respective positions in pass blocking number one number one number one from <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">lang</person> and palaka and the other guys arent bad either portland s <person player="khari lee" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lee</person> and <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane taylor</person> so they are going to have to continue to come up big here for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and for they need something here out yaaaaah out of some of these pass rushers that just troll <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> remember theyre just trying to keep him contained markets that may be slowing them down a little bit to vodkas back in there s the the kirsten michel makes it look easy i mean we were talking to him last night as you mentioned you know what is it he says a lot of it s instinct and film study yeah and and really he s not trying to get out too runny watch him he s gonna pull up and look to pass and then when it s not there then he takes off and he s elusive enough to pick up those big first downs if you can remember the first game against the lions it looked like the lions were gonna mount this huge comeback and what happened late in that game it was <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> running the ball the one football game late in a lot of games over his starter three years on the they first got drafted to the 35yard line and is a flag down nine penalties already on green bay going to run illegal block in the back office number seven 10yard penalty replay birthday that s <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person>e that s gonna make a 10 penalty for 75 yards against the packers every once in a while when you get a running back that starts crossing back across the field the other way there youre gonna see the shot right there by <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person>e and that s the one theyve got called he means stiffarmed here by christen michael who is bounced around just about everywhere i think weve called him with three different teams wave is this guy on our boards again yep still we have a doing him every other week i think was following first and 16 devante <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> was in the backfield in detroit territory by <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo</person> listen who had that big 39yard reception at the end of the first half to set up a <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> 53yard another catch here 431 they have been running this pattern a lot the little down out and up and they get just a little pick going down what a story <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo allison</person> has become he had a nice day in the game last week and you can tell that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> trust him he said i have to trust you guys in practice to know what youre doing in this hurry up no huddle office where i trust in the game said this young man is doesnt expect the packers get away with one almost a disaster there as rodgers was not expecting the snap but quickly recovers and gets it to animist for a sevenyard gain maybe <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> best play of the game he got hit right in the gut with a snap absolutely no idea this thing was coming a he catches it b gets behind the receiver so it s not a lateral c gets it out and they pick up seven yards on the play instead of what for most quarterbacks would have been im just going to fall down on the field and take a fiveyard loss or fumble and recovered by detroit were to good hands right there by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> then the fullback in the game this time it s joke carriage running back is its second down and three just blows it away that time coming in from his blind son with a clear shot at him well as <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kerry</person> haider who leads the team in sacks so rodgers sensed it throws it away third and three you just have to wonder how much kristin michael knows about this offense you know <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> if you watch him breaking the huddle when there s a new guy back there <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> kristin michael hell often turn to the back and tell him exactly what to do when theyre breaking the huddle and i guarantee it kristin michaels getting a little lesson as is <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> every single time he leaves the huddle third and three <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> back in the backfield the 22yard vodkas jared book the tight end beat s<person player="miles killebrew" race="nonwhite" position="DB">miles killebrew</person> the safety first at green bay it s just too much of a matchup here this guy has been doing this he s really just a bigger wide receiver a calvin <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> kind of wide receiver on the outside and you try and match up a safety against him and myles <person player="miles killebrew" race="nonwhite" position="DB">killebrew</person> and he s just going to win that battle it was really interesting when we talk to <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> about this win streak and he went right there he said <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> is that with das <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> <person player="jordan tripp" race="UNK" position="LB">jordan</person> and that s enough to gain the extra yardage and a first down is he pushes <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> out of the way you see a time after time anytime you give this kind of cushion that s got to be seven or eight yards on the outside by <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> with that quick turn you know it doesnt matter which way he s throwing it leftright he can get out of his hand about as quickly as anybody well <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> had been questionable before the game missing the last two they really missed them against dallas last week when the cowboys lit him up for six touchdowns and he s hurt again harry s put stadium in st louis no the cardinals are not playing tomorrow but the blues are against the chicago blackhawks bridgestone nhl winter classic chicago and st louis on nbc tomorrow well <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> came out of the game he has to come out for at least one play and <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> bad emotion comes in picked them up cleveland yes it is yeah well there s we have <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is always looking for the open wound first and ten from the 11 spins around with ten for needle one second and nine a sleigh comes back in it was a good call to defensively by terrell austin he did not leave padam oc out there one on one they had two safeties back to help and probably now come back to some of their band coverage maybe even some blitz so that emocionante is back in dont worry in the back you second a nine rogers over the middle and that s intended for <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> and incomplete josh mines the linebacker covering play third down in mind but it s about exactly what you would hope for coming out hit that in cut you got a wide receiver out here working against just put hit it oh that s right there see that ball 39 thakur s go 5 wide lyons rush for rogers again to the outside again is torque for a touch stabbed by <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo allison</person> i mean you just you cant stop him if he does that let me have the boy eight nine seconds put the clock on it this is what s so difficult to defend whether youre unmanned coverage at which they are here plenty of time he s scrambling around buying time and eventually one of these wide receivers uncover they practiced this all the time people think oh my goodness it s streetball theyre just no they every single day in practice when we get the opportunity to go there <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> even when there s nobody else on the field well take off and start moving around to try and come up with plays like that there used to it and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> has just thought his 39th touchdown pass of the season so he breaks the time with ryan and he will lead the league in touchdown passes for the first time the kick is no good so sin 98 so two possessions though for green bay up by 9 with ten minutes to play in detroit on sabbatical something like football being brought to you by volkswagen by samsung pay turn your phone into your wallet and buy at&amp;t there are some of the individual champions breeze and passing yards so vic beasley under the radar in atlanta leveling in sacks zeek <person player="jayrone elliott" race="UNK" position="LB">elliott</person> the rookie and rushing and the venerable one <person player="larry warford" race="UNK" position="OG">larry</person> fitzgerald most caches there s the venerable one for green bay tremendous year in zone run back to the 31 yard line by <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre roberts</person> and and go to the touchdown so you want to play defensive back in the nfl watch on the lefthand side <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo</person> allyson he s working against dan <person player="don carey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carey</person> and he s done a terrific job to this point right and now of a sudden here in rogers here we go and there goes allyson back the other way hagar whitehead picks him up and still to no avail <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kerry</person> had to cover him for about five seconds and he basically gave up but i guarantee you for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo</person> allyson just went way up his list with that spread the drill he s got four passes to mind center to the 36yard line they havent done much running in this half detroit had 70 rushing yards in the first half and only six here in these seconds there is the undrafted free agent was on a practice squad made his nfl debut in atlanta at the end of october he s made a splash he is not going to be leaving the lineup anytime soon <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> may be coming back from that ankle injury shell just work into the mix second 9520 left before a screen and tape makes the most of it by getting four maybe five depends where they spot it close to it first well once again youre just <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> who is basically a saint he does a little slot stuff so he s not used to getting picked off of those plays so there youre now going to challenge mike got hyde and now <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> is out playing the slot we saw this a little bit in the very first game of the year when they had a lot of injuries in that first game against jacksonville they had to go to some makeshift stuff and <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">burnett</person> was the guy that played the slot in that game too you know that was opening day in 90degree heat in florida that was a first down so stanford now and getting open making the catch at the 36 yard line is warm and jones having a big night tackled by the rookie bryce any time youre faced in his own defense if you can buy a little time watch <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> here just move around buy a little time eventually breakdown because those stretch receivers that are running the verticals down the field take the deep coverage and then there s those angles across the field just like that jones five catches tonight martin village of 76 yards and that is knocked down at the line of scrimmage at least 2nd down and 10 kenneth park is there the 7 <person player="kenny clark" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kenny clark</person> one of a couple of the young guys on that defensive line that they like dean lowrey weve seen him make some plays <person player="kenny clark" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kenny clark</person> in there latroy guy on where s the big guy in the middle he s not going to replace him such a great run stuffer but that <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff</person> is coming in to play the way the lions play second dance is dropped at the 31yard line <person player="tj jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tj jones</person> at a big long 35 yard reception in the first half cant hold on third and 10 you gotta have a little respect for <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius</person> gunnar went out of the game after 19 snaps in the last game that comes right back and they have to have him here they basically have no choice beautifully played that time by gunther the pass has got the world but boy is he a technician repeat some protection and he flares out that s intended for pj jones clinton dicks covering now you got fourth and 10 all right see you down by 10 you got a really good field goal kicker but do you want to try a field goal from here the downside of course is that you give green bay the ball back in your midfield if you miss it i dont think you have to and this guy has been lights out from long distance got a longer 58 and in his career 35 or 40 fiftyyard so remarkable record 54:39 earlier but this time he turns it into a onepossession game straight down woodward avenue 23 17 green bay 742 left well the playoffs are almost set it depends on what happens in this game and our postgame show will have all of the matchups for you well have all the television coverage for you saturday and sunday in the wildcard round but probably wont know the exact schedule until we find out the result of this one again the winner of this game hosts the giants next weekend and the loser goes to seattle chikka janish back deep kristen michael sale through the end zone so rodgers and company will go to work up at the 25yard line well it is been something so far tonight to watch these two quarterbacks go back and forth but <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> started to heat up now and he s finding the young receiver <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">geronimo</person> allyson not safe to play there did rogers as you can see when he starts to get in a rhythm is awfully tough on any when he starts that scramble bro nobody s come up with an answer all season long pretty average first half good second half for the two touchdowns 13 of 16 is rogers from the 25 this drive begins with an inside handoff come on summer takes it out to the 32 yard line for a gain of seven tackled by tyler whitehead we were asking about time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> said are you more exhausted and more beat up after playing running back than you were playing wide receiver and he said you know a little more exhausted because of wide out sometimes the runs away you kind of take a play off their running back youre smashing into somebody or blocking somebody on every single play backers a rush to 124 tonight 61 second three that s all then but it s going to the first of fonte <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> let s see where they give them the spot im gonna give him a spot just about at the line the game lord progress boy that s not very im not sure about this spot yeah they gave him a first down he comes back there s no way he was at that time but you know jim caldwell he treasures his time out and he may send the flag out here and he does so again you know what you really need is a landmark and or something along the sidelines or choices founded over the field that the ball carrier made the line today some thing that indicates where the line of scrimmage is if he wins the challenge it would be third down and whatever theyd have left which appears to be the issue case at least a yard short of that line to gain that s a good challenge we had a long conversation with jim caldwell about what he was going to do you know he just will not give up those timeouts but anytime youre talking about setting up a third and one kind of situation with a chance to get the ball back this late in the game you have no choice he had to do this because the guys upstairs felon he looked at probably wins so you dont get charged with the timeout so until both those feet come down on the ground that is not a catch and this figures to be reversed setting up a third down and three quarters of a yard yeah what weve seen so far in that situation is a lot of aaron rip cows after reviewing the play the rule in the field is being changed to sort of the lines again the toy is not taught at the timeout almost success all right what is mccarthy who s the play caller go with here tonight great the three on third and short not <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> in the backfield rogers gonna take the snap out of the gun on third and one blast off show blitz and rogers is going to take it himself does everything first down what a cool it s easy to say what a colby s it works but but what a call you just dont think that youre gonna put that billiondollar guy right there but and ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> he was going in there try and make a big play and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> just pulls the thing out even joe namath did at once so look at him oh yeah loves to compete doesnt he loves to compete loves love s love s to practice and that s a quite a disparity with his predecessor the balls at the 47 yard line the flag down pressure put on by whitehead flag is right about the 50yard line on the other side of the field so totally away from the polygroup defense number 23 530 all the matters first out darius slave at the top of your screen there got a whole chunk of that jersey but i tell you for that penalty <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> took a pretty good shot at the end of this one which your outside the pocket youve got some different rules that apply out there so 5:35 first down there in detroit territory a twopossession yeah trying to chew up some of the clock as well generally <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> we go to michelle well earlier we saw packers cornerback <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> leave the field on a cart and leave the stadium by ambulance i can tell you now he is at a local hospital he s conscious and has movement and he s remaining in that hospital for further evaluation but some positive news in that he is conscious and there is movement guys yeah for sure thank you michelle so good news there <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> watching his offense here trying to almost orcas a way to get some points harry ivanova safety blitz you know were talking about rogers before you were talking about practice he loves to practice he comes up to the line of scrimmage here did not let detroit sub and that s incomplete you got two receivers in the same area so youve got <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> and <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> looking for a flag there is none and green bay trying to catch them flatfooted and that was very close right there those detroit lions defenders screaming off the field now youve got a flag a old man participating to play defense again it s almost like when he gets you to go offside against the free play he knows when you have the extra guy in the huddle he rushes to the line he gets the play off and gets the penalty you know one of the really hard parts about having time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> in the backfield is when they split him out now youve got issues here we go down here in the bottom youre gonna see as he get off the field or not doesnt did not and you saw rogers looking in that direction look right at him knew what he had gets the penalty makes a third down and five we had <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers and <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> walt in the backfield and slips the past it s time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> and that s a first down of the 3040 stays invested you can plot go you know just the finish we were talking before about about rogers and how he loves to practice you know what brent ferrara was ending his career remember brett s saying us many times you know what i love the games im just bored with practice and this guy s never bored with anything he went through not only talking about how much he loves to compete and practice but with his girlfriend playing some crazy cake for five minutes on that so he won some game that earlier this week he was all excited about from the 34 yard line slipping through his <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> and that s a nineyard gain so chewin up yardage chewing up the clock clearly in field goal range down to 423 and counting you know once again it is time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> watch them be patient here and then go we talked about it with leigh be on bail all the time pretty amazing for a guy that comes in and plays running back from the wide receiver position to be that skilled but he has plenty of experience playing that running back position throughout the course of his life and he is the number one rated most elusive running back since he switched to that position you can imagine trying to tackle a wide receiver in the open field second and one look at this formation bullying his way for a first out of the 21 yard line is <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> and lola nice to start thinking about when does he want to take his timeouts you know and it s just so brutal because they had them backed up when was the third nine and they end up trapping him with that one guy fairly doesnt get off the field shorten the field and keep this drive alive but it has just been that sort of perfected use of the quarterback position that has made it so hard to beat the green bay packers down the stretch of any season three minutes on a first down the 20 the play clock timeout before we had a delay assess it s a timeout well it s really gonna be interesting i mean the matchups in the playoffs or or we dont know what theyll be yet but somebody s got to go into seattle the giants are hot how about that defense and the giants in the game that really had nothing at stake <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> had everything at stake and the giants came up with a big one that i you got russell <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> you have <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> you have tom brady you have been roethlisberger you have eli manning so you have quarterbacks in this thing that have made the entire run right and then you have the great unknown youve got dak prescott in the dallas cowboys is the number one seed theyre gonna be able to play in dallas throughout the course of this thing so it really is setting up there just a tremendous playoff series you know a lot of matchups we havent seen before oakland of course you know opens just got huge problems now at quarterback on we should blowing got hurt today we no car is that they had to go to connor <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> and they have to go to euston next week and if theyre only sheeps theyve been redhot and dont forget the atlanta falcons which everybody seems so forgotten about the number to see <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> taking you to the 16 and cold blow says i will take a time out here to stop the clock with 259 so they have two remaining i just wonder how many lions fans are sitting there going i have seen this movie before you know when it all matters and youre thinking okay weve got <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> coming in here and we got a chance to win the division first time since 93 and got my lions hat on and im feeling good our team wins all these games in the clutch and the boogie man comes in and is doing it to him again and i mean <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> just has a way with in this division of making plays when it matters most to play made against the chicago bears and team throw down the field to <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> to win now it theyll put at the time the boogie man really would have come in if <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> to beat the giants the babies and the loser of this game would have been out of the playoffs second and five first down and set up a first and goal now the troy is really in noman s land they take their time out here they do there s only one remaining plus the twominute warning but already first and gould talked about the elusiveness watch this one player whitehead has a clean shot no way you could miss that tackle and that is exactly what time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> has done he is 225 pounds now told think of him is 175 pound wide receiver 225 pounds with that deep quickness he is as good as there is at making single tacklers miss him in the open field so first and goal detroit one time i plus the twominute warning <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> can only hope for another shot touchdown vontae <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">adams</person> working on navigation and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> tonight has thrown four touchdowns and that gives him an even 300 yards on the evening the boogie man hard at work tonight this time to <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> he saw the blitz everybody saw the blitz you know it s one on one coverage and <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> now that his 11th touchdown of the year he s had a few drops along the way but that balance along with <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> and now <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> getting back into form you give that guy a few weapons and add one more is an even dozen now he s got two in the game tonight with six catches the twopoint attempt to try to make it a 14point game or up by 12 who wants to play these guys right yeah well that s you know theyre good they if they hold on to the victory here there will be six wins in a row to the package and to <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> again on that drive along the hammond its 3117 you know the boogeyman as i said if you imagine if if <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> had won that game and the loser would have been out unless this game with a wound up at a time as i was thinking as you look at the touchdown passes this year aaron with 40 ryan 38 brees 37 philip rivers with 33 or top four if this game would have wound up in a tie and <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> 21 oh dan snyder would have had a congressional investigation and i just dont think it could have happened i just dont i dont think anybody would have done it but it is you know the one guy who wasnt on that list if ive got this right tom brady this season 28 touchdowns and just two interceptions missed four games yeah and <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick</person> foles had the 27 in to us i think that s the new standard as far as that percentage goes so who do you vote for for the mvp ive been going back and forth on this one quite a bit i think you can make a case for quite a few guys matt ryan tom brady s been unbelievable <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> calling his shot here at the end of the sea <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david</person> <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ezekiel</person> <person player="jayrone elliott" race="UNK" position="LB">elliott</person> dak prescott who you like im gonna send it to the electoral college because i dont know when s the popular push in this category that s crazy you know the <person player="jayrone elliott" race="UNK" position="LB">elliott</person> and prescott will probably savage each other to a certain degree and work you the year as well top to bottom but it s gonna be a very contested election fourth quarter cut back to the lions this would be the capper though they could do it they have eight wins six of the eight here and they won six straight games here so theyve overcome small deficits theyd have to overcome a 14point deficit peyton manning at sevengame winning drives in the fourth quarter back in online so matthew has had eight but this would be the camera from the 25yard line let s drop intended receiver <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> covering on the play second down to ten how about <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> here being able to go out as a true safety and hang with wide receivers on the outside his versatility may well make him the via this deep end never made the full bowl and that really come in from light mccarthy just able to do so much it s more blind caught and then taken down is <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">ebron</person> and he stays in bounce and that keeps the clock rolling i tell you dom capers has a magic wand how he s holding this explosive offense the 17 points with who he has left in his holster ive no idea evon so they hit the tight end again wanting to stop at the twominute warning 14 seconds away the 45yard line take advantage of it bro and that s caught over the middle and you got to the 21yard line and that comes with the twominute warning at 1:57 the <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> exhausted but he has the ball at the 21 yard line the tinct over mcgee 3117 well volkswagen postgame report detroit s very own mike tirico is here and one ville the entire playoffs scheduled for next weekend michelle on the field with the stars of the game and well take a look at it to wildcard weekend as far as the afc is concerned we know what s happening there in terms of the matchups dolphins will be at the steelers and the raiders will be at the texans patriots are the number one seat chiefs big day for them they beat san diego and oakland loss of the chiefs who would have been five or two they would have most likely had to play three road games and theyve been the five and that s what opens gonna probably have to do right now as opposed to having a week off and a home game in two weeks the raiders have to be oh man i mean just the effect they were such a good team and it s gonna be tough from here so who s the sickest thing the raiders is sick <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> is really sick a lot of coaches i think coaches are sick and unemployed probably more tomorrow so black monday has been moved up to a sunday happy new year for a lot of guys and over the next couple of weeks detroit one china 57 first 9221 gargle were stanford <person player="antwione williams" race="UNK" position="LB">williams</person> pull off america s bring news pass rushers inside now and <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius</person> nutter is able to tip it away from <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> second down and ten you know it s it s just fun for me to watch <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius</person> gunner play here s a guy that probably runs about a 465 playing the cornerback position but if he gets his hands on you at all in that bump and run not many good things happen for the offense the 16 yard line caught by <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">ebron</person> gets taken down by dicks saving their time out dirt down and a floor 37:13 session and that is going to be <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> coming away with it in the end zone for a touchback <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> with the interception on <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden</person> teeth and as he said great you got guys playing all over the field in that secondary you move hide to the outside he gets the game sealing interception i mean there s a lot of contact out here but <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> game on the line just plays it perfectly and the biggest thing he did was he squeezed them right into the pylon over there there s nowhere to go wrestling going on arms around each other on both sides officials say play on a <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> cant believe it i gotta tell you for all we talked about <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> in this offense what this defense did the night with the division on the line with nobody left to play cornerback was one of the great shows weve seen this year tremendous and what theyve done is won a home game next week so the new york giants im sure are hard at work at their meadowlands complex looking at the green bay packer jp is theyre going to lambeau and i looked at that longrange forecast for lambeau next week let s put it this way single digits that s the long term that im dr dopler i understand that but im just telling you might be somewhere around six and that streak lives on here they won the central division which of course no longer exists and if seen or started a no to green bay is gonna win it again so theyre used to playing week seventeen division joke carriage it s the give right here you second down and ten and you got packers down and this not with any that s <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">jason</person> sprigs rookie tackle some distress well the other thing weve got to say about the green bay packers now for the fourth game in a row no turnovers that s how you win rodgers the seventh game in a row without an interception right so mike mccarthy super bowl champion and ten eight straight years to the playoffs three and three at home hell be there next week four and four away but ill tell you what this guy has had more gutwrenching playoff defeats than anybody he has lost five playoff games five on the last play of the game either in regulation or overtime then you go through that litany the giants beat him in overtime and o s seven cardinals beat him in 51 45 and ot 49ers won the game on the final play wildcard 13 fox beat him over time and the nfc championship game and last year we were there when <person player="larry warford" race="UNK" position="OG">larry</person> fitzgerald caught that touchdown pass after a hail mary by rodgers had sent the game into overtime in arizona and there were people coming after his job halfway through the season and he probably had the best way of describing it he said you know we keep stats on everything including some of those articles that were written weve got all those filed away too so always good to have a list huh by the way mccarthy was everyone on the street how long do you think it would be before he would get higher not long but four minutes maybe not that long but let s say you do have to pay attention a bit here <person player="brian price" race="nonwhite" position="DT">brian</person> belaga has been shaking up a little bit now <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">jason</person> sprigs and you know these games dont stop youve got to turn right around now and get ready for the playoffs right were not sure exactly what day theyll leave they have six or seven days the interesting thing about this game two tonight green bay had eight days rest because they played on christmas eve saturday and detroit only had six days recipes they had the monday nighter and on the road so they had to fly back then get back here till tuesday about 6 am all right so rogers with a meal down here detroit if they want to use their final timeout and they do would at least make green bay run another play to take close to 40 off the clock and then be forced to punt let s still it s a two possession game so you know we talked about greatness all the time but for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> how many times the whole relaxed thing the whole i think were going to be able to run the table in this one a little boost of confidence and for him to play absolutely perfect football since he made that statement it s one thing to say it and have it happen it s another thing to play as perfectly once he said it and that s the difference between the very good and the great now a little pushy shovey here theyre anywhere close there and rogers it was going to be a riot down there squirted out the back tunnel and you can just tell how frustrating it has to be for the detroit lions this is a good football team they made the playoffs and yet here they are one more time in their own house they cant handle the packers so havent had a home playoff game since 93 this team is there are only two playoff games in detroit in the last 59 years and it wont be one next weekend because the lions will be flying to seattle so it s 4th down and greenbay could just let the clock run down as far as it will to 27 seconds so jim caldwell gets his team to the playoffs second time in three years theyd have to do it all on the road though they will know like i said before at green bay was a six seed in 2010 and went all the way they thought running the table let s run the table and green bay the game at 37 and the game and the play clock to team and the game caught the 37 seconds and start on my wife all right so thatll take us down eventually to 27 theyre close to it on the play clock all right so and we just discovered that detroit will have a short week is saturday night at 8:15 freddie eastern time it will be the lions at the seahawks and that will be our crews game next weekend on wildcard saturday so we will follow the lions out west as they get ready to match up with the seahawks who ended their season

inhale air elide that one it s right you remember when eli hit one of the barnaby road man what do we got here we got 31 17 mm just a little bit under where some folks would like to see this one wind

as exciting as what rodgers did last time no this building but pretty good for playoff schedule coming up but michael have it for you on our postgame show tell you who s got what game and win you know one of the things i love about football is 12 teams making it to the playoffs you know every other sport is it s like you got to work to not make the playoffs youre one of the twelve you had a great years i know there s some disappointment in detroit but youre one of the twelve and you have a chance no i like it the way it is they talked about expanding it but you know 12 minute 20 out i think is a good combo platter every other sport is half and half or at least basketball and hockey are baseball a little bit different but the green bay packers go to the playoffs for the eighth consecutive year their home giants go to lambeau next weekend and detroit heads to seattle 31 to 24 green bay wins and coming up next is the boats with postgame report right after these messages from your nbc
