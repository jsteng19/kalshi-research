with an old buddy after 14 years on bill belichick s s pass patricia is the head coach it s his first head coaching gig he s off to a rough start lost on opening night to the jets got beat last week in san francisco and the maidens are already already a little bit restless but nothing would soothe them faster than a win tonight over the vaunted patriots so chris as the underdog tonight how do they pull up the upset i think they throw the football why not the patriots are missing tore their starting defensive backs their best pass rusher and alliance <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> three terrific wide receivers a couple of really talented as receiving backs coming out of the backfield if theyre winning tonight i think theyre winning throwing the england were used to them starting fairly slowly last year they were to a two round of 13 and three theyre one of the one right now there s a pattern here i think they use september a little bit dont you they play a lot of people a lot of different positions they build some experience build a little depth out there but we also know if youre gonna get the patriots you better get them in september get them early out there i look for a shootout here i dont think either one of these defenses are gonna be able to hold up against either one of these quarterbacks as you know already a crazy sunday in the national football league what s in store tonight in detroit on sunday night football sunday night football is brought to you by subway make it what you want by

better and gonna play better and keep trying to improve each week if you are a detroit lions fan you are passionate but you know all about frustration more on that to the field we go and michelle well the lions are going allin on the patriot way two years ago they hired general manager bob quinn who spent 16 seasons in new england s personnel department contributing to four super bowl championships quinn inherited that head coach jim caldwell but fired him two years later despite a winning record and the day after the patriots lost a filling in super bowl 50 to plan and hired pats defensive coordinator matt patricia who was part of three super ball wins in his 14 years now patricia s approach has brought a bit of a culture shock to the lines why doesnt that lola take telling me on a jim caldwell everything was completely different were still adjusting definitely but better in safety warmer quinn said every new coats brings something different these are dead goats now and how nothing expedites that buyin process quite like winning does and michele he s brought the to our practice to detroit and he learned that from that man bill belichick who last week with a or two weeks ago at

hogan</person> to a good start for the lions as they hold him on a three it out well the best news for the lions is they held up on the first two plays in the running game if youve watched detroit at all they have been a disaster stopping the run so that gave them the chance on third down and then they made a play with their man coverage ill put it punter brian allen <person player="jamal agnew" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jamal agnew</person> ran a couple back on punt returns last year and wound up making the pro bowl he sets up back at the ten angled kick gonna let it bounce and takes a

won a super bowl ring there and that feel for detroit and they have been looking for a running the seemingly since barry sanders retired and this is blunt and what picks it up to the 17yard line <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> his numbers through the first two games he threw four picks on opening night low rating youd have to say he s had one good quarter and that was the fourth quarter last week in san francisco when they almost erased a 17 point deficit but lost by three this team is capable you have to do is look around at these wide receivers and running backs you know what they can do snapper than distinct year sack bark thatll be a first down mister an emerging star <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> covering on the plane the first first end of the game belongs to the lions most people know about <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> but this guinea gala day has really made an impression on everybody he s sort of that intermediate route catcher youve got <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> on this offense they get the ball to him quickly a lot of moves <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> the deep threat but this <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> has become a force in that middle range thanks showing inside give <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette</person> what he s a <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> who can run over people but he s also elusive with people i dont think when you watch them run you dont know how elusive he can be i agree with it ranked 5th in the nfl and our elusive rating that we do but you can see the gap right here and you give him a little room to run now elusive also means you run over people for sure if the <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> didnt make the tackle you can either give a little wiggle and make a miss or just run over that s about 50/50 am ready you got that lady that s blunt coming out of the backfield and another detroit first down and action there is the ball you may have come loose but it did not so first now let s take a look at the new england defense do just watch junior arkansas lauren scott shoot <person player="michael roberts" race="nonwhite" position="TE">michael</person> brown local cant say davis chattering <person player="kyle van noy" race="UNK" position="LB">kyle van noy</person> briga heelan durog was the university of east docks a hotel the university of alabama <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stephon gilmore</person> south carolina duo <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> rutgers <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> are you <person player="jason mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason</person> mccrory rutgers 3c guys are missing tonight billy trate flowers <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> and eric rope and here goes blunt again bullying his way out to the 47 yard line brigitta 7 second down and three yeah in a little bit of a surprise here it is now the lions going with two tight ends instead of that typical three wide receiver look and just playing some power football i think getting number 76 the right guard <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person>e back is a huge help there but inside youve got lange and frank rag now who is their rookie who is struggling a bit with pass protection that does very well with the run game second down and three carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> and that is a first down they picked him in the second round again detroit looking for a running game for over a decade a rookie out of auburn led the sec in rushing last year again flowers out with a concussion erick roll would start at a corner with a groin and <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> is still in the concussion protocol brian flores right there he is the nominal defensive coordinator doesnt have the title linebacker coach but with patricia coming here flores calls the defensive signals reaching up for his gold and tape it no incomplete cover there by <person player="jonathan jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jonathan jones</person> explained that i would row out perfect opportunity there for <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden</person> tape the one thing that they have talked about all week this week is our receivers are going to get oneonone coverage we have to win the contested catches we have to be able to go up in this game and win these balls but that was perfectly done that time by <person player="jonathan jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jonathan jones</person> you see him slip the <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> in there and get it down second down and ten play of the lions opening drive after the patriots went for it <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> fires over the middle <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> makes the catch to the 30yard line he goes <person player="jonathan jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jonathan jones</person> makes the tackle and in another detroit first down at 18 yard pickup this is the fatal flaw when youre talking about the new england patriots if the detroit lions can pass protect like this all night long i think this happened to him in a suit nick foles really had all day to throw the football and on the outside there s <person player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">taylor decker</person> with the pass blocking or against evening flavor and he s now probably their best rush happen late one came over from atlanta had six sacks in one game against down here comes your fifth one one escapes the tackle on the backfield and then weaves his way just about back to the line of scrimmage what an interesting case started with tampa he was in new england and then left there went to pittsburgh for about half a season then he came back picked up a couple of super bowl rings left there went to philadelphia last year got a super bowl ring and on to detroit he told us one of the big reasons he decided to come here was because of his relationship with matt patricia he made no bones about it what s the feel so knew they were going to draft the running backs out of the cordy <person player="devon kennard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">devon</person> s twin who came over from cleveland in a trade at the beginning of the year makes the stop when you play the patriots the one thing you have to be able to do is block these big linebackers they are huge a lot of times the backs cant handle it nice job there by the rookie carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> if you cant pick up those guys youre in for a long night there are the twins touma cortese <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> now comes into the backfield for detroit third down and five he flares out goes over the middle and that is tape does he pick up the first a very close as he gets the 20 yard line fleek blakeman as the referee takes a look at the change and says they are a little bit short well if you detroit now i go for it what do you think absolutely let s take a look your side of the screen will be official was not touched not touched and theyre gonna send in the field goal groups in the crowd doesnt like that because that s an 11play drive very affected to this point but now to settle for a 39 yard field goal attempt one of the best ever <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">matt prater</person> couple misses last week out west 55 and 44 <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">sam martin</person> put it down and the cake feels good at least it ends with a store with six minutes to play in the opening frame 3 nothing trick <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is brought to you by toyota i said last year if i the time has no idea where this <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> lives his passing yardage at 38 and 39 years of age both nfl records at that point but he turns 40 last season and what does he do oldest player to lead the nfl in passing yards and wins the mvp award for the third time in his illustrious career he s got my mvp vote for the last three years it s almost impossible to explain hold this mvps in the four major sports barry bonds is 40 carl malone was 35 herb garden he had to go all the way back to montreal in 26 and 27 in the nhl at the age of 35 so brainy at 41 who knows very well do it again line drive campus fielded at the 10 and this is sunny michelle who was back there is one of the up men who will take it back himself to the 26 let s take a look at the detroit deed rickie s <person player="ricky jeanfrancois" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jeanfrancois</person> carol city <person player="sylvester williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">sylvester williams</person> north carolina <person player="deshawn shead" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deshawn</person> hang alabama <person player="christian jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">christian jones</person> florida state jerry davis university of florida <person player="devon kennard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">devon</person> cunard usc neverland lost utah state grover coin new mexico quan great big university of texas <person player="jamal agnew" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jamal agnew</person> san diego <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius</person> big place like mississippi state big place play was in concussion protocol so he fell off had a couple of days ago is grady man swings it out for sonia michelle and hell go no taken down by <person player="ashawn robinson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">robinson</person> matt patricia thus far in the two games rushing yards per game that against the defense a hundred and eighty youre not going to win very much with that and thirty nine and two games the average that seventy eight points and only buffalo coming into this weekend had given up that many no it s not caught its course set on the outside again i mentioned just three wide receivers active tonight theyre sent <person player="cordarrelle patterson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cordarrelle patterson</person> <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">chris hogan</person> for josh mcdaniels offense let s take a look typically all the double teams all the tricks on <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> come on third down the first third down they just went straight mantoman coverage and it was padre dix on it this one looks a little more zone ish for third and 11 spread it out again five receivers lyons fourman rush grady the clean pocket and then throws and it s complete intended for dorset straight over the middle so it s a second straight three and out for the packs youre never going to beat <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> with this kind of time you just simply or not he had to pump fake that one and he just missed that throw door sets a smaller receiver he just missed it but it was wide open brian allen to punt spinning kick and short and takes a detroit sideways and the lions with a very decent field position at the 41 yard line with less than five to go in the quarter three nothing home team because jim bob cooter was hired by caldwell and snapper dove corsa and cooter have had a nice pairing going and not that <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew</person> was necessarily in the meetings but he was very happy when patricia decided to retain the offensive coordinator basically built his system together a lot of input between the two of them so <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> was very good start from the 40yard then he throws it out too blunt spins his way for to the 48yard mine <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> makes two stop al football at its best is when you put in a running formation and throw the ball or throwing formation and run a ball so what theyre doing so far in this game is theyre taking <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette</person> one putting him in the backfield and throwing him the football that is not what you expect out of the detroit lions typically the receivers are <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> and carrion <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> coming once already thought to tonight his careerhigh is three and they give the longer the flagged and carrying on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> for the moment with him flags down to the 48 yard line blakeman says holding offense number 77 10yard penalty replay second down that s frank rag now he was their numberone pick rookie out of arkansas yeah let s take a look at this one there s rag now right there and remember he played center in college so i think there was a little bit of a tough decision for this organization do you play the rookie rag now at center and <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">graham glasgow</person> at guard he has experience out there or do you put the veteran in there at center <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">glasgow</person> and try and develop right now there has been a definite learning curve as far as path protection with him there lady exam second in 12 from the outside <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> the former seattle seahawks tynan sir nathan would loop and that should be a first down run out by landon roberts and one of the things that i think the patriots are going to have a tough time with is their linebackers in coverage landon roberts that time basically got picked by a bunch formation on that side and so there really isnt that great cover linebacker so if they can spread them out the detroit lions and for some man coverage with those linebackers i think they can dictate they have to play a little more zone flanking that stepford let s come in it s it away down or driver stop <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> tackle by mccord e85 well we talked about it when these patriot linebackers blitz they are coming hard landon roberts that time and were here at blunt to pick it up the once again one in the back yield and still throwing the football anna <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> rotating that back it goes there looking through the middle for a first down to the 36 yard line tackled by <person player="jawhaun bentley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bentley</person> that s already detroit s sixth first out of the game here s what this team does really well watch gram <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">glasgow</person> the sinner make that but also rag now when he gets that big frame of his on a linebacker or a defensive back they are going backwards so now it s upside down day again right you end up with <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> in the backfield you run it look <person player="derek rivers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">derek</person> one back there you pass seven wait seven hot into the 36 <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> has incompletions to five different receivers <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> again he can move first down to the 23 yard line tackled by van lloyd i know there s frustration over drag now and his past protection but watch these run blocks he s moving people and theyre doing a heck of a job in there they are going right at the new england patriots i thought the patriots strength was really those big guys and they had and theyre inferior three and itd be tough to run against them not so far the games have a hundred eleven yards patriots have five it snapped up at the line of scrimmage itll be second down and ten with a little over a minute to play in the first quarter yeah and no real surprise for me that the new england patriots are basically saying <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> weve got our secondary banged up wed prefer you to run the football so were seeing a lot of that too deep safety look back there to prevent these wide receivers from getting all the man coverage and getting down the field so so far it s working patriots have always been very good in the red zone they won the first time see how they do here just outside it outside that zone right now the 24 yard line is second down his <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> weinstein finds the open man that s another first down as <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin</person> sets up a first down and go of the nine yard line and that s going to take us in all probability to the end of the quarter and what a quarter for that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> s team 125 yards to five a three nothing lead and knocking on the door and that is the end of the first quarter detroit three new england nothing sunday night football back after these messages nice array of guests coming your way on the tonight show this week including any more from this is us the future base showing oh jane famine all this week on nbc s detroit now michaels cris collinsworth michelle deploy yet week three first quarter numbers all detroit one twenty six two five two three announce for the patriots and eight first downs eight for detroit and they have one here is the second quarter commences with the first and goal of the 9 yard line they start scoring touch touch formation to the left <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> is the running mate it s ridic emotion thank you running inside the five itll be second down and gold this kid has already carried the 31 yards on four totes yeah he s been really impressive i mean sec offensive player of the year at auburn rush for 1,300 91 yards and they really feel like that he was a hidden gem in the draft because they thought he was so much better a receiver than what he was able to show at auburn first two weeks when they get down deep and they guess not run but they ran their second down and goal it s a little short of the goal line they keep the ball that s dominate he couldnt get in it is out of bounds at the oneyard line the ball spinning away <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> makes the stop it s third and goal from the one yard line youll see this little sidearm throw and remember youre to see the receivers foot go across the line but that does not matter does the ball go across the line they dropped oh there it is i think this is going to be a touchdown well they got to challenge it he was ruled out so if patricia wants the challenge we think he s going to win it and here comes the flag the map patricia throw that red flag that s far well i dont know the flag winds up at the 4 yard line that s the farthest red flag throw i have ever seen if he got it from the 25 to the 2 even <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> s former high school made clayton kershaw couldnt have done that there you go his challenging crowd of seeing the replay and they anticipate the touchdown how about that what im talking about good form youre under extended ball beyond the goal line when the challenge the extra point forthcoming now with 48 seconds having elapsed in the second quarter is <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">prater</person> tries to make it 10 to nothing and doesnt what a start hawaiian s 9 first anslo england has none 135 yards for detroit new england has 5 their home of the detroit tigers they played earlier this afternoon then youve got pork field and nearby little caesars arena home of the red wings and the pistons and the fox seal the fabled fox theater here in detroit all saluting we thank them sunday night football san <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">martin</person> will send it into the end zone and through after the 25 will come <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> still looking for a first down there is <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> the big trade of course this week with cleveland for a fifth round draft choice the much suspended and all suspended <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> boy if he can stay active he will be something but he had a slight hamstring pole when they reported maybe he s ready for next week when they have a thursday night game on top of that and then they get <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> back as well after a fourgame suspension what a difference that could make first down here showing michelle so you take a look at their receiving pore here you know you everybody wants to go back to the randy moss thing when washed him over but the difference that made of where s you do in the hall of fame what do you think of the <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> situation depends if he s the 2013 <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> he is gonna be randy moss it was one of the most exciting seasons i think ive ever seen averaged like a hundred and eighteen yards at gain receiving which was like six paths in the history of the national football league but that was a long time ago and you just hope and pray for the kid that he can which birkhead about a yard short of the first down with <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> we go back to 2013 suspended for the first two games suspended 11 games and 1415 the whole year in 60 the whole year again 17 suspended for 11 games and finally in cleveland just certain point you gotta cut bait third and one wrapped up behind the line of scrimmage michelle with a jean <person player="ashawn robinson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">robinson</person> and the england patriots for the third time in a row have got three it out i think there are some people around here going hey hey what s happenin here with these detroit lions this is the team that really had no chance whatsoever to stop the run that might have been <person player="ricky jeanfrancois" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ricky jeanfrancois</person> breaking one there s a flag down home so as you all know following the nfl it s normally against the receiving thing and it will be paul <person player="jamal agnew" race="nonwhite" position="DB">agnew</person> cant catch a break every time he has a good run back it gets called back during the return illegal block in the back return team number 24 10yard penalty from the spot a foul this down detroit it s never been awesome with detroit has it and a 10 nothing lead oh oh nine 35,000 fantasy yarns foot six and sixty seven this record it s the perfect way to put it twenty four point one points per game allowed by the lions in the start second highest for a quarterback with one team so he does not get the defensive support or hazard and of course sir weve mentioned the time after time no running game maybe theyll get one now with blunt and carrying on seven yard line in 5 second down and five it s a difficult situation you want to protect this secondary a little bit and i understand that weve got some young players back there <person player="jason mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason mccourty</person> taken over from erik row <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> is such a huge part of this defense he s sort of that swiss army knife can handle all the different things so now basically theyre having to bring their free safety out of the middle <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> theyre playing drawn <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> that s a lot of moving parts on this patriots defense in <person player="jc jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jc jackson</person> 27 savage sidearms roberts makes the tackle loss of two third and seven for the lions it s really starting to set up i think that this may possibly be a game in which the detroit lions tight ends and not everybody knows a lot about him but <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilson</person> came over from c came over from atlanta so youve got some guys that really havent made a lot of catches so far but if they continue with the linebackers on those guys big opportunities out the door he s now at indianapolis if <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">riddick</person> the past counselor back in the backfield on third down seven the 40 yard line by <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> so in third and long they convert that s their tenth first down cross and makes the tackle now this is all about protection if you can hold out these guys for this long some of these routes that you want to develop down the field there s a receiver you get so frustrated sometimes when youre in man coverage because you know theyre going to end up blitzing for or bringing some pressure off the edge so you have to accelerate your route but with that protection it gave these receivers an opportunity to work it down the field im just tying in and statistic <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> eat daffy with a flag thrown coverage is good downloading the intended receiver complete blakeman will be the next voice you will hear now there was a lot of contact going back and forth with <person player="jc jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jc jackson</person> it s like theyre trying to figure out if it was in the air before fire the past holding defense looking at a maryland playing with crossed another rookie so you get a little delay while they do the flea flicker and then try to take off and let s see what <person player="jc jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jc jackson</person> does at that point what do you think mmm we have an official in the booth now im letting head make all those calls even the small ones like encroachment roadsides delay of game 12minute information on the defense to fiveyard penalty third of the way into the game bill belichick has not seen his team looked like this very often well in fairness there are a lot of guys who arent patriot you know used to playing in this uniform out there on the field right now so indoctrination period here as well and their former defensive coordinators on the other side of the field right around the outside his <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> stays inbounds and he stepped out at the that s where we stepped out of bounds the was first in five so a first down and much more ill tell this carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> is making an impression i thought dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> had him take a look watch <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> right there and he looks like he s in perfect position and <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> just outran him to the edge got it turned up the field saying this offensive line looks a million times better than they did a week ago while his number again for a short game about the 33 yard line second down in 7f regina 3 could this possibly be the night that the detroit lions have a running back go over a hundred yards reggie bush right thanksgiving wow 2013 70 games since theyve had a hundred yard rusher and right now <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> already has 48 and one has 21 safeties are forced to come down and then you get the true oneonone matchups with a single safe we like they have on the field rightness one of three super bowl rings to the 27yard line third and two so here s what im talking about at one time they were here and here now theyre here and this <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> s starting to creep down a little bit but now he s still backing up so you want to be patient you know who your quarterback is you know what this offense is capable of doing but it s going to be interesting to see those safeties will tell the story of how bill belichick feels about the way the detroit lions the lady sauce to me then at this point to the 22 yard line he goes he led the team in rushing over the first two weeks and he has 54 yards already tonight and that s 13 first downs for detroit and none for new england <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person>e is one of the better players in the national football league and the best lineman on this team he was out last week but that is a heck of a reach block right there to get that edge on a big third down conversion around three times as many plays as the patrons 2079 through the second quarter and incomplete good coverage that time youve got gilmour against jones in a marquee matchup second down and ten that is a marquee matchup and <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stephon gilmore</person> is the unquestioned best quarterback on the patriots right now he s on the outside here and watch this position he never lets the speaks tour <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> get ahead up that is usually the receivers trying to stack the other way but <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> we saw it in the super bowl as well as he made the switch over and made the oneonone coverage on the outside what a difference it made in that game now they have to start thinking about going after the others and some point <person player="jason mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason</person> authority will be challenged that s ridic about a yard shy the first now <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> getting into the action for snapped by gillen more was a heck of a play by ben roethlisberger i mean bad thing <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> is he was under attack how many times have we seen roethlisberger just stand there and somehow get the thing out of his <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> brilliant quarterback play really is with the way that theyre calling some sacks right now i think some quarterbacks are thinking all right are they got to blow that play dead at some point third in the juice which means swinging out <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> carry on and jensen picks up the first down 189 yards making 194 now after that for detroit and 13 for the patriots the weakness of this defense is going to be can these linebackers cover these running backs out of the backfield i dont think they cant i dont think they have this to keep up with carrion <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> and <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> coming out in the backfield i dont think matt patricia believes it either do these guys he knows their weakness so far taking advantage lady waiting it first and goal here you know blend reminds you a lot of you know marshawn lynch we were talking too about that the other day says he spends a lot of time watching lynch videos on youtube yeah you can understand that you know what he s also become a little bit of the ambassador you know the detroit lions are going through a transition you talked about the to our practices the one thing that the new england patriots have always done is just work harder than everybody else and so far that patricia is trying to bring that here and it has been a bit of a hard lefthand turn for a lot of these guys and when it would really help them buy in today second down and goal caught out of bounds its gala day who s there but he is on the truck we saw <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> along that sideline front street but they have had the ball for four minutes he s gonna have to warm up again she s a character a ledee now he didnt make this play or diddy now i think that left heel was down but out ive seen him make catches like that game after game he is one of the most impressive catchers of the football ive seen this year six for second year out of northern turn goal to the end zone hi <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> in the back of the endzone didnt get up the snagit and in comes praetor to try to make it a thirteenth a nothing game to a fastball yeah out of the strike zone just like <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> the one thing that happens to quarterbacks when theyve got to get it out of their <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> quickly sometimes they just sail the ball we saw <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> do it the first time he saw the bartman jones had a chance tried to get it there too quickly and it sailed off crater now is the record from history of 64 years and the lions extend the lead with little less than 5 to the half 13nothing lions all the voice premieres tomorrow night all right alan chris over to you in detroit all right tell me look forward to the next episode of the voice i have a detroit board filled america park right there and it s all been the lions to this point 13 to nothing every category totally one side soon we let it go <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> will start at the 25 back in 30 seconds for tonight s game stats powered by the ws let s take a look at our next gen stats powered by a double us since 2016 on throws to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> that guys expected catch rate is 54% that is actual catch rate is over 66% the difference 124% above is expected catch rate the highest in the national football league he s not catching anything unless you throw the ball not even one target so far out here tonight now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is 2 out of 5 theyve only had the ball from 9 plays 3 3 announce over the middle progress will take and almost to the line but a little short quandary <person player="quandre diggs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">diggs</person> makes the stop itll be second down in inches right here we go with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> weve been trying to see exactly how they were going to play him early downs he does not get all the double coverage so maybe the plan was hey let s see what happens if we start throwing that way on first half the outside must change who s going to be taken down and he didnt get to the line to gain so it s gonna be third and one to maybin makes the stop you know the detroit lions linebackers are really almost the complete opposite of the patriots theyre smaller theyre faster they can and coverage you saw a little bit of it right there out of <person player="jalen reevesmaybin" race="UNK" position="LB">reevesmaybin</person> mass bringing a fullback devlin ray v of course sneaks for a first down a lot this time were going to and he s going to get there first first down of the game but just barely out to the 36 yard line well this sonia michelle is a pretty impressive young man i mean he really had a knee injury really missed all a preseason and yet you get the feeling that he is about to become their goto back he is about to be he s already currently like first and second down could you give me feeling as you said he could be out there a lot more from the 36 yard line lead devlin in the game the faith but the coverage is good to me as fling it away into the patriot bench second down one of the things that i dont think people appreciate enough is the blocking of <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> yes he has it in the run game but so many times he has to pass protect before he goes out they were trying to get the ball down the field to <person player="phillip dorsett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">phillip dorsett</person> who really has taken over the brandon cooks role but brandon cooks he talked to some of the people with the patriots he was a special <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> at those he was arguably the top deep threat in the league a season ago baby dancing troy the 50yard line that s croc for a first out of midfield spot going down to the 3minute mark just big zone defenses on the outside now for <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> youre so afraid he adjusts everything you do defensively youre so afraid of leaving just blonde gray digs on him one on one so you try and mix up the coverages i personally dont think the detroit lions play zone defenses very well theyre much better in maine in detroit territory <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> is the back and it s <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> 20 points in the super bowl a couple of years ago to the 44 during the last lion series take a look at this here was <person player="tom brady" race="white"

tackle that s going to make a third down and one detroit really does a nice job of that three safety levels 18 yard line louver quinn makes michelle down in his fourth down yeah we speaking of that free safety look two of the safeties made that play that was a combo sandwich time out here <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">stephen gostkowski</person> longtime patriot kicker boy they hit the gold mine had been eteri and then this <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> came in so like the quarterback situation in green bay you bet 36 yard attempt after the drive was consumed 57 yards bogged down and the patriots finally get on the board with 40 seconds remaining it s now 13 3 were back in 30 seconds totally remixed introducing the allnew volkswagen jetta coming up on the toyota halftime sunday in 60 seconds the best of week 3 tiger very emotional efforts first one in five years at beast mode mic in the game were ready to bring it to you on the toyota halftime yeah congratulations the tiger that was great wow yeah been a long time they had a little bit of that look in his eye again theyre done he did that one holy look too im gonna get the ball at the 25 yard line 40 seconds and two timeouts tale of two coaches right get the teacher got the pupil and one has the old school paper and look at it that way the other one with the surface in <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> showing about it the other way and then when theyre on the defensive side course you got a pencil follow the leader on that one that s routine the patricia s got a pointing forward and bill s got a pointing backward yeah patricia turned his hat around he did miss herman that red polka too starts going off asleep snacker almost the first handy the tape for a gain of 11 i love this so many times you know 40 seconds youre backed up a little bit you just kind of go okay were just gonna sit on it go in at halftime with the lead but it changes the momentum of the game it just does get the ball out to a <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> like <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> who is as elusive as any wide receiver we have seen in the nfl over the past four or five years almost impossible for the first <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> to make the tackle for that matter to the second <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> to make the tackle very safe throw but as an offense you stay engaged you still want to be out there attacking even if you dont get points in detroit trying to get at least three and they really get the time the lions will be second half kickoff realities in the backfield <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> throws and then trying to find the sidelines again skinny holliday he s a little short of the first down and the lions will have to take a timeout here with 25 seconds well the stage is set for the us to defend its 2016 win on foreign soil from paris youre gonna see the ryder cup starting friday on golf channel continuing saturday at 3 am eastern on nbc <person player="justin stockton" race="UNK" position="RB">justin</person> rosalind the fedex cup

ryder cup is pretty like watching the olympics almost second down and one taking a pop there pj jones been hit by <person player="jonathan jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jonathan jones</person> clock has to run snapper and see the spikes and here he does i was wondering about the hit there every time you get a hit like that got to start thinking about it right looks like he did get him with the shoulder it s bringing terror out of there bringing kerry mccauley our rules analyst terry longtime former referee what do you think so i think the the receivers just bracing for context and no foul on him and the finish is trying to make a wrapup tackle i dont see any forcible contact to the head and neck area and certainly not defenseless anymore and it s not roughing the passer stoppage here for new england to take a timeout well weve been talking about <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> and look at all these arm angles tonight you talk about pictures that can drop down and deliver the different throws well it takes a special <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> with a special arm to be able to do all these different angles there s that reverse see they talk about when he needs to really crank one up no problem either he is a special talent and it s really because of the fact they havent been able to run the ball because of some of the issues on the defense may be underestimated as a player overall but his numbers stack up with anybody he could be koufax and drysdale over the top or side on second down and 10 snapper fires he s got a first down but that should take us to triple zeros and it does detroit will get the second half kickoff what a half of these guys score is 13 3 let

brady</person> will make a run in the second half always hurt you in the red zone well in terms of the day in the nfl we saw a quarterback return from injury and a quarterback with a significant

jimmy garoppolo is injured in san francisco fear that it may be an acl injury more on that after the mri as to the green bay story and the roughing the passer for the third straight week really clay matthews in the middle of well i know the league is trying to clean up the game trying to make it a safer game but at the same time clay matthews he s doing everything he can within his power to avoid helmet to helmet he s trying to avoid putting his weight on a quarterback i dont know what else you can do as a football player trying to make a play like safety is important protecting the quarterback is important but we just had to let the referees do their job we all know the difference between driving a <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> into the ground and falling on and falling on and should not be a penalty by rule called correctly it s the rule that is real reason the eye of a lot of time to go leave get the car parking spots the elite

cars trucks and suv s back in detroit downtown detroit river is their bachelor bridge in the background ford field now michaels chris collinsworth michele tafoya 13 to 3 detroit leading it dominating in every category crazy started one for four picks it up on that plan which resulted in these buse in the first half yardage for the passage 14 and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> on the night where he s on a face for 300 yards what else is new in detroit was more than a semblance of a warning attack a long time now this offensive line lions will start from the 25 and we start with michelle well the lions have allowed war points in the third quarter than any team this season in any quarter heading into this weekend a managers have told me this third quarter is critical we know the patriots are gonna make adjustments we have to stay out in front of them as for bill belichick i asked him what his priorities were you said everything it s not just one thing it s everything we have to do better now take a look at those stats we fell and he s right offense defense <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> takes over a first drive of the second half darion <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> in the backfield to the 33yard line chris a lot of good play on that offensive line but maybe this one the most startling the play of frank rag now the center in college watch how powerful he is in the run game he is moving people those are big linebackers and big defensive linemen he is moving out of the way at making it so easy for <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> and carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> to do their deal pass protection was an issue last week next deforest buckner who s one of the best players in the national football league not so much he is rushing for detroit and he will stay a baby over the left side then looking third down and three a little bit of emotion now coming out of patrons different wives trying to get and there is here you look for those guys you know theyve got some key guys out of this game <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey flowers</person> not playing up front you need some energy no <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> no eric row as well the two starting defensive backs in the best banks russian third floor it s intersected at the 50yard line so a big turnover there <person player="jawhaun bentley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bentley</person> with the takeaway for new england they rookie out of purdue jajuan <person player="jawhaun bentley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bentley</person> pretty special right here youre going to get this post pattern and i think is <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> it throwing it up over the top we might add a touchdown i tried to throw a line drive and that allowed <person player="jawhaun bentley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bentley</person> to come underneath and make the play but that is exactly if youre a lions fan what you did not want to see happen in this first drive because somewhere in atlanta theyre thinking no lead is safe first turnover of the game and michelle was an 11yard pickup behind a trent brown watch the monster at him from the 49ers played his college football florida 16 and 380 pounds his brown areas i want you to imagine being number 24 and evan <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> when 68 and 355 pounds is coming at you it shows to the outside for the two or three flank with maybe a face mask with a relatively penaltyfree game that would be from complete wow facemask defense number 24 15yard penalty first down and that is <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> now right at the end of the play just as he was going out of bounds there you go what i think would have been okay if he could have gotten his <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> out of there soon enough but this is what you have to worry about that patricia was saying what you have to be concerned with is that new england explosion at some point in the game they are going to explode on you and you have to hang in there you have to make a play in these guys situations after a turnover and he knows the first <person player="dashawn hand" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hand</person> here s understand another flag here it s awesome making the tackle holding offense number 77 10yard penalty so first down so we highlighted trent brown there s the penalty on big number 77 yeah when offensive lineman gets surprised is when they hold he thought the play was going inside there when it bounced out here you just naturally youre always grabbing and holding a little bit see the shoulder pad grab right there then it bounces outside then it becomes really obvious to the official happens all the time then it s hands on the line back of you line moving back first down in 20 let s keep finding his way close to a first down so branca was silent until the waning moments of the first half has now picked it up of almost 20 yards a second down a gator another first down throw to drunk again when he doesnt get the doubleteams as much on those early downs you think back to the super bowl when did the patriots get it going and they started forcefeeding guac in the second half <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was sneak so professionally that through the years almost always converts on the third and one or fourth and one picks it up here on a second and one i know matt patricia knows this josh mcdaniels if you leave a gap up there like the detroit lions just left on that play whether he has it played that play called or not the quarterback snake he s just gonna tap the center and go let s go weve done about 200 times yeah <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> frank and weve got a safety lien way to help so opportunities back to throw the ball play clock was going all the way down and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> saw it and takes a timeout i think it won think when you look at the the patriots right now and it s an early season game how big can it be well you know if you if you lose the game and you go home one and two and next week youre playing a team that s three you know miami at home and youre already two games back yeah and flip it around there s robert kraft jonathan up there working on their 300th right he s looking for his 300th win there s an owner pretty amazing what that group of men along with <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and bill belichick theyve done at this organization they were terrible they took over over shoots berkut berkut looking back straight back covered by <person player="jalen reevesmaybin" race="UNK" position="LB">reevesmaybin</person> and be second down at ten big <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> on the outside trent brown but youre going to get a good rush out here by <person player="romeo okwara" race="nonwhite" position="DE">romeo</person> or quora there s a saying in football low man wins and you can see what that means right there it s going to be a battle for brown at all times during the course was career to stay low talk to michelle breaks a tackle davis momentarily that s going to make a third down and eight yeah here s the speed of jared davis this is the inside linebacker who can absolutely fly and break up plays sometimes it gets burned doing this but every once while he flashes that speed that initial contact slowed him down just enough on kowski out to the right and double team we talk to get at the crime boggan is the motion ran by james wright for touchdown 52yard 7 play is coming after the interception takes from three and a half minutes right back in it anytime you doubleteam <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> youve got to leave somebody else one on one and that has always been how the patriots win games and they do it so many times with these backs out of the backfield this time <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> really pretty nice coverage down the field that time by quan dre <person player="quandre diggs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">diggs</person> but that is the oneonone matchup and nobody finds the one on one s better than <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> ill say this though the number one option on every pass play they have is <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> it takes two for them to get off of him zone disgusting with the extra point and five minutes into the third quarter it is a three point game board filled in detroit bill ballast is a lot of law for detroit he was the assistant special teams coach in 76 receivers coach in 77 he had actually started as an intern in baltimore with <person player="ted karras" race="white" position="OG">ted</person> marchibroda but this was his first real coaching job there s the man in the middle is rick horizontal who hired him there is bill it s been two years here was telling us a lot of stories last night about those two seasons forty years ago and you know what it has led to right now it s led to getting right back into the game down by three points this booze cosby kicks off start from the 25 one of the stories was martha ford and she s here tonight lovely lady in her 90s the widow of william clay ford martha firestone for she would send a christmas card and she sent has sent them every year for over 40 years and the other thing the fords did is he remembers he was making 10,000 bucks a year he got a $5,000 bonus and a ford thunderbird it wasnt all bad no he said the cards the nicest card i get every single year it means so much to me that they continued to send it said i was a nobody assistant coach here and yet they treat me like family he was one classy lady and sacra s going to get taken down and that s <person player="deatrich wise" race="UNK" position="DE">wise</person> who s lighting a fire under the defense on the lawn did some of that emotion now coming out of here why is going to come around he had a big first game he had one and a half sacks and week one against the texans there and just goes right around <person player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">taylor decker</person> who is a very good pass blocker can struggle against the run sometimes but that was a bigtime play and the patriots in his emotion making a difference second out of 17 it s funny we talked about virginia mccaskey we had the chicago riding first lady of the chicago bears martha ford sharp is attack love visioning with her you know there s just the difference when there s a lady in the room is it there there s just the difference when there s a lady involved and the great game of football as well third and nine now 26 yard line there s the momentum back as holliday makes the catch on the third and nine he gets free along the sidelines venus sixteen okay this is as good a throw as youre going to see <person player="jonathan jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jonathan jones</person> is going to be right underneath this throw that s coming out like this and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> and yet inside the boundary that was something special by mathew staff picks it out to the 49yard line <person player="jason mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason</person> were 40 stops him there in a 7 second down and 3 just in case youre wondering <person player="tj jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tj jones</person> out there is able to block because it s within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage right there so anything in that little <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> line is legal clearly within that <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> line nicely executed on second and four spot at the 48 yard line come here for <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> across the 50yard line he goes third down and one more than halfway through the third quarter im always amazed at the ability of the patriots defense to stay so patient i mean they have just remained back they have watched the detroit lions and what is typically not a very good running game have a good day running the football yet they stay back to prevent those big plays their feeling is theyre not going to get beat on runs theyre gonna get beat by these wide receivers making big plays down the field but an opportunity here that they wanted to take a shot man coverage across the board the floor is the nominal defensive coordinator third down and one rolled in at the 45yard even one got about four that s carryon <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> making the catch and it moves the sticks okay yeah if i had to make one throw to the detroit lions right now based on what ive seen this year and a big moment in a big play <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> right there wouldnt be too bad at all getting the ball to him and he gets to the 40yard line <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> 23 of 39 <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> has averaged 39 passes a game in his career it s 10 a quarter and they will do anything they can get the football to <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> in the open field he catches more balls behind the is because he is probably well without question has been the single most elusive receiver in the game very difficult to get your hands on one seven five he was drunk everything from scrimmage based on what theyre really sets up a third down and one as <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> takes the ball to that spot his team right now detroit averaging of one more than averaging their totals 94 yards theyre averaging almost 5 yards per rush i have not seen <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> stand on the sidelines this much since he was injured i mean it just feels like it has been the detroit lions on offense all night they go man coverage and really get <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> a shot that step on to go more move the sticks and the reason you havent seen <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> that much of the time of possession detroit is 20 minutes and the women is 12 tell you what pay attention now to this offensive line what were getting out of these interior three and maybe in particular frank rag now is they are getting movement this is a big bunch over there on the defensive line i mean the malcolm browns and the <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">lawrence guy</person>s and the <person player="danny shelton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">danny shelton</person> those are big people what s playing on that d line from the 33 yard line sacré deep <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> talking about having to take shots having to connect and there it is 75 yards then place a big early third down conversion im really surprised on the coverage on this one the patriots all the time when you go across the formation that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> goes there and the corner just falls back to center field they did not do it on this one i dont know why you look like <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> was almost expecting it and the speed of <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> made him pay and maybe that s where you really miss <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">prater</person> with the extra point to gray point with 3:45 remaining in the third quarter detroit 20 new england 10 on sunday night football oh boy hey rona inviting you to find a newer beach across the highway from 14 detroit s eastern market founded in 1841 doubles as a farmers market saturdays houses tailgaters on game day so far been a pretty good game david his crowd their squad leading 20 to 10 the kick his field with a four yards deeper <person player="cordarrelle patterson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cordarrelle patterson</person> back to the touchdown we go jerrod <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> playing and centerfield back that youre going to seek <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> watch him almost go straighten up the field and then almost point to say he s yours and then he realized that doron <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> was not going to pick him up and all <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> could do is chase at that point and finally a big play for <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> theyve been over five on those <person player="dee virgin" race="UNK" position="DB">dee</person> so far this year each early third down conversion on that drive and go 75 as <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">chris hogan</person> who comes up a little bit short of the first down <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">chris hogan</person> had a great super fall detonate and he is trying to do the impossible and replace <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> in the slot he s not a slot receiver and theyve had so many great ones here in the past but that was a very nice little inandout move gentlemen would have been proud of that one behind a fullback you have a second down the escort first now adam schefter reporting today that there was a trade in the works a serious one with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> coming to detroit just around the time of the draft and that <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> went in and said im not accepting the trade and i taking the phone call im gonna stay in the winglet or not at all and for everything we know that s exactly what happened yeah he was going to retire and he let it be known and i think it was believed by both parties because the trade went away stay with <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> break from the 45yard line hipster that s on the near side you know every time you look at the patriots chris it s like it doesnt matter if book comes out youve got rumors youve got interviews youve got everything going and it s like it s almost like with their success it s like when mark twain once said reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated you know for them it s if there s one mantra it s on to cincinnati and it s part of the price you pay for that level of success right i mean if youre finishing last every year theyre not writing books about nobody cares they care about the painful second and ten sets off and the pencils dropped by selling the shell out of the flat <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> also gets flat and it s third down and ten one of the things i love getting a chance to do with bill belichick is ask him some real detailed football questions i ask something the other day for two minutes about so out of our leaf in this conversation not really going to say that was all third and ten <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> in the back film or man russ with protection it starts to break down <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> comes back around comes up a little bit short for town double coverage there on <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and theyre going to take a shot anyway got the underneath coverage and then you got the safety over the top and glimmer quinn really nicely played though on the outside by <person player="deshawn shead" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deshawn</person> shed the former seattle seahawk he was good sam to a great year in 2016 see your bounce back kick 9 around the corner he goes right to punch back for touchdowns last season and steps out at about the 25 yard line 158 left in the third detroit by 10 the oregon stanford notre dame saturday 7:30 eastern on nbc that used to be brig stadium then tiger stadium and the tigers played before they went to comerica park and it s now a ball field very close to where we are i so reggie <person player="jc jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jackson</person> in 1971 hit a home run at that stadium and the allstar game that almost landed up in canada there are the mccourty boys 40 twins which <person player="devon kennard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">devon</person> s been here a long time and <person player="jason mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason</person> s just joined them at the beginning of the season really good football players and nice old <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> 4:15 i love watching this <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> cant watch <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> get across the formation here and make this block not only did he get there but he was athletic enough to stay in front and that big gap you saw the back run through was courtesy of tj lane what a difference he has made coming back from the entry week to go fiftythree down down but look out starting to creep down justice english safety theyve got to play this holy now they cannot just stop it cant let them get up all the clock three second and seven and the next snap will be under a minute to go in the third quarter you know the one thing out that the new england patriots continue to do and brian flores theyre their de facto defensive coordinator is they do a lot of gapping with that defensive line a gap simply means instead of running up the field and trying to go get to quarterback get your hands on the offensive lineman in front of you and hold it hold them there so that you can go to the left to make a play or go to the right and make a play we want those arms extended by those defensive lineman in their bench press of all funny stanford that s gonna be a first down that s going to be <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden</person> tape follow into the 32yard theyre on harlan with the tackle lions on the move again that s a gain of 25 and that is going to take us to the final quarter play three in detroit and the lions the patriots 22:10 sunday night football resumes after these messages michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya start the fourth quarter hundred yard rushers the lions have gone four and a half years 70 games without a hundred yard rushers if you push the last two do it during that stretch there have been four hundred twenty eight hundred yard rushing games in the nfl done by a hundred and seven different guys and tonight tonight we dont want to give this the kibosh but that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> is very close already 12 carries 86 yards anyone garrett what is in the game right now on a first and ten when the patriot 3288 to the 19 yard line i mean these are some of the biggest holes ive seen the national football league youre gonna get get oriented here down down down and in here like this get a kick out block across the way look at the size of that hole i mean that s peewee football sized holes and then the worst news for defensive backs you get a satellite like garrett blood coming down on a safe reduce they got three big guys in there along the defensive line the press is gonna tip it out to the fullback for more up there by landon roberts taken down for the loss here five yards in fact second down and 15 you know when theyre starting to take seriously play in the run when they go to that triple reduction that s what matt patricia tried to do out in san francisco and in their first game against the jets and it was a train wreck it was a disaster they were really bad at doing it so they got completely away from it today with good reason now fela tech can loosen back up a little bit after that big first lady 15 swings it into the ground and then completely third down and 15 was a fast game weve had only six accepted penalties and no injuries yeah you really have to give some credit here matt patricia and i think his knowledge of this defense let s be realistic there are a lot of really good players not playing tonight for the new england patriots either but i think knowing the strengths and weaknesses of every single player we asked <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> about it and he said that was the biggest thing that he gave to us we knew exact things that they did well and what they didnt do 13:15 snappers stepping up snappers keep it out of bounds at about the 14 yard line providing an easier shot now for the field goal group as <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">prater</person> comes in even when they havent scored touchdowns theyve been going up and down the field tonight and the best defense and the best way to beat <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is to leave them over there drinking gatorade well 374 yards for detroit tonight 1:33 for the patriots the pace is about the quickened for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> 32yard attempt and he s 31 is good 44 left in a regulation it s 23 to 10 lions tonight where the outside temperature is around 60 the windless team steelers lions cardinals lose today so the raiders as did the texans crazy day though you got the packers losing or get the vikings getting stunned lions trying to get to one and two in the nfc north chicago winning at arizona the kick is fielded by <person player="cordarrelle patterson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cordarrelle patterson</person> is very good as he gets stuffed at the 21yard line back in 30 seconds stop ins at 3m oh he poked them today in the bucs play tomorrow night against philadelphia against chile against pittsburgh brainy starts to strive with a deep drop in it a bunch of blue shirts out there second down in 10 well when <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> gets it going nobody can go through his progression like this <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> right here check this out he s got his first raid didnt like it in second read im gonna come off of that up by the way im gonna step up and avoid the pass rush why am i running back coming out is read number three part of the reason he s had plenty of time to do that neither of these teams with too much of a bash rush you know wondering if they talking about grounding you can have grounding on a deep pitch to short the super bowl that s the little few years ago there was nobody down they went <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> through it deep downfield i didnt see anybody close and i think that s what the discussion is the question is was he under pressure because if he wasnt then you cant have it i just think i think he was expecting somebody terry what do you think terry mccauley yeah well i see i see him under pressure number 42 is right next to him when he throws the football there s nobody even close to where the ball lands that should be a foul frontal around there yes yeah they just do it we saw that in the patriots super bowl please ten yards in the previous spot it s a loss of down from second down inside the tackle box is the under pressure has to be i would say under pressure and it really didnt feel like somebody ran around it did kind of feel like he was just getting rid of the only over to dorset by 25 yards that quick second and 20 and he gets some of that back as he hits <person player="cordarrelle patterson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cordarrelle patterson</person> up at the 22 yard line ena 12 itll be third down and eight that <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> motion way tucks that left elbow in there tried at home make the throwing motion tuck that left elbow in there hard and what it does is it forces the ball way over the top look at that release point way over the top and works on it all the time they third down play under 12 minutes to drive alive on the third and eighth watch the time surveying coming back the other way that s a perfect sack of ive ever seen one down he goes at the 19 yard line you have the ball that longer <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> you know that the secondary has done a masterful job it just has to be an answer for somebody other than <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> pure doubleteam all the way across the field no way theyre going to give them that and there s <person player="cordarrelle patterson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cordarrelle patterson</person> on the outside well covered various leg the quarks well come back in two weeks and he takes it at the 29 black is down to the 39 they make it <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> ready for next week conceivably he s inactive tonight and then <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> for sure two games from now you know what al though it s hard <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> how hard it is to learn what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s doing at the line of scrimmage they want to go so fast the package with him would have to be so limited at this point everybody knows when he comes into game playing deep right dont give up a big play and the lions fans are doing this tenyard penalty from the spot a fire pushed down the toilet tracey <person player="tracy walker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">walker</person> but detroit has the ball and with eleven minutes to play the network by geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance by rocket mortgage by quicken loans america s largest mortgage lender and by microsoft surface patricia 14 years last six as defensive 14 he owns three super bowl rings all right roy starts with 21 in the fourth quarter through the years moves the chains he lose the clock along take a look since 2010 most fourthquarter rushing yards lesean mccoy and blunt this next the one thing that they were determined to do bob quinn insisted that this team get tougher physically that they learn how to run the football that they convert third downs and things they couldnt do they grab right now dancing right there he s been stopping the line of scrimmage so itll be third and let s call it seven now but here s the moment i know the patriots havent done much tonight on offense but it is still top rated and you have to stay aggressive you just have to assume that that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> is going to do what he has done throughout the course of his career make it interesting by the time we clicked down to double zeros so this play here is really important the first man to take another two minutes off to class there s two safeties the toughest to throw the ball into that there is fourman rush <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> throws and that s incomplete beverages good dj jones cutting across the field with him is <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gilmore</person> and in comes the punting unit yeah instead of staying too deep they ended up going alert coverage to get these crossing routes the crossing routes really beat up the made reeds a week ago and had an opportunity there but <person player="stephon gilmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stephon gilmore</person> too good first punt of the night for the lions <person player="cyrus jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cyrus jones</person> is back to receive the cake from <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">martin</person> falls for a fair catch at the very last second and makes it at the 26 with 918 remaining in the fourth through the years when <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> gets matched up with a former coordinator neither offensive or defensive mangini cornell mcdaniel score obrien seven and three mark my tv interception mark of twenty two and four with it tripledigit rating last time he lost a game to a former coordinator when mangie news with the browns back in 2010 they started to drive from 26 yard line was shown in the shell the rookie firstround draft pick for that it s only nine second than one and we go to michele well <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is down yet another weapon rexburg burkett doing running back went back to the locker room he s being evaluated for a neck injury he went back there with the unaffiliated rama consultant they are required for neck injuries keep in mind he had a concussion week one as well finish that game diagnosed later well keep an eye on it right michelle that s molly we havent seen it very much tonight as they pick up the first down and more on a run by michelle over left guard out to the 41 yard line 8:40 left one of the lines that we love from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> last night was that most organizations dont have the competitive stamina to follow through the grind of those two our practices on friday the grind of the offseason it s hard for people do they win a game they victory monday off they dont take days off in the window that phrase contended to the stamens you know especially you come back off a loss as <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has done through his career a regular season loss and in the game following the patriots loss he s 43 and 10 yeah and that s what matt patricia and bob quinn are trying to do with the detroit lions build those calluses make practice so hard that you get into the games and you get into these situations and it s easy a lot of teams you know want to stay healthy that s not what these two teams are all about something beneath the double coverage and it s intercepted intended for dorset that s <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius</person> big playing the sleigh with a very big play and a flag on the run back and another one comes into the end of the play <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> who was in concussion protocol until late in the week double coverage on terrset deep downfield with the pick and the penalty should be in regard to the run back <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius slay</person> has some of the best ball skills youll find in the nfl eight interceptions a season ago and you see why very comfortable he was never uncomfortable on that route ends up down with the football you go after him at your own risk return personal foul understand off this blindside block on the defense number 32 first down the toy and holding on <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon wilson</person> 723 left away from tonight we go to pittsburgh not that there s any drama there baltimore against the steelers on sunday night football football night begins at 7:00 eastern time steelers tomorrow going to take night sunday night and this is carrying on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> to the 23 and back we go to the <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> interception watch <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius slay</person> here keeping his vision on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> this is a zone on the outside but he knows exactly what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s going to do he knows it s a little bit of desperation time under total control of that he read <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> who was trying to look off the safety but slave was not fooled and what a difference having him in this game he had a concussion against san francisco week ago they werent certain whether he would play or not practice friday three huge here he s milked the clock on second down and six flag is taken get one jones covering itll be third down and six we were just talking about it out defensively format patricia s team hasnt really been that one player that has dominated <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">slay</person> just made that big play there but nobody with more than four tackles garrett davis and <person player="christian jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">christian jones</person> on that this has just been one of those grinded out great efforts and i think you have to begin to look at this patriots team and go okay how good are they right now what team they pete was used to houston hasnt won a game let s first add more after mathilde the point you made chris on the pregame show tonight he said you know it took the names and numbers are up the back youve got <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> youve got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and then most of the rest of the top guys are on detroit absolutely check out credit he was just so elusive he that is his choice whatever <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> wants to do there <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> is just going to watch it you want to break inside break inside you want to break outside break outside and there arent very many people in this league sign back or safety or otherwise it can cover that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> coming on the back lady exactly run the play clock shoo up another 35 seconds or so so now theyre playing the run on first down no question about it we did this reduce look with these three guys in there got more people around the line of scrimmage so they have no choice theyve been playing the pass all day long but it has been the detroit lions offensive line in this running game i can barely believe im saying that tonight but that s exactly what is won the football game at least at this point for the detroit lions who just came home from dinner you look at the score youre rubbing your eyes second nine let me get third down and bellatrix them to take a timeout and start conserving the clock with detroit trying to run all the way down patriots came into the only three wide receivers they thrown seven times completed three tight ends three receptions and that would figure of course that s all <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and the running backs they normally go to them a ton just five receptions on nine targets yeah and not one pass play over twenty yards right they had one of 19 to 2 of 19 and they need help in it maybe it s that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> right there who knows <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> may end up somehow you have to get some distributions somehow you have to get people off of <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> and without brandon cooks they dont have that person right 30second timeout here snacker flag is down then on the offensive backfield holding offense number 68 the 10yard penalty replay third down daddy <person player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">decker</person> negating the first down it was just completely unnecessary they had great protection youll see claiborne try a little spin move here and as he did <person player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">decker</person> got his hands right there and the officials able to see that one but it has really been and i and i know the patriots are missing their best pass rushing tonight <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey flowers</person> not being able to play because of his concussion that s it was a real factor in the game were down in 18 almost into the 45 it goes well that s gonna be 101 yards unless he loses a couple of yards on subsequent runs it s going to be the firt it s almost like the crowd senses it too they know it they know it s been four and a half years since they had a <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> rushed for a hundred yards and the rookie does it and it s going to be carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> s name that is going to break that streak but let me tell you something mal <person player="taylor decker" race="white" position="OT">taylor decker</person> in particular frank bragg now <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">graham glasgow</person> <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> and rickey <person player="ricky wagner" race="UNK" position="OT">wagner</person> i came in here thinking the right side of this offensive line had a chance to be really good and they are but tonight the rest of them have really impressed and i think frank rac now is we have to talk about him as a potential game but here in new england it s final timeout they have and we stopped the clock at the twominute warning and theyre gonna have four and a half two trying to get a couple of touchdowns little bit of a recap tonight you joined us late that start for <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> and company vacuum the typical number 216 who yards very untypical for that <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> 105 yards 1 td 1 interception hawaiian defense which had given up 70 points has been great and carry on <person player="kerryon johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">johnson</person> they put that up on the board he s being surrounded by his teammates there they are they are sick in here and announcers like me talk about it and look at the offensive linemen they just better hope he doesnt lose two yards net the rest of the game theyre just thinking why i hope my wife has pipe here i get from the 15yard line they start this drive be the patriots watch this time 23 yard line that is <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> making the catch weird rock that s for grabs tonight for 51 yards second and two ladies look out to the tenure came over in a trade from san francisco and it s to tonight he has appeared for under four minutes it s going to be third and 12 that s nice watch <person player="eli harold" race="UNK" position="DE">eli harold</person> basically the 49ers didnt think he was good enough perfect coverage down the field and six sacks a week ago and now i bet you five of them for coverage sets got one there too <person player="eli harold" race="UNK" position="DE">harold</person> working against his old teammate from ground p former 49ers dancing fire 34 yard line incomplete no hit the ground who said a lot of traffic thinks he held on but it s gonna report down i think that was jared davis got a finger on the ball on the ground no challenge by the way they dont have a challenge anyway theyre out of timeouts even if they wanted to challenge that they couldnt so it is fourth down and the new england patriots are forced to go for fourth and 12 from their own 13yard line in the slot to the right double team fights doubleteam that is incomplete there is no flag and detroit s going to get the ball territory look at this this is just that s what they do to the outside guys on the punting nonjew big <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> and not you somebody else promise aint nobody else it will map a trigger there s versed who gets hurt down the three receivers so philip to her set on the sideline came over the last year from indianapolis it was really rounding into form and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> just slips his helmet away and the patriots are gonna go home with the record a one and two where <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius slay</person> being in this game has been huge and we thought maybe last week that jacksonville was just that good right that they just beat the patriots at home and the heat and no big deal but couple in a row feelings change back after this ends at ford field so disappointed on opening night against the jets it losses the san francisco last week starting the show tonight with some callers they were as we said at the outset the natives were restless was the <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> that jim caldwell was doing fine right sure but if youre in his position in the patriot way and he got a chance to hire a patriot and he knew it was going to be a hard left he knew it was going to be a difficult transition not only for this team but for this fan base and the calluses are starting to build on the detroit lions well it s a tougher team that we saw earlier in the season two of them work together in new england we call mote that he had a winning record he got to the twice in his four years here but the win was saying we gotta beat the good tubes they had so much trouble beating the better team you know go out and they get some hopefully get some big guys right there blunt flag is down holding offense number 60 10yard penalty replay second down when it comes to trying to beat the good teams i mean stanford s had a pretty good career he s been durable he s thrown for a lot of yardage but when it comes to regularseason record against teams that finished that season with a winning record six and forty nine it s gonna be a seven after tonight well and it s because that there was never any balance here you know everybody knew you came in here and you played <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> to throw the football down the field and he puts up big numbers and they stay competitive and then their defense gives up 24 points a game they win something they lose some but give up 24 points you dont win many of those 37 brought us out the ball is out clock continues to roll is going to be detroit school the <person player="deatrich wise" race="UNK" position="DE">wise</person> man once said or a <person player="deatrich wise" race="UNK" position="DE">wise</person> <person player="lawrence guy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">guy</person> nobody knows anything nothing i know this what do you know we talked about it a little bit already but that the patriots look like one team in september almost every year we saw him on opening night against kansas city last year we go boy what s wrong with the patriots right and then they went on the streak over they won 11 out of 12 games the defense went from giving up like 28 points a game the rest away 14 points a game there is a process in doing and theyre gonna have a long process when they get home with bill belichick after this one postgame report brought to you by volkswagen coming up a show on the field of stars of the game liam the queue up here to wrap it up peter kings football morning america preview chris tonight take a look at the matchup next sunday night in pittsburgh coming up right after the game so the detroit lions when you take a look at the standings now in the north chicago is going to be on top the packers are one one in one the vikings are one one in the one in detroit s going to go to one and two and in the east all of a sudden next week in foxborough is a critical game for the patriots because theyre already two games back if somehow miami wins that game and somehow me theyre three and oh maybe three games up after a month it was a head to head wound there you go to kick it through it s a sport field goal of the night and it makes it 26 to 10 well you know look weve been around long enough like four years ago or three years ago the patriots had their head handed to them on a monday night in kansas city they were two and two at that point i mean some of the stories of new england were maybe <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s done let s get garofalo in there and then actually you know they were looking the lombardi trophy in the february hot were on to cincinnati right that was the team that s that was raised that was the game but but what was interesting for me about this night for the detroit lions was this was an oldfashioned win this was let s get our big offensive line going behind our running backs let s use our speed to get outside when they start coming up to play the run let s throw it over the top of their head that is a real proven method to winning football games consistently in the nfl and i guarantee out of everything that happened tonight pascal oniy the defensive coordinator who said defense has done a great job tonight as paterson during the return illegal block in the back eternity number 46 that he s half the distance to the goal line first down to england so the lions immediate future will look like this they go to dallas next week so both teams will be one and two they get green bay coming in here then a bye week then off to miami and the seattle comes in in week 8 you know what s so funny is everybody was saying oh you look at that schedule were they going to get a win now you go floor based on what we saw tonight they look pretty good against dallas who had a tough time out there today green bay s and a bit of a stroke you know it s amazing one week just flips the script on everything greatest our sister after noon or yard line new england schedule talking about going home theyve got miami and indy then it said at kansas city the kansas city is in foxborough that s a sunday night game the 27 yard line goes <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> so theyve got three home games in a row it s too early to say critical but you know what mini critical ive just seen it too many times well look a lot better after this i dont wanna say garbage time dry but no timeouts great clothes but it still is right to score to score games id be laughing at myself for saying it right but who knows see some wacky stuff that s for ganesha 44 yard line patriots run up to the line of scrimmage i always hear thing it s almost time for the hail mary right now because you have to get one end there after the onside kick people said is back in the game a lot of time off the clock take us down to about ten seconds when the time <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gets this next one off if indeed he gets it off that s what i mean you know you complete a pass and it s open uh now she s just not getting back to the line of scrimmage offering their congratulations to the detroit lions look at that i respect bill belichick more i guarantee this will be a very respectful moment how to play these two free fun hill taking the troops pected foxboro and the trisha gets his first win against the master both wearing a postgame report im gonna pitch you
