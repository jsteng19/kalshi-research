============================================================

into the end zone how do you resolve that tonight well we i keep moving it and just give us more opportunities down there and then we get down there we got to be effective we got to avoid the penalties and negative plays were getting down in the red zone but i think we saw those issues go out there and try score some points tonight eli thank you a flock and the giants are without <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashad jennings</person> at running back tonight but on defense they get back <person player="dominique rodgerscromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique</person> rodgers cromartie and wookie <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> who was questionable will see time in the nickel as for the packers green bay is without <person player="damarious randall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">damarious randall</person> and <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> so <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> in <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius gunter</person> will start at corner and we could see three undrafted rookies play in the packers secondary team okay michelle see if they can take advantage of that if the packers down there you two coaches last game it was in 2007 when the away team coming off a monday night s football game on the road and the home team came off a bye week met and the packers wound up beating the chiefs they had the short week so the giants are pitching on six days rest the packers are pitching on 14 days rest and the packers are playing the second of four consecutive home games and there s a bye week thrown in as well now the giants won the toss and they elected to defer which is an interesting in and of itself because you normally dont want to put the ball in <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> hands right off the bat but that will be the case here as browns kickoff is dropped and then down in the end zone by <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> and let s take a look at the green bay starters nirn rogers county <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> alabama <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> kansas state <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> kentucky <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> fresno state <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers cal berkeley <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> the university of colorado boulder playing taylored oklahoma state <person player="jc tretter" race="UNK" position="OT">jc</person> treader cornell university <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj</person> <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane</person> eastern michigan <person player="brian price" race="nonwhite" position="DT">brian</person> belaga iowa and the one guy missing up front the longtime guard josh sitting who was surprisingly let go before the season started and now and rogers short drop surveying and scanning and extending the play as he does so brilliantly and then hits <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> on the outside he gets taken down there for a game of five by the cornerback <person player="leon hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">leon</person> hole itll be sucking down you hit it right on the button the difference between these two quarterbacks theyre about the same when they throw on time and on rhythm but the difference is that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and his ability to buy time run around move around make plays outside the pocket so many of the big plays of this packers offense comes when he does that and of course we saw that in speeds last year a hail mary to beat detroit and then a double hail mary to send a playoff game against arizona into overtime and one second and for that give it to lacey and lacey is a little bit short of the first down kenard makes the tackle <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> people said oh he had an average year last year yeah 31 touchdowns eight interceptions i guess for him that s average at home here 48 and 12 this best in the history of the league minimum of 50 starts so so tough youre so tough of course on the road as a super bowl ring has been an mvp and leads them up here on third down on a short one and straight ahead is rutkowski he takes the place that john coon so aptly fulfilled for so many years rutowski the new fall back in the first half of green bay now most of you know that josh set and went to the bears before the season but i tell you watch these guys in the movement they get right up front there center <person player="jc tretter" race="UNK" position="OT">jc</person> treader <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> only hasnt been to the pro bowl probably the most ridiculous part of that pro bowl there s a few ridiculous parts but there are some really good players that have never seen it from the 38 yard line and a toss <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> they where it stays on his feet and just brute strength up to the 42 yard line let s take a look at the giant defense <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> south florida <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">damon harrison</person> v <person player="ishaq williams" race="UNK" position="DE">williams</person> in university john behan constancy ohio state university <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> do you <person player="devon kennard" race="nonwhite" position="LB">devon</person> canard usc children <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">shepard</person> lsu jonatha <person player="jonathan casillas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">casillas</person> new brother high school <person player="dominique rodgerscromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique</person> rods cromartie tennessee state <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> alabama <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> uconn john orr s jigga s north alabama <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> one of several a new giants they went out and spent a ton to revamp the defense <person player="roger lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">roger</person> is a ton of time against the grain deep downfield and the pass is incomplete and everybody in lambeau says where is the flag so does rogers 65,000 plus booing incomplete here we go on the outside dominic rogers cromartie is in a follow <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> is a tangled feet or something more probably just tangled feet i think that was a good nocall im very much minority in this stadium though but now it s kind of interesting dont you think that so far we have seen mike mccarthy and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> go to back to the huddle not the hurry up pace so many times in these games they come out very quickly in the no hug third down and six rodgers a master at drawing tunes offside and a third and six over the middle they convert to <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> i said before 65,000 fans are booing im not counting the 16,000 or so giant fans those respect are in the building tonight gonna end up with just a little move here as they bring the pressure off the edge and they just lose coverage on the outside nobody found <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> when they were coming with that blitz now youve got <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> lining up in the backfield run back man wide out as well the tailback spot as he does here and he will not go very far and it s dragged backwards by jpp <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> after a gain of one second and nine it s been a lot of conversations about these two guys on the outside but <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> there <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> on the other side they only have one sack each but those two guys are probably both top five defensive ends overall play theyve been outstanding in my mind now the big question has been the number of snaps that theyve had they just hardly ever get off the field and we havent seen all the explosiveness that you can see in the past and that may speak to depth now rodgers is able to at least for the moment we feel draw them offside will see and he does and they stop the play before he has a free throw that s <person player="jonathan casillas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> and oculi makes his first call of the night itll be second and fourth well they say watch the ball and you cant be a whole lot closer to pollen <person player="jonathan casillas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> <person player="johnathan hankins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hankins</person> basically just going on rogers hard count and you could see there was no head bob there was no but they practice their cadence they have about eight or nine different cadence s that they use and basically defensive lines fear that staff may have got comp lined up as the tailback from caste is the fullback across the spin move but he loses his balance because of it tackled there by <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> so <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> he broke into the league and he broken with a splash as a rookie he had a really good second year he s now in his sixth year but he s tailed off of it the question becomes you know what where is he now in his career to keep expecting and week after week we got to get top going you know will this be the week well i think when they lost <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> they lost some of the deep threats on the outside because he s much more of a work the middle of the field kind of receiver so without those deep threats much tougher on him over the middle and it s complete to <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> coming off the acl surgery that cost him all of last year he s already scored four touchdowns in three games and that s another packer first down you know im a fan of the left tackle oh <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> got big money to be a pass rusher in <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> those quick feet too much that time for <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier</person> pardon and now they go without a huddle here but not a hurry up the 36 yard line and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> cannot find wound to the outside again that s <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> who drags him down at for a gain of two second down and eight <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> is pretty remarkable coming back and he s got the injured right hand we all know about that but watch him just reach out basically with one arm and tackle a 250pound running back we met with him the other night he says yes it still hurts there s no question it bothers me but you just kind of learn to live with the pain and that time no problem bringing down the big back lost one finger partial to others you know there s a lot two years ago and that s plucked by <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> who gets taken down after picking up the first down <person player="leon hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">leon hall</person> chases him down another first down for green bay that s their fourth on this drive already watch out here in rogers sells his fake watch this here he s gonna go watch his head he s just gonna look oh it s a race run okay and then all of a sudden he comes out that extra little second or two that he carried out that fake is what got <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> open so already theyve had the ball for seven minutes the ball was at the 17 yard line <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> would be the back here balance with six runs and five passes so far this the 12th play of the drive hi im almost picked off at the 8yard line intended for <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> and that was generous <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> who got his hands on it <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> is not used to seeing a ball missed that high he thought there was somebody behind him he basically let that ball go you just dont see <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> miss like this watch adams he almost pulls its arms down thinking that s gonna be for somebody else and <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> almost got it norris <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> another one of those guys working for steve spagnola got big money in the offseason and he is under pressure in this one special arrows defense looking for his first interception of the season check in the tan perfection collapses into the enzone that s bad in the way intended for the tight end that was <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers the intended receiver and batted away by <person player="keenan robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">keenan robinson</person> third down some play by <person player="keenan robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">keenan robinson</person> on this one right here he this looks like one of those back shoulders touched down all day just reaches around and gets his hand on it so backtoback either great plays or great opportunities but now is the third down now is the money down for this giants defense in the red zone hold them to three and you feel like youre a winner brief the three our the packers on third down of this drive three receivers set to the right magnolia loves these pressure situations and rogers didnt like what he saw timeout green bay great linebacker ray nitschke so many iconic memes adorn the facade all the way around lambeau field this is the 14th play of the drive starch is a backfield it s a third down and ten 303 on third downs on this drive great protection dancing looking still then he escapes he looks for the first time that gets it well what do you do with him you cant get to him he give him all day even in the second air he does its job there he goes with his legs there s really nothing you can do on his lap <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> the receiver was going to turn and run up into the end zone the minute he saw the back turn of <person player="jonathan casillas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">casillas</person> nobody there just a backbreaker of a player is <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> here s all the coverage on the outside but there s nothing that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> likes more than to hold the ball give his guys a chance to break open and then the the one that just destroys teams his ability to run it hurt the detroit lions last week <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> barely his man the left tackle dope in this case going it s about half the distance to the goal so it s second down and go we simply know chris it was interesting how the giants won the toss and deferred and youre playing with fire when you give the ball to <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> in the first quarter you know and the really interesting part for me here is the theyre not doing the hurry up offense and so you wonder is mike mccarthy now playing to the fact that he s missing his two starting corners and just wanting to keep his offense on the field and play keep away from <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> 2nd and goal 16th play of the drive six and a half to go in the quarter and catching his <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> for the touchdown rogers gone away to his right <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> with a full stretch and his fifth touchdown of the season an <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> working with a bad hamstring really has not practiced much at all but there has been some magic that is touchdown number five and were just begun the fourth game of the season i dont know that anybody fully understood the impact of <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> to <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> in this offense but since he is returned it is like they have awakened they led the league the packers didnt scoring back in 2014 there were fifteenth last year his <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> could have gone after and the green bay packers opened the game with six first downs diverse for cavora third run off 16 ways lead the giants seventh another if curly lambeau and you think of vince lombardi and his coaching career at fordham new york city before serving as the giants offensive coordinator it could be four through 58 so among others he had on frank gifford on that giant offense and the midfifties is playing paris in three yards in the end zone and the former dallas cowboy gets taken down up at the 31 yard line and gives us a chance to take a look at the giants offense <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> old myths <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> dark 1/2 length <person player="odell beckham jr" race="UNK" position="WR">odell beckham jr</person> lsu <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sterling</person> <person player="kelvin sheppard" race="UNK" position="LB">sheppard</person> oklahoma <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor cruz</person> massachusetts will tie stony brook <person player="eric pinkins" race="UNK" position="LB">eric</person> flower all about to you <person player="justin pugh" race="white" position="OG">justin pugh</person> syracuse western <person player="weston richburg" race="white" position="C">richburg</person> colorado state john jarrett oh miss <person player="bobby hart" race="nonwhite" position="OG">bobby hart</person> florida state taking the spot normally occupied by <person player="marshall newhouse" race="nonwhite" position="OT">marshall newhouse</person> inaccurate tonight and the giants be good on the ground with <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> dark blue picking up about four <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> he s just shy of a couple of milestones his next regular season win will be number 102 more touchdown passes puts him at 300 vs chris mentioned the top two huge victories here in postseason you know seven and 11 leading design super bowl wings on both occasions the 48 there s beckham making the catch so odell beckham ill tell you what this guy he had a better chance to wind up on the cover of psychology today than on sports illustrated oh but i know what freud was coming out of the grave to weigh in on beckham and you know the amazing part about it it really wasnt a foul what led to that entire conversation this week the officials around him handled it perfectly the black game at a center field here s darko picking up just one wish that came on top of the confrontation that he always has with josh norman the week before the frustration on the sideline you know hitting the kicking net and the net banging off his head and what went on last week but he seemed to really get it all together became far more plastic we talked to the meeting yesterday and he s making to have a big you dont listen yeah it s dont know second and nine not down at the line of scrimmage the <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> goes down pass goes down elight has to readjust his shoulder pad and it s third down to nine the troy guy on is going to come to set right up the middle and get his hands on this and i couldnt tell his intercepted or not her or a little while i sort of just floated between their face masks and now it s up to eli to convert on a third down and long nakara got these the giants well be there top running backs and <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> and beryllium boy year third and nine and that was on the wall so that s incomplete and so after the packers have the ball for almost eight and a half minutes the giants have the ball for 147 and are forced the punt and brought a little slot blitz off the edge in this game the packers are going to be playing <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> more as the nickel back as safety who has a full understanding of how to get pressure on the quarterback they took advantage on that third long <person player="brad wing" race="white" position="P">brad wing</person> to punt <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> a rookie from cow terrence s let it go and harris downs it at the 15 and the flag is down flanked senate about the 41 yard line of the packers so it hockley will check with the official who threw it let us know what s going on during the kick holding by the receiving team number 88 the penalty will be enforced half the distance to the goal from where the kick was pot first out thailand generally green bay has the ball again and up seven to nothing over the giants <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> has been the green bay starter since all eight that was his fourth year in the league he s the improviser for sure you get him outside the pocket look at the lows numbers all the most the nfl 64 touchdown passes scrambles he s run for 13 touchdowns as well so you give him time he will kill you as he did on that first drive and now he has the ball backed up in his own territory at the 8 yard line with 421 to go in the open i almost wanted to do the math and calculate how much more coverage time opponents have when <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is playing that an ordinary quarterback about two and a half seconds is ordinarily when you have to get it off a betcha he doubles that in almost every game blitz and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> avoids the blitz and gets to the outside eye picks up about 12 yards <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> they almost got him in the backfield <person player="keenan robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">keenan robinson</person> was blitzing on the play and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> says take this first down for <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> this is exactly what theyre looking for in the game their last appearance against the detroit lions they thought there were too many times that you sort of danced around a little bit in hole there trying to convince them that yes you are 250 pounds use it occasion huge hole and that s another 12 yard game aaron rip cows key the fullback helping to lead the way so backtoback first downs from the feet of any lacing <person player="jc tretter" race="UNK" position="OT">jc</person> treader one of the quicker sinners in the game and that reach block right there so difficult to get when he s on the play side shoulder of the center there s only a handful of guys that can consistently get that shredder has been very good packers running their toe 19th play of the quarter the toss outside garage nice or <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> rogers to rogers that s <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> making the tackle gain of six <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> at the improv let s take a look youve got rogers in the backfield you have to cover two different plays here s play number one theyve got it covered good job giants but as soon as all that starts to happen here comes play number two you had to cover for 57 two seconds more than double what the ordinary quarterback recovered in between defenders of out the atoms and he takes the ball into new york territory that are finally makes the tackle gain of 18 when sapp rodgers talking to the defense it was we are going and then or sting <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> is hurt you shake it up in three timeout so they have <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> the former ram <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> is back in there now supplanting him at that spot and rogers on first and ten to work in that area and this time it is <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> who cant make the play <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">apple</person> covering itll be second down and ten and that s strictly a read right there anytime <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">apple</person> really got in pretty good position this time and both <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> and rogers do it so he threw it back shoulder and went right to it i would have to see <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> who s had the hamstring problem i would have to see him covered even if i were playing this game right now especially not knowing what s going to go on with <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> you want to see <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person>s sprint 50 yards down the field a few times and see exactly how he s holding up big table on a screen that some blocking picks up eight gets it to the 38yard line here paul is there third down and two for the packers ill tell you there are some athletic offensive linemen here for the green bay packers <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> and <person player="jc tretter" race="UNK" position="OT">jc</person> treader both got out in front of this thing very quickly it s one thing to run these wide receiver screens it s another thing to run them when youve got athletes like that playing on the offensive line to go set up <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> third and to the packers already of nine first downs in the quarter off the fake rogers fires that s a tankful sound that s <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> making the catch that moves to six to the 25yard line jp p almost took off the head of <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> coming across the formation here and it probably is the things that cost them the ability to come and get them watch come off the edge and rogers trying to go out on a route <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> took care of that but they allow for the quick pressure <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> is back in he s at the bottom of the screen inside <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> already has carried seven times for 40 yards when lacey came into the league highly heralded good rookie season then of course with all of the talk last year was that he was overweight and they sat him down for a while and they put him on a diet he s off to a great start this season number two pick out of alabama back in 13 he s playing against his old high school teammate right <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> of the giants number 21 it s gonna be a little weird up against the guy played in high school and college it starts in the backfield flanking rodgers who stays in the flair him out it s awful the <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> had a lot of room to roll and he s obviously pretty upset with himself itll be third down and six oh he had a walkin he had two offensive linemen both outside the anything on that side let me see going this way and theyre gonna have this wall set up look like a punt return going down that boundary there was nobody left here they go quickly on third and six and a minute makes the catch two flags on the play two flags before the moment bob is in the end zone there s a flag at the 14 is a flag at the 22 on the far side of the field big six official conference going on right now and oculi having a little sidebar here he s an attorney but definitely the giants definitely looked like they had an extra guy on the field i dont know if there s something to offset that or not there were follows by both teams on the play yep his legal shift by the offense all 11 were not set for a second there was also 12 men in the field by the defense those penalties offset replay third down he gets it together some no touchdown third and six back we come right couldnt quite get off the field there and now let s see if they really got set the officials said no to that heco play by <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> that was a great move he put on neon hall there we do have generous <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> back in the game they would have been first touchdown of the season and on third down and six now rodgers accepted very well and then it s intercepted deflected and then jaykins interception and jim norris <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> will bring it up to the 29 and a flag is down on the lung back <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> couldnt handle it there s another flag that comes in at the very end and so rogers throws a very rare lambeau pick and thatll be the final play of the quarter and wait for the the penalty to be assessed or penalties all flags were clearly after the interception though that is going to be the first interception of the season for the giants took him 17 quarters to pull it off boy did they need that though hmm it was just going looking too easy for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and the packers going up and down the field there was only one foul on the play that was by the giants after the interception personal foul unnecessary roughness by number 54 against the quarterback as a 15yard penalty will be enforced from the deadball spot the giants peaked the ball first down it s <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> that s the end of the first quarter green bay s leading 7 to nothing and sunday night football from green bags and he s after these messages week 5 seven to nothing green bay dominating the first quarter but the big pick there gives the giants the blow after the penalty moves him back to the 14 to start this drive giants have had the ball fully five plays the packers 426 and manon fires over the middle and that s beckham making the catch a flag is down as he makes the catch up at the 30yard line and the giants are coming back holding offense number 74 half the distance to the ball would be first down the back and look at a couple of things number one is the interception off the hands of <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> and into the hands of <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> who had to come out of the game for a couple of plays when he was shaken up and here s the penalty on <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> for knocking rodgers down and i thought the rule was that as long as the quarterback doesnt pursue the ball you cant hit him but if he does pursue to make attack where you put hit him and im sure there s some nuance off of that to burst in 17 and this is darkwood going next to nowhere meanwhile the cob would be touchdown was nullified because the packers werent set to go back and look at the top of the screen theyre all moving and youll see <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> is going to take a little step back theyre all sort of still getting shuffled and because everybody wasnt set for a full second that one brought the touchdown back now it s second down on 16 from the 8 yard line and this <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bobby rainey</person> and hell work his way up to the 17 and let s take a look at the packer starters but regarding on breath lajas new tornadoes mike dance hi <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> usc <person player="jake ryan" race="white" position="LB">jake ryan</person> michigan <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake martinez</person> stanford play <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> us see quentin wrong with miami ohio <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> georgia tech rocklin dicks <person player="dean lowry" race="white" position="DE">dean</person> the rest of their alabama the bear is gone you market hide university of iowa back mccarthy s singling out not really as you got who has been a pleasant surprise for the packers it s third down at seven and beckham makes the catch out to the 33 yard line so he hit the penalty nullifying his last grab not this time <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> is there and beckham is not caught 2 for 29 yards now theyre trying to play this to man outside but remember now they are missing their two starting corners and quentin <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> who is really probably their third cornerback is now forced into oneonone coverage against one of the great players in the league <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> free for his first five 438 yo look at knocked down in the backfield aha clinton the knicks knocks down <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bobby rainey</person> loss of one aha clinton dix has been doing a lot of stuff up back and then comes back up and makes the play again that last guy off the edge you just cant tell what he s trying to do out there and having that kind of activity from the free safety thinkll toy poll omalo really disturbs things for an offense well be stopped at the outset here because <person player="bobby hart" race="nonwhite" position="OG">bobby hart</person> started to back up and right tackle it s a false start itll be second in sixteen so penalties on both offense number 68 fiveyard penalty had second down <person player="marshall newhouse" race="nonwhite" position="OT">marshall newhouse</person> inactive so one of the starters is out the giants have been besieged by penalties in their last two games losses to washington and the minnesota and there is <person player="marshall newhouse" race="nonwhite" position="OT">newhouse</person> at that back next week when they need baltimore merritt <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> way too many penalties other than defensive backs he has become the holding <person player="tavarres king" race="nonwhite" position="WR">king</person> so far that left tackle position second and six penis <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> goes over the head of beckham started to cut it in and ran it to the boundary in the past two high third down in 16 just cant miss that one that was that s a gimme you got odell beckham wide open and a cover two hole nice play calls going to get you out of a third down and very long and they just missed it when mcadoo first year as the giants coach in his fifth game last two years offensive coordinator before that four years eight years on the staff under mccarthy here in green bay as the tight ends goes first and in the quarterbacks coach working with watchers every day spotfire work well be taken up at the 36 yard line so the penalty put them in a hole it cant extricate themselves and are forced to punt on a 4th and 7 they are doing all kinds of stuff with <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> out there it came back from hamstring and ankle injuries and youll see him he s going to loop all the way around <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> gonna try and cause a little disturbance out here maybe even grab and hold a little bit and here comes <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> they have been doing a lot of different looks with him early in this game <person player="brad wing" race="white" position="P">brad wing</person> to punt <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> drafting in the 5th round for cal berkeley ready to pull it in this contact made there and of course a flag comes down <person player="roger lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">roger lewis</person> number 82 running into the rookie davis the little lesson on the sideline it s a good job by 28 <person player="josh hawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh hawkins</person> not making contact here where feriss is the opportunity to catch the ball by the kicking team number 82 that s a 15yard penalty and forcing the spot of the foul green bay keeps the ball first down so he did not blind him into him in the bed penalty on the giants got a ton of emblazoned quickly to michele tafoya well the giants thin secondary just got thinner al <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eli apple</person> and <person player="dominique rodgerscromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique</person> rodgers cromartie are both out with groin injuries al all right thank you michelle and deal i had a hamstring prior to that so <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> is there and you got <person player="michael hunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael hunter</person> a rookie out of oklahoma state a free agent who now is in the secondary and of course rogers will spot that immediately has a ton of time he s going to launch my own the traffic it s batted away <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> was the intended receiver and you had <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> back there with <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> one of the things you knew the packers would do is go after the rookie safety <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> number 33 the general feeling is if you throw up a deep ball on a safety your wide receiver is going to have the advantage over a safety trying to play like a cornerback so theyre just giving <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> some opportunities and that time <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> with a little help from generous <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> up to the task in the backfield but a little too far in front of him and itll be third down and 10 so of course the packers are having the mix and match in their secondary with rookies and so are the giants <person player="michael hunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hunter</person> a rookie adams the rookie with <person player="eli apple" race="nonwhite" position="DB">apple</person> and and <person player="dominique rodgerscromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique</person> romani out rodgers cromartie so mike mccarthy in his 11th season of course he knows his opposite number about as well as anybody and vice versa tired um he should third and 10 from the 32 yard line rogers scrambles again to the outside first down flag is down the bunt they adams the flag is that all the way back at the 21 yard line so well behind the line of scrimmage as rodgers was rolling left holding offense number 69 10yard penalty repeat third down that s the left tackle <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> negating the first down good matchup there <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> against <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> see if we can pick up the hold here definitely chipping with <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> was the jump that he grabbed the jersey and pull him down yes hard to say his second penalty against green bay five against the giants who had 19 in their last two games third and 20 again they cant get to rodgers all day all night and it s incomplete as <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> tried to make the catch that would have been the first down he had enough yardage adams is there covering fourth down well i can just tell you this the giants will lose tonight unless these pass rushers that have been paid so much money do better than this they just think they have to win on the edge with <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> oh i diggy s oohwah those guys cannot allow <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> to stand back there that long they got away with it that time giants only for sex in the four games as far this season parrish is back to receive the kick off the foot of jacob shum buchan his first year as the back pounding pic how the balance crab doesnt like it at the 41yard line they want tim mash stay back itll be first that more the <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james</person> when we come in at 7 up in green bay western pennsylvania football hotbed the coaches who have come from there include both guys tonight mike mccarthy native of pittsburgh ben mcadoo his hometown homer city pennsylvania and he looked through the years marty schottenheimer and chuck knox bill cowher mike ditka marvin <person player="roger lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">lewis</person> mike mccarthy western pa head coaches with a hundred or more regularseason wins and the karthi of course helping pave the way for mcadoo to eventually get the giants job than the second youngest coach in the league at 39 second adam gase is manic throws and it s caught by tie the tight end that will tie so when some bounce takes it all the way down to the 28 yard line taking advantage of the rookie linebacker <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake martinez</person> here he comes up playaction fake on early down and get it right behind him these young linebackers have been doing an excellent job and i think theyre going to be terrific but they are young and the playaction is holding them right now but i gained 27 taking the spot of <person player="larry donnell" race="UNK" position="TE">larry donnell</person> an active tonight as you recover somebody concussion here <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> dhokla second down in 10th so it s funny how things work out i mean mccarthy had really no idea who mcadoo was mcadoo winds up calling him meeting him and that leads to the two of them being in new <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> together san francisco together green bed together and then of course ben goes on to new york and there was a huge storm he just basically called up blindly to mccarthy and said hey i want to present something to you and he goes who are you basically got in the car drove down in germany was nasa s incomplete that was over a decade ago when mccarthy was at the combine in indianapolis at that point mccarthy was in new <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> as the offensive coordinator then that whole staff winds up getting bounced he goes to san francisco for one year and back into wines of going winter then mike gets the job here and brings mcadoo here mcadoo spent eight years on the staff here as the titans go and eventually the quarterbacks coach riding the hot jockey right this day weather sup head coach at the nfl there are an 11 the rookie parkins is in the game sent him out into the pattern and then back as he was covered there by quentin <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> so the giants drive bogs down after the catch by will tie that gained 27 its fourth down you like doing a little <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> here watch him step up through the pocket here and buy a little time and in allowed odell beckham who is open thrown just a little bit behind him maybe if that one s a little farther in front might have been able to pick up the first down but you have to continue working that oneonone matchup with putting <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> 47 yard attempt for <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">josh brown</person> and the giants are able to get on the scoreboard with three here with 821 to play first and sunday night football from lambeau field seven three packers thursday night that s the matchup on the nfl network cbs and streaming live on twitter it s denver losing today for the first time against san diego losing to open a 26 and 30 seconds beat your kickoff for thursday night football cbs nfl network and appered rich people doing a promo for seven to three <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">brown</person> to kick off after the 47yard field goal run back here taken at the two yard line <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> a hand injury to the 20 oh youve seen both quarterbacks move around but look at the similarities here were talking about <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> one of the quickest to get rid of the football <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> takes much longer because of those scrambles and plays that he moves around here s the difference theyre both about the same 25 seconds or less but 25 seconds or longer look at the difference in the rating 71 for eli 114 almost 115 for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and that has been the difference in those two quarterbacks rodgers showing some of that tonight getting out of the pocket extending every plays of great protection meanwhile there is lacey just pulling over people still on his way the even more yards and find their little scuffle ensues after he s taken out of bounds but not until he picks up 31 yards <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> <person player="roger lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">roger</person> is going to get thrown to the side but watch <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> here bounce first outside then back inside and that allowed his offensive lineman to get back on their blocks usually he bounces outside way too much i think you got a little action now he comes the other way takes it to the 44 and it s <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">collins</person> who winds up hitting them the two guys who go all the way back i mean this guy s a monster running down the field and it s sort of interesting at the end of this play look at that stiff arm it s his old buddy is high school and college teammate who comes up and makes the tackle and you could tell that both these guys were a little uncomfortable in the back they were finally going to be playing against each other second down and four at the 43 yard line starts now the backfield mechanics starts cuts to the outside and he will get a first down <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> s back up <person player="michael hunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael hunter</person> makes the tackle first down going back to high school dutch town high school in louisiana and then on they went to alabama playing there for <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick</person> saban one the running back the other of course the safety and im flashing on the turf at lambeau field under seven to go in the half first down at the 38 yard line and that s four and it s a nine yard pickup for <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> rodgers picking up the pace right now going nohuddle yeah and were seeing steve spagnolo the defensive coordinator rotate some of these defensive linemen out weve got <person player="kerry wynn" race="UNK" position="DE">kerry</person> win in the game theyre trying to keep those guys fresh so they can get some of those explosive plays going looks like <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> now lined up as an inside linebacker he s number 54 right there get up cheers on the sidelines in not stopped at the one <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> <person player="michael hunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael hunter</person> is able to knock him out three officials now confer rogers thinks he got into the end zone and he does after the conference by the officials the field judge signals sotas hockley touchdown it s almost not fair <person player="michael hunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael hunter</person> who had only nine snaps in the game against the vikings doing the best he can but he got adams got the ball in his left hand which allowed it to stay inside the pylon nicely called by the officials no doubt but you could see green still his pink shoes kind of help a little bit pink and then green and then white that s a good sign so <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> comes in to tack on the extra point touchdown passes tonight that drive 80 yards in five plays and takes only two minutes and 20 seconds six minutes to go in the half it s not 14 to 3 packers as you see the animation package next to lambeau expected to open next summer the tubing hayley got a skating rink you get a playground water good stuff happening lambeau field they expanded it about a decade ago over 80,000 can fit in here a lot of people just though they come here all year long just to just to tour lambeau field i got a hundred bucks if you go down the tube until next year well 150 will do it baby cause news dick fielded by harris at the goal line spins away and harris will get taken down over the 42 yard line so it looked like he was going to be stopped deep in his own territory it s janice who is there to stop him puts it up in your midfield well it s been all about beckham this week who said on tuesday football is my sanctuary it s where you go to escape it s for a most happy but im not having fun <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> said competitive emotional fiery but you just have to control it lightly to motivate and encourage your teammates bring out the best not the worst because that was the story every day and every night in the papers on radio and other places around the country dark wood the action tinnitus man he s been very quiet is really not a lot going on in terms of what he s done on the field he s caught two 4:29 yarn should go back to what started it all last week the penalty <person player="christian ringo" race="nonwhite" position="DE">christian</person> minnesota yeah i didnt think it was a penalty at all there is old order line <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane</person> ed he came back reacted a little bit the officials got between them there are three officials one two three all handling it perfectly right there no problem nothing going wrong the plaque came in from centerfield by finish for the and man he throws it away third and four well and of course you know tom coughlin s said i you know can come in and help with odell and then it sort of started to hold their who s really in control you know it does the whole thing and it became a story beyond belief in new york during the course the weekend the positive thing is that i think odell beckham gets it now you know hurting his football team 15yarder have been ejected play differently and i do think from talking to him i thought he got it this way i get to third and four and that s behind the intended receiver <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sterling shepard</person> first time the rookie from the oklahoma state or oklahoma has been targeted tonight so it s fourth down whose beckham s glove just smile huh and you know what that was really good advice because for odell to blow up when somebody s doing something to throw him off his game it sort of puts him at the level of the guy that s guarding him if he just smiles on him he says basically hey okay i know youre desperate youre trying to guard me youve got no chance right that s the message it gets set and set up tinnitus thing it s been quiet and when his pick is pulled in at the 14 yard line by davis was 502 left of the hamper ebay has the ball an 11point lead chase s on nbc rather 12 continuing chase sheets up in the canyons nascar s best drivers next sunday youll see it they are jimmie <person player="josh johnson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">johnson</person> qualified for the round with heat with his win in charlotte you have the chase standings right now heading to kansas and we go to the show well <person player="dominique rodgerscromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dominique</person> rogers cromartie back in the game the giants earlier told us he was out with a groin injury they said that was their mistake he s going to continue to play through that injury that kept him out of week four ow all right michelle you can see he s got his the wrap around his right upper thigh so he comes back in and rogers will begin this drive there is cromartie as <person player="roger lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">roger</person> starts this one from the 14 yard line fake distorts traffic and he will get taken down from behind by <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> one of those very highpriced giant acquisitions about 200 million dollars in contracts given to the giants newcomers but half of that guaranteed money but the <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> played in miami for a lot of years and a lot of folks said really yeah he s been playing with a wrist injury too that s been hurting him a bit but not quite the production maybe they were looking for as well look at that protection second chicks and flag feeling well chase them out of bounds but the giants they havent gotten close to rogers tonight in the pocket yeah now they really havent and you know you youve got that kind of money invested in those two outside pass rushers one of the problems is they get no pressure whatsoever out of their interior guys either though <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> <person player="johnathan hankins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hankins</person> no push means that the quarterback can step up and run like aaron just did holding by the defense number 22 for the quarterback credit is scrambled that fiveyear penalty is tacked on at the end of the run first down and that son <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> here he is maybe he grabbed the back of his jersey or shoulder pads and said get off <person player="john jerry" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jerry</person> reese and the new york giants organization made the decision let s go get some defensive help it was a really tough year for the giants defensively last year neither foreman 20 yards per game and again look at that time it is <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> he never had it and his grants is incomplete hit there by <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> as the ball got there so jordi s dropped a couple tonight very uncharacteristically suck him down there we go we got <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> over here and cj lange s gonna come out and help on <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> they got him completely hoodwinked and then <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">olivier vernon</person> working on belaga nothing nothing i mean that s they cant win against <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> rhett rodgers has been standing back there for five six seven seconds it seems like footage is such a great word isnt it second and ten up to the 35yard line goes <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james</person> starch with 3:45 to go in the half you would go to wake me wouldnt you know that dingman <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> know the one thing he has been able to do for the giants in his place really solid football in there against the run you know youve got to start there you cant allow a team to just pound you through the middle and at least he has accomplished that for this depreciate green bay tonight averages about five yards for rush raj easy this time a little bit of pressure but no problem for hammond it is picked offered doesnt does he have it he does generous <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> on what would be his second interception of the night goes to the ground obviously well take a look at it on the replay but <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> right now comes up with a huge pick <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> turned and was pushing against <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> and then the ball ended up being under thrown you could tell that adams thought he was going to throw it back inside <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> able to recover and his two interceptions the only thing keeping this from being a complete blowout does he hold on to it well he has his arm under it just because it touches the ground doesnt mean he doesnt have control of it and they have confirmed the interception so that s a pair for the former ran one of those guys who s got a ton of money both raji s picks tonight on third down giants now at the 40 shannon is strongly dependent good fruit about 13 yards in the 27 yard line well and the other part of this is that the packers are playing too deep safeties back in the middle of the field so the giants have to be able to run the football against that or it s going to be tough throwing the ball down the field all night long and really this has just been the odell beckham show only one pass i can remember to either <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor cruz</person> or <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sterling</person> chef the one to shepherd im a brand new <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">cruz</person> first and ten and complete at the 20yard line youre talking about <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor cruz</person> not getting targeted there he was a guy who got hurt midseason in 2014 missed all of last year as well as that season and came back him up to a pretty good start this year yeah he has and it s really been great to see him work he s working here against <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius</person> gunther who i thought in the last couple of games played better than any of these other quarterbacks and he s really come out of nowhere check in again looking for some room on the 22 goes <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bobby rainey</person> sign of an april

position="WR">sterling</person> shepherd the intended receiver but mike the hide was there covering on the play fourth down ill have to settle for a field goal attempt now this throw is behind <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sterling</person> shepherd that <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> hide really sort of a safety in that position i thought had pretty good position right there weve seen eli missed a few throws in key moments in this first half where he had people running open that wasnt wide open but there was an opportunity <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">brown</person> a 41 yard attempt they went from 47 earlier and that one is able to draw its way back in it might be a little wide the right looking laugh now it was close 14 strips new york the nfl the american cancer society and urge everyone to join in the fight against breast cancer learn more about a crucial patch day october

guaranteed over 52 million bucks tonight i would say <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> is the bargain and the others not yet mmhmm you know the story of this game is the green bay packers offensive line theyve been devastating i know pass rush to speak of and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> is averaging about ten yards of carry <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> keeping him in the game with those two picks so it s an eightpoint game green bay has two timeouts and we will dump over the middle and <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> looks back miscommunication it will be second down at 10 and you can tell what spagnolo the defensive coordinator is thinking here is okay we cant handle <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> but we can handle the rest of these guys and they are just trying to cover on the back end that s a little pressure and at the feet of <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> right there and both guys are upset third and 10 <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> almost got there on this one right up the gut here that little pressure got down around <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> knees and i think it made him flinch a little bit they have somebody going down there that was a pretty easy throw backtoback easy throws that it starts they missed him both comes in motion to the near side rogers on the time but batting at the line of scrimmage and incomplete that s <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> wright this <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> put pressure on gets a hand on that one and it s fourth down snacks has moved up to an order varies it s pretty good you know he s going right through there gonna get his hands up it s a huge play and now give his offense one more chance yeah not trick before the night is line drive kick here look at the 33 so harris has a chance to do something with it and it s a 70 yard return to the 40 yard line so the minute and 27 seconds and three timeouts the giants have it people affected by severe weather other disasters need your help now to support those impacted by hurricane matthew over the last week text matthew 90 9 9 line to get 10 bucks or more to american red cross hurricane relief red cross such a great organization so many great things in a hurry times like this from the 39 yard line on first down the hands of time whod beaten this man have gotten in front sailed into the end zone couldnt pull it in second down oh this is a walk into the end zone here we go right off the edge oh my goodness he kind of panicked a little bit and started turning sideways but for <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> he s going to go into the halftime and beat his head against the locker that is at least a fourth big play they have missed tonight he s gonna get sacked he s gonna lose the ball green bay s been a recovery unbelievable they go from a walkin touchdown to a sack fumble and put <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> back on the field and the goodlooking rookie back role came in forced the fumble and instead of maybe a onepoint game or even a tie game if ty gets into the end zone it s an eightpoint game in green bay in scoring position already im let say this <person player="kyler fackrell" race="white" position="LB">kyler</person> fact well keep an eye on him i mean they have good outside pass rushers this young man is beginning to make a name for himself now second sack he is applying very consistent pressure and a game that looked like it might start tilting back towards the giants just took a huge turn the other way so the rookie creates the thump of authority <person player="kenny clark" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kenny clark</person> who s the youngest player to lead just 21 he recovered it and now on first now being chased gets away from burning chased by cola and then just throws the ball out of bounds second down but stumbling around here afterwards let s take a look at big money on the outside live a <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> coming off the edge on belaga gives them a good shot gets pressure but he escapes as he always does <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> good pressure so that s as good as you can ask right an ordinary human being a quarterback and youve got those two guys meeting at the quarterback in a sack and a big play and instead it s just second intent poor man pressure giving the stocks he has some room on the inside starch takes the ball to the 23 yard line third and two now i tell you the other thing this this hard count of <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is doing youre not seeing these outside pass rushers get their usual jump off the ball you know when they anticipate the snap count theyre all a little bit frozen afraid to be the guy that jumps off sides and gives <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> a three play rodgers been a master of the hard factor too this contact there and a flat comes in devante and gets yep trevon <person player="trevin wade" race="UNK" position="DB">wade</person> and theyre gonna call that one offense from the offense yeah yeah i thought that was the right call that comes in for a fiveman conference well i tell you this is an interesting decision here though assuming it is offensive you want to make it fourth down and two or third down and let errant action those offense number 17 grab the defenders jersey and pull them back tenyard penalty from the previous spot repeat third down so the you get the extra down by two except to the penalty you now put them in the position where a field goal would be about 51 yards <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> can make it from there s no rear long as 58 but you do make it much more difficult but if you turn around and give up a touchdown here yep not much fun going into halftime third down and 12 has to check it down this starts he gets to the 26 makes you feel to go a little bit easier and on fourth down we may can just run it down to the point where theyll take all the time walk the clock leave the giants with nothing but the giants will get the ball when we start the second half they won that toss it to the end of the game and deferred so <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> will come on and try to make an 11 point game at halftime maybe <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> against <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> coming here now watch him slip at the end of this one of the things that steve spagnolo the defensive coordinator was concerned about is that this field can be a little slippery he went back in and encouraged all of his players to put on those longer spikes now a lot of people dont like to do that feeling like it puts their knees and ankles and a little jeopardy so you just wonder how that conversation went with <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> 44 yard attempt on what barring the penalty will be the final play of the opening hands <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> sends it through the uprights to make it 17 to 6 green bay at halftime coming up next is the toyota halftime the first these messages from your local nbc station tonight s firsthalf highlights are brought to you by chevrolet it is <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> deflected image intercepted rogers does a very the sidelines for but that jinora <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> second interception of the night chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row second half out michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya 176 green bay by 11 <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> six of 64 87 yards three receptions for beckham <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> throwing two interceptions in the first half fill in the two tvs <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> with two interceptions keeping the giants alive and there the numbers would back up lihue last week and three catches for a total of 23 yards in his first ever performance at minnesota <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> and the giants will get the ball as we start the third quarter packers come in with a record of two and one off their bye week giants 2 &amp; 2 third quarter begins with a touchback and the flag is down the backers must have come across the line too early he s the flag is down from just about the spot of the kickoff and oculi is tonight s referee and will give us the call shortly after these words from your local station offside by the kicking team number 29 fiveyard penalty read kick well it seems a little onesided green bay s way but it could have been the other way <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> had plenty of opportunities this one to odell beckham wide open on a third and long or second along whatever one was here s another one im <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor cruz</person> this was probably the is that was going to be a touchdown and then the next play the sack bumble courtesy of <person player="kyler fackrell" race="white" position="LB">kyler</person> fact roll so the giants are behind but it s not like there arent things that are possible out there and i remind you once again the packers playing without their two starting quarterbacks so there will be opportunities but theyre gonna have to get these other guys involved a little bit <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor cruz</person> <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sterling</person> shepherd you know even a guy like bobby raining coming out of the backfield just balancing it out a little bit well <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">cruz</person> hasnt caught a pass tonight he s targeted one shepherds been targeted a couple of times he has not caught anything and beckman has the three grand minus one reigning in s2 so a recap this dude s eres a chance to run it back from the two yard line about the and look at michelle well i thought ben mcadoo at halftime and you told me on offense they have got to keep the pocket clean and they have got to find completions as you referenced <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> just six completions in the first half as for mike mccarthy on their offense he said they slowed it down a little slower than usual for the packers offense because they want to get more players involved and he acknowledged <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> two interceptions as being uncharacteristic but he said well be fine horace or as as chris manzo is the guy who needs some attention as <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> will tell the fan base from time to time relax relax big three the giant receivers beckham with those three grabs <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">shepard</person> and <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">cruz</person> blank the giants almost every time theyve come up to the line of scrimmage this you line up in what they call 11 personnel 11 which means it s one running back one tight end and if that means you got the three receivers and you just dont want to take these guys out of the game yeah but you got to throw it to them if youre gonna play them or you might as well go you know play goal line out there these are explosive playmakers these are the guys that have to win your football games there s no question about it this is a dinged up green bay packers secondary this is the perfect opportunity and i still think theyll get to it here there there were too many opportunities missed first half so the first scrimmage play of the second half from the 28 yard line and a yard maybe two for <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> dartmouth that packer defense coming in and otherworldly 18 yards per attempt allowed which is unbelievable and the giants in this game are averaging less than two yards per ushe eight rushes 15 yards manna from the pocket this time he hits <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">shepard</person> so the rookie makes his first grab that of oklahoma he was a number 2 draft choice last year and a first down <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> dark were going to give a little help here against <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> coming out those kind of rib shots right there are remembered for a long time defensive lineman hate those from the 39 yard line clients have only five first downs in the game packs of 15 and that it s just impossible to run against these guys he s here <person player="jake ryan" race="white" position="LB">jake ryan</person> makes the tackle so the total yardage allowed in three games 128 18 yards per carry which is insane more than a quarter of the carries has lost yardage one carry allowed of only 10 yards and more by far the fewest in the nfl and again tonight just on that same pace <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rainey</person> is in the backfield with <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> on second down and 11 eli stepping up look out from behind sakhalin soonerlater plane <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> had to be involved in the action and he was it s been a tough night so far for <person player="eric pinkins" race="UNK" position="LB">eric</person> <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> the left tackle working out here is it flower is going to try and come back and meet them and now youre talking about the one defense and ill say this the pass rush as well the green bay packers have basically played this whole game with two deep safeties to take away the deep threat of these receivers if you cant run against that block with those safeties sitting in the field youll never be able to run third down and 14 dumps it off underneath in short of the first anna s rainy can only take it out to the 43 of course you know on top of that chris the giants going with that what would be their number one and two running backs in <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> and <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> and there s no question about it that dom capers is just dering dering ben mcadoo to run the football saying you cant do it my big guys up front are winning the battles time after time and he s exactly right eight years as the defensive coordinator on mccarthy here s winning department his fourth <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> short kick flag thrown it goes out of bounds at about the 28 yard line and the flag thrown back at about the 24 in mcadoo first year after tom coughlin had been the giants coach for the last 12 mcadoo spent the last two seasons as the giants offensive coordinator and when tom stepped away at the end of last season mcadoo ascended during the punt holding by the receiving team number 28 so 10 yards would reinforce from where the kick went out of bounds first down it s <person player="josh hawkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh hawkins</person> 17 checks auntie <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> probably always takes his offensive linemen out to dinner but im gonna say this week they might get double steaks because there has been no action in that big blue circle around him all day long our all night long as he just continues to stand and look around dance around and can passes you almost feel sorry in some ways for this giant secondary because theyre having to defend for so long against one of the great quarterbacks in football porterhouse ribeye what do you think <person player="john jerry" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jerry</person> jones used to say both from the 15yard line straight ahead to the 19 hit elation the sagina room three second down and seven upcoming and there was so much conversation you hit on it earlier about <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> and all his stuff and he worked with tony award ins and all the different things and so we asked him you know did you change your diet to do anything he said yeah i lost a little weight he said did you change your dye said well can i am southern and you cant really change your diet you just manage it a little bit that s my new word im gonna manage my diet for a while to pull the quarterback a game manager <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> makes the grab and then taken down from behind at the 21 yard line by <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> gain of a couple third down and five one thing you know is that <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> is going to be a guy that will always give you maximum effort even when he s out of the play he s not out of the play get back and get involved in that one on the tail end and almost had a chance to strip that thing out third and five in 18 good protection and then the coverage is good as well <person player="keenan robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">keenan robinson</person> on the tight end <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> so it s fourth down <person player="keenan robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">keenan robinson</person> s had himself a game in coverage he knocked one away down there on the goal line and comes right back on another big third down play to give this offense one more shot came from washington and they are really very pleasantly surprised with him kind of up and down his career in washington the two big plays and this is beckham with his receive the punt that makes a fair catch at the 46 yard line another very short punt by shama 33 yards giant boy well the giants and the packers robust almaty and hudson and some of the hall of fame names through the years y8 settle and hearts are going back to the 60s and of course the great frank gifford so the ray nitschke bridge named in his honor one went to michael strahan and reggie white in the 90s john marathon our family has owned the giants for so many years these two teams first met in 1928 when they met the giants joined the nfl in 1925 and for the first meeting but 88 years ago swing pass caught by beckham and they get beckham the bull a little swing to the outside and he picks up about six or seven yards very nice a little creativity there that time they go empty backfield and theyre going to put their best player odell beckham right back here just swing it out and basically he s just going to outrun the linebacker <person player="jake ryan" race="white" position="LB">jake ryan</person> a nice pickup here spread them out these guys are missing corners make them play that s bobby raining what if it better runs of the night i can get three yards that s saying something yeah let s give them some credit inside latroy guy on and <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> day tony jones <person player="kenny clark" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kenny clark</person> all those guys have just been doing a masterful job allowing them to double up with those safeties against these wide receivers as explosive plays just have not happened raise the back on third and one get the first answer through the yard <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor</person> takes the ball to the 42 yard line with nine minutes to go in the third quarter temperature was 54 at the start of the game right now were down into the mid 40s that s green bay it is welcome to green bay here we go big rookie right there youve got <person player="kenny clark" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kenny clark</person> taking <person player="weston richburg" race="white" position="C">weston richburg</person> who really struggled against linville joseph of the vikings just overpowering the packers were going to try and do the same thing to him tonight let s get a little push rainy break an attack oh and it takes it down of the 25yard line so the giants on the move done by 11 now theyre doing what they should be doing which is they have weapons spread the ball around spread the field theyre missing corner backs let s get some oneonone matchups <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rainey</person> is the guy that sort of taken over is for <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person> who s theyre receiving back he can do some good things for them but he poked <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> out of ucla is the back here they fake it to him swing it to <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> who had a big play last week @minnesota and the rookie takes the ball to the 11 yard line another first down now theyre using odell beckham in this half as a decoy theyre going to bring him around and it s going to get people s attention allowing the screen to sneak out here wherever odell beckham goes theyre going to be a lot of people going that way and they threw to them so much the first half now as a decoy he s actually much more valuable is going to get sacked <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick</person> barry having a real good year making his <person player="mark herzlich" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> the one time number one pick back in 2012 out of ucla talk about using your hands watch this one now <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> is going to just swat <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> drops his head and <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> just slams down on top of his head and goes right around them sorry trojans girl out of usc <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> at a ucla in the backfield givethem inside handle he takes the ball to the 30yard line third and long giants for over a year now big problems in the red zone nine turnovers nexttolast since the beginning of last season beckham comes into the slot threeman rush <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s going to take off and only get to the 12 yard line so again red zone problems for the giants well have to settle for a field goal which would make it a onepossession game back them theyre just theyre dropping eight men in coverage theyre not going to give up anything cheap i went across the zone there was really nowhere to go they were gonna get it nice call by dom capers everybody covered up or seal i to run one thing they are not worried about is <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> running the football they were very clear about that that would be correct 30 are 2/10 off the foot of <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">josh brown</person> just inside the right upright by the hand to go and the third it s an eightpoint game we lay on top among the others sitting in with jimmy on the tonight show this week see all the way from solvang spot your people out oh yeah spell your name right the next time when you get the time that worst message is the nats you had so touch back there and were at lambeau field and for those of you who were watching whatever else other programming tonight aloha and welcome to lambeau field where it s 17 to 9 the green bay packers on top and were gonna factcheck you oh boy all right let s go for the keys to tonight s game have been for you no question the green bay packers offensive line has basically kept this defensive line the pass rushers of the giants off and <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> quite frankly missing about four big opportunities it s still a one score game almost remarkably because it s felt like the packers all the way and <person player="roger lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">roger</person> said spectacular protection and once again <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> cant hold on will be second down and 10 a little recap here hot start for green bay they scored on their first drive but rogers with two touchdowns and hex fault by generous <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> to cut in the offseason from the rams eli of the fumble lost sack three times beckham fairly quiet night all things considered after especially after last week four catches 48 yards and no extracurricular stuff going on up to the 27 yard line statistically take a look at that rushing yardage for new york negligible green bay meanwhile thanks to <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> 119 totally yardage in green bay picked up a lot of that in the first quarter and the two interceptions creating the two turnovers and the sack bumble by <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> the giant turnover and mcadoo the giants rookie head coach firstyear 39 years old coaching in his 15 giants coming in with a record of 2 &amp; 2 certainiy jous voiding nobody is open so an imagined defense especially if that first dry when winged being marched down the field 16 plays into the end zone england equal to the task <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> on the outside against the knights star for the giants norris <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> table on the other side working against the veteran <person player="leon hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">leon hall</person> nothing doing and i almost feel that ive given the giants defense a round of applause because they have kept this team game and once again he lies going to get another opportunity we will show me that a flag that comes in here greenbay converted for third downs on that first drive and since then one giants have stopped them on almost every third down opportunity the packers have had since that opening drive you know youre allowed to be pushed out of bounds if youre one of those gunners that <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> has to get back in bounds you cant just run you know and behind ben mcadoo over there and you cant play with it <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> is the guy that can run though theyve got a lot more speed on this team this year that the <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> and <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> have medeiros a guy that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> would love to see on the field more i sportsman like conduct by the receiving correction by the kicking team number 83 he went out of balance remained out of bounds as he covered the punt that is unsportsmanlike conduct 15 yards added to where the ball went out of bounds first out <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> there we go he s gonna go out of here and stay over there okay you can get pushed out but now you have to go fight your way almost immediately back into the field to play a lot easier to run down that white stripe but it s the reason they dont let you do it so the penalty will tack on the extra yardage you know here we are again in there sitting there at midfield you that super bowl mvp quarterbacks and great receivers on the outside we get lacing on the table being looked at on the green bay sideline cost effect on the goes all the way back and beckham what happened in there and then banged out about into the green bay bench and tells <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> hi no problem that was definitely a reverse pass they were had routes going down the field youll see odell beckham putting it in his right hand and really should have just thrown this thing out of bounds i know he doesnt know the quarterback goals but at that point bruised was going to go in and then here he goes in <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> fighting 6yard law sets up a second down and 16 from the 43 under florida go in the quarter <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> that hit as he throws in the pass is incomplete intended for <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sterling</person> shepherd so it s third down and a mile and a mile for erick <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> at the left tackle position you can tell it s eli s starting to think about it a little bit now that if on every play youre getting hit in some way shape or form from that blindside not much fun <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> completing 50% 11 to 22 for 141 yards third and 16 the line of scrimmage flag down as well an ocular looking over at the bench holding in 467 the penalty is declined for <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff</person> fork down <person player="justin pugh" race="white" position="OG">justin pugh</person> now that s tough when you put the guy like <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> or day tone jones inside this time day tone jones and right there you could see justin pew who s really played very well at that left guard position all year giving it up and the giants net offense on that drive five or six <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> has had a few of those in his career which should wind up someday with an induction speech and in canton i would agree redwing this will be his best part of the night and the 18 yard line <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> he did not fall for the fairtax and the giants corral him at the 18 yard line canard thank you the tackle three and a half left in the third eightpoint game behind here on elliot for spain joe on the field friday as the nasher defeated west appear

break off a run like that and then you go playaction the defensive linemen tend to play run first but this is as much time as ive seen a quarterback have all season i mean this offensive line is doing this to perfection look at the space <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> does a great job gliding around but you just cant cover down the field for five seconds green 18 rogers still under 50 percents something that s only happened once in his career at naval or statistical maven to her chill pointed out to me on third down the packers were five for five to start the game but the giants have stayed in the game by denying them on seven straight third down opportunities right now in second at six and the interesting thing with <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> being out of the game <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> is really the only other running back aaron rip kowski is a fullback i guess youd begin to go to <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> and <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> with some of those sets where he they go back into the backfield with diamond formation here strong s has been a credit back and that s a third down and force and he would go after they were fine for five they are now old for their last seven on third down with a minute to go in the third and it s tough when youre running against snacks <person player="damon harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> in there that s one of my favorite nicknames i really do like that it s like it s subtle you know what i mean yeah he s a big guy but he s not fat he s you know he doesnt have doughnuts he just has snacks for but in the pork chop right mcgrath i like pork chop on the 44 be careful hard counted one is poor that s the first time it s poverty stays in bounds ii it s taken down by adams see that streak of stopping them on third down for the giants comes to a hole the ball will be spotted at the 23 yard line that time they end up with the safety <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> on your best slot receiver and quickest guy and <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> that was a nice job by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> to find that matchup and then deliver a perfect shot and that s going to take us to the fourth quarter after three it is green bay 17 and the giants 9 and sunday night football resumes after these messages 17 what about comparison go figure that one out both guys under 50% on both secondaries banged up coming in here yeah did not figure its first on for green bay at the new york 23 yard line take the start time fires and that s incomplete at the goal line im looking around for a flag is none notion the intended receiver <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> right there big time matchup double move on the outside by <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> here but generous <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> has almost singlehandedly kept this giants team in this game i mean somehow or another he is earning whatever they paid him you just check him off the list ids he s paid in full right now were checking john <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> again even on the ground starts you burnin knocking them down for a loss of a couple these teams doing in their divisions dallas one again today four straight philly lost through the first time washington a winner giants are two and two at the moment meanwhile minnesota five and all and the packers at two and one had a bye week detroit a winner today in chicago a loser today vikings the only undefeated team now i think to philadelphia and that is correct well be going down third down and 11 and hell get tackled just short of a first down by <person player="jonathan casillas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">casillas</person> so what is mccarthy going to do here and a fourth and you have to go for that field with one score game right absolutely and the way your defense is playing why not i mean we havent really seen any sign of life weve seen eli make plenty of late comebacks in his career but sooner or later they have to do something in this one a 33 yarder that s good early fourth quarter green bay 20 and the giants nine i dont like the color coordination there or color rush yeah off the goalpost for a touchback 13:46 in regulation manaman company back to work at lambeau what makes football special to me is just the idea that every week everyone s watching you and you have to top what you did the week before you have to be at your best at the very top of your game obviously having some ups and downs with injuries can alter that in a way but my love for the game has never faltered my love for the game of football has never wavered and im excited to be back here playing in <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">victor cruz</person> real good guy we were there and still it off on a sunday night tore up his knee and another problem last year another operation cant half on the shelf let s let s try to get them into the game tonight basically big run on the outside and this is <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bobby rainey</person> able to take it for a first down there you go will you finally get a run here the two deep safeties were talking about but this time youre going to end up with a defensive end crashing inside just miss reading that play i think it was <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> and left no one setting the edge there on the outside so a good start to this drive and the giants desperately need to get a little running game going to keep those two free safeties from just sitting back there and get taken away all the big play possibilities 14 yards for <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rainey</person> longest run against the packers this season pants and all kinds of contact with <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> invicta crews getting hooked up that was a rare one a rare opportunity with just one safety in the middle of field to get a chance to go deep and <person player="victor cruz" race="UNK" position="WR">cruz</person> i think was thinking back shoulder the whole way but so is quinton <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> and because <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rollins</person> was looking back at the football no call second down and <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> checking off underneath and then throwing it behind beckham running through the middle sham across there s third down and ten he like tried to make an offbalance throw there but he did have time that time the protection was good enough he stepped up and tried to sort of do a fadeaway jumper back to odell who had a little room as head coach <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> is now in the backfield all the pass rushers in and <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> not a good blocker blitz dan tip incomplete <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> the linebacker got a hand on and intended for <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">shepard</person> and the giants put between out that was a big play that time by thomas because <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">shepard</person> had some room coming across there and i think would have had the first down against <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> but thomas able to jump up as that nickel linebacker make the play and hell i knew that one had a chance 11 of 26 tonight has been busy this will be his sixth party are my words fair caught there by <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> two minutes into the fourth quarter green bay up by 11 images from that 61 nfl championship game lombardi s first title in 2007 and if she championship game giants stunning the packers in overtime going on to eventually knock off undefeated new england in the super bowl rodgers to work in the 20yard line the bench that give it to <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> it s a game 21 to the 21 second down to nine weve been talking about this packers offensive line all night long you know josh sit playing with the bears but across the board every one of these offensive life and either ranked in the top ten four out of five or top 15 for laying <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">taylor</person> coming in they are the best pass protecting group in the nfl according to pro football focus unblocking not bad either at 13 and they are proving it tonight i mean rodgers has had all night sitting in the pocket and when he does get flushed that eventually you know need this in the outside this time he does get some pressure but he steps away as he does so often and it s almost picked off again intended for <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> itll be third down and nine but it was <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> who had it go right through his hands that could have been a game changer there i think that is adams back there little pressure inside and rogers made an offbalance throw but that went right through the mitts i could have been interception number three for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and really should have been did that get tipped quite telev adams is able to get a hand on it or not third down and and his throws that is caught and staying on a speed and getting the first down is carving a lot more and then he drops the ball but after the play was over socom was going to be stopped green bay was going to have to punt broke away breaking tackles takes the ball onto the 38 yard line it just cant happen great play by <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> but you have two linebackers theyre missing tackles i believe it was <person player="keenan robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">keenan robinson</person> and <person player="johnathan hankins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">johnathan</person> casilla but you have to be able to finish the deal on a guy that weighs about 195 pounds third down youre off the field you have another chance huge fist tackles and eight answers tonight from 95 for <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> where the touchdown call back on the penalty rodgers throws and that pass is caught <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> along the sideline <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> is right there <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> arguing the call and what <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> wants mcadoo to do is throw the challenge flag i dont think youre gonna have enough from that view to challenge it that looked like a catch he got his hand in there and it almost looked like it was <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> he kept it off the ground well what a that window is about a foot by a foot that he could put that one in oh mcadoo is going to throw the challenge flag here and so this will be looked at by hawk yulian company decides it s a felony ruling in the field that the pass was complete it would be 12 yard gain for a first down the street come back youre rolling in the field of the pastures complete stance s paul the <person player="jonathan casillas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> tries to get this background actually like how theyre doing this stands a lot more this year unless it is absolutely decisive and that clearly was and i thought it was almost decisive that it was a catch but youre seeing more and more and more than unless it s a nobrainer just stands i think that s the right way to do replay right you dont see enough there to to overturn it could be significant that the giants use the timeout as we head down the stretch sit down by 11 exactly 11 minutes to go first out of the 50 yard line squirts away for the yard meet me itll be second down and nine for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> some of his numbers fell off especially a season ago and a lot of those issues were issues throwing outside the numbers just not as good as it was back in 2014 which was unbelievable 2008 to 14 and i asked him specifically about it and why he thought that was he said we just didnt have the kind of speed that we had you know <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> was gone <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> this <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> comes in to add some speed but back shoulder throws only work when you can scare people down the field and they couldnt do that last year why was that <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> comes in puts pressure on but he gets it away to <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> flag is down it shakes out of bounds but would be a close to an 18yard gain after wait right now for the coal it was second down and nine before the pass was thrown holding defense that penalty is declined play results in a first down to give <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> credit for a 17 yard reception and the ball now at the 32 yard line the va <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> almost going to get a little pressure around the outside beating blaga there and the old reddit pick that wasnt a pick play and your outside running and there s a stack of three linebackers in traffic nothing jinora <person player="janoris jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jenkins</person> could do start its bounced down at just about the line of scrimmage so <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> who was going to be stopped on third down big broken tackle here getting away from the linebacking core moving the chains and right now theyre clearly in scoring territory yeah congratulations the <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> got engaged actually graduated from the university of kentucky as well this offseason very determined young man ill tell you it was fun watching him in college at the university of kentucky he played every position there was on the field tonight he catches for 95 yards rogers clock ticking down to 9 minutes just does get him go up long is <person player="trevin wade" race="UNK" position="DB">wade</person> out of it line is <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> he was slow in getting up market just short of the first down what an incredible effort though onehanded bear crawl or whatever you want to call it but that was because he was hit so he definitely would have been down and he almost crawled his way for that first down now youre putting a tremendous amount of pressure on all parts of your body trying to do that it was a great effort injury momentary time out here to let atoms get back to the bench and it s going to make a third down and one now at the 23yard line and now there is no shortage of wide receivers around here though this <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor davis</person> can absolutely fly he s very green doesnt know exactly what he s doing he s in there right now number 11 <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> we saw him in a playoff game we know what he can do every darris they love chasing sprigs for gelas one minute 78 on this play and give it to the fullback witkowski during his quest spontoon imitation takes a ball took everybody with him everybody they might have to go out for a pint after that scrum watch the big guy right here <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj</person> laying get this old scrum started going right behind him and he never stopped his kept pushing and pushing down the field there comes a got this everybody boy i love that i never saw that when i played football now the scrums are like a usual thing anymore that s fun crowd goes crazy to how they loved it ss of a first hand and goal when they thought of the formation who starts at the time starts three raj is cromartie making the tackle halfway through the fourth quarter second down and goal what does this giants defense have one more stand in them because they have been battling all night long because their offense simply has not been able to do anything in this game theyre gonna have to find a way to stand up here and force a field goal three field goals for the giants tonight and a team there came in ranked 27th only put three points on the board three times good night second off that clock you know all kinds of time surveying for those corner end zone incomplete tended for <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers and a set of a third down and goal just a perfectly thrown ball absolutely perfect there is nothing the defense can do with this ball this ball was thrown a yard out of bounds and only <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers could catch it but you should have but that s exactly what you want from your quarterback zero danger in that throw this will be the 12th play of the drive and he s taken a lot of time off the clock there were 13 minutes left when it started 646 right now third and goal goes intended for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> in the corner of the endzone but the coverage is good by trevon <person player="trevin wade" race="UNK" position="DB">wade</person> and the giants are able to at least keep it within a two possession game as the field goal group comes in fire the safety blitz <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> coming right through on block rodgers had no choice but to get it out of there and i was <person player="trevin wade" race="UNK" position="DB">trevin wade</person> who struggled a week ago coming up with a big play at least keeping this game a possibility that he like had put together a late couple of drives 25yard attempt for <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> he s made 44 and 33 yard near goals tonight and his third one right through the uprights here was 639 remaining in the fourth green bay 23 in the giants nine but we go to texas next week to houston specifically <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew</person> luck in the indianapolis colts against the houston texans football ninth america it s a started at 7:00 eastern time colts texans on sunday night football one week from tonight houston three and two tennessee legged against miami not against chicago jaguars were off woman 3 and who luck was sharp today though the gamewinner 2dy hilt right at the end of that me and is that one to beat the bears so <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> walking around on the sidelines hasnt plates early in the fourth tipoff here this is <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bobby rainey</person> with a good run back out to the 37 yard line six and a half lifted before it giants with <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> now by 14 the giants can they mount something from the 37 yard line <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> it s almost picked off <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> almost picking it off second down came out and he was looking for i think right there odell beckham coming that way didnt find it threw it up late and caught a break that that one wasnt picked off by <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> knocked out when he fell to the ground but a little tip of the cap out there to <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> who is really playing this slot corner done a great job in a tough circumstance for him father of breaking a tackle and at least getting a little bit of yardage is bobby lee rainie he s getting a little bit back watch the one overall third down and 11 missed him late but for ben mcadoo who without question this job was his because of how <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> was playing that s the reason he got the job it has been a disappointing few games here lately science started the season in the capital wins over dallas in new <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> and then backtoback defeats washington in minnesota and the virgin <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> escapes goes on the run for 50 yard line and is able to extend it and catch is made by jorel adams who would beat your number two tight end tonight and three overall in <person player="larry donnell" race="UNK" position="TE">larry donnell</person> fit healthy rookie at a south carolina not even close by far the best play hell i <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s bay tonight what led then <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> goes down ball loose had too many guys on the field j ron <person player="jayrone elliott" race="UNK" position="LB">elliott</person> who reads the fumble theyre too many guys on the field that s the preliminary indication already you see this right here at the bottom there we go those guys running off late tyrone <person player="jayrone elliott" race="UNK" position="LB">elliott</person> he likes sunday night football there were files by both teams at the play the illegal shift by the offense number 13 it was also 12 men in the field defense those penalties offset replay first down okay then mcadoo he was interviewed to the philadelphia job as we take a look at what happens here that s a tough night tonight for <person player="eric pinkins" race="UNK" position="LB">eric</person> <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> he s playing okay but tonight has been nothing but a train wreck that green bay packers have studs playing outside and he s gonna almost give up the football supposed to getting a first down well you just wonder how much different this game might have been if wilt i had been able to come up with that pass from <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> just before the half and then the sack fumble and turn around they got the field goal out of it youd swing by shepherd but only a threeyard gain im talking about mcadoo was interviewed for the philadelphia job laughter so much tom coughlin s were surrounded on the doug peterson and then the sella say that he was actually interviewed the head coaching job at cleveland back in 2014 before i went to new york as the offensive coordinator second down and six now clock ticking down of 420 under pressure loses the ball to play that way coming forward the <person player="ereck flowers" race="nonwhite" position="OT">flowers</person> is right there so arm going ahead itll be third down ball <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> the young ricky we trying to sneak out here and give him something and lie hit him in the derriere there the youth commission for something third and six screen setup and that s gonna be a first down as <person player="bobby rainey" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bobby rainey</person> comes out of the backfield to the giants on the move but the clocks on the move as well under four to play anytime you get a blitz to one side and the screen to the same side you feel pretty good about that they came with a lot of pressure <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> covering up the blitz on that side i saw it timeout was called by green bay before that last snap music conference rubies the green bay was subbing yeah so the giants subbed so the referee or the is gonna sit right there and not let him snap it i think they snapped it between his legs trying to get that fiveyard penalty that s not where you want to be when a play starts mmhmm and even mccarthy can laugh about it the offense substituted number 28 come out came out of the bench area therefore we were holding up the ball as is required by rule where the ball was snapped there is no foul on the play there is no play it is first down he said jiron elliot loves something i thought there was a certain out charge to green bay no timeout charge to green bay that s a good well start when i blow my whistle and it hockley love sunday night football to little little hint of paint fred hockley as well right for him you may want to go shirt sleeves tonight it s about 44 degrees at the moment and retreats means it to the outside adams then with the second grab on this drive was forced out of bounds at about the 13 yard line jarell adams an interesting guy rookie six rounder but he was a basketball player who ran for six for long and lanky only played eight snaps coming in here but because of that injury tulare now getting a chance and taking advantage first out of the 13 yard line three and a half to play it looks like odell beckham in oneonone coverage but really not with that safety though middle there goes <person player="paul perkins" race="nonwhite" position="RB">perkins</person> that to six yard line 511 200 pound working at a ucla is <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> looking up at the board and the clock ticking down of three minutes at second and five lumber let the rookies in the game right as far as audible system is concerned kuki wiki s three key rookies in there fires to the back of the endzone touchdown what a grand buy back under throw is high if it who threw it over his hand when it left <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s hands odell goes up makes a catch <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">brown</person> is looking at the replay did he get both feet in with possession is the question let s see boy the referee had is gonna look as anybody but man he didnt put his heel on they were on the field did that toe go down without the heel because remember if that heel doesnt touch then the toe is what counts but if the heel touches then he would be out of bounds since the whole thing is the right toe down completely inbounds before the heel is down where the heel is clearly on the white you could see he was desperately trying to keep that heel off the ground i talked about it earlier they have a lot of plays that just stand is there enough to overturn the call of a touchdown on the field see the yeah i think think back cleat is off the ground i dont think theyre gonna overturn it wieszczyk i think for summer i think they can overturn i just think that theyre gonna look at this and think that his foot was on the boundary but im like 55 45 on this let s see you can call it at home this official is looking right down at that foot is now if the front part is on the white definitely out of balance i cant i pretty darn clever stuff from odell whether he other accounts are not grateful a great catch he s looking up at it yeah that might not be enough to overturn i mean the official is right there there s nothing conclusive down the line look i mean that s as close as youre gonna get the rest head is he s right there so at the moment im gonna say it s gonna stand now because i just dont see anything conclusive to overturn what the official just saw i think that s the back turn that was i think scott pelvis in the the back judge there who had a bird s eye look at that baby the ruling on the field stands it is a touchdown there is clear shot that is clear and obvious that the foot was out of bounds i said it before so im not coming off of it now id like what theyre doing with that if it s obvious change it if it s not let the officials play but this is a ball game now especially that the guy is right there you talk about great officiating at least on the field that s plants that s the best one in the whole year so far oh of course odell beckham earlier lost the battle with the kicking that took one in the chops comes back and gives it a kiss there we go were all even now kicking that that s his buddy that s great so beckham five catches 56 yards and <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">brown</person> for the extra point so beckham finally gets his first touchdown of the season let s watch the whole round here and take a good solid look at this one aha clinton dix picked him up then tried to plaster him in the back the end zone goes up and gets it but to have the presence of mind to not let that shell get on the ground i mean it s just clever football clever football then eli is gonna take a shot at the tale into that one but he knew his guy was a leaper and a one hander and all those sort of things just give him a chance <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> able to knock him down and just smile he was able to do so there well they have a chance to smile again is the question the giants do the onside kick here within the fifth you know classic there s so much pressure in this game you have to be able to laugh every once in a while that timeout we mentioned before when they had to use it on the challenge could now come back to be an issue they have two timeouts you also have the twominute and steam is out there for green bay is they have to guard against the onside kick and well see what <person player="josh brown" race="white" position="K">josh brown</person> has in mind not really a pure in steam situation 35 yard line so now <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is going to go to the green bay packers theyre in a the mid so they wont have to travel for a month and a half this is the second of four home games they dont have a road game until the end of the month the giants meanwhile gonna go home for for their next five and their only road games a neutral site game in london against the rams so some interesting stuff coming up yeah it is in the nfc east which had sort of become that division the everybody made a little fun of or whatever but now with some of these young players these young quarterbacks two rookie quarterback starting in that division it s becoming very competitive and at least coming into today they had the best overall record and football that division washington redskins started out only two now they won through and run michael ball normally the giants two and two coming in and the packers trying to go to three and one and try to keep pace with minnesota already five and oh from the 35 now weve done the clock year starts goes to the outside and youll get taken down to 32 yard line so that s a loss right there <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> makes the tackle and the giants will use the timeout one remaining plus the twominute warning weve talked about the lack of pressure but there has been excellent play from everybody playing outside linebacker defense ben when it comes to the running game tonight ive only seen one real mistake in the whole evening but it has almost been impossible to get out on the edge so even though they dont pile up the sack numbers quite yet <person player="olivier vernon" race="nonwhite" position="DE">vernon</person> and <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> certainly doing the job in the run game oh dont rub his hands in anticipation of getting one more shot giant defense right now has to do its job second down and 13 at the 32 yard line youve got arguably the best quarterback in football here but you almost have to run to force them to burn that last timeout and if you drop the throw on third down exit stop it again it s not your office johnse loses the ball next one thinks he has it but the giants feel at least adams does im not sure they never really had that ball that was the strangest looking thing he turned around and he s cut it it just never settled into his body the green bay s gonna wind up with the ball his bizarre an oculus his wine the clock as well what watch the football here he s gonna turn and it just flies out almost winds up in <person player="kelvin sheppard" race="UNK" position="LB">kelvin</person> shepards arms and he cant hold on to it oh my goodness for the new york giants defensively with all theyve done if <person player="sterling shepard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">shepard</person> could have come up with that one i mean when the clock is running so mcadoo says time out and the clock tick a couple of more seconds and final timeout well mcadoo is saying he s put to put those seconds back on the clock at least go back to you know to 28 to 29 right and as they were try all the timeout was called even better t30 that s exactly right because they had to unpiloted the ball so they didnt start the play clock at that point so the timeout was properly taken but here we are back down to that descent i think they called that incomplete right so now it s going to be third and 10 and now decision time as far as throwing the ball theyre going to give him the theyre gonna give him the catch on that the 2 yard catch ball was recovered two yards back right at the line of scrimmage now they put it down at the 35yard line right they lost yardage on first down that s right so now it s dirty ten must get a stop here that s on the is that twominute warning and rogers listen to the outside and it s going to be a big first down for who pays the <person player="brian price" race="nonwhite" position="DT">price</person> takes a shot but takes the ball out to the 48 yard line on top of it he stays in bounds which is going to take us to the twominute warning after the injury timeout hit by <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> three of the biggest plays in this game have come from <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> no question about it there we go just going to make that kind of a move and think of the one where he broke the tackles before anybody wanted out <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> right now he is basically delivered almost every big play tonight for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and he took a shot to the head there from <person player="landon collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">landon collins</person> well did the ball come out he goes down i think his hip hit before anything happened anyway well he goes off the field and then they wind the clock and that s going to take us to the twominute warning and there s gonna be first down and the giants are out of timeouts so it s been a huge struggle green bay on the cusp of going to three in one 23:16 green bay so the giants who started off with a win in dallas on opening day then he went out over new <person player="orleans darkwa" race="UNK" position="RB">orleans</person> only to lose a fourth quarter lead against washington with the minnesota last week and you know what happened there so it has not been a very pleasant two trips to the upper midwest for beckham tonight no extra stuff really a little extra love for the net id love for the neck that was about it nothing nothing insidious though he doesnt need to get under the innocent have to wind up in dr ruth s chair next week everybody else in the world was weighing in <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> a great night really key plays and for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> we were tracking it all night average of three point three three seconds per pass an incredible amount of time to throw and the ability of <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> to by that time many ways was the difference in the game so aaron just barely over 50% that s on it s a little hug there from ben mac to of course the two worked together so closely over the years mike mccarthy of course the hiring been late into this job and their first confrontation ends with a green bay wind blowing and postgame report coming up on the other side of the break
