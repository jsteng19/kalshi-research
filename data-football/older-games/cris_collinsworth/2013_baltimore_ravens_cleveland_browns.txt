race="nonwhite" position="RB">scott</person> green is our referee work triple appearance defense quality placed at the spot of the foul first down hey took quite a conference to figure out not just what the call was but where they would place the ball either way it s going to be a first down for these cleveland browns browns lost last week at kansas city 23 17 they trailed 13 nothing within three points the entire fourth quarter they played well then take a lot of the positive movement they feel from that game into today first and 10 from the 34 for <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> <person player="joe thomas" race="white" position="OT">thomas</person> the block the one temple and that is proc crab by the lunar making his move looking for pocky gets one from canon and from behind brought down by jamil maclean to the raven 34 a <person player="ishmaaily kitchen" race="UNK" position="DT">kitchen</person> run of 32 in a cleveland first down probably the best play weve seen from <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg little</person> all season law because he catches this ball in traffic delivered by jason cowboyed noah turner the offensive coordinator for the cleveland browns he challenged the likes of <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg little</person> and devon best saying that the receivers he needed more production out of them and named both guys specifically about <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> responded mark please <person player="marqueis gray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gray</person> this is the wildcat formation and you see the tackle made by <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur</person> jones it is a gain of one <person player="marqueis gray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">gray</person> is a rookie free agent from minnesota and he was cut by san francisco a college quarterback at the university of minnesota and they run that wildcat from time to time picking up a yard shuckin down a nine theyre doing everything they can to try to manufacture some offense to this football team you know and their five losses theyve only averaged 12 points per game struggling to put points on the board on the fake tonight a teen ager look at cats brought down by ladarius wim he s near the five a 28yard connection by one of the best so far in the nfl the young player out of baylor <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> first and goal watch the play accent rate right there that s what allows <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> to get open at the second level this is what we call a bang gate soon as he hits the top of that route the balls got to be right upon the receiver you can see josh court beating ladarius whip inside gaining position that ball was on <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> before the safety could react to help on coverage three tight ends one of which is on the top of your screen as a receiver first and goal at the 6 and a timeout taken by baltimore each team with two were just starting and cleveland browns on the move no score 9:28 to play in the first weve had some big completions on this drive of 32 yards to the wide receiver out of north carolina <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg little</person> in a 28 yard pass moments ago to <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> and here theyve got it first and goal at the raven 6 you can see what theyve done their last 20 possessions against the baltimore ravens where the ravens of that defense had great success against these cleveland browns but theyve not been able to score now with <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> let s see what they can do to find some room in there there s not a whole lot he picks up a yard smith was there with the stop and suds and also linebacker <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh bynes</person> second down and goal remember jason cab was the third quarterback to start for these cleveland browns this season i think what he gives them kevin is he gives him obviously the veteran presence having started 72 career games but his big garment experience i think should bode well for this football second goal of the five after jones was chasing and he lost his balance <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> and <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> were in the end zone area for the cleveland browns incomplete <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> does a lot of things he has a lot of confidence a lot of starts in the nfl just exactly what this cleveland offends me i think his experience brings poise to this is a very young football team here with the cleveland browns as you could see third goal the mobility that he gives you is quite surprising i think to most defenses he s a tall long and rangy quarterback but his experience i think to just throw that ball away and live to fight another day is just another added benefit very good red zone defense for baltimore number one in the nfl third and goal of the five new overnight lists out of bounds across the way by <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> a sonic game of four to the one this is just a great break on the ball by <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> he closes in quickly understanding youve got to get your hand on him to get him out of bounds before he turns up to hit the chalk he s able to keep obadiah out of the end zone looks like the browns gonna go for they know points come out of preview when youre playing against this baltimore ravens defense in with a veteran quarterback give him a shot and put some points on the board so you like him going forward here not taking three i do like them going for it if you have a good plan if you can get the right matchup i would prefer to go in and take the three points all right timeout taken are going to talk it over fourth and goal early in the game and you see no score so cleveland is used to timeouts already weve got eight they have to play in the first quarter they talked it over there they go fourth and goal at the boat to go one watch for <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">cameron</person> 84 and the best red zone receivers in the nfl sample turner david fisher days <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> i betcha that is a cleveland chrome touchdown so the gamble and aggressive play calling by rob kazinsky a dork turner pays off he s in the slot theyre blitzing here comes do merville ball out quick and the catch by dvon best in tight coverage best had been battling to hold on to the football at some critical trump s last week that came into today s game leading the league with nine drops at boyd he come through for his head coach on the fourth down play web and grammar on the coverage oneyard touchdown throw by quarterback <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> and the extra point by former raven <person player="billy cundiff" race="white" position="K">billy cundiff</person> and 7nothing browns divine pass his first touchdown reception as a cleveland brown the x dolphin hauling it in a lot of congestion 7zip cleveland now the browns are very confident coming into today by virtue of what they did last week in kansas city although losing but playing well they thought and they played well behind <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> particularly in the second half of the ball game he appears to have great rhythm at chemistry with these receivers and allowing everyone to take their game to another level after the oneyard touchdown pass to devon vests the ensuing kickoff <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> had four different receivers here at cleveland browns defense is on the field and the auto pattern reading is critical to their zone defense watch here on the three receiver side there are also three defenders each defender will look to cover an area and the underneath is all while vacating an area to which the quarterback it appears to be uncover now watch as the safety will match up to the number two receiver to intercept the pass pattern reading allows defenses to play a player s all coverage while fading the quarterback look for the browns defense to do some of the same things to <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> today up to the oneyard touchdown pass by a cleveland his flag go on first and ten he s got wide receiver <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deonte thompson</person> seventh catch of the season it is a pickup of nine he s up to the 29 yard line and the defense for the browns good run stuffers and <person player="phil taylor" race="UNK" position="DT">phil taylor</person> in a table reuben all krueger was i picked by the baltimore franchise years ago and here s the second area right there at 80 as the number one defensive back and a gain of five as they bring it up the middle with <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> gets the first down he s at the 34 yard line you know this matchup zone we talked about for the cleveland browns is brought here by ray horton their defensive coordinator some of the same zone blitz concepts that dick lebron uses in pittsburgh these baltimore ravens they seen it before as much as they played the pittsburgh steelers five cents of x its first detail dont until flatnose gonna run the show you could cease doing it <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> he says he fears about herself he is he has filled all season krueger jumps on his back and it is a gain of about a yard up to they make it to up to the 36 kevin what <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> is doing he s got a count the number of defenders in the box if he gets six defenders in the box he s got to check a run play as you saw him be there he s gonna lie and <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> to try to get the run game going came into today s game averaging 28 gone to carry on going second down and eight a grab <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thompson</person> again second catch today 45 yard line picks up 10 that is a first down again for the raven remember jim caldwell the offensive coordinator with the ravens served in that same capacity as well as the head coach in indianapolis for years with payton maddox some of the things you saw payton do four years at indy theyre now allowing till <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> to do with this multiple ravens offense he s running the show from the line of scrimmage after reading the defense as opposed to ten right here <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> theyre from <person player="aq shipley" race="nonwhite" position="C">shipley</person> they get through in a hurry <person player="desmond bryant" race="nonwhite" position="DL">desmond bryant</person> the <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> blew it up wash up two on the play back to the 44 and what are the more interesting points to take a look for take a look think of his own block see they pulled the guards it s all a zone run scheme and that s one of the huge adjustments that the baltimore ravens are having to make this year where in the past there s a lot of mantoman blocking bit strong offensive linemen coming off pounding the running game this year theyve gone to a zone scheme has taken some time for them to adjust and be productive so i get down in 12 picked off on the play by <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">owens</person> the former atlanta falcon it s incomplete what did <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> tell us about this cleveland browns defense he said you know the guys had a pretty good secondary but you know not only are they good they know they are good he said they theyre very confident group and you can see whether it s <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> whether it s bust the screen again <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> throws the ball behind the intended receiver seen him do that now for the second time in the ballgame he was looking for <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thompson</person> once again throw down in 12 six in the secondary for the browns have also brought emily im ecstatic it s got too many on the field dont think i think they do and event live in <person player="leon mcfadden" race="UNK" position="DB">mcfadden</person> from then on defense fiveyard penalty still throw down yeah theyve got too many on the field <person player="leon mcfadden" race="UNK" position="DB">mcfadden</person> he got he got caught out there he s a rookie look see youve got a number of different guys you got four guys on the line of scrimmage got three linebackers and then youve got five dps and i watch see he s trying to get out of there but there he is youre the 12th guy the odd man out still the hi number of those uh back six third and seven are his wife s at his side it comes from code anika 45 and im the move they got to us but down by scream the <person player="ishmaaily kitchen" race="UNK" position="DT">kitchen</person> roll takes him to the cleveland 28 he picks up 23 first and 10 baltimore i think <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> just showed us something that he brings to the table a lot of quarterbacks dont who are pocket passes he s a very mobile guy he can move but get him throw that ball to <person player="tandon doss" race="UNK" position="WR">doss</person> even while he was pressing the line of scrimmage climbing the puck and so confidence really good play by flatting watson set the offense got 11 personnel one running back once i get three why he severs it s the personnel look choice with <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> for this ravens office and he plundered the drive <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> down on the play by <person player="john hughes" race="UNK" position="DT">john hughes</person> it is a gain of four to the 24 yard line of the cleveland brown once again at six in the box he was gonna check to iran and its really very unselfish for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> most of these quarterbacks and we know it s a quarterback in the league they want to throw it every single time but he s going to be very patient he reads six defenders in the box he s gonna check to the rod give the ball to <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> give it to put our peers and let the run game get going this comes in second six six defenders of the box again it s incomplete looking for crown coverage by screen that makes it third and six before we get there let s go to the orc and jane the baltimore ravens before their bye week so all these teams are in the hunt in the afc 4 flat got 36 and county knows this time it s quinton rhodes who makes the sent second of the year he s brought down at the 34 he loses nine the first sack for cleveland d and theyll try for three well the baltimore offense his front seven there s girls there working against michael war coming around the right side he comes around that in and to quayle jackson and the party vias <person player="barkevious mingo" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mingo</person> get pressure in the face and black holes not able to climb the pocket <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">groves</person> come away with the sound it s six x last week against kansas another spot seven a day are a lot to deal with it could be a handful for this ravens austin <person

brought down the play by edible on a gain of two to the 22 yard line well it is the nfl s longest active winning streak by one team over another 11 consecutive raven win yeah <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> has been the quarterback for the ravens through all of those eleven win cities commit to the national football league he s been the ravens starting quarterback and he has never lost to these cleveland browns but he said you know they are tough defense he feels like theyve always been good and he says all of these games have been relatively close they expect it to be the same way today green santee dominates where the pillars in the backfield and exit <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> the virtue i feel it occurred engine on the side locked down by mclain and he s out of bounds he said about the 22 and no gain on the play yet during that time the browns youre talking about he doesnt so seven theyve had four different head coaches and five different quarterbacks well rob kazinsky wants to put it into all that they want some consistency they believe that the veteran leadership of <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> will give them some stability on offense allow them to score more points they believe they have the foundations of a really good defense here they really do need to improve their play at quarterback and maintain some consistency on offense <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> looks analytical on third down and eight overnight out of the backfield the block by <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">schwartz</person> the running sample he needs to ferdie and ice choco slavophil by the rookie at a kansas state with a fragile <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur brown</person> made the stop conceive camp a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit shaken up on the plane wow he landed hard on careful this number 92 15yard penalty first down and that was third and eight he s got some turf on his grill and we talked about quarterbacks in their veteran presence you know they know if i sly you cant hit me if i go ahead first unlike any other football player now watch this this is not a slide that s hit first and he s falling he s hauling falling not not as falling that s a football play the quarterback has the ability to save himself simply by sliding you go feet first they cant hit you as youre going down you go ahead first theyre just like any other football player including a running back in as much as you hate to see this from the browns and <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> leaving the game not quite a hundred percent a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit woozy he has to be able to slide to protect himself it s the lateness of it obviously which is the problem so <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> will be out framed in weeding the secondyear quarterback out of oklahoma state he was chosen last year by a different front office to be the franchise quarterback he has had a horrible season hasnt played since green bay a couple weeks ago he is greed with a chorus of boos and here he goes he started the first two games he got hurt <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> came in he started the next three he got hurt wheaton came in he played poorly <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite"

kind of put the team at ease that <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> is here nobody we talked to him he told us he s relieved to still be here in cleveland as you watch him on this end around he seems bit to say the last day of the training deadline waiting by the phone failure to leave the house and when the phone didnt ring he felt a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit better about leaving stays and first intent <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> run up the gut and again a for life there but game he wasnt shoving after the play as you can see division rivals familiar with each other le bowie s and then lost his hat he was down there heavily with <person player="greg little"

position="LB">daryl smith</person> the leading tackler it s a loss of two back to the 34 i know it was a screen play but <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg little</person> was wide open going down the middle of the field and of course wheaton s doing what he s instructed to do on the screen play try to get it out to his back the times when whedon has struggled which has been often this season it s really been about his lack of accuracy where he s had receivers open and he s missed guys he s been wide open and that s why theyve gone to other quarterbacks but now that he s in the game he s got to compose himself and be able to make some plays within the offense third and 23 they need the 43 of baltimore right up the middle and the rookie was leading the charge it s an incomplete pass and it s brown who is a second round pick out of kstate <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur brown</person> what defense tightening the screws right there cleveland s got a punt you got to set the protection and and write that look who s he throwing that ball to kevin he s in the pocket is it within the framework of the pocket doesnt get the ball back

has a fair catch 49 yard line near the 18 yard line he is a good one and emerging this year what is tom brady and the conductor of the new york philharmonic have in common more than you might think

down he goes back to the 18 and they got a punt losing eight yards and overload to the left side wise 53 roberson and then there it is <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> so <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> picks up one blitzing defender but theyre not able to pick up another this is that zone blitz key when they bring the dime defender in this case the nickel defender <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> he comes clean able to get the sack on <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> cook is gonna punt to <person player="armanti edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">edwards</person> this is the third three and out four possessions for the chance <person player="armanti edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">edwards</person> from the 27 sake brown from behind read some printed down scrambling for 12 right there after a 55 yard punt the cleveland defense has come to play defense of the ravens had only allowed 13 touchdowns of 4th fewest touchdowns in the nfl coming in to turning a ready to firsthalf touchdowns to the browns here is a first in chapter three not by baltimore and across the way they go and smith will watch the twirling catch of <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> net two yards sally up to about the 41 the baltimore ravens it only allowed five touchdowns in their last six games with it held teams to an average of 16 points and you mentioned already giving up two touchdowns early in this game coach harbaugh talked about the fact during the bye week they had a two days of very tough and physical practice they felt like they were getting back to playing their best football not a good start here today in three live a couple tight ends second down and eight the game follows the ball it s loose in here easily bubbly by a head of oh for the baltimore ravens of fumble virus the games turning over a d in cleveland territory and the baltimore ravens here mentioning the fact that theyve gotten off to a slow start on the defensive side of the ball because watch says they just plug up the middle against <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person> a former baltimore raven himself and they were able to punch it out looks like <person player="courtney upshaw" race="nonwhite" position="LB">courtney upshaw</person> was able to get in there james ahead of all comes over to scoop it up creating a turnover getting good field position for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> and the ravens offense miss mcgee s first turnover as a cleveland brown and a nice opportunity here for flat go as you see there first half resumes so far they havent done much with the football bug this kind of field position theyve got to be able to make some headway against this browns defense has it been easy let s into the miquelon first down in ten price underneath the p down over there by <person player="craig robertson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">craig</person> roberts who s a drafted kid on the north texas no gain on the play something down in jam are you talk about these cleveland browns on the defensive side the ball theyre very proud of the fact that theyre tied for first in terms of allowing only four point six yards per play even though theyre playing somewhere around 70 snaps per game on that side of the ball we still are playing at a high level these guys are doing it every level take a look at joe hate the front middle range at the end on the back end in the second a lot of acclaim youre right sucking down a tenth price vampire shine it s a the m2 of flag is down began battle about the 47 yard line is a day offense under 60 look like when he said 64 thunders on 74 or you see the cleveland browns fewest yards per play allowed under the best in the national football league this defense though they played a lot of snaps fourth most plays from scrimmage of any defense in the nfl that stickle are not giving up a whole lot tells you just how good they are second down and 20 same thing rather blog on sheer size they go right there for smith that coverage by hayden their friends way back when haven was from fort washington maryland with the coverage take a look at him he plays from the top down watch how he settles and then see how he wins the fight for position just incredible footwork great anticipation his improvement has been phenomenal i think he s having a pro bowl season and he takes on every week the best receiver of the opposing team theyre not making any plays against jill hey hayden coming off though arguably his two worst games touchdown to each of the last two none the first six third down 20 go short for dass the coverage by water theyre finding it hard to complete any passes against his browns defense the pressure we told you at the front end of this browns defense is very good theyve been getting after <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> making him uncomfortable theyre taking away his first and initial read and coverage on the back end and then he s finding it hard to come off and find the second or third guy open well they squander a good field position they can do nothing with the recovered fumble of cleveland running back <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> cook and best is been here caught about the 12 yard line with a 36 yard wellplaced punt by <person player="sam koch" race="white" position="P">sam</person> cooke halfway through the second quarter browns on two touchdown passes well you see the offensive story right there three consecutive three notes five to baltimore ravens <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> with his offensive cleveland looks completely different with him understand o binaya of what for in ten not a had a hand in there too you see <person player="jameel mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jameel mcclain</person> gain of four smith was their ball to the 16 when nfl with nfl mobile you can get live video access to exclusive premium content on your smart phone call star saw nfl to download or go to nflcom slash mobile learn more message and data rates apply will be second down and six twice they leapfrog <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> when they had changes in quarterback now he finally gets his chance boy was he pasted i thought he handled that is about as well this anyone ever good when a girl is in the backfield against the ball is she s five stars is close to the first he s a yard shy picking up five out of the backfield right there i think jason gambel understood the situation that he was in yeah he had to wait for the first round pick brandon wheaton to struggle just so that they can leapfrog hillman allow <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> to start him <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> want each of his first three games when he started but you could see they are look at the sacks per drop back and whedon s he s getting sacked once every ten times that he drops back seventeen drop backs boyer was sacked look at this only one sack forty some cowboy he s attempted 41 passes nickels second daily for baltimore third and one blitzes picked up by logan is not the way that time by buying coverage on <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">cameron</person> the top receiving tied into the nfl cleveland does nothing with it on that possession well the defense stood up crowded pocket but you can see there he has to get rid of that trying to anticipate but it s just really good coverage defensively for the baltimore ravens taking away one of their best weapons in <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">jordan cameron</person> there s a look at <person player="tandon doss" race="UNK" position="WR">tandon</person> dogs out of indiana laning theyll be putting it winded as bats with a three and out for the cleveland browns to devon best touchdown receptions in this game so far <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> throwing both its fair caught a 54yard punt well tomorrow melissa mccarthy and billy gardell are back in the new mike &amp; molly season premiere tomorrow 9:00 8:00 central only on cbs now coming into today the ravens where one game in back is san diego for the afc sixth and final playoff spot that was going into today but they lost it over time the jets won today so it is a constant changing picture in the afc and you can see the offenses struggling bring it out four of their five possessions today theyve lost via their last four games lost two in a row going into the buy they nearly dude he to get it going here but here s on first down in ten looked like <person player="desmond bryant" race="nonwhite" position="DL">desmond bryant</person> was at the bottom of that pile losing those games by a total of eight points i mean they were in all of the mafia s well the defense has played well for coach harbaugh the offense is still struggling to find its footing and what did he tell us when we met with him yesterday he felt like over the next couple of years <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> is ready to take that next step to become one of the elite quarterback ship ever theyre allowing him to run the show now him to read the defense check either run or pass play but he s got to execute much better than what we see here in the first half didnt we all day of coming on and bryant was throwing the pressure and knocks him down the former oakland raider it s incomplete to <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> it s third down and three this one is on <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> you got to know if theyre coming here when you turn around and the play fake wasnt very good look at this there s no runs back there on the play fake all he does is sets it up brian is able to close in on <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> immediately at play appear to be very disjointed brown shouldnt have chipped him as he was in motion there well he wasnt called to chipper because he was releasing on the pass pattern ive cleared effects events on this bird down in fries which oh who needs the 35 that has got down slidin brought down by armani bryant picks up hey that s the ravens first first down since five and a half left in the first quarter you dont have to tell <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> to go feet first do you go it slide yeah that s the thing they give quarterbacks to protect themselves and yeah even though bryant was already lunging but there was no real physical contact made on the play when the quarterback the tipster saw ravens with a couple timeouts in a first and ten here s manager or a place to run no place to hide <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> brings him down no gain on the play no the one thing with this zone the blocking scheme has been implemented by the baltimore ravens typically when you employ this kind of scheme you want to wall off on the front side and cut people and get them on the ground on the back side i havent seen that from the baltimore ravens theyre trying to wall off ever you wanted this defensive line theyre just too fast too strong too physical to allow them to stay on their feet think youre gonna create some running lanes for the running backs it appears on second down and ten going deep always got jones the man toby jones he was in suffocating secondary defense for the browns and a turnover for the first time today by baltimore let s see if indeed joe hate was able to haul this one in they are trying to get it over to the <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> there were two receivers in the area so there is the catch i think that s a catch did the ball touched the ground yes but did he have control over it and maintain control absolutely the ball doesnt roll doesnt rotate remember the ball is allowed to touch the ground but if it s jostles loose in any way shape or form theyre gonna rule it get incomplete pass i think payton has it it touches the ground i think he maintains control every turnover reviewed <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> s first aricept in his last 85 passes hayden with his first pick of the year a review and 306 in the first half welcome back to cleveland it s going to be rude and interception by joey not only does he make the catch he maintains possession after the ball makes contact with the ground i think we have clear visual evidence it was ruled an interception in the field of play and i think it s going to be up there the to see all the brown jerseys or how s your co beach this sauce had never been thrown by <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> he s gonna regret throwing the ball because this is what we call single high coverage look youve got a safety in the middle of the field you got to post routes and you never throw it you got to throw it outside the numbers he just love lost the ball up in midair for just about any of the browns defender to come down with it first and ten congestion with brings a down near the 34 pickup of a lemon first down for cleveland well it s clear today that <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> is struggling i think throwing the football finding receivers and really managing the offense the defense is going to have to bail them out and really keep the score down theyre gonna have to do a better job of whether it s creating turnovers against this browns offense of keeping <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> out of the end zone it s gotta be on the defense to make plays it s winter again on first and 10 <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur</person> jones bandhana then they just had the ambulance the defenders no gain on the play whitaker foz wit whitaker from the state of texas was a long horn he had 3d injuries in college football and acl and mcl right need microfracture as you see our quarterback comparison yeah whitaker is one of those guys he s gonna help them he s giving them some pointless givin up some speed lissa mobility to be explosive coming out of the backfield twominute warning late second half possession here for the browns because of the hayden interception who said this week the browns are facing a raven team that s not the raven team of old he said he meant no disrespect he said both teams have changed it he said history is not going to matter in this game the fact that theyve lost 11 straight games he said but let s face it theyve changed there was no late luis over there there s no and reid over there he said we can now impose our will on the other team boy are they doing that this game today on timeout for cleveland second down and 10 into the nickel weve been getting by do merdell hit by smith and wisely throws it away that s a veteran move right there the night year veteran <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> out of auburn i remember we asked to rail <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> about those comments from joey you dont wanna say anything he just kind of gave us that wink you know he s gonna be chasing the quarterback today already has one sack to begin the game but now he s one of the new leaders on this defense he and hello de nada theyve got to be able to provide a spark for this football team and you can see the cleveland browns off his name scored five times in the final two minutes of the first half this season two touchdowns and three field goals and lifted for more of this possession if a thirddown intense sniff jetting up the middle and making the move on camborne down he goes another set back to the 21 third sack today registered by the baltimore defense loss of 13 and the browns do nothing with that turnover they got to punt the ball yes his defense to make the play and that s exactly what they do you can see smith coming right up the middle they come with a double a gap blitz able to get right into the face of the quarterback no <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> is quietly been a i think huge acquisition for this defense it s made a lot of play sax interceptions doing a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit of everything on d4 youre right john harbaugh said one of the most underrated defensive players over the last decade in the nfl his right he s a good one planning to fun and the ever dangerous <person player="tandon doss" race="UNK" position="WR">doss</person> is back to the 26 yard line close the room on the side brought down by <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">owens</person> across the way and a return of 54 yards well the kick of 54 and a return of 9 coming up on the horizon halftime report join jb dean shannon fullmer and coach bill cowher news nfl scores and all the highlights of a busy day in the nfl coming up next in the verizon halftime report alive cbs studios in new york and here with limited time left 101 and 2 timeouts <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> hazard first down and ten and it s 33 oz four possessions three three eight outs five plays nowadays armani bryant makes the move he s a rookie is second second a year on it in central third set by the browns he is a knock down at the 32 losing 1/2 yard a timeout of peace remaining 55 seconds in the first half sucking down wada im down by brian he picks up three yards and takes it up to the 35 yard line have you ever been as impressed with this cleveland browns defense and all the times youve seen them exist you can tell that each and every week that they play in ray horns defense theyre more familiar than what theyre doing and theyre becoming more aggressive third down and eight moving up gets a block going oh he s got smith wide open with that quick cut he gets by weird hell dance in the secondary he has pulses like always and he goes down and about the 19 18 yard line that is a terrific catch and run of 46 oh and they just fall asleep it looked like kimani bryant had <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> he gave up hate so two drops coverage as he allows smith that just separated coverage had his eyes in the backfield and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> stay with it theyve heard a fine <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> hello youre gonna see him right here now watch eight he has them to your mantoman comes now stay with them and the safety just runs himself out of coverage that s desean gibson so when you play in the secondary you lock your eyes in on the quarterback you drop coverage that s how receivers are able to get so wide open as we saw with <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> on that play well troy smith sally has more receptions of 20 yards or more than any other receiver in the nfl picks up a quick 56 right there and now theyve got the ball at the 19 yard line with a first intent tonight s 20 seconds to poi and a half let go and go into the end zone i was just beautiful coverage by joe hey in fact if he times his junk better hell be intercepted look he stays on top end coverage eyes inside plays the ball well see if he times that jump i think he s going to get himself an interception already has wanted the first half but that was just excellent coverage by hating on that play rises in <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> bottom of your screens shutting down in check no timeouts that was a touchdown unless he said no he got in there a touchdown reception for <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> he had touchdowns and three of the first four games none since 19 yard grab and the ravens are back in business theyre working against his own coverage theyre able to run one receiver deep that creates room underneath for brown he s able to come in the underneath zone catch it turns up because theyre defending the deeper receiver in the end zone and they just turned round wide open how about <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> rallying on that drive to be able to get a touchdown after the browns the great ranks in comebacks and here s <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">tucker</person> 14 to 10 which is something that the ravens im sure feel they can work with going to the second half a 19 yard touchdown pass to rookie free agent <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> out of the university of georgia his fourth touchdown reception this season and baltimore is back in at nine seconds to play this week dont miss the show that s an elite by itself with guys who take out all 32 teams and each other every week change brown <person player="phil taylor" race="UNK" position="DT">phil</person> simms and cris collinsworth with the artistry of nfl films and the chemistry of the guys inside the nfl to show the pros watch wednesday at 9:00 only on showtime so a touchdown pass and a pick by <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> in the first half two touchdown passes by <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> the browns and this is going to be an entertaining second half and that s exactly what the baltimore ravens needed going in at halftime needed to make a play they needed to see <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> play better after lofting a ball up in the middle of coverage in m&amp;e his pass intercepted by joe hey next time they get the ball back goes right down the field score points with nine seconds to go in the first half and <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> short one right here scooped up and <person player="leon mcfadden" race="UNK" position="DB">leon mcfadden</person> was the one to reel it in and he s up to the 43 yard line with six seconds to play and cleveland does have a timeout as <person player="leon mcfadden" race="UNK" position="DB">mcfadden</person> comes out of the plan so the baltimore ravens coming off the bye have lost two straight and three of four the browns have lost three consecutive games each team feeling a sense of urgency theyve told us on both sides coming into today because the division is closed and it was up that way with cincinnati s lost thursday down in miami after watching cincinnati lose that game in miami on thursday night both teams i think their hopes of getting it to the divisional race were resuscitated they both feel like this game is vitally important to continue their efforts to challenge the bengals the baltimore ravens have a game coming up with them very soon here and so does the cleveland browns and the browns already beaten the bengals wants during this season right here in cleveland so both teams feel like they still have a shot but today s game is vitally important to their overall hopes of making the postseason one second now they got a get delay a game i assume so they keep the timeout they were trying to get their offense of personnel straight you saw a late entry there by armani and signed this week signed tuesday he had played at carolina when rogers insky was down there as the offensive coordinators are very familiar with him but he wanted to keep the timeout so he can take a shot even in the middle of the field five seconds six seconds might be tight going underneath papaya opinion brought down by cory <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> at the 48 gain of ten thatll take us to halftime with the prawns on top they have led at halftime in seven of their nine games they called timeout there you go that s why he wanted to keep that timeout in his hip pocket he wanted to get a pass completed over the middle of the field that s why they took the penalty and watch with a run here and then does he get down in time they called timeout look with one second to go take a look at the time clock on the bottom left side of your screen that was a quick timeout coz anything his body and settled by the time it was down well you know the head coats can call timeout from the sideline with the plans to be complete net who know theyre going to give him a second and well see what they do with it ravens are not a cam review here have the three players inside the ten <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> with a good long arm winding up going deep and the ricochet and it falls helplessly incomplete and that will take us to halftime two touchdown passes from <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> to best for ravens ending the first half on a plateau 19 yard touchdown pass to rookie free agent <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> a closer at halftime the browns by four youre watching the nfl on cbs go sean were safe baltimore has beaten cleveland 11 consecutive times you see her halftime score let s now take a look at the first half performance presented by intel this involves a quarterback <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> on the receiver vest well ness has come out he s responded to some of the challenges that the coaches have presented him with that dropped nine passes earlier in the season but you know he come out and he s responded you have to continue to play well i think <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> has allowed them an opportunity to really jumpstart the office the <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> first ham performance is interesting for instance on the pass that he was going for jones jones was open but the ball was underthrown we know <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> s got as good a big arm as there is in the lead he struggled in the early going of this game but you got to give a lot of credit also to this cleveland brown defense that has played very well but <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> was able to get it going in that final possession at the end of the first half was able to get some points on the board so well have to see how he responds at some of the adjustments made at halftime and then the one who was underthrown of course on the long pass to jones the defenders for the browns had a chance to get back there and gain some momentum nonetheless we start the second half they muchneeded touchdown in there for the baltimore ravens late on a 19 yard throw to the receiver brown be ensuing kickoff after deferring and winning the toss to begin the game they get the jones taking it out and hit on the play and brought down after a 23 yard return by <person player="jordan poyer" race="white" position="DB">jordan poyer</person> who is recently signed by the cleveland browns and threw 30 minutes of football these are some of the numbers about the browns dominating in time of possession the three announced by this baltimore ravens offense i think is shockingly and very surprising but remember the ravens offenses scored three touchdown drives on the first possession to begin the second half in their previous seven game so this is the opportunity or at least moments where <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> in the offense has responded life signs first down in 10 youre going to be watching some of that running today because it has been a problem sheer jumps on the running back gain of three to the 23 the only 24 rushing yards in the first half for the baltimore ravens they bring in this new zone blocking scheme where they are meant to wall off defenders but this defensive front it s just too big too strong to physical throughout the ball line in seven and smith down by <person player="craig robertson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">robertson</person> weaves his way for a first down the 31 picks up eight yards theyll move the chain and with the run game struggling i think that s why flakoll has to play well it s got to be able to find receivers open crossing the field as they find <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> doing the same there theyve got to be able to free up receivers more importantly theyve got to protect <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> then he s got to be able to execute the passing things then that 46 yard catch and run late in the first half they go outside the tight end gibson he is followed by <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> gain of three to the four to make it to the 34 see much greener rhythm with <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> in the offense he s now saying okay weve got three receivers in the game watching check he s going to read or count the number of defenders in the box gets single high safety he s got to throw it right now the seven fingers in the box it s going in setting and could end up checking to iran false start false start offense number 68 fiveyard penalty second down that s the new starting left guard <person player="aq shipley" race="nonwhite" position="C">aq shipley</person> they acquired him in a trade from the indianapolis colts yeah that puts <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> behind on the count he was gonna pull on this play look at him go ahead he s gonna go ahead and pull right there 68 jump too quickly there s five previous starts had all come at center he has applied and early in the place of assembly who in all likelihood has finished for the year second down and 12 <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> gets away from taylor and it throws it away looking up the solid line for brown now theyre faced with third long as where <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> s to be careful who told you how successful the offenses been on that first possession to begin the second half his ability to convert third and long plays is something that theyve been very good at all season long one of the best in the nfl converting third down plays of 10 yards or longer find defensive backs third and 12 vinny the 41 look like a tube flitz flackville gets by it he s chased by armani brian and then run on the bounds line to quell jackson and he s got the first down running to the 44 it s a pickup of 15 on third and 12 we talked to many of the cleveland brown players look they are gonna blitz look at theyre coming right there once he breaks containment watch the speed of <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> he goes 6 6 but look brian s not able to cats if he gets around to quayle jackson picks up the first down it s where he s shockingly very quick and very fast when it talks it besides the world with the football second time there this afternoon but he has run for a first down on third down and first and 10 lice and the pollen sues kowski couldnt open up a hole it s a gain of a yard to the 44 you might say to yourself why would you go ahead and check to the run look <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> s their leading rusher on the day and they continue to give <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> if <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">bernard pierce</person> opportunities to run the football because youre <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> you cant allow what happened week 4 at buffalo on the road whether he threw it 50 or 4 times in that game and then throwing five interceptions youve got to have balance and continue to give the run game of chance been down in nine and flat go and dragon the defender with him hence the 52 quelle jackson pickup of 8 and of a 47 yard line <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> has really emerged for this football team we knew to kofi jones and <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> would be the guys who can play at the wide receiver position his emergence in the loud of the goal with a threewire receiver set the personnel grouping that <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> in this passing game would really prefer they were waiting for a third wide receiver to emerge and brown has been the god of course missing antwon bolden losing tight end <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis pitta</person> guys that were so instrumental on that terrific run by the ravens a year ago third and one play clock at five here are some of that fear and he submarines for the first down pickup of three to the 44 it s one of their best looking run plays of the day watching stick one foot in the ground just attack the line of scrimmage is what you do there theyre able to wall them off it <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> is able to cut it back hitting the line of scrimmage for first down smith out of catch of a cycle enter on a 15 it has just picked up the first down play the drive hosting jenna incomplete as he was going for his wide receiver <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> coverage there including hate black was gonna put this on the backside shoulder of smith and watch if he throws it on the front side look at where hate is and he s on that inside that s why he put it on that back shoulder because you dont want it to be intercepted want to throw it away from the defender and smith cory smith was not able to adjust second down and ten blanco sniffs he s got the first down diving to the 32 picks up 12 on the play and brought down at by gibson right now the defense is just playing catandmouse with <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> trying to make him think that he s got eight in the box and then theyre giving him a too high and when he really wants to throw the football and he was able to read it accurately and complete the band s even there on the tackle from the 32 drive started back at the 20 watts all the movement on defense theyre trying to confuse dont know for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> and hope that he runs out attack forcing to run a play that he would rather not run into five defensive backs until first in 10 hits bob hoover chased by huge and hits it off to <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thompson</person> hill is it by the defensive back <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> with a gain to about the 23 yard line on a pickup of nine well theyre making <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> earn his money look at <person player="paul kruger" race="white" position="LB">kruger</person> coming with pressure coverage is tight on the back end look at the coverage on <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thompson</person> he stepped out about this rating back here which is why the official throws his hat down it s gonna be an illegal catch touchdown actually it s kind of theyre gonna repeat the first down or at least that s what theyre saying we should probably wait for the call but it looks like this one s gonna come back take a look see the illegal touching overtones he cant he cant be the first guy to touch the ball after stepping out of bounds it clearly he was <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thompson</person> with a couple catches today his third one right there wiped away now first and 15 isis in complete foreground either was too high for brown or too short for smith second and 15 you can see you know <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is is dealing with some of that you talk about no longer having <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis pitta</person> how much he relied in the postseason on anquan boldin to make plays he s having to deal with some new parts and new components around him there you can see he was trying to explain to <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> hey youve got to continue up the field how it s anticipating you doing one thing and you did another mater was on things for a 4000 yard passing season shutting down in 15 it s down the middle of dixon real and that works by the linebacker that well jackson third and 15 looking for dixon oh dixon s one of those players in trying to replace <person player="dennis pitta" race="UNK" position="TE">dennis pitta</person> who is a security blanket for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> look at this throw and weve seen him make those catches dixon s got to be able to come up huge for ass quarterback hell be able to get a hand on it got to be able to haul it in one way or another but that s throwing it into a tight window in <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> nose and we had him youve got to be able to make a catch for your quarterback now the browns on this drive that converted third and 1231 that began back at the 20th at the twentieth twenty third and 15 what s up the middle with jackson get that my wife then the second way the next <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> down he goes at about the 45 pushing them out of field goal range it s the fourth set ward picks up his second sack of the season it s a loss of eight they got a punch in love playing defense or a hoard there you see the blitz here there s there s de cuello jackson both he and <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj</person> war they are relentless in getting to the quarterback come in with a third most sacks in the national football league and you can see dialing up blitz is able to get to <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> is the second rated nfl safety by pro football focus especially against the rock sheared almost gotten away event good punt <person player="davone bess" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bess</person> likes it going back to him and into the end zone touch back to the 28 43 to go in the third and a 45yard punt but number 43 ward coming in and bringing down the super bowl mvp <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">jordan cameron</person> 84s got more passes than any other tight end coming into today but he s not caught one they filmed him four times after the punt by baltimore on the 20th of the touchback first and 10 sample let s bump a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> pitch up five and it is to the 25yard line tonight on 60 minutes alabama is the number one team in college football what is this secret coach nick saban only on 60 minutes tonight shell be taking on lsu in a primetime game this saturday night on cbs beauty in tuscaloosa second down and five let s wigs on and the did balls smith was looking for middle smith did not know anything that the ball nailed all the flags and that s a very difficult thing for a defender to go against right there not knowing if he s got the ball and now he thinks he s making a tackle yeah and really you know he s not trying to slam into the ground as much as he is trying to be physical and play to the echo of the whistle and hope that you can get the ball out did you see they dont normally has it or not did you read his lose he goes i dont know how does he know he doesnt ever go that s a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> personal foul unnecessary roughness defense number 51 15yard penalty first down if you think he still has the ball you have to play to the echo the list right there see watch he s still raking away see his hands and throwing him to the ground hey youre not gonna hurt him he s not made of glass it s not gonna hurt <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> all right now here s a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit extra there i know what officials are doing and were trying to clean up the game were trying to make it more safe but you still have to allow it to be an aggressive style of play which down in 10 high morning s for tight end is on the moon there was spaghetti neck the center and lavon trying to give a black no gain on the play second down in ten let s take you to new york and james brown balls and the his cluding won against this great baltimore defense opening night wow that s something second down and 10 thank you shannon thank you james outside drops <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> smith fair flag flag downfield at about the 42 yard line on the far sideline <person player="bernard scott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">scott</person> grainy worked super bowl 44 is a rough interference offense number 12 10yard penalty second down theyre gonna say that <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> pushed off and tight coverage against <person player="jimmy smith" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy smith</person> right here at the top of the route order to get separation all right theyre just a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> pushing to shove enough to create separation and forgot to haul it in well <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> mentioned that it s a relief off his mind that he wasnt traded and he admitted that it did serve as a distraction we saw that in the green bay game where he really struggled and then was able to pull it together last week where he had over a hundred yards receiving against the kansas city chiefs most feeling is the browns best offensive player second down and 12 overnight weve knocked him out of bounds with a catch and run of the box six and theyll put him at the 36 it s interesting to see you know how jason cam was distributing the ball he s getting the ball outside the numbers he does have the strong arm thought the game was played a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit differently with <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> who got the ball out quickly but preferred to go to the tight ends you saw <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">jordan cameron</person> catching the lion s share of the passes particularly down inside the red zone you can see the pass distribution today he s 11 the wide receivers are done the tight ends and five to the back so <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> is pushing the ball much further down the field with a third and 14 many of the 50 here comes katie here goes <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> and he is shy of the first down nice defensive play by <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">corey graham</person> allowing a 13 yard reception on third and 14 searching a pickup they got a punt the ball causes good coverage the key is is the importance of tackling sure tackling right now look hit down he goes good defense by the ravens the browns have been known in the past to be a sneaky in situations like this fourth and one theyre very aggressive in all situations kevin obon i is the protector laning is the putter they will send us away landing by the way has a touchdown passes our favor vehicle client us loses the ball in touch though it s still loose the ball the number two plumb returner in the nfl this judson lost it it s recovered on the play by <person player="eric martin" race="UNK" position="LB">eric martin</person> who hurt his knee earlier in the game watch this you must sit right there ball goes down look he doesnt get on it it squirts out clear on the other side he had it for a second but theyre able to pry and loosen the ball see it goes right through his legs and he doesnt reclaim it martin gets it so why hovered over it he wasnt able to pull it into his body to secure the ball he has no chances to get it i think maybe <person player="johnson bademosi" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> bottom oc got his hands in there and try to chart it free first and ten at the 11 with mcgehee in the backfield insideout flag 12 men defense weve seen this twice each team defensively have had 12 men on the field you say well how does this happen different personnel groupings whether it s your sub packets whether it s your base defense guys need to communicate who is on the field and you call it out you have these nicknames for every personnel grouping and when they call it out you can see there s still some confusion as to who should be on the field run off <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> now theyre struggling to get lined up first and five they cant get a first down and he had a bow along with this such at the bottom of the pile on a gain of two down to about the four yard line on a muffed punt by dogs <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur</person> jones 97 knife dead nearly made the play the adults can only contemplate his turnover and get an opportunity to redeem himself later in the game now you know the cleveland browns theyve scored 17 points or less each of their last three games theyve lost ball 3 of bacon just get over that hurdle scoring more than 17 quarts goes a long way second im phreak and a carnage touchdown <person player="aaron mellette" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron</person> laden special team said we came through we set the table for <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> who delivers inside the redzone just gotta admire the poise kevin that he brings to these situations they were coming with a blitz now watch barnet s look hell release right there he comes out in the flat look at that he s open <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">jordan cameron</person> was also open to the back of the end zone but it s just smooth selling business as usual for jason gambel the love his demeanor his third touchdown pass they cash in on the muffed punt <person player="billy cundiff" race="white" position="K">cundiff</person> hell make it 20 1 to 10 so punished with his second career touchdown reception wide open on the play in the third <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> is at seven different receivers he s at two different receivers on his three touchdown passes today now turning into tonight and cleveland leads in 21 to 10 have lost 11 consecutive against baltimore on the move <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby</person> joel his check with the block in jones up the sideline and brian takes him out of bounds 22 yard return here comes <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> well we know that cincinnati losing thursday is opened the door a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit here in the north that baltimore would go on to win this game became an independent cleveland wings they beat two games back and here a first in 10 handoff goes to <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> a taobao reuben throws him for a twoyard loss back to the 24 or theyre struggling to run the football kevin is to put more pressure on <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> to produce in the passing game 13 rushing attempts for about 21 yards other than the fact that <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is their leading rusher so just between the running backs havent been able to really put up any numbers and see averaging two point nine yards per carry suck it down 13 not by <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> special down by <person player="paul kruger" race="white" position="LB">kruger</person> initially it s a gain of three to the 27 yard line so when you become one dimension on offense layers like <person player="paul kruger" race="white" position="LB">paul kruger</person> and the rest of the defenders to the cleveland brown they can pin their ears back and come after <person player="joe flacco" race="white"

we want to score points early so we can run the ball late 10 points is not enough to really try to continue hammering away with the run game theyre going to continue to read and let the defense dictate what they do in terms of run pass ratio but a 3rd and 7 expect the blitz coming from this cleveland ground defense they need the 49yard line of approval rhymes burton shot welcome here comes there s compliance boss he is drilled on the play by screen two yards shy of the first down shaya midfield gain of six now fourth down in the body yard what do you do here and now with that i think you got to go for it youve got to put some points on the board you got to leave your office is good enough to convert the fourth who want opportunity they talked about the two days in which they had a tough practice looks like theyre gone upon it looks like theyre going to upon it i thought they may have trust this deep it s a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person>

talk about <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> throughout his career is on his slow deliveries got a long windup and he talked about one of the reasons why i wanted to come to cleveland he wanted the opportunity to play for north turner nor has really worked with <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> to speed up his process for getting the ball out much faster he s been able to speed up his footwork you can see the ball coming out on that blade much faster than were used to see jason kemp getting the ball over to jordan cam he s hitting different receivers today he s been on fire today third and four and good defensive play by cory gran coming up from the secondary it s a gain of the yard it s fourth and three and the quarter will wind down the ball is at the 15 cleveland will punt and they will have the wind at their back in the fourth three touchdown passes by a <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> after this message and a word from a local station we come back to cleveland here watching the nfl on cbs the hunting situation coming up at the cleveland browns as we start the fourth quarter and is forced to fair catch whose boss is back he month the last time for baltimore wind at the back of the cleveland clutter thus from the 33 nice blocking and finding a camp and taking it down the salt line nice move there with open eye and knocking him out of bounds that s why dass who returns that 30 yards is the number to punt returner in the nfl he s gonna get <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> some good beginning field position early in the fourth in cleveland now down 21:10 a lot of time obviously left to the game and here s the second start for baltimore and cleveland territory one of the first time second one right here from the 30 to the glass returned by funko on first and ten marvin brown finds room to roam gets by screen hit by ae and then finally brought down by <person player="barkevious mingo" race="nonwhite" position="DE">barkevious mingo</person> on a catcher on a 14 to the 18 first down they decided kevin to blitz joe flack on that play they just turned brown wide open er he was loose no one covered him on the play was an easy read for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> flipped it over the ground and have themselves of lucetta downs and <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> at his side from the 80s fico first antenna maker blipping catch my chili smith quickly hit by eight picks up four to the 14 yard line at cleveland go and sniff as you can see bit shaken up i think he lands on the ball watch him come across he s gonna have the onehand grab but when you land on that ball right in your chest belly area see right there tends to knock the wind out of you a bit go over to the sideline recuperate that that hurts what a catch by smith he s got four receptions today second six the playoffs to <person player="deonte thompson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thompson</person> who is it by <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> on a gain of five juvenile right now they were all the booze theyre doing a really good job right now <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is on the move third one play might ask yourself do you go for two if you get the touchdown here i think to go ahead kick the field goal and will you need it later absolutely but you can wait until later to do it you dont have to risk it now try to get the extra score extra offensive lineman is coming again or equate now and he will be on the new side side or the right table versus in 31 fact a leech he closed out the first down to the seven picks up two and a first down first and goal to go baltimore look at the baltimore ravens they appear to be getting some momentum and as good as this cleveland browns defense has been theyve turned some receivers loose on this possession you have to ask if theyre beginning to wear down a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit they played a lot theyve been used to playing roughly 70 snaps per game theyve got to be able to hang in there this is where this football team s been really good on this side of the ball once back in first endure the southern touchdown and part of the play by <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> gets his second tonight reception a sevenyard strike and theyre gonna go for two theyre gonna go ahead and make it a three point ballgame so if they need the field go later they are gonna go in and go for it but this is just really good throw from <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> cant tell you enough about the protection ease add on this possession even when the browns have dialed up blitzes they havent come close to getting to <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> it harbaugh wants to go for two here mico on that drive in the perfect four of four he s gone to his rookie fridge and wide receiver brown twice a 19 yard touchdown pass just before halftime setting on her right there and the book says go for two takes into account the score at the time in the pistol with when youre going for two good catch and until he goes to brown he has been the target today harlan brown puts two more on the board makes it a threepoint game with just over 12 minutes to play not only do they go to the slot receiver but they roll the packet and they are able to get black on the ends of the defense for a twopoint conversion making it a three point ballgame there s a look at <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> who is thrown a couple touchdown passes today hit <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> earlier for 19 moments ago for seven and the twopoint well orchestrated drive began it on that drive to brown had a 14 yard catching money he had his fingerprints all over that s going drive for the ravens that bring them down to within three of cleveland with just over 12 to play <person player="fozzy whittaker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fozzy whittaker</person> leaves it in the end zone hey get inside the mind of a quarterback join <person player="phil taylor" race="UNK" position="DT">phil</person> simms rich gannon and steve brule water and special guests <person player="gary barnidge" race="white" position="TE">gary</person> danielson on nfl monday qb im joey tomorrow at 6:30 eastern on cbs sports network the 24 hour home of cbs sports brown only started 11 games at georgia he caught for his career eight touchdowns he s already got five in less than a full season in the nfl i will the browns respond out first intent for the 2002 the kickoff in a touchback gamble this is my best with the coverage on the play by the linebacker jamil <person player="jameel mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> best was knocked off his route by mclain he didnt know he was you know still just beyond that fiveyard mark but you are entitled to your position on the field in <person player="jameel mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> took advantage of it now let s see if rob kazinsky in this office and get something going this is where <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> has to continue to put points on the board you know jenna you dont tell flat was gonna respond that he gets another possession looks like baltimore s tightening the defensive screws here a bit yes they are starting to mince the pocket a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit on <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> hill <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> i think kind of surprised him a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit the way he s been able to get out of the pocket and extend plays see what he did the first half where is a lot more productive five of eight here in the second half still that s called for touchdown but they only have 37 yards this absolutely seedorf turn our dowling up plays trying to get his quarterback opportunities to get the ball to the receivers downfield my defensive backs and that s a gamble looks in his receiver that s <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> and it gets a block and he s off to the races who go against <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> in the ocean out of the hands <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> has been terrific today for the cleveland browns up <person player="ishmaaily kitchen" race="UNK" position="DT">kitchen</person> run of 46 yards to the 27 yard line of baltimore <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> appears to be in pain once he went to the ground after the catch and run but how about this he attacks this ball well thrown by <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> on the money and once he makes the grab look you could see <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> came down looking for yards after the catch he s done a really good job of making and securing katz as he falls on that right shoulder that s why he s wincing in pain he is seven career catches today career high and on first and 10 the run produces only a yard as they go up the middle and mcgehee is the ballcarrier littlest head catches today of 32 and right there 46 yards and a careerhigh seven with over 100 over through the air the high pick out of north carolina s leg <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> third year he s led this team here city in the last to write something about coaches particularly veteran coaches selecting or fraternity knows how to challenge players challenge <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> as we said earlier in the week expecting greater production out of both he and devon best both guys have been able to make plays in this ballgame that s already has two touchdowns and seven catches hundred 22 yards for <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg little</person> where can i into that field it s a second down in temperatures again for <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">jordan cameron</person> a coverage by a heavy bubble along with <person player="omar brown" race="UNK" position="DB">omar brown</person> who s been on the practice squad all season long there he is and he helps the special teams by being active today see that ball sails high and behind the intended receiver <person player="jordan cameron" race="white" position="TE">jordan cameron</person> and then look at the theory you see brown and i had a bow looking to separate the receiver from the ball now on 3rd and 10 see what the browns can dowell up obviously this is where you go to your tidy until you try to get thornton down the field four down territory not just yet he got allowed to deep it s the big place where he is wet third down and ten over nine picks up the blintze that stolen back at a super <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gordon</person> with the coverage on the play by shocky brown so now it is fourth and 10 and they bring <person player="billy cundiff" race="white" position="K">cundiff</person> out onto the field former baltimore raven kicker who was signed during the first week they had a competition here they didnt like what they found in training camp they started from scratch and they signed him off the street remember covered it in the afc championship game used to kick for these baltimore ravens wind it is back 52 yard tribe oh it s a fake as a pooch and it will win at the 10 to the end zone so baltimore holds 34 yard fun they cant keep it in bounds turn it over to the ravens through a cop the momentum and down by free the net coach john oliver s telling us this is different than most super bowl winning teams because we had so much turnover from last year a lot of guys are gone and they have a lot of new guys theyre trying to eat into the lineup roundup first and ten assured out of bounds across the way by buster screen it is a gain of six and out <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is at seven consecutive plucked at 10:45 and down by three the ravens begin to make a move he talked about <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">marlon brown</person> he s one of the new guys theyre rotating in but you have to fill the shoes vacated by anquan boldin those are huge shoes to fill baby in the pistol second down and four <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> and again through their time again the running attack is just not an attack at all the loss of two on the play back to the 23 they really go there look he just goes right underneath <person player="michael oher" race="nonwhite" position="OT">michael oher</person> and you know these are big guys who really want to be able to fire off it come off to be more physical the zone scheme orally doesnt allow you to do that it relies on the athleticism of the offensive line not necessarily the physicality of your offensive line all right then charism 16 yards today indicative of how this wrong game is really suffered and told us last night he feels almost on 2% you know with that hip injuries whether they come and bryant armani bryant s rookie seventh round pick flag has been thrown a sack right there by the cleveland browns those back isnt stands to the 14 loss of 9/5 sack that looks like it s gonna be against the browns or they off sighs they were crowding the line of scrimmage trying to get a chill down the ball defense number 43 fiveyard penalty automatic first down gj war sometimes when youre blitzing you want to pull one of the blockers so that you free up the other guys to come free now take a look here he is right here let s see if he pulls someone so that it frees up someone nice he s in coverage and he s holding areas right there working against <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> cloth at the second level first exam like a complaint looking for <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> broken up by <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> let s go to new york and james brown farley and solomon wilcox hi guys thank you cleveland has led the entire way here second down in 10 it s <person player="bernard pierce" race="UNK" position="RB">pierce</person> and up the middle he goes he got by sean gibson then brought down on the play by <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg</person> <person player="craig robertson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">robertson</person> it s a pickup of six to the 35 know the safeties i just think the way they play in this defense it s made for improvements as well we all know about <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj</person> war but to shock gibson has been a huge addition and i think the huge five for ray horton in his defense 30 important play right here third and four for the ravens outside theyve danced a cobi jones shy of the first down and it was yep shy by a body yard picks up three they hit by <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> knocked him out of bounds and the chains are on the far side of the field so theyre gonna bring them over from the far to the near side for a more accurate measurement so there s an official s timeout it s gonna be close but good tackle look out sota comes up with the form tackle does <person player="chris owens" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris owens</person> on <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> it knocks him back looks like he s just short of the first down mark there was no yards game after the catch him that reception by <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> i dont think the spots very good and it looked like he got as far as the 39 but i wouldnt be surprised if they challenged the spot john harbaugh was right in front of it as good a look as the officials did short he s probably sees on his headset cific what do you guys see from up there that s exactly what he s doing and should i challenge it probably even thinking should we go for it here you know now that i want you the second time he may have been short yeah it was a great tackle by chris owen and i think it didnt spot now that i see it at all i was wrong fourth and one theyre gonna go for it their offense is on the field right now were gonna decide to go for it how much confidence do you have in your offensive line that you can get movement in the run game that youve struggled to run it all day only 52 yards rushing most of it by <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> but the running backs have found it hard to just even get beyond the line of scrimmage against this cleveland browns defense were bringing in an extra offensive lineman 71 rookie rick <person player="ricky wagner" race="UNK" position="OT">wagner</person> again he will be on the near side next to or at the right temple it s hard to try to draw people offsides when youre on the road by himself the push look like or almost grabbed him by the shoulder pets it was dragging him forward is to quell jackson came in with a stick michael or may if he did they got the first down vontae leeches behind him big number 44 started pushing his quarterback forwards everything they could do to gain it is watch for his side before he hit hook for sure one of them and <person player="vonta leach" race="nonwhite" position="RB">leach</person> is pushing him one guys pulling the other guys push it big play right there seven play of the drive coming up the clock approach in eight minutes all the time is renamed first and ten blocked by the roll at the left angle the quail junction quickly on the receiver <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> again at six to just about the 46 yard line what did they tell us about the quail jackson one of the most underrated middle linebackers in the league and though he s a fine tackler he stays on the field on third down he can blitz the quarterback excellent in coverage and really good at diagnosing the offense at setting his defense up to be successful let s deal with <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> into the nichols shutting down to work his way around brought down by billy win out of boise state a gain of a yard to the 47:16 career gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime it sounded three times against cleveland so this is a very familiar situation for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> he s never lost to the ground approach ins 7 deployed third and three consecutive stuff to the browns psycho third and three they got it to quell jackson he s hit by a sheared and brought down a loss a set right there by jabal shared out a pip his second sect of the season fifth by the browns today a loss of a yard and theyre gonna punch <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ray rice</person> tries to pick up the quail jackson and jackson forces him to step up in the pocket a ninja ball sheared the others peel off is able to get the sack but the initial pressure was provided right up the middle by quayle jackson to a comment on cook gets here best back inside the 15 this is into the wind the one on the sidelines is gonna be up to about the 30 29 yard line 25 yard punt browns get it leading by three in the fourth 6:44 to play three timeouts apiece sama will cats kevin harlan 29 yard line hooked on the browns his punting moments ago we touchdown passes by <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> today one two that guy in motion right there bring it back <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> fucktown beautifully on the play by the defensive back cory <person player="corey graham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">graham</person> seconds in kevin what it rob kazinsky tell us when we spoke with him he said you cant underestimate the importance of the quarterback position he feels that it s the most important position in all of professional sports believes that jason campos ability to lift his entire team just with his queen paw personality and debater can really help this team heal contemptible second intent but he <person player="spencer lanning" race="UNK" position="P">spencer</person> one of his better games of the day <person player="courtney upshaw" race="nonwhite" position="LB">upshaw</person> was on the tackle just beyond the 35 picks up six on the run well rob kazinsky spoke with <person player="josh gordon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">josh gordon</person> said hey we dont want to trade you were gonna try to keep you hang in there with us and you know he was able to i think have a great influence on several players and the way that this team is being built he said he s all he wanted to be aggressive on both sides of the ball on defense we saw the aggressive play calling in the first quarter going for it on fourth down and moments like that even though it s special teams theyre willing to take chances trying to eke out wins anyway they came into the backfield with ohm and i on the move third down long three <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> moves up he needs the 40 he s got the first town and he takes it to about the 49 with a first down run <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> s done that a couple times today for the baltimore ravens who run a 12 and a first for cleveland he does use his legs but this isnt a real baseball slide this is more like a lay down it but it s a smart play because they cant hit you when you go feet firms <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">greg little</person> were being told as a shoulder injury he was just in he is left again so it s clearly bothering it number 48 first and 10 whitaker who comes back for the ball and tackled on the play by wine backer jamil maclean and spinal injury a year ago good to see him back out there but a pickup of 8 right there for the browns to the baltimore 43 44 the insertion of <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> at quarterback has given this team s poise it s given them some kind of calmness on offense and what about the confidence i think we saw in the second half of the game last week at arrowhead stadium against one of the best defenses in the nfl against kansas city and right now he s in turn in i think a very important drive that could go a long way and helping them win this game second to mcgehee as he crossed the line close to a first down hit by <person player="chris canty" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chris canty</person> of course the three timeouts remaining the clock at four and a half and ticking kenny is slow to get up and youre wondering now when you start using some of these timeouts yeah if youre the baltimore ravens got a conservative got to trust that your defense could get the stop against jim harbaugh of team he s he s waiting for his defense to come up with a stop if you guys help us get the ball back so i have the timeouts in my hip pocket for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> <person player="brandon williams" race="UNK" position="DT">brandon williams</person> comes on that defensive line the cleveland browns have a third one theyre the best third and 1 team in the nfl and they get some extra meat back there as you can see alignment is in let s billy wynn who is back there with open i am just under four to play timeout taken cleveland im calm and by the new windows one experience for everything in your life still halloween for some it s quite a string of wins or losses whichever side youre on air rod says insky needs to break it this important third one situation can go a long way into helping them in that street defensive lineman billy wynn is an 31 pretty important for out here and they try to dig it that looked like nada was grabbing the waist of mcgehee and bringing him back obadiah was in there before the timeout looks like theyre short they replace him and there s also jumping out there <person player="terrence cody" race="UNK" position="DT">terrence cody</person> who has been dealing with the sprained left knee take a look at this a lot of out of girth in there with <person player="haloti ngata" race="nonwhite" position="DT">haloti ngata</person> yep some of the others theyre stacking the box they covered the center guard gaps on both sides no room to wrong now at fourth and one looks like rob kaczynski s gonna go for it again and what do you think this goal id rather see him boots upon it to be honest with you and make them go to distance does they only need a feel go to tie this game timeout cleveland one left baltimore s got all three fourth and one they try to draw offsides where s the thought before now the timeout taken 3:12 here not a good finish here let s go to james in new york with more smug fourth in one do you go for it here if find the cleveland browns i know they want to be aggressive but theyve struggled to run the football today they couldnt even get a yard on the third and one makes you think youre gonna get it on pelican walk to tie downs whitaker in the backfield fourth and long <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> he s being chased by <person player="courtney upshaw" race="nonwhite" position="LB">upshaw</person> he s being chased by the train he throws it he got the baby that s why there is a first dawn right he s on a web pickup up to first town cleveland that s a quarterback making a play for his hand coach bailed out rob kazinsky here <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> youre running for your life you throw the ball late and over the middle ladarius wimp nearly intercept sit but best is able to wrestle the ball away from 21 and ladarius oil cant believe that pass is completed and this has been one of the best third down receivers on that particular case fourth down reception getting a first down he s down so now the baltimore ravens with the clock is ticking at 229 theyve got the three timeouts oh yeah that bad that s a dagger there john harbaugh cant believe mcgehee in the backfield first and ten nihlus these down to about the 37 yard line new the 36 and picks up three and the timeout taken by baltimore stopping the clock at 213 never stop but youll be at the twominute warning so they have two timeouts and plus they have the twominute warning but your defense has got to get a stop and boy did they need it theyre needed to get the ball back for <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> there with a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit more time flannels watching every tick of the clock just drip away well the afc north division has sent the most teams to the playoffs in the nfl the last five years the bengals right now as you see the only winning record in the north but losing as they did on thursday night football in miami has opened the door of it now and changed the landscape a bit with this north and a win by either of these teams today makes it a different story and the pittsburgh steelers down by 17 the fourth quarter against the new england patriots oh yeah these are the next two challengers one of them steps up to win this game knocking on the door against the variables his bronze fans know theyve already beaten cincinnati once this year second down and seven temple down the

race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> first it goes <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis</person> is it black on the side there by <person player="john greco" race="white" position="OT">greco</person> there wasnt a whole lot of room in fact no gain on the play second down and goal before for those of you expecting to see 60 minutes youre watching the nfl on cbs the game between the baltimore ravens of the cleveland browns our score 21 18 cleveland 2 minutes will be seen in its entirety immediately following this game except on the west coast where well be seen in it s normally scheduled time with a timeout baltimore burning their final cleveland with one left 147 the point almost of this has been done by <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jason campbell</person> throwing the football not many runs here theyve struggled both teams that struggle to run the ball but in these situations where it s timesensitive you got to continue to allow the run game to work for you and force the baltimore ravens to burn those timeouts keep playing the drives on a third and three <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> scrambling for 12 i lost their helmet and i dont think any gain at all another good stop <person player="arthur brown" race="UNK" position="LB">arthur</person> jones among a couple making the stop right there and losing is at that time was challenged <person player="terrence cody" race="UNK" position="DT">cody</person> yep but by keeping the ball on the ground theyre burning clock they wont have to snap it to right around the oneminute mark this is what if youre rob kazinsky the ability to manage games in the final seconds i think it s one of the more critical pieces when it comes to winning games and it s where head coaches that s where they earn their key to tight ends third and goal at the forum outside that s nice pursuit defensively and again no gain <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> that s his former teammate and brings them down all the more cannot stop the clock you see it ticking down you got a if youre gonna either kick the field goal or you use a timeout if youre cleveland or do you go ahead and take the penalty move it back just by hands you go for it on fourth down then if you dont get that make them go the entire length of the field or you gonna burn as much time off the clock here that maybe use your timeout and then you set up to kick the field goal and take a sixpoint lead to about 18 seconds or so and cleveland youll take the time you go good clock management big alive rob s his instep yep <person player="billy cundiff" race="white" position="K">billy cundiff</person> there s a really good job it s a fine young coach weve saw the game against minnesota manufacturer win on the road against the vikings faking the special teams and faking punts faking field goals and throwing it doing a number of different things anything they can to manufacture points in win a ballgame and if there s an one block this season on the field now looks like it s gonna be a 22 yard try to put them up by six wind it is back 22 yard field goal try bike unders landing the whole before 18 14 seconds left your look and drive had a run by <person player="jason campbell" race="nonwhite" position="QB">campbell</person> at 12 a catch and run of 17 by obadiah a reception of 14 by the runny bag of ania they ran six and a half off the clock they get three their latest 614 seconds a 15 play drive by chicks in skis offense and now the story shifts over to the baltimore ravens we told you over the last six games that only allowed 16 points a game they give up 24 on the road here today against cleveland and now it s on flakoll this offenses got a score more points tonight on cbs begins with 60 minutes in alabama s head coach nick saban followed by new episodes of the amazing race the good lines of the mentalist only cbs itll be a nice way to get ready for the lsu alabama game next saturday night on cbs and a look at john harbaugh who have the chance to self scout with his staff and with his team he was up and buoyant last night and so very confident about his team and the adjustments they felt they had made during the break to get ready for the second half that so i think this goes back to some of the stories coming into the season without the likes of ray lewis and ed reed where s the leadership coming can the defense continue to carry this football team and at what point does the office begin to take over as the dominant side of the ball in a place at least where you can be consistent <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> has to be that component and the offense has to be the part to really carry the team well they got to go a long way not too long ago when they undo the same thing in the afc divisional playoff game in denver <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> got back to denver defender where he mourned tony carter 7002

first and 10 franco underneath it s a pitch to jones from smith who gets out about seven seconds on the clock hayden shoves him out of play 14yard gain on the lateral up to the 34 yard line seven seconds usually about enough time to get the ball down the field typically about seven seconds per play but you can see the distance they have to go of 66 yards they have brown jones and <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> is receivers first and ten blacker s got a pig on underneath <person player="ray rice" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rice</person> and that s it cleveland is one clowns beat baltimore for the first time since 2007 and now cleveland within two games of first place cincinnati baltimore will play the
