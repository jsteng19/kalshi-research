effective <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> early on showing some will quickness he s lost about 15 pounds from when he got cut with the carolina panthers and it shows so calling this one <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> hailey now in his fourth year as the offensive coordinator in law last season seal

we asked tomlin last night can this guy really play all three downs he said at least for two weeks at the young <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm</person> brown right here and so far he has been struggling inside that time was david de castro just sort of threw him away to the outside these are gaping holes that you typically do not see against the patriots defense williams three carries smack receivers to the right now he s lefthanded looking but the defense does its job and he gets taken down at the 31 yard line by <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm</person> brown number one draft choice out of texas it helped that they were in a zone defense that time so the safeties back here deep able to kind of see this

race="nonwhite" position="OT">marcus gilbert</person> well he got away they held him the first time but ning kovitch this time was going to get grabbed and very tail into this thing just as the angela williams was jumping to the outside you saw a <person player="marcus gilbert" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gilbert</person> just grab the jersey and dicot so what looked like a very promising drive you try the gimmick play that goes nowhere but that works and now the thing fight your way back in the field goal and another second in 28th the backup running back is <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> fullback by trade that s johnson behind blockers gonna give it to him shelvin used as a wall carrier but freshman to backup duty tonight with bailout

position="LB">sean</person> squeezin their top kicker got hurt in the hall of fame game in canton ohio in august and then they brought garrett hartley in and he got hurt so they picked up scobie with a lot of experience and his first effort as he steal there will be a 44 yard attempt no wind to speak of and snow bees first kick is no good lied to the right to a promising drive gets bogged down on

no excuse <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> just missed them patriots they can beat you by running as 50 times were throwing it 50 times against pittsburgh historically theyve been very passive and they start that way tonight no russian so far five passes then great play clock at one town has to escape but not very far i can only get to the 43 that s but improves their number one draft choice number 48 making the tackle so youd be looking at a real long distance field goal obviously here and then pass up that opportunity over 16 <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">ryan allen</person> comes in to punt had a screen pass coming this way if i <person player="alvin dupree" race="UNK" position="LB">dupree</person> unblocked on the play and for some reason <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s didnt like the screen pass late getting the ball and just got unsettled brian allen belichick has always loved left footed punters and <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">alan</person> over the years brown is back across with fair cats and collects it at the 7yard line that s where pittsburgh will begin the second drive off halfway through the opening quarter on open a night no score bill belichick on his ipad super bowl starters after the old one season they lost they lost four after their o three when they lost two starters after their old for victory and then six starters are gone on offense connolly in vereen four on defense including the starting corners browner and revis and the third corner would have been arrington who s now with baltimore so bill belichick not afraid to mix up the roster nice come guys go he shocks people there is <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> he of the immaculate interception in the super ball and now their key guy pittsburgh from the seven yard line williams and

they were in trouble in terms of lady on bail and is going to get suspended originally for three games now just for two they bring a minute thirty twoyearsold second active running back oldest actor only fred jackson his older second down and four take him down by the shoelaces by <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> number 95 then we third down no question one of the best players on this football team for new england right here <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> had some injury problems last year just six sacks but by the time it got to the playoffs he took off he and rob ning kovitch i thought were brilliant throughout the playoffs is matt patricia the defensive coordinator good young talent dante hi on these things third and five showing blitz here they come and then throw is planned from <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> so <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> may have taken care of regard to locket but brown says not me baby not me that is as perfect to coverage as you can have and watch what <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> the leading receiver in the national football league does catches it right off his hand that is unbelievable he had no chance at that ball he s almost like what <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> did in the supermoon wow from the 22 yard line under the sea why couldnt it have been us cole from jeffers coming illegal formation offense number 68 was not on the line of scrimmage fiveyard penalty replay first down <person player="kelvin beachum" race="nonwhite" position="OG">kelvin</person> beechum the left tackles the back and look at that catch by brown again phenomenal this was one arm and grabbed he had the ball and one arm and <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> s helmet and the other he was trying to get his left arm down the ball got stuck on his arm at me still cottle back in the 17th 1st and 15 this burger throws brown there and to the 20 yard line for the 129 passes last season let s go to michelle al patriots defensive tackle <person player="dominique easley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dominique</person> easily has gone to the locker room he s questionable with a hip the medical staff was looking at his left side ill tell you when he walked back to the locker room he walked slowly and very gingerly so he has remains there now well keep you posted i thank you for shell second down and 12 if the steeler coaches headsets are okay right now we were told couple of minutes ago that they were getting the patriot radio broadcast in their headsets maybe 12 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> tough to bring down at this time he s brought to the turf by dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> the toughest guys in the league his saggy got guys hanging all over him throughout his career but <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> had him and his grasp took him to the turf these two inside linebackers find a way to get to the quarterback i thought it was one of the differences in the end of the season last year both he and <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> and if youre wondering there is no horse collar in the pocket so even though <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> here is going to grab them around the back that is not a penalty sakurachan 18 and then biased on but he may be a little short of the first down <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> needs 18 gets 17 as theyll spot the ball just short of the 31 yard line <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> covering on the play and they bring in the punting group where as a defense you want to play that line but that s cutting it awfully close nice job by <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> coming out of center field and making that solid tackle mccord he made a bunch of solid tackles in the super bowl when marshawn lynch broke out a few times jordan perry on the job from brad wing and tranny cant win now with the giants here s a minghella who collected a can flag is thrown there and bella brings it back out to the 34 the flag is there matthew <person player="matt slater" race="UNK" position="WR">slater</person> involved in the play pittsburgh indicating it s against new england will get the call from jeffers during the return illegal block in the back number 18 of the return team 10 yard penalty first down the weeks later opening night no store in foxborough max coming to nbc a mind erase the body of clues that lead paul s most really mystery blindspot premiering monday september 21st on nbc town boston about a 40minute drive away but not in rush hour from the 10yard line i used to be a <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> mr pepper we started talking about we were told that they were having trouble the patriot or the steeler coaches in their headsets they were getting the patriot radio broadcast that you dont think do you opponents would not call that trouble they would call that whatever there is every team that i know of has some story about what happens to them in this stadium and of course deflategate was all part of that and that s not going to help the fact that theyre getting those radio signals in their headset to be on lois of course there were a spate of stories this week longform pieces by espn and sports illustrated talking about pervasive and persistent cheating but the patriots have extensively done since 2001 the one thing that belichick has told us team and hey forget it boys we dont listen to the outside noise but there s a lot of outside know there s a lot outside noise and it s going to be enhanced after this start here i mean the grady tries to sneak as he does very often patriots at a very stern response to those reports this week but it s been an ongoing saga in new england enough for a first down <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> able to pick up the inches needed with a minute 40 to go another this is what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> does very often on third maybe fourth and short now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s knee did go down but it s like they felt like it crossed that line but i tell you it is unsettling for a visiting team to come in here and have something like that happen you want to say okay were starting the game now were on an equal playing field but i guarantee of mike tomlin is hot right now from the 20yard line to the outside flag is long i mean lisa should be listening to our broadcast mean the patient s radio guys are good but he was pretty good on <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> s holding side number 77 offense 10yard penalty repeat first out and sold her second penalty of the quarter you know it happened so many times to those tackles that especially when theyre not anticipating that the back is necessarily going to bounce outside on them theyre blocking blocking and then all of a sudden the back jumps and the defensive player makes a move in the tendency to just grab and then youre outside the phone work and here comes a flat it s <person player="brandon bolden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon bolden</person> sets up wide to the right running back by tree all the way and that s plot sitting down at the 19yard line is <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron</person> thompson the six week 200 pounder from marshall tackle deer by <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> well probably the best pass rusher for the steelers this preseason right there <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> just say that how about that he is the guy and mike tomlin sam you know he really doesnt like being the leader he likes being the villain but cant help himself all these guys just ball him around like he s the pied piper they all show up at the cold tub at 6:45 because he does second and 11 pumpkin pie there s the sideline bug wrestle down by <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez</person> now linda will be third and short on the first play of the second quarter b s weve played one on opening night pittsburgh nothing

edelman</person> up to the 37 yard line let s go to michelle that communications issue down here on the pittsburgh side it was with the coach to coach head sets the word is that they were getting some sort of patriots radio broadcast bleed into those headsets while that was going on the patriots coach coach headsets were shut off so that things were a level for the moment but right now im told that everyone s headsets are up and working well again for the time being that s according to the nfl yall stay tuned <person player="brandon bolden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon bolden</person>

position="LB">ryan shazier</person> i dont know that ive seen a faster linebacker coming out of college just has the ability to make big plays wasnt healthy a season ago but they say he has made huge strides this year and guys like <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ryan shazier</person> and <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> are

position="DB">blake</person> they call him zilla kazee they say just mean he s a mean tough guy and he has his hands full inside we saw in the super bowl as well in the playoffs last year very difficult to handle <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> at the line of scrimmage but a lot of changes in this secondary including bringing bill allen the veteran to come in and try and help him with communication louis thanks for the outside taken down there for a short game so dick lebeau they did not renew his deal he moved on to tennessee working there with ken whisenhunt keith <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> offensive coordinator was the linebackers coach for 12 years so he was actually there before tomlin came in milk our hired him and he stayed on and now he s the dc one time linebacker during seattle second grade ethos and finds <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> again the 35yard line tackle there by <person player="valentino blake" race="UNK" position="DB">blake</person> and <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">alan</person> trying to take advantage of this young offensive line up front gonna come with the old pittsburgh steelers cross blitz here but that was a nice job by <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dion lewis</person> coming across and picking it up not a big guy but they say you stout and he will block and then you dont get there with more covering <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> already four catches <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> sooner or later <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> was going to catch one and there s his first of the season of the 16 yard line very difficult to cover the seams against <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and there s a big hole and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> got that one off just in time touchdown they came up to the line that run the play right pouchy the back touches lay in the yards 13 plays to the first score of the season and theyve got issues with communication on the back end <person player="robert golden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">robert golden</person> is in the game and he typically is the special teams captain plays very little but he s going to come out of the side here and see that <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> is completely uncovered they were worried about communication on the back end for pittsburgh and now it is come to fruition that was poorly done the last two or three plays with that hurry up offense gave them problems you the extra coin a snap from the 15 three yard field goal and no issue here on the first official new extra point in the national football league of seven to nothing all right our plane is up downtown boston on his head 63 degree night and by 95 and head back to cover tonight s aerial coverage being brought to you by stadium it opened in 2002 it open 13 years ago yesterday against the pittsburgh steelers and it s a night when they celebrated their first super bowl title now seasons that kick into the night and then starts the night sixfour sixfour 63 yards takes over the 20 when we come back secondary coach carnell lake a pretty good player in his time he s the defensive back coach in his team this unit had a little problem here chris yeah right back here in the back end nobody sees <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and now all of a sudden <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> sees that nobody sees <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> but this is a team theyre keeping this he s saying come on come on come on let s go snap but i got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> wide open and that s a walkin at the perfect matchup williams running back diangelo stop sharp good start for the steeler offense tonight but then a penalty they try to trick play with brown throwing and since then the patriots have pretty much stuffed them yeah but what has been working has been <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> and what always works is <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> and one of those guys you definitely want to invite to your party im safe up on stage singing and dancing and heard all kinds of thing the guy that loves life doesnt it it s around 2nd and 8th from the 22 those two hi for keith <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> third down take a look at been jewish career number one pick back in oh four there his numbers right there that s his first eight years first eight seasons and then with todd haley coming in as the offensive coordinator took a little while for them to get in rhythm but he s been pretty terrific especially last season they are missing some bigtime weapons tonight maybe the passing game as much as the running game who turned out to be fun for me before touchdowns not here and the center marquise bouncy meanwhile walk this burgers going to go feet feel and it will be so on a third down in a hayward bay at one point figured to be a superstar with oakland he was a seventh guy picked in the online draft really hasnt done much through his career not getting another chance here a 48yard game just three catches last year but he can fly a 43 guy in a course drafted by the rangers in that situation and on the other side pratt like <person player="bradley fletcher" race="UNK" position="DB">fletcher</person> a guy who got beat like that more than a few times last year in philadelphia from the 35 yard get outside to pick up five yards before he s pushed away less than ten minutes to go in the hampton new england on top seven i think in pittsburgh driving mr paul sheared on the outside number 93 a guy that they are extremely excited to have but that is not the first time tonight that we have seen the speed of <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> hit outside this defense and boy you go to a patriot practice and all you hear from belichick has set the edge set the edge so far in this game theyve been getting beat on the edge williams seven carries for 46 yards number eight is a two yard at government setting up a third down and two at the 28 yard line ten seasons in the league for williams nine years in the league for a mike tomlin and everybody talking about when he got hired he won the super bowl in the second year the owner in the league was saying finding the next mike tomlin 8 1 it was the problem a lot of young coaches got hired none of them turned out to be anything close well in almost a halfcentury youve had truck gold bill cowher and mike tomlin that s it at the helm of the steelers third and three down to zero <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> that s incomplete <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> looks for a flag doesnt get it covered by <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> and in comes the field goal unit hey this <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> is making an impression he s been all over the leading receiver in the national football league now obviously <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> was thinking back shoulder throw there didnt happen the <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> that s a long way from being a sub in the super bowl and then all of a sudden now youre covering the number one guy who s the new girl remus i guess 46yard attempt scobie already missed important to speak of and that one is good we picked up from jack s building a very auspicious killer beginning seven of the oil eight and a half to go and a half seven to nothing new england after a missed scobie field goal his second he got the young guys on the front tonight drafted pair of rookies and shaq <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> and <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey</person> jackson that s coming in the fourth run that puts him under fire on opening night who and well so far in the 36 yard line rady off the play fake fires over the night <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> big night for <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> already five catches for first down so far tonight <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s getting the protection from that interior three of this offensive line if youre going to beat <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> typically you have to get him to move laterally the steelers would have loved tonight to make <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> step to the side but that anterior three their young that theyre getting the job done luis people know where he is stuffed by <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> at the line of scrimmage itll be second down in ten they need a whole bunch of that out of <person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person> this year they have been very open and honest keith <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> the defensive coordinator basically saying it s time you know youre a guy he led the nation in sacks and we just havent seen that look at the shot he put on <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> there and came in took care of <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dion lewis</person> as well if he starts playing like that and <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">shazier</person> pers the way that he can was young defense good fast <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> before pressure gets their swings it caught <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny</person> over his shoulder making the ground stays inbounds first down you play man coverage youre going to get a pick set right there and then youre gonna get the swing route they ham and dole up the sideline they missed the first one they dont miss that one it is a difficult proposition one of the things that s happening in this game tonight is that <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> is being asked to play inside because they wanted this club of veteran communication between <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> and <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> but you just have to wonder now is everybody a bit unsettled with their position that was a gain of 18 that is the big question coming in from pittsburgh grady gets out of trouble and thatll be another first down in the 30 20 yard line is <person player="brandon bolden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon bolden</person> comes out of the backfield to make the catch brothers you know we were talking about at the beginning chris the fact that the defense in pittsburgh that s the big question you know theyre gonna score very potent offense especially when you know <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">bell</person> gets back and <person player="martavis bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bryant</person> obviously but that secondary was the key yeah and what you do not want to see are the mental breakdowns mike tomlin chief <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> intentionally made this defense very simple for this game as it was going to be loud the road and so far weve seen those breakdowns balance on this drive is beyond <person player="dion lewis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lewis</person> picks up 8 yards well the other part of this defensively that you have to see out of the pittsburgh steelers is step on to it and <person player="cameron heyward" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cameron heyward</person> they have to take care of the middle in there louis tries to back you swing girl horse down spotted i think just a little bit short of the 10 yard line well if this young offensive line can play and play well think about what the future could be here theyve had the two tackles <person player="sebastian vollmer" race="white" position="OT">sebastian vollmer</person> and nate s older play for a long time here and now youve got <person player="david andrews" race="UNK" position="C">david andrews</person> and brian <person player="bryan stork" race="UNK" position="C">stork</person> coming off the concussion <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey</person> jackson drafted and shaq <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> a very athletic guy on that left side along with josh klein were thinking that s a young bunch could be here for 10 years raucous <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">cannon</person> in the right tackle third a short one already sneaks again that s gonna set up a first down and goals we took down to five minutes left in the half tell you what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s going to take a little shot on this when coming in from his right side but he has away <person player="ryan shazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">shazier</person> timed it up perfectly they doubleteam can a champ but it wasnt until a week ago that you even knew for sure the time was going to play tonight at the 5yard line therefore gain of about for these gentlemen <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> there to make the sub alright here we go it s tough enough to play against these guys when youve got 11 out there you show up with 10 and we have seen all kinds of trouble i dont know what happened exactly mike <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> was coming in and out of the game for a little while and so im not sure if he got hurt but the throat then seems a little out of sync now defensively second lord boldin is the running back that s down <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> the second boy they made that look pretty z9 play 64 yards for us five passes and brought to the end zone twice today right there wow and they put him in because of his veteran leadership and communication they gave him a run formation and then just went right by <person player="will allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will allen</person> dont know how you stopped that big guy i asked bill belichick do you think youll see cover two which basically means the middle of the field open he said nobody plays cover two against us as they cant cover <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> at the 23yard line this task is good for all patriots to make it work can you take a look at the solution for that s pretty good tip jason day ricky fowler who won here last week <person player="dekoda watson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">watson</person> is in there charlie hoffman played well down the road coming up beginning thursday off channel skinny right there to the 17 yard line the pittsburgh steelers haha trying to get out of it 357 to go in the open <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> came here in 2010 and since then in terms of proficiency well red zone since brock got here 42 touchdowns three interceptions that s a 55th overall touchdown pass that <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has thrown to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> until 94 in the zone both new england touchdowns now the steelers from the 17 yard line around the tip by <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> spins away for another cup of the orange takes it up to the 22 yard line this is going to look familiar to a lot of people this was the old super bowl play come out with a pick now it s gonna come and <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> s gonna drive on it he just played it a little deeper but he did get a big shot that time on antoniou brown a little more effective pick that time marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> second and five were gonna have left in the half draw williams up to the 31:8 flag however is sown at the 20yard line holding number 72 off that s the center taking bouncies place <person player="cody wallace" race="white" position="C">cody wallace</person> interior guys just arent used to being in space and that time it was <person player="cody wallace" race="white" position="C">cody wallace</person> who got out he s gonna make a good block but he just again is angela williams got to the outside you just grab the outside of it and you saw <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> begging for the flag and john at that time not a big hole by any means by <person player="cody wallace" race="white" position="C">cody wallace</person> on that one at her second and 15 from the 12 those his way to the 21 had a chance to talk to <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> about that super bowl play and he said when i saw him plant that outside foot like that i knew he was going inside i drove hard on that thing and just made the play he said one of the things that was really key for me was seeing that foot move and then the reaction time youre going to see come back in but he said i was so angry that that tipped ball i was covering landed in the lap of the receiver i thought i was to go to the games i had nothing to lose at that point i just fired my shot ended up working out when he came out on the next play went back in for you know why pass caught by antone and he is out of bounds at the new england 41 yard line so a big third down conversion <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> again covering on the play and we posted the twominute warning 37 yard gain <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person>s not too bad either that time you dont get a good solid jam on him and that s an issue running that go route from the slot position is so much easier let s see if they come back to it five grams for him twominute warning 14 nothing with these stealers on the move so the halftime coming up they and tony and rodney are all here weighing in in the first half well take a look ahead to sunday night football giants cowboys but f time two minutes pittsburgh has all of its time like that double trouble and jonathan stewart at carolina four years at the 40yard line brought this burger leading up to the line will huddle mid40s five in the hat stare has been waving the ball all night they just have to start the burden points atchoo 22 oh wrestle him down about three yards short of the first down in bounds so itll be third down time considering those three time asking well need to take one here at stirred that in three and josh go beyond we shot within and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> s gonna throw tended to market terrell brown longtime 49er came over this year and it s fourth down well and because you know what bella jack s gonna do he s gonna try and take away your top threatened at san <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> so they knew marcus <person player="markus wheaton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wheaton</person> and they knew <person player="darius fleming" race="UNK" position="LB">darius</person> hayward bay had to make some place tough play here but it could have been a real game changer they just have not been able to do it now theyre gonna go for it youre on board yeah scotty would have to pick a 53 yarder waqas berger has whistle before the snap timeout have been called coagulating a 30second timeout fourth down when we come back first player to miss two field goals for the steelers since 1970 first player since seven <person player="dekoda watson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">watson</person> discovery stays on the sidelines here s raucous burger after the new england timeout the 35yard line each first down here <person player="darius fleming" race="UNK" position="LB">darius</person> named invade and theyll take a timeout with pittsburgh because had they not prayed he would have had enough time to march down the field again back after the timeout first down 31 yard line steelers have two timeouts and if the royals smooth to cut it the inside to the 25yard line pittsburgh letting the clock one here now youre to the point where really getting into nerdist im not using a timeout here that s a lot of time off the clock second and five no it s not it s the official comes over to see your on the choc means im not taking that time out leaves them alone 13 seconds how could they mess this up there it is his right foot is on the chalk even when they get a layup this is a layup there s nobody there well i understood not taking the time out earlier but here now theyre down to 13 theyre gonna leave a timeout maybe two on the board in the meantime theyll take one here wow the clock stopped well the clock stopped pittsburgh had to take a timeout just to figure out what they get gonna do here it s third down and five at the 25yard line they have one timeout and i want to settle for a scobie field goal <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> that last one really moved the safety see if he comes back and now youre going to get another new england timeout yeah and that enables us to tell you this info kit go special brought to you by verizon watch live prime time games benefi mobile only on four eysan by chevrolet finding roads by everest the most intense imax daily experience september the 18th and by nationwide one is on your side snow here of course over the winter they came back in it when they had 110 inches in fact thousands of fans boylston street to celebrate the patriots fourth super bowl win 96 degrees here two days ago the snow finally melted third and five from the 26 under pressure cause and that s incomplete they looks for a flag and doesnt get it and his 4000 so from the moment theyre gonna get scobie coming out to attempt a field goal of about 44 yards there is a word bae doesnt play a lot but anytime youre planning gets mantoman coverage you dont stop youve got to make sharp breaks youve got to try and separate and youre brown on the outside another good job by <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> that s been a 44 yard at 10 times an ugly ng would seem to be a wreck promise to drive they have a new holder as well in addition scobie the punter is the new holder and that kick is good so with three seconds remaining in the half it s now 14 to 3 well one person not in attendance tonight is the commissioner roger goodell oh opted not to come watching on television to sort of understand it i mean you know he can argue both sides of it ill tell you one thing if judge berman showed up they would parade him around the stadium in a sedan chair weve seen signs around town free coffee for life for judge marvin i read one article that said the only chance the steelers had was given up when judge berman made that ruling i tell you theyve hung in there pretty good against this patriots team even despite all theyre missing on the offensive side so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> not that he needed any extra incentive or juice or whatever didnt remember he can say all he s man he pretty much approaches every key the same way yeah when he came out on the field though about an hour before the game for his very first appearance in front of this crowd they went crazy as you might expect and he gave it some pretty good fist pumps like he had just thrown a couple of touchdown passes knew that in the first half and the super bowl champions on opening night he drives culminating with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> touchdowns lead 14 to 3 coming up next time after these messages from miracle <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> nearly 15 of 17 in the first half two of those completions touchdowns to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> the pats 14 3 at the half here s dan tony and rodman alright bob thank you rodney you spent time with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> last week and he knew he s gonna be the focal point of this steeler defense he made it look too easy i was too easy dan and all week distillers talked about jim and i being physical at the line of scrimmage slowing him down and if they didnt do any of that coach and with all the changes in the secondary i know about miscommunication but this is just lack of execution you cannot let the best tighten on the planet go up the seen my tomlin was worried about the young guys making mistakes here s a big one no one covers <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> easy touchdown so now all of a sudden they decide to put two guys on it and guess what they still cant cover and get our hands on and were gonna rough him up he runs right up the save you cannot let this guy score is too tough sounds that s inexplicable when the two touchdown drives <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> 12 for 12 a hundred and 34 yards fitchburg had opportunities here they did and there s so much pressure on their offense they cant make mistakes but theyre looking for the big play and sometimes it s not there this is a double pass a trick play but you see the safeties deep and tonio browns just got to throw this away he cant take the loss and then rodney this you cant have these kind of mistakes where receivership gets the ball but he just steps out of bounds but offensively they were moving the ball theyre having success then all of a sudden they try a double pass coach they get a flag out the words dont get too cute dont outsmart yourself penalties two missed field goals they should be in this game well the steelers have more total yards than the patriots do but theyre down 14 to 3 coming up look ahead to the giants cowboys sunday night football opener featuring odell beckham jr but first while everyone knows that sports are exciting let s take a look at some of the folks who take that excitement and go the distance at halftime the patriots lead the steelers 14 to 3 meanwhile looking ahead our first sunday night football game features the giants of the cowboys and the last time these two teams met on a sunday night last november the giants odell beckham jr made a play you might remember even if you still dont believe it was sunday night football against the cowboys its first from 10 on the 43 yard line who does have a long playaction is a double move out and up i go to jump for the ball i see that you know i like it uses the one on that i had was just the right arm and it was the only way that i was gonna be able to get a hand on the ball so i just reached back and little did i know my life is gonna change forever after that play you are going to see that may be the greatest catch ive ever seen unbelievable as a word that s often overused in sports but that was pretty close to unbelievable beckham and the giants will be in dallas on sunday night
