============================================================

kicking in both directions is going to be a challenge tonight in particular going left to right on your screen is going to be especially problematic packer special teams coach ron zook told me when it comes to field goals or a point after attempts in that direction you better have a plan b it says it all michele it is really swirling down there and the wind going left to right 10 to 20 miles per hour that s what the packers are gonna be going with that direction here to start the game they won the toss gonna take the ball both teams saw the teams ahead of them in their divisions win today

couple of weeks super bowl mvp twice the mvp of the league the numbers are always good but they have been better in part because it s an offense for this chris not gotten into rhythm they havent run the ball effectively and aaron s tried to have to save it all so often and you hit it right on the head with your first comment it looks like their offense when he drops back and he s not comfortable throwing on time and then he scrambles around and there this hasnt been those big plays that were so accustomed to seeing when we saw on this two years ago they debuted in 2014 against the window getting ready to pop in that diamondshaped backfield but <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> had nowhere to go as <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> makes the play for the loss of a yard here we go and when you get this kind of penetration going right around cory <person player="corey linsley" race="white"

addition to kicking tonight catching punts was a challenge for these guys in warmups at this time and jacob scum kicks in 35 yards the fair catch by <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK"

race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> theyre going to be going out it s going to be a key thing this looked like a man coverage off the snap of the ball nice job by joe berry given that look but it was pure zone coming out and all <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> could do just dump it down and make a big play jacob let this one go takes a good bounce and washington will have 94 yards to work with the job by shum the wind field position so important advantage green bay for the moment took this a moment of tonight s game with the nbc

going to do that tonight rock kelly gets topped on his first down run good play up front from the troy guy on they lose a couple on first down detroit guy on right over the ball right here just gonna blow right through that guard center gap and make the play and now the washington redskins backed up in precarious position at this point you definitely need a few yards on this play just to get you back where you can punt and here come the pass rushers thinking two points of their own second a 134 <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> hell throw from his own endzone gets it now gets it complete to <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">pierre</person> garçon short of the first down but gives them breathing room third down ahead let s

matthews</person> usc maderas gone you <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> georgia to rockland it s the university of alabama quentin wrong as miami ohio missing two of their top corners so that secondary play needs to be more solid it s third and short no run <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kelley</person> first down a much more robert <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kelley</person> across the 30 so they were backed up at their own two and with to place washington gets the game s first first then <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> is going to come over and kick out right here gets <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> and just establish that cutback <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane</person> and it was a tough day at the office last week against tennessee for this green bay packers defense of course their leading tackler jake y and their middle linebacker out there playing with <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> who s used to playing and pass coverage and stopping the run is paramount here <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> is such a good plan to pass her in traffic hilda to buy car saw to shine a big feel in the first down hey im impressed so far watching <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> throwing the ball in these conditions right now he is rifling this thing in here here s our song without a drop pass all season <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> but how many times we see that mic you know you hit a big run you come right back with play action all of a sudden a linebacker step up here comes the crossing route it right in behind washington offense is getting better in part 32 kelly who you see there as prem ratan taking over to the running back position down to the right undrafted player out of tulane only gets a yard there <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> with the tackle chris we talked about <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> when the run game gets going it seems to feed right into his skill set yeah it really does and you know this robert <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kelley</person> has come out of nowhere really to take over the running back position and i dont know if this is gonna make a lot of sense to everybody but he makes a lot of two yard runs four yard runs and in the national football league if you can do that if you have that kind of power to run the football it just sets up everything else keeps you on track for some of those playaction passes stop seducing now as well theyre third down back this is second and it s complete and top <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> unable to hold on and that s such a story <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> rarely drops the ball just a seventh our target drop of his career it s his fourth year in the league that s a nice play here by <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake</person> martin as it was a clear catch he just goes in and knocks the thing right out but you can see the matchup issues that <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> is going to create for those inside linebackers there his career drops hed beat ninety four consecutive catches of balls thrown on target without a drop until that one that we just saw so that s that s news there he s more than 9 and a half out of 10 play <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> wanted an illegal motion penalty on <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> didnt get it it s close to jackson tried to put the feet down in bounds but did not in complete against his own defense and washington will be forced to kick it away and i think already were seeing from dom capers he has no real interest in playing man coverage against these washington redskins receivers they are just going to be very happy to sit back and hope that <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> and <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> can get home with the pass rush because they do not match up well with all the injuries in their secondary trés <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> it could <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> out of bounds last time it s the nosedown tries to keep towards the sidelines with power their catch 40 on the nose he s got that ten the packers will have it for the third time this evening when we come back green bay s been so good for so <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> he s just not used to a stretch like this the losses in atlanta to indian lambeau and then to tennessee and 30plus points allowed in each game hasnt happened in a decade now theyve scored 25 points a game but theyre one a five teams in league history to score that much in each of three straight losses and for mike mccarthy have to go back to 2008 to find a streak in this neighborhood and these guys have been around and theyve been so successful but karthi rodgers leaving them on the field ted <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> the general manager since 2005 but right now it s a rare time there is a little bit of angst fans are complaining theyre being vocal spoil perhaps after making the playoffs seven consecutive years <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> with the carry out to the 14 yard line but christen there s an example that this team has not been whole especially on the offensive side the first half of this season well when you see number 88 is your tailback you know there s a few different things going on and for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> right to the line of scrimmage it s been an uncomfortable week for him as people they tried to tell him what he met with his words trying to jump into a little nohuddle get some rhythm going and <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> runs only for a couple of yards its eighth place on the packers with not much to show for it <person player="ricky jeanfrancois" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ricky</person> jeanfrançois with the tempo well and the other part of it is let s face it two of the best guards in football for the past five six seven years are no longer in the starting lineup here josh sitting now plays for the chicago bears <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj</person> laying out with a leg injury so there s some issues up front too going to get the first first down of the evening third full on it to complete but <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> so they go to that other side up a shot <person player="bashaud breeland" race="nonwhite" position="DB">breeland</person> we shows up there and that s three consecutive three announce of the packers much like last week i wish i had one of those golf trackers you know where you could follow the flight of the ball i think this ball moved about four feet to the inside of where <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> threw it because very rarely will you see him miss a stop round to the inside that s the interception side you see that replay shum punting it to the sideline <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> so dangerous and it on the sideline but makes the most of it against that the bounce right around the 46 yard <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> it s a good field position for a washington your defense get it done so far <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> grew up on the west side of the state of michigan holland to michigan went to michigan state was here with robert kraft from the 30 didnt think hed be the one setting the quarterback stat numbers and making some redskin history for best numbers through 35 starts but he has been that man number one in all these categories except for touchdown passes one behind mark ripon who had 58 the redskins have had such inconsistency at the quarterback position but they settled on <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> and so far as making them look good last year and this slide to <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> the arrow gained about seven yards the various gunther and haha flicking dicks on the green bay tackle you know he s the first time i really got to spend any time with <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> and he s an interesting guy you know i you saw the fiery stuff and he even said that you know i was a lot like philip rivers back in the day as complete for the first time held onto by <person player="ryan grant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ryan grant</person> and forward progress third year man at tulane will be marked at the 43yard line of course you everybody knows that i said who did you say that to anyway he said there was just some poor reporter over there so were you mad at me because no i was just i had to yell something to somebody last week after a passing thought should have been a pass interference call he sprinted about thirty yards down the field to have a conversation so he s got some of that stuff in uh and i think he kind of tries to balance it is it good and what is it not going first down here is hit strong rbis bruce in the middle but <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> was a nice job breaking up the pass intended for <person player="vernon davis" race="nonwhite" position="TE">vernon davis</person> and it s incomplete the one thing the washington redskins have to be able to do in this game throwing the football is try and go between those split safeties back there they really want to sit there and play some zones and not take a lot of chances so youll see trying to get the tight end right down the middle of the field that time <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> all over it theyre trying to make sure they get some push out of there and now get some crossing routes underneath second and ten harry gets pushed past the spot <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> scrambles runs will <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> move the pump fake past the line of scrimmage and itll make a third more managable here s one that i find amazing over here tiein seki who has taken over for i think the best left tackle in football and <person player="trent williams" race="nonwhite" position="OT">trent williams</person> and here s a guy with really very little experience whatsoever goes into that game against the minnesota vikings as a starter <person player="trent williams" race="nonwhite" position="OT">trent williams</person> suspended for four games and he basically pitches a shutout in this one and now he s got <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> and doing all right so far with him this is being the four game suspension for violating the league s substance abuse policy third in six <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> over the middle it s brought in by <person player="maurice harris" race="UNK" position="WR">maurice harris</person> for the first down and starting to target <person player="maurice harris" race="UNK" position="WR">harris</person> the biggest bodied wide receiver they have a little bit more the last two weeks 14 on that game there we go just some of those crossing routes now watch right there ha clinton dix he s gonna jump the first crosser but they come with the second crosser right in behind it and so far <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> really delivering bullets all night <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> he has been on target id really to listen plant the line first in ten there are some again get to the 20yard line pick up a five up first down in chris you were talking about his emotion and controlling some of that emotion he s becoming that whole line comfortable in your own skin he s becoming comfortable as the quarterback of the redskins right now <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> 20 million dollars well do that for you you know really he was wanting a longterm deal and he said that that was the best offer i got the oneyear deal prove it and he knows the next seven games or so are gonna have a lot to do with how <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> he stays in washington on the franchise tag for this one year kelly up the middle has a helmet aaron tackled by <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> but got out of it and kept those feet going and that s what you said gracie turned nothing into about two or three yards with that <person player="derek carrier" race="white" position="WR">carrier</person> there s something about in the national football league these guys that <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> you know to 25 to 30 and you just cant bring them down with arm tackles they just keep fighting but look at the difference now now instead of a third down and seven and you got a drop back and shotgun and now everything s open to you they bring in <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person> who is really a key part of this offense on 3rd down at running back <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john</person> jackson in the slot <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> surveys those two <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> for the touchdown ld marker i the play will check the fly it looked like there was a blow to the head on the far wide receiver out here i dont know if that s what they caught first time we hear from <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john</person> hussey the reference to the hands as to the face default for the play touchdown and <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> gets his second touchdown reception on the season watch the move by <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> up the field gonna go fake out to your left and then just hit hard that post pattern again going between those split safeties down the middle of the field that s where they think they can work all night <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> it s a sweet move yeah

position="TE">reed</person> came all the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> back that s a good quarterback play and he s been doing it all night <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> so far seven of 11 for 76 yards in that touchdown see if the packers can get going last week their first three drives a couple of three announce and then one first down so similar slow start picked up by <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> the tight end abeyta man listen gets to the 30yard line in about five yards well and theyre hoping that tonight theyre get a little action out of <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> who has been injured it but he s that big speedy tight in that they think and get in the middle of the field and work some of those triangle offenses that they like to play but they havent really been able to threaten the middle of the field so far this year quick the temperature was tied incomplete intended for randall cop <person player="kendall fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kendall fuller</person> the rookie the coverage will first down opening three drives first time since 2010 when they went over their first five drives and theyre threatening goal for fouryear if they cant pick this one up well and let s just say because it s going to be a game of which direction are you going to they are going directly into the wind now and washington has had the win at their back so well see what happens when we flip it porter third and five redskins rushed for rogers gets rid of it there s a first down <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ty montgomery</person> just in turn to the 39 before the veteran <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">donte whitner</person> makes the tackle id say it opens up a lot of possibilities when you have a wide receiver playing running back time <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> lines up in the backfield and is really just going to get out here and the flat nothing fancy about this at all but he still was going to have to make one person minutes to get the first down no problem at all able to make the play there on <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitner</person> <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> get lines up in the backfield 50 left in this opening quarter with him on this drive it s <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers again hell carry <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitner</person> right to the first ill mark at the 49 yard line two catches here for <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> who has 19 receptions coming into tonight it s washington s defensive coordinator joe barry and ill tell you having <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> on the field has really allowed him to do a lot more they are youre seeing more man coverage and more attacking style of defense because they feel like with <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> he can lock down somebody so they can help elsewhere on the defense bounty s punts the lutes <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> reloads and fires complete third one on this drive to <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> and he s pushed out of bounds right near the first down marker boy id say it sure looked like <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">ryan kerrigan</person> had him then he made that little inside move and it just looked like it was game on and for <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> he was staring at sack number eight right there so you know he wanted it but it s amazing how well aaron sort of recomposes himself after ii you know something crazy happens he can get his mind refocus and find somebody down the field 3:19 we just to start to run to the left in washington with good penetration he francois will come to you going to make the tack in a couple of yards as we wind down to the end of this first quarter so after the struggles for green bay they get a little momentum here mike mccarthy steamed of the benefit of the wind at the line here maybe squeeze up one more play before the other the first so end to the quarter here in washington with the score redskins seven packers nothing and sunday night football continues after these messages tonight skycam coverage is brought to you by geico mike tirico and frau michaels with cris collinsworth michele tafoya sunday night football team glad to have you with us in washington been a while since sunday night football has been here and the redskins fans happy about the momentum this team is built remember they won their last four last year to win the division five three and one trying to stay within shouting distance of the cowboy so they go visit on thanksgiving so after going into the wind in the opening quarter green bay and when did their back this drive starts second and eight and the loungers pass complete to <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> in front of the <person player="shawn lauvao" race="nonwhite" position="OT">shawn</person> <person player="bashaud breeland" race="nonwhite" position="DB">breeland</person> is short of the first down do you think the wind is a significant factor in how that first quarter played out offensively i think so you know we really still havent seen a deep pass down the field so we dont know exactly what s going to happen with that but it s interesting that <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> and the washington redskins have really been the more effective deep passing team on the year well go through some of the numbers but just intuitively you would say well <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> right and the whole thing but it has been the redskins with some of their weapons that have been much better at those deep throws 32 for rodgers out of 33 ready go and be back here that lunch to the right and a delay again it s really rare that you see that with green bay you can hear the wind in <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john</person> huskies microphone and maybe you can see it in the numbers in the distance of the opening quarter passes yeah but that s not necessarily a bad thing for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> the one thing that i think maybe theyve done too much of is just having aaron scrambled around and kind of doing some sandlot stuff we saw in that tennessee game when he got back to some quick throws get it out of his hands protect his offensive line a little bit they started moving quickly up and down the field theyre the two tension two third and seventh pass is deflected and incomplete sulak ravens a secondround pick out a usc who s playing a great role in his defense with the deflection and saying this young man is exciting right here he is going to loop around that <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> and come up and be right in the passing <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane</person> i mean they are now starting to draft young men like this because of the gronkowski s of the world you have to have a little size you have to be able to play the run you have to be able to blitz a little bit and right now he is becoming a bigger and bigger part of this defense a real playmaker inside number 36 hell go from here be 56 yards given the wind green bay s going to go for it to the 30 rogers keeping it a lot pass incomplete intended <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> and the slot quarter <person player="kendall fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kendall fuller</person> was over there let s check the penalty penalty flag thrown downfield on the opposite side of where the ball was thrown boy i tell you <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> one shot that wide open before the pass was thrown to the base number 26 on the death penalty automatic now <person player="shawn lauvao" race="nonwhite" position="OT">shawn</person> <person player="bashaud breeland" race="nonwhite" position="DB">breeland</person> keeps the drive going for green bay take a look and you want to get your hands on receivers but as they dip down you cant go to that head and neck area and this is one of the things ive seen a little bit more than ive ever seen before <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> pops him wide open across the field and rodgers doesnt see him i mean he has been his number one guy forever and you know he s looking for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> on fourth down and just to miss seeing that guy is very unusual tough call on that one to keep a drive going starts to the puts his head down ziggy <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> pittsburgh steeler firstrounder mark that deal on rotation makes the tackle for washington gain of about four four starts yeah but the one thing that you have to see more of is just the ability to run the football i think theyve been down to like 27% runs something like that now they throw the ball on anyway but generally it s around 40% down to 27% and if it werent for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> runs over the past three weeks it would have been lower than that chris he has all the rushing touchdowns this year dodgers it s almost thanksgiving to second and six screen setup starts drops the ball he s a very good screen runner that s been missing from the packer offense a man that had a chance to gain a first down it s not more tough to blame that one on the wind and only went about 5 yards but those are the kinds of plays that you just take for granted with the green bay packers that when youre in a slump and when things are going poorly you dont make those kinds of plays he might have still been running on that one and of course everybody knows <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> theyre tremendous young running back is out he s now on ir up to that ankle surgery and really active for the game tonight as a pure running back game starts the only one thirtysix washington bring some extra pressure rod to his surveys hat starts who holds on this time was gonna be too shot in the first half <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitner</person> was chasing and hit him first let s see what mccarthy will do here hell go will be a 43yard attempt or you can see that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> now is trying to look at something down the field theyve got safeties deep theyre playing man coverage underneath and theyre just you know theyre just isnt that guy running wide open yeah i keep thinking maybe theyll come back to <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> he s had the hot hand here lately but havent seen a lot of him either tells me about the wind here and this is with the wind at their back what would be a 43yard field goal attempt they ask you that and try to keep the drive going rogers looking for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> man to get away from <person player="trent murphy" race="white" position="DE">trent murphy</person> and hell run for the first down because he slid forward against all that slot yardage in he was untouched so he keeps going with a rule that he gave himself up as he made the dime so hell be marked it up bt okay you know just <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> being there in rogers and being great youre gonna see im gonna come across here with the back side and it looked like <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> was going to be wide open for that first down but then it was murphy right in rogers face but you better not attack that guy too quickly because that s what s made him <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> over the years they begin his running tough exchange there but they game through just to go back to that play to clear it up if you slide normally like a baseball type slide give yourself up that s where youre marked but since he wasnt touched because he s sliding forward if he would have gotten immediately up since no redskin touches him he would have been able to score but what s his body came to that stop right there they really give yourself up and <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john</person> hussey did a good job of getting on the mic and explaining that still got the first down and this is the best looking drive green baize had in the first half send a lot of pressure for the redskins this could go <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> inside the tendon and its first and goal for green bay they signed them in february they rarely signed free agents chris they bring in <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> who was with tennessee for four years and then the rams just to try to get a big tight end presence back in this lineup he s been injured most of the season yeah he really has but this guy his entire career has been a receiving play making tight in and with this offense the one thing that theyre trying to get back to what mike mccarthy wants is somebody right in front of <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> that s always theyre a big target easy to find let s keep these drives alive bursting gold from the six lookout man walkin touchdown wouldnt spin his head around he hasnt played with the quarterback like <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> who s going to give you that one it was the worst of all situations by time you run out of space over here youre supposed to turn up the field he was just in the process of turning up the field just as <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> was throwing it to the flat so it is just a miscommunication there and that s kind of the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> some things have been going here lately is that time spent together 22 the backfield second and goals we get up beneath <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> will be three shy of the touchdown passat <person player="bashaud breeland" race="nonwhite" position="DB">breeland</person> with the tackle put a pretty nice job up front so far you know theyve got the two new guards in their <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane taylor</person> and <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">don barclay</person> a really great matchup on the outside here let s keep an eye on these pass rushers on the outside for the washington redskins attackers drive 17th play of the drive when they came out with the touchdown it s like washington s gonna bring some pressure as rogers gets rid of it for the touchdown enzyme <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> penalty flag thrown back by the quarterback holding <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> who s in for <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj</person> lying at guard going up against the old packer right there colin <person player="cullen jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jenkins</person> and as <person player="cullen jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jenkins</person> made that inside move he still has it a little bit it was <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> who latched on so once again success undercut by a mistake he mentioned <person player="cullen jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jenkins</person> the old packer he put the plays like 16 snaps and last game isnt play much at this point in his career part of the superbowl 45 team but he got <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> who is in a starting role for the first time this year after the injury to the very dependable <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> last week at tennessee third and goal again the pressure rogers and eludes the rush throws on the run and cant hang on they say touchdown they say and then that s the ball out but he had possession first we had a flag where the blitzer was coming in he hit rogers up by the face so a <person player="sua cravens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">cravens</person> cannot believe what just happened too the corner bath result from the play was a touchdown this fell through on the kickoff let s go have to look at the touchdown the reception here in the back of the endzone by <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> came on the slot blitz there s the grabbing of the facemask almost pulled it off and somehow <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> got that front leg back on the ground and found <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> a remarkable play remarkable play by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> where s the catch tucked away because he wasnt going to the ground i guess the period of time is much shorter there that s one of those interesting ones in the field of play as you talked about there s the play it s now under realtime look at it he s spinning attorney if that happens in the middle of the field that s not a catch but it s in the end so so did he have it <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> enough to look here and they look at the game dave central in new york to decide after review the call in the field stands against stan so nothing clear and obvious to change the call on the field against his facemask justifying <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> coming down there you know we were talking about it during the break in the field of play is that a catch i dont think so hey you know i dont think so either then zone a little different i always would say there a catch i hate taking points off the bird at me he caught the ball was doing an act tucking it away my mind i would have left it alone so he weeds the nfl and were in zone touchdown receptions that was his e to the red zone night of the year what a play by rogers and were tied at 7 apiece so day after thanksgiving the real chaos that could be the boss be on the ice the rangers take on the flyers and he tell thanksgiving showdown to the top scoring teams of the nhl the rangers off to an excellent start you know three on chicago s nhl hockey for you on friday after thanksgiving youre on nbc i just let my buddy on the ball chaos because of the penalty that was not enforced the redskins at their hands team on as a synchros becomes too big field for the kickoff 15yard penalty it s a touch back to washington well get it at the 25 weve talked about the green bay packers secondary and youll see some of these numbers pretty remarkable for pro football focus those are quarterback ratings against each of those defenders and when you look at the number of touchdowns and a 112 quarterback rating would win through the mvp and that s the lowest one pete of the bunch right now clearly the injuries have really hurt dom capers and his defense it was a secondary build around <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> okay he s out weve got <person player="damarious randall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">damarious randall</person> a firstround pick he s out now we have issues it s kids working against went from the 25 <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> throws <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rob</person> kelly cannot bring it down that pass is incomplete <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> bringing heat on the quarterback now were starting to get <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> warmed up here a little bit and they desperately need it he s gonna come right around the edge here an aggressive move to the outside by in seki but for <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> there s no question this is just the different defense we talked about <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> in the corner stone in the back end the corner stone on the front end is this guy and it has been for a <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> time and there are different defense without him now he s playing outside instead of inside dont say he s back home second and 10 <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> this throw incomplete as you tried to get it to <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person> so washington will have a third law isnt it funny all those easy looking throws from <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> in the first quarter going that <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> all of a sudden dont look quite as easy out there i mean it is really roughing and im a bit of a wimp when i go down on the field and i was off that field in a hurry it was cold and that wind just whips it was hard to even describe which <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> it was blowing sometimes costas was sitting on the set play football i cover for you sitting underneath to shoot yourself flag throw in here full start offense number 85 yard penalty third down jameson <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> we talked about how <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> that drive was about an eightminute drive with the wind for green bay at the back end of it chris they could be right back on the field this washington defense so this is one of those times in the game can change momentum because of what the packers are able to do on offense and because his stadium so enclosed once the wind gets down in this bowl and just starts going crazy tres set the screeches <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> went up to tip it and it s incomplete and he hit the deck hard as he was exposed six foot seven <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> go back to his college basketball days north carolina that s like a tipping this guy <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> he s going the <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> of fame and certainly and this is one of his skills he s blocked a bunch of kicks watch him kid holy cow that ball was hanging forever thought for sure somebody was gonna get him and then all of a sudden it was <person player="shawn lauvao" race="nonwhite" position="OT">shawn</person> laval who got him a good tip it was a blocked shot third pass he s deflected this year expressway kicking the 47yard kick that is own 33 tom returns it but 11 yards and green bay will have good field position they are coming back pack rangers will check on that player when we come back to use the term voting judy wants to play in this year s pro bowl game in orlando you can vote and if lcom / pro bowl votes every vote counts it says so vote today now we mentioned going to break there was an injury <person player="demetri goodson" race="UNK" position="DB">demetri goodson</person> it was a nasty looking injury and no need to show the replay of it but the medical staff immediately out and the cart as well for <person player="demetri goodson" race="UNK" position="DB">goodson</person> a cornerback for these packers in his third year this guy played the basketball for the early part of his career at gonzaga that finished up playing football at baylor it did get the start week 7 and 8 at left cornerback because of the groin injury to <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> granted <person player="damarious randall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">damarious randall</person> so certainly hope that young man s all right has a very bright future in front of them he was involved in the punt coverage and the tackle and just got a body or two laying on his leg and got bent in the wrong direction it s a great banth leg training staff and medical personnel here in washington will look after <person player="demetri goodson" race="UNK" position="DB">goodson</person> as the packers will get back to offense to take over at their own 44 game tied at 7 <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> caught a 17yard from <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> on the last drive <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> to <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> to tie it up tom and <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james</person> tux will space here for six or seven yards and crisp green bay controlling the offensive line a little bit as good to just take it back to the locker room got a few good lucks on this one <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">don barclay</person> is gonna come down and make a nice block here and then it s aaron rip kowski who comes and gets the secondary block from the fullback position so a little couldnt sense a little bit of green bay maybe trying to get back to their running game now and helping their playaction passing game and taking a little pressure off of <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> field roger stops on the dive as he saw <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> unloads downfield and it s incomplete <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff janis</person> was running it was double covered you mentioned chris the running game getting going a little bit but mike mccarthy told us this week youre getting christened <person player="christine michael" race="UNK" position="RB">michael</person> from seattle who is inactive tonight we actually have a running back room that looks like it s full we have five real running backs in the room it s been <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> maybe a little <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> tonight mike would love to get back to being able to get some balance and some rhythm and pace of this offense <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> like that too he said he s got six touchdowns well have anybody down here <person player="christine michael" race="UNK" position="RB">michael</person> just coming and after being let go in seattle cuz cj prosise has come along so well theyll have them next week third in play rogers pass complete other one it stopped for the first down inside the 35 yard line to the 34 a gain of 15 id say weve got to keep an eye on something that <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> s really given <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">don barclay</person> some problems right here he s pushing him right back in there and rogers aaron stood in there that time and somehow delivered a strike that <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> is gonna have to be able to win that battle no question about it <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> their toughest inside bull rush er <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">lang</person> got hurt early with a tennessee game berkeley played essentially the whole game 74 snaps like theyre looking for the lead and starts well captain couldnt make the tackle <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> over there but it could gain on first down for starts sponsor to pulled the ball away but it was down and a flag is thrown on <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">norman</person> so <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">norman</person> threw the ball after that whistle was blown saying down by contact one of the officials farther away saw it and threw the flag for what will probably be a delay of game penalty in a five yarder youre not you know a little <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> sherman like you know i mean the guys playing football the ball and delay of game number 24 the defense the striking the ball into the ground fiveyard penalty first down unfortunately what theyre gonna say let s take a look at the play first see if that ball came out or not did not the elbow was on the ground but it just lands in <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> s laughs so he assumed it did and then we see this all the time guys get frustrated with a call and that s clearly a penalty that s the absolute right call as the eleventh penalty of <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> he has more penalties than any player in the league that one gives <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> a first down 24 yard line is complete to <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard</person> rogers again so theyre spreading the ball here in green baize out fences finding a rhythm from weight bed first quarters well and it s really what they are gonna have to do theyre beginning to isolate some receivers on the backside on the single receiver side and taking advantage of that coverage that time beating <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">donte whitner</person> with <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> so there you can tell theyre looking for tight ends more in this game take a look at the wind and you can throw a spiral like that it doesnt matter right rotation rotation the 13 that get to start the first man mess pose a flag <person player="sua cravens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">cravens</person> feels like he was held by berkeley bolden offense number 67 10yard penalty first out and that s where the speed of suah <person player="sua cravens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">cravens</person> comes into play those defensive back like linebackers that were starting to see coming over here watch <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> youll just see <person player="sua cravens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">cravens</person> beat him to the spot and then <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> really has no choice but to reach out and grab him in that case it s always better to let him go no give those backs a chance theyre getting paid money too oftentimes they can make that linebacker miss i love the point you made before i think a day home buchanan no close to cardinals this is a trend in the league to try to combat so many three receivers the teams are in three receiver sets twothirds of the time they get somebody in there to play the run and cover as well first in 24 rodgers again he s the best at this extending the play and he s got a ton of room to run inside the 10 it s level it down just around the 5yard line what a great play here how smart a play by <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> he sees rodgers getting loose on the corner so he s down there he knows he s in man coverage so he s going to peel back the other <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> sees the man coverage takes off deep down the field which worse is breland to go with him and brilliance got his back turn the whole time the rodgers is running right at him just a really smart football play by <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> it s funny if you think it s scrambled drills for receivers and it s work with your quarterback here it s one of the best things you could do work away from him give him space to run not me i was going to the ball play clock running down there s the second delay of game unless they give him the timeout let s see before the penalty number 12 on the offense call timeout it s our first shark sign now green bay this will come here at the five minute mark game time except you know were starting to see a strategy emerge here for the green bay packers and that being they cant get their hands on <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> even when guys are coming unblocked they cant get their hands on them so what are they doing theyre going five wide theyre just splitting everybody out and going okay maybe we cant block all your guys up front but let s see if you can tackle number 12 or not and so far that s really what s turn this game around that in the wind right and the question is can they keep doing it this <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> as you go through the season i mean youre asking your quarterback to do a lot but if there s anyone who youre gonna ask do a lot its guy s been the mvp in the league couple tough he is the most physically talented quarterback that there is there are other guys that can throw with him there are other guys that can run with them there isnt anybody they can do both with them you use the tennis term holding serve this was with the wind washington had the advantage in the first quarter green bay s had the win here in the second quarter theyve got all seven first downs if youre just joining us the wind that just swept through in turn temperatures in the 70s to the 30s from the midwest on through the northeast it s been a factor throughout the weekend in football games has changed the tenor here of this one timeout second and it starts this tongue

communicator the guy who gets that defense lined up and the coaches will tell you he is not the most physically talented linebacker they have but every time they put him in the game the defense as a whole was better and now he s the team captain so you know he is just it s nice to see those guys that have earned their <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> into prominent roles in this league again close to the play clock without <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> s get rogers back to the 20yard line ryan carrigan s eight sacko season anytime you see that double a blitz inside these two guys these linemen have to block down which means harrigan is going to get a free run so <person player="aaron rodgers"

touch back take you back to the 25yard line it s taken through that of course green bay pre lombardi had struggled 11 consecutive non winning seasons lombardi hired at seven and five record which

donald and some of the other players who he really admires that whole leverage thing he s and watch the olympics not necessarily the biggest of the strongest it s the guy who knows how to use his leverage properly he applies those tactics here in the league washington rather green bay took a timeout because that win factor youre talking about here chance to get the ball back quickly here in

offensive line were starting to see the packers now trying to do some stunts and loops because theyre not really in field goal range here because at least what i saw in pregame oh man this is going to be a nightmare if they had to kick one from there so that was a big first down michelle mentioned at the top kicking field goals in this direction the bigger issue is the two choices in the 35 corner blitz coming okay certain breed to the 15:3 caches of this drive the first end <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> mr tacker they brought a lot of pressure six men on the pressure coming off the edge and that for <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> is stuck on the outside against basically a slot receiver <person

race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> a lot on this drive three catches for 49 yards and he s one of the three tight ends washington has in right now i think they might be going for two here perhaps because the wind but theyre lining up to go for two hilly with the touchdown run his second big blocks over here on the double team and then <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">reed</person> lavar gonna lead their <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> right through there good tight running in there by robert kelly well that was an impressive drive into the wind mike mccarthy had so much confidence as defense is going to make a stop called the timeout and now here they are going for two mr <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> with that just a plate to the length of the back to the run and <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> will be stop putting dicks gotham first he s still going in that scrum finally is stopped so it remains a threepoint game at 13 to 10 interesting strategy there to go for the two we would think the wind impacting it there <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kelley</person> the touchdown washington the lead this time i promise well be back at 30 washington on top after that he played rat 13:10 let s go downstairs and here s michelle well you saw jordan read on that drive being able to move in ways that other players cant move look at this one they call this his crossover move murray told me he grew up playing basketball every day and he said i just used the same kind of movements i use playing basketball the same footwork and smoothness and <person player="vernon davis" race="nonwhite" position="TE">vernon davis</person> told me reid runs routes kind of like he has a basketball in his hands and davis is now trying to emulate those moves like those are pretty good ones he s terrific athlete was a very good star in connecticut during his high school days then went down to florida where he played tie then even started a game at quarterback to show how a good an athlete he was that s the position he mainly played in his high school days in connecticut before going down to play for the mighty gators then you call that game they want it right wonderful game they want a bowl game they play penn state and he was the starting quarterback and there s a short kick into the wind tough to catch flicka <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff</person> <person player="jeff janis" race="white" position="WR">jeff</person> janice s hands back there to burn you then sue if ravens made the first hit and then terrence <person player="terence garvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">garvin</person> will clean him up around the 15 yard line 32 seconds left and just one timeout for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and the packers really pretty impressive night for both these quarterbacks especially given the conditions out here but i just cannot emphasize enough as we look back on this game the drive that <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> just put together going into the wind where it looked like that was going to kind of be the deciding factor not just scoring the touchdown but eating up all that clock from <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> they burned the timeout and now only have one to work with and theyre backed up washington has the choice to start the second half we assuming at the ball that snap that rodgers had to pull in and he s just going to go down but he s sacked back at the 8 yard line big o <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> gets his third of the season and one of the packers linemen slow to get up as well they cannot have another injury on this offensive line of course <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> came into this with a knee injury they were unsure and to leave that last game and boy i tell you that would be a huge loss and i think mike mccarthy said enough is enough get out of here and get to have time to figure out what the plan is for the second half touchdown by washington late gives them the lead at the break 13 to 10 where the halftime coming up but first these messages from your local nbc station tonight s first half highlights are brought to you by chevrolet dozen surveys goes to 2shot jackson pull the touchdown rogers eludes the rush throws on the run touchdown remarkable play by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> look out <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> s got rogers back to the 20yard line touchdown for robert kelly chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row and back at fedex field ten miles away from our nation s capital on this blustery sunday night november <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> led a very good drama 17 play drive longest of his terrific career to get green bay on the board after a sluggish first quarter <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> very good working with the wind in the first quarter but as chris allude to big drive the end of the half to put washington on top five three the lone green bay touchdown <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> who leads the nfl eight in the red zone eight of his nine touchdown catches weve been watching the wind throughout the night it was really blowing late afternoon and just before kickoff you see many papers flying around the stadium and perhaps just a bit of the bite of the wind has gone down but the third quarter here washington has a choice to start the second half theyll take the ball and the green bay will be kicking left to right yeah and theyre gonna give them the wind to start and then take the win in the fourth quarter or so i like that strategy <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> as wins kicks it cant get it all the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> back to the end zone so it will be returned across the 20 getting it to the 7 yard line will be <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person> and theyll stop him there and well go down to michele tafoya well packers cornerback to michi <person player="demetri goodson" race="UNK" position="DB">goodson</person> will not return from that left knee injury he suffered in the first half so mike mccarthy will rely a lot on his safeties here in the secondary <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> and <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> both have a lot of experience in the slot now how big is the foes the wind of a factor mike mccarthy said it s like calling two different games down here depending on which <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> youre driving and as you said chris he has chosen to have the wind at their back in the fourth quarter trying to get that offense going in case they are behind mcgann the packers have lost their last three games trying to avoid a fourgame losing streak by calling a couple behind in the nfc north both detroit and minnesota won earlier today touchdown first half played <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> breaks it down after gate of three i have to tell you one of the surprises for me as i started to study the washington redskins was to play their offensive line <person player="brandon scherff" race="UNK" position="OT">brandon</person> sheriff the guy that the higher draft pick certainly got the job done <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">spencer long</person> who s come in and surprised everybody how well he s played there and then <person player="morgan moses" race="UNK" position="OT">morgan moses</person> doing a nice job on that side and senki on the other side holding his own all night <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> with <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> very impressive by him and that drive and their running ability had a lot to do with theyre taking the lead right into the right <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> will be pushed down to the sideline for confer net comes across the field good speed to make the play is washington offensive lines coached by bill <person player="joe callahan" race="white" position="QB">callahan</person> who did coached the raiders of the super bowl who were defeated by the tampa bay buccaneers but he s been a terrific offensive line coach think of the groundandpound jets he was their offensive coordinator when they went to backtoback afc championship games and he was with dallas that group that we want is the best in the league right now he helped those guys as they came in he s done a terrific job with his washington offensive front and assists on perfection third and six bus it s about to get through <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> ink and when a flag comes down on the hit by <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> the safe will be 15 on the packer defensive lineman contact to the helmet area of the quarterback automatic first down so instead of three and out first down washington you know he s not a big guy and when he got into them does a little loop around and you could see just standing essentially straight up i think the helmet caught the helmet and you saw <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> look immediately for the official and got to call that hurts both ways probably hurts <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> more but it hurts the packers they dont get off the field in washington as of the 46 invest for a couple of yards michelle yeah the wind a factor for jay gruden as well he told me they went for two after the <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rob</person> kelly touched down because he didnt want to kick it in this wind and now with the packers depleted secondary he likes his matchups across the board he wants to see his offense run the ball better and throw to the outside receivers to take advantage of that depleted secondary mike that s great to clarify that michelle because it mathematically at 1310 youre thinking take the extra point dont leave it a field goal game but the conditions change that it was 11 missed extra points today factored in as well kelly again across midfield <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">perry</person> was holding them <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> finished him off third down coming up it s amazing how thin the green bay packers are right now in their secondary and basically playing the game with safeties now when they want to add another defense back they dont add a corner they had another safety and cantrell bryce who s in there so the matchups you almost begin to think i wonder if the redskins would put your wide receivers on the field and see if they can take advantage of that matchup bryce got matched up with the tight ends against tennessee waning want right a big <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> pressured steps up fires in the village of and it is read for the first down of the 21 yard line and it s bracelet makes the tackle after a gain of 28 and what s happening is theyre sprinting people right down the middle of the field and then coming in with these crossing routes and because <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> was able to step up and buy that extra bit of time every time we would call in the huddle in cincinnati one of those deep crossing routes our quarterbacks would look at the offensive line and go look guys we need about three three and a half seconds here for this to work but i promise you if you make that block well win that s exactly what happened here to block and lead the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> for kelly strong first down run to the 15yard line we found something they like right there too because that s the same exact play they scored the touchdown on remember the old line here back in the day the hogs of washington and a big offensive line this is the hogs circuit 2016 look at the size of these guys well vows a short guy at 63 but 315 325 really huge imposing <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> arm tackles but the hogs back to the day chris they seemed big back then look at this oh my goodness bostick was 245 it s blamable it would be a wideout today it s incredible the year has changed three decades later hard the 14 is kelly and you stop there the third down and four days that s that s what s different this place and the redskins were so good for so many years the joe gibbs era i think was about ten playoffs in his 16 seasons three different quarterbacks two and winning the superbowl but it s been a quarter century since theyve been to backtoback playoff so dan snyder you havent heard a lot from dan snyder joe theismann you see sitting back there theyre trying to build with bruce allen for the front office s the president scott the clone is the general manager trying to build this thing the right <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> and sustained some success division champs a year ago four <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> chased by <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> and brought down for the sack <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> on the board again this <person

position="OT">morgan moses</person> not feeling too well out here here s jackson going right across the field what s this one nobody nobody and for <person player="morgan moses" race="UNK" position="OT">morgan moses</person> he s trying to suck it up on the outside out there but he has been limping around all night <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person>

best the best in the world and those that say i cant cover them well let s put that to the test that s for me i enjoy that id get a kick out of that i get up for that and that is why i played this game was the fifth round pick with carolina allpro last year to pick money free agent signing for washington <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> has been a big positive for this redskins defense backers back to their own we give inside with cows key is breathing room to this object out to the nine yard line now no question now about <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> we saw carolina the other night and they look like a different team at least early in the year without him i think nobody was more stunned than <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> was he called everybody when he got word that they had basically rescinded the tag on him and he called the general manager he called a head coach he called the owner and said what is up that i had to pull the car off the side of the road did not want to go anywhere else but things started happening pretty fast from there who drops that and it s incomplete over to <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">norman</person> s side here you can place this side of the field and doesnt travel very often but he s done a really good job for washington as the seasons gone on there s one time <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> quickness got him though turned around <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> he is always has the heavy lifting no question about it when we bring somebody out there on him but bought a little attitude to this defense and a much needed element tom parkway starting lifeguards been replaced <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">jason</person> sprigs the rookies second round pick out of indiana is playing guard third and three up top it is jerry <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> across midfield that pushed out of

right <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> right off the bat going up against <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitner</person> just oneonone just too fast a better athlete and they get that three by one set going we see it all the time like gronkowski and jimmy graham and all those things and just believe in that if youre going to leave a safety or a linebacker on that fast tight in on that side were taking it every time 47 yards on the game to <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> ready go flips the field from packers ready go three yards print yet you have to go back to winter <person player="christine michael" race="UNK" position="RB">michael</person> finley was here to go to the last time if there was a steady difference making tight end of this green bay offense and in the pure west coast which they still run some of that s a huge part of the team well it s all a matchup game right and you want to leave safeties on the field to try and stop the run game so you put two tight ends in and sometimes you leave them in tight and you want to just go power football but then they have to leave safeties on the field and no defensive backs go fine let s split them out let s go one on one and take advantage drive it with the half of the packers were halfway through the quarter as retreats and foots went up top its pulled down by randall table at the 20yard line game 22 to first down i tell you this was a good move at halftime by mike mccarthy <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">jason</person> sprigs right here is one of the better pass blocking players in college football a season ago and he has given there a little more time to work it

that flick even into the wind it s just such a good pass to be throws yeah every once in a while you know you want to say all right high school quarterbacks dont watch this you know because he s a rare guy that can make those throws accurately and it almost doesnt matter you see them kind of hop away from the throw you know where he got that one right brett favre and you know getting your feet moving so that people dont come on in to your knees third name remember field goes down this <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> are the tough ones to make in the wind does that movement up truck which concern coming over they thought they saw movement from the packers well see what the officials say well start it s the new guy in there sprigs just not used to getting all these hard snap counts and well we saw how hard the washington redskins were working on that snap count they did not want to give <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> any of those free plays matter of fact they went so far as to say if you jump offsides dont jump back to try and get onside you go grab hair be brothers because otherwise he s gonna throw it in our end zone they got burned on one of those rodgers specials the free plays in the wildcard game in january turned into a touch guy drama <person player="geronimo allison" race="nonwhite" position="WR">allison</person> the rookie free agent at illinois one of the receivers in there for green bay on this 3015 incomplete would be fourth down and from here would be a 36yard field goal attempt michelle yeah in in the priests game <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> converted a 41 yarder in this direction as you said that s very very tough kicking in this direction he said he could go 45 to 46 he said the wind is coming in and then bouncing right back in your face in this direction is what makes it so difficult he said he s gonna try and hit it hard right down the middle he mishit gave ways let s get back okay down here the windy conditions a break shaken adam just missed it a little bit to the left talk about your good games next weekend in the premier league chelsea s top of the table of 28 points tottenham hasnt lost six wins six draws terrific game a london derby action chelsea had taught them some it s stanford great job for you 12:30 eastern on nbc on saturday redskins take over after the miss from the spot loomis 26 robert kelly still moving and he gains about three yards let s go back chris that missed field goal yeah just take it look up here on top of the goal post yet 14 miles an hour blowing right into the kicker and you could see <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> at the end of the kick he sort of did his hand the other <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> like i thought it was going to bring to the right and it broke the left but it was exactly what was happening to him in pregame he would kick kick after kick <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> ago left one would go right he said he s got to try and hit it hard down the middle see what happens that time worked against seven from the 29 deep drop <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> much therefore <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> by the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> didnt you ask for that in the first half like the golf pro tracer on the ball yeah and frankie deli jurassica for the truck come up with it bud third quarter well you got juice man i dont know what took him so <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> alda had it by the first quarter for sure how is our guy doing out there im gonna guess he s hit some pro tracer shots he probably on the golf course over the last couple of days one of the great golfers ive ever played with in terms of quality of play or the enjoyment into the round no time okay score differently it s third and five here for <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> got spread out with three receivers to the top skinner <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> the pass rush but nobody s open downfield good play by <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> he then he checked down and he got a first out terrific play <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person> not bad by <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> either and not bad by this offensive line now just watch the protection okay he s a little messy right nobody there but watch his protection he s standing in the pocket he s still alive move around a little bit that was great that was a great offensive play right there by the redskins you talk to <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> but he gives you that third down back roll my crowd has been quiet tonight the receiver from the 40 <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> on the foot middle of field deshawn jackson goes down at the 43 yard line to avoid the hit on that injured shoulder gain of 17 you know youve heard of make up cause that was a make up throw up if you get it to him well <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> knows up this draft class immediately it s like saying what s your name <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> who are the quarterbacks drafted before you buck griffin tannehill wheaton osweiler wilson and foals and then <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> was the eighth quarterback tank and taken with him overall pick number 102 he said this was the last week absolutely the last place he fought that he would be traveling fortythree rounded kelly runs to the right into the 40yard line eats it look they got robbed from chris with a third the last thing they need is somebody with my style of play that was gonna bring me in so he gets picked and he was crushed that they were quiet they didnt know what happened finally his older brother said hey <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk</person> just got picked in the nfl draft we need to celebrate this and it kind of got his mind going in the right direction he said there were eight quarterbacks that i felt like i was competing yes and he was hoping he would go somewhere in the middle at and he went eight of those eight and he was crushed and eventually it was his family that finally said hey come on player now stop it let s go have a party second and six that one in has he had twist to the round of the pass is incomplete so he was there was robert griffin the third and of course griffin golf to the unbelievable start with mike schadt as the coach in that first year but remember <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> came in and saved a key game and then won a game against baltimore and cleveland respectively cleveland was the start then he had to start three games their second season that has griffin at the injury problems and the struggles <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> started more and then 2015 jay gruden says look we gotta give the job to robert or have it to <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk</person> to start here and stop this going back and forth and <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> took it last year he started the times but closed very strong winning the last four games and cemented himself as the starter here packers wanted to flag some movement on the redskins but theyre gonna get to delay a game flag delay of game offense number eight fiveyard penalty third down that was a good job by the green bay packers when they were jumping around i think it distracted <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> and he lost track of the clock see if anybody moved they felt like there was some movement out of those two guys clock ran out because they never did call any of that j s thrilled about it lucky if you ever seen a gruden unhappy in my life now it s third no less second 11 now at the 44 bhavana patter for <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> down the field it is for the touchdown jameson <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> 44 yards we talked about those split safeties and going after the middle of the field that time got a wide receiver down straight down the pike right here youre going to get a safety on either side of them just taking advantage of that speed against but a it <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> has made some nice reads tonight that was not an easy presnap read to know that was going to be a split safety look he saw one safety move out there assume the other and got him on the outside just enough theyre out of <person player="morgan moses" race="UNK" position="OT">morgan moses</person> to make the play and then i think my star of the night so far high in seki on the other side against <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> of 12 going to go for two remember michelle tosi and 1/2 times 8 newton didnt want to go for the extra point kicking into the wind at the back end of the first half but here trying to make up for the math and get it to a 14point lead it s keeping spinning or committees kept the play alive there s nothing to get there he s able to run the zone read for the touchdown go ahead touchdown in detroit a few weeks ago they only lost the last seven games couldnt get it to work their 44 yards on third and 11 <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> to <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> washington up a dozen there s wednesday bring your appetite it s a feast of comedy the snl thanksgiving special this wednesday 9:00 eastern and pacific 8:00 central only on nbc great <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> to get ready to welcome everyone s here homes as everyone travels to be with families that terrific weekend of family food friends i think you guys welcomed me into the family i know youre a friend thursday i know we both like food too it s just the second packer drive of this third quarter first of all nine plays and 80 yards to start their own two took it down to the 18 yard line again the wind has been the story as weve gone through the night with the wind success against the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> they have moved to begin that s two quarters worth against the wind a lot of it on that last drive and they have not scored points chris do you think the deep shot that jay gruden and his offensive coordinator shaun mcbain went for on that third down was because it might be their last play with the win no question basically told michelle exactly that two different game plans 25 draw bujji starts pumpkin with a tackle after date of about four war the running backs it s interesting for me watching this <person player="trent murphy" race="white" position="DE">trent murphy</person> out there for washington redskins there s a guy that was asked to put on weight put on about thirty pounds to play inside then all of a sudden junior galette got hurt hurt his achilles they said two days before camp lose thirty pounds and go back to your home possession starts another carry heater pick up your child first down murphy made the tackle and this third year man a stanford s done a good job seven sacks of his time for the team lead coming into tonight <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> s got one more so he s second on the team for the moment yeah and that s not even talking about <person player="preston smith" race="UNK" position="DE">preston smith</person> the other guy so they had coming into this game tonight 17 and a half sacks up there 25 i think it was but they were able to come up with pressure from the outside so far we see <person player="ryan kerrigan" race="white" position="DE">kerrigan</person> applying some pressure but a pretty good battle between these two good tackles on the outside for green bay in terms of punching into the wind this will be an important first hand of green bay to pick up get rid of the end of the quarter rodgers retreats puts it up top for club and he s able to bring it in inside the 40 to the 38 yard line working on dookie a nacho that time he beat both safeties in this quarter for deep passages if you see how early <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> put that ball up i mean it is probably about right here suppose he just floated it <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> up in the air like one of those hail marys is and as soon as court turned around it just hit him right in the chest what a play 29 on that one dante <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitner</person> for one earlier if this happen whose sales aint good week to bunt a adam <person player="preston smith" race="UNK" position="DE">smith</person> the coverage wasnt very open well that seconds left that was a big mess you dont see <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> miss like that very often they had a little inside fade going there and there was a big gap the wind got that one or not but that one wasnt close a lot of conversation about starting early leadership on this team urgency of the players and a lot of it pointed back to mike mccarthy and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> during the week they try to manage the message on the exterior and both implied to us that on the inside everything was fine with this green bay team that will be a cutlass or the first down as we get to the end of the third quarter is gonna be an important quarter here for the packers theyre down a dozen try to avoid a fourgame losing streak washington by 12 sunday night football continues after these messages tonight skycam cover brought to you by geico awful go to the fourth quarter here fedex field landover maryland just outside of washington dc leichter it going for al michaels with cris collinsworth michele tafoya entire sunday night team green bay packers sitting at 4 and 5 they opened the season three in one lost for their last five and their only one was that thursday night over the last place chicago bears awesome atlanta home to the colts and the loss to tennessee basically doesnt point deficit but working with the wind here as we begin the fourth quarter in <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> is the bag is the much back there seven carries 19 yards to endles get it why open there s nobody there it starts to walk in for the touchdown a bust by the redskins and the packers start the fourth quarter with a 31yard school complete confusion that time on the part of the redskins you could see out here they were just pointing and just didnt quite have it all figured out and then play fake and nobody around <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> i mean that is just the gift of all gifts topton trying to get the front figure down and figured out extra point added by <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> and it s 22:17 the packers needed that energy boost right back in 30 seconds after the easiest rodgers touch got a pass hell ever have you see confusion and coverages but you rarely see something that s this blatant legend starts <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> touchdown giving a direction to the outside and then it was confusing see him pointing out there to them and so they both end up chasing one of those guys and just simply nobody covered <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> it starts it s his second receiving touchdown as has been the story all night most of the points being scored with the wind now washington s gonna have to find ways to sustain offense going into the win in this fourth quarter pras be brought down by cahide to hold the chance of <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> to catch that the washington will start back 25yard line well here s the play that s setup everything youre gonna see right out here <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is gonna watch when he throws this ball there s the throw and now watch how far youre gonna see <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> run balls in the air about another 10 yards before he makes the break and still makes the catch and then this one s a little easier <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james</person> carson not very often on the football field you turn around go well look here who s their penalty everybody stop fivepoint game nothing new to washington almost all their games this year been tight as complete to <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">pierre</person> garçon gain of five for an end there in frigid again the two teams ahead of each of these teams in their respective divisions one today detroit beat jacksonville minnesota getting the victory over atlanta over arizona i should say so green bay trying to win to stay within the game dallas of the giants both winning as well <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> takes the deep shot downfield into the wind homerun ball seventy yards the dreaded borders coverage again once this tight end goes up the field that s a one on one route to the outside everybody in the league does the same thing they run that post route and these cornerback injuries are currently killing the green bay packers if you had to say how does this team with all this talent lose four in a row they have just run out of bodies at a key position darrius dr pete <person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">dustin hopkins</person> to the extra point he s able to power that through <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> goes over 300 yards with that touchdown the most three hundred yard games in washington history 16 of them beautiful striking to the wind 70 yards to <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> washington back on top by a dozen bc s

earlier but there were 11 missed extra points most on one day in nfl history back to the future in dallas the cowboys are now 9 and 1 3 more touchdown passes for dak prescott we had two nd for thanksgiving but today peyton manning got to say i love you man as they honor the super bowl 41 chance the michelle means a louisville do the whole doctor stuff in the lab coach yes im doing the means multitalented the packers table a game momentum taken away by just a moment ago starts blossom to the hand of <person player="trent murphy" race="white" position="DE">trent murphy</person> one of the defenders to make the tackle and i know weve hit on it a little bit and there s play <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">matthews</person> over there trying to i think he s playing at about three quarters here tonight when you say i mean i know he s got the problems with the hamstrings and he s had a rough go of it but you just get the feeling that this washington team not just on the offensive side but on the defensive side is gaining away independence issue the 16 rogers murphy rosen complete throw it back to jared s book <person player="will compton" race="white" position="LB">compton</person> having coverage third down coming up and in fairness you know i admire so many things about <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> we have seen more than a couple of these this year you know where there have been guys wide open and you know i mean he s been chased around and harassed there s no <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> i could make the throw but you know just misses just misses feel like you try to carry the whole team make up for all the deficiencies until you ask a great player to do sometimes too much 30:12 washington gonna bring the blitz it s the first foot brakes now now ive been to washington territory inside the 40 hell go down at the 38 yard line dontae <person player="donte whitner" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitner</person> missed the tackle just an unbelievable individual play when you have to have it you backed up third and 13 make one man miss make two men miss and then youre off to the races just every once in a while somebody has to be better than what he actually is ive heard that face before just be better occasionally than what you actually are and that time <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> was running 47 for <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> on that one azana move gonna take off here and get all the slide right there nobody touch them you can youre right chris but theyre gonna mark them down he s the little negotiation there with <person player="john sullivan" race="white" position="C">john</person> hussey well let me just tell you something that guy s a smart guy and that thing is now firmly implanted i guarantee you the next time that he runs and slides headfirst he s going to pop right up but he might score a touchdown defensive players are so trained to not touch the quarterback theyre just you know theyre afraid to get a penalty i think youre just as smart as he was thinking exactly that on that play get up just like the last one get it on the first gap first down starts hell get the first down here to the 20 yard lines of green bay responding to the quick hit from washington great job there by <person player="jason spriggs" race="white" position="OT">jason</person> sprigs who s taking over for <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">barclay</person> a guard watch this he s kind of stumbling coming around here gathers his feet just enough to make that block right there on <person player="will compton" race="white" position="LB">will compton</person> and spring <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> thing with crosstraining he uses those linemen all over this guy was a tackle for most of his college games in indiana the guard position calling for that movement for the 48th overall pick to last year he starts again and get six out of it good first down pickups now this is a green bay team that had not run it very much had not run it very well and they havent really tonight their leading rusher again is <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> three carries 33 yards but well short passing game with <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> has given them essentially what the run game yeah but just remember and i know were about to wear you out with this wind thing but you know 29 17 im not betting hard against the green bay packers because theyve been moving pretty efficiently going this direction it s pusher than it looks right in we have his hands the tightend <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> inside the ted jerry <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> gets to the six yard line first in gold green bed that s the newest version of the green bay packers sweep vince lombardi you saw him earlier and he had his own version block block and here we go just dump it <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> quickly as they can you can see those receivers out there they have no thoughts whatsoever that theyre gonna catch a pass boy that s <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> down adds a that s a biggie wont seize along starter up front on this washington defense does it 3ds at night oh my goodness has he ever let s take a look at <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> and what he s done tonight working inside work it against <person player="don barclay" race="UNK" position="OG">don barclay</person> came up with a sack early on is really effective with that push right up the middle with the bullrushes and then you see some of the speed and quickness against the run it s not close he is their best defensive lineman up front those first two years at penn state fish s college ball hampton your five in the league would not be surprised here if mccarthy comes back and says let s check out the middle in there without <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris baker</person> into play 47 yarder <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> getting green bay down look at those big plays and cop the last couple years so so many of the early in his career into this first and goal rogers gets prichard comes in inside took but who holds on to the touchdown gets his first touchdown as a packer first let s take a look make sure this is a clean catch look at that release there s nobody can do the things he can do with that does he hold on has to go all the <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> to the ground not let it bobble clean catch and what a difference <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jared cook</person> is making in this offense that is a former corner out there not just any safety will black man who is a really good cover guy for a safety and even he didnt really have a chance one try <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> banks it through you like in this game four consecutive drives ending in touchdowns <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> made a man miss got a big play led to the <person player="jared cook" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cook</person> touchdown just by and we hope youll join us to wrap up your thanksgiving special edition of sunday night football on thanksgiving big ben and the steelers andrew luck and the coats both getting division wins today and an important game for their playoff hopes in the afc steelers colts will be in indianapolis for thanksgiving 8:00 eastern time the coverage begins right here on nbc and to lucky and the colts getting off to the hot start looks like tennessee the tv beat today district green bay last week was 21 nothing colts they had to hang on through the fourth quarter to get that win at home michelle just showed you they honored the championship team peyton manning and his former teammates rockman <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hyde</person> comes back down again to hold for <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> picked off by <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person> and this 210 karen swift but good pursuit and fat bro make the tackle for green bay just shy of 20 yard line on a good quarterback night here in dc better than that both of them have over 300 yards passing already tonight both have three touchdowns and no interceptions and there have just been laser with tracers all night <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> in this one baby one of the most impressive right here getting the point of that ball to turn over throwing like that into the wind look how the point came down that s the only <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> you can make a throw that far into this kind of wind perfectly thrown perfect spiral just a showcase tonight for these two quarterbacks ive missed out the 19 and <person player="rob kelley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rob</person> kelly goes nowhere knockdown for lust before by <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake martinez</person> both quarterbacks over 300 yards no interceptions three touchdowns rodgers ratings right around 115 <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> rating 147 right now so considering the wind and all the other stuff going on terrific performance here tonight and it s not the first time either <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> has had on deep balls this year five touchdowns just one interception and he continues to light it up and show that strong arm washington behind the sticks a little bit second and 14 pass to <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> is caught but make it third and manageable as jackson brings you then for the third time to them where these corners have seen enough balls fly over their head i think dom capers went over to the sideline and say listen guys just keep it in front of you youve got <person player="quinten rollins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">quinten rollins</person> who s a young player out there gunther who s a young player out there you have three safeties in the middle of the field you have dom capers trying to make it up and bandage it all together 33 washington is school on every drive this half pleasant press it aint complete the contact will draw the flag i dont think that was going to be complete lake <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">martinez</person> with the contact but there s a second flag backed by the quarterback no three flags on the field right down to different areas of the field there are two felts on the play one by each team holding number 79 of the offense pass interference on the defense those penalties will offset third down and checking the starting left tackle called for the hold interesting right out here let s take a look maybe grabbed him and pulled him down i suppose that s what they saw and then early contact there by <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake martinez</person> so let s try it again on the outside one more time to sean jackson is to the ground held out to by jackson for a big first down for washington with a 35 to go have to take advantage if these corners are gonna play that far off it s a freebie let s make sure he makes this catch elbow on the ground as <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> as it didnt bobble where we couldnt see it first down redskins little shuffle there wasnt it the decision to mike mccarthy has a tough decision to make clear and obvious that ball moved will they tell him from upstairs challenger no challenge flag out to live with it for killing with the run to the 38 yard line okay theyre doing a nice job out there let s just jump cut here by robert kelly the two yards into four yards but there s another kind of developing story for me here tonight a new <person player="vernon davis" race="nonwhite" position="TE">vernon davis</person> was a good blocking tight in right locks on about 50% of his place but <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> has done a pretty good job blocking this evening and theyre using him more pulling around you know this two tight end combination a little different than what you saw in new england but still very effective for the redskins read on the sideline with making sure everybody sees that play play we urgently hear dont get a delay of game while taking a fork kelly again a loss of yardage on the carry and it becomes a game so itll be 32 instead dont forget that inside the leading tackler <person player="jake ryan" race="white" position="LB">jake ryan</person> is out of this game injured with a bad ankle and so they have what is generally considered their nickel linebacker <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> in there so the redskins do have some opportunities with that big bunch in front just try and go right at him some the <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> 48 that is the <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">joe thomas</person> whose dad at age 55 got in the game to south carolina state and college

of the play itll bring up fourth down in the yard and washington s probably gonna have to kick it away here with six and a half to go nice play inside by <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> right up here watch him come swing inside and just clog up that middle <person player="lane taylor" race="white" position="OG">lane</person> where they thought they were going to have something nicely done by the veteran <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> was in there im gonna make that tackle and then as the pushing was going before they blew the play dead harry went down at the back end of that and he s the packer who s getting medical attention right now okay clean up a couple of things <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> walked off mostly under his own power his ankle was trapped under the big pile of bodies they came out and measured their a foot

position="OT">shawn</person> laval got pushed back by latroy guy on and guy on kind of ran right by <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> but it was that little twist that got <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> skinny enough to get through there and then laval came in and helped push him across the line he also keeps his body up so no body part hit the ground as he was going as when they teach the running backs it gets skinny get big to get through a hole it s not the definition of it but man i tell you got big on that one was jay gruden i know you play to win the game i remember her taught us all that but that was gutsy stuff right there and <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> who s done everything right tonight why not keep the ball in his hands it s the first down daniel snyder up and watching just helping everybody along it s the first dow jones minh right there behind them in the box to our right the redskins trying to go to the playoff second year in a row right what the heck man let s let s give it a shot you can almost he s a funny guy anyway i know you know it s brett well worked with him forever but he s entertaining he could always hear and say what the heck let s go read tight end look they ran effectively in the first half with this kelly with the run to the left going at 2 or 3 yards a jaybird very competitive guy he was a quarterback in his day championship quarterback in arena football set records in louisville we were timeouts here ticket with the injury to <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">blake martinez</person> who s down for green bay boy that s a problem now theyre out of linebackers they might have to move <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> back inside now that s the story of their season defensive injuries timeout it flexed into this game next sunday night you know look at two seven and three teams the chiefs and the broncos in denver on sunday night football the raiders will try to maintain the lead though as they play <person player="houston bates" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> in mexico city tomorrow night kansas city endeavor pulling to the texans maybe get that thing tied three ways at the division lead on the line when they meet sunday night football starting at 7:00 eastern reaching tonight on nbc <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> back in lake <person player="blake martinez" race="white" position="LB">martinez</person> limped off with the help of the athletic trainers call dragged through just crawled up off the practice webbing keys packer debut tonight zombie nearly intercepted by <person player="carl bradford" race="UNK" position="LB">bradford</person> it was intended for <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> who was battling with <person player="ladarius gunter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ladarius gunter</person> if <person player="carl bradford" race="UNK" position="LB">bradford</person> had his hand on it for just a brief moment it was almost the same exact angle which we saw <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> missed a throw <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> inside look how far inside that ball was lucky to get away with that one that would have been something huh <person player="carl bradford" race="UNK" position="LB">bradford</person> come into game this is a big play pick up the fourth down there that pays 3rd and 7 and a blitz coming from the packers it s picked up cousin shot downfield it is caught by <person player="trevor davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">trevor</person> brother inside the 10 to the end zone and he s down just shy the goal line at the 1 let s beat her with jameson <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> first and goal washington first of all let s say how did this thing get off got a blitz coming right here they told me that <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person> was a great blitz pickup guy he certainly was and then here we go youve got one of the quicker wide receivers on his team running against a linebacker unfair 53 yards on the gain for <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> who takes it over a hundred receiving yards here on the night at the back end of that <person player="kentrell brice" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kentrell</person> bryce who goes down and he is receiving medical attention for the packers staff so theyre putting that on the half yard line but did he ever actually go to the ground take a peek of that and break meantime they look at bryce what a night passing for <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> 375 yards and three touchdowns just took a peek of his jameson <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> play he did come down a bit on bryce which is one of the reasons bryce got hurt but you could see his bottom hits before the goal line so the ball was correctly marked at the one that s first to go for washington there chris how impressed are you watching the arm strength of <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> to them you know it s the tightness of those spirals throwing into the wind that s making the tip of that ball turn over and he s able to get that at a distance it doesnt seem to have been much of a factor for him flowing into the wind which is amazing the packers scored all their points he s been climbed up as a fullback next on the left and gets in for the touchdown his second of the night and washington able to get an 81 yard drive into the wind to extend the lead to double digits again there we go let s make sure he crosses the plane remember any part of the ball crosses anything on that white line and that one s pretty easy there s big <person player="houston bates" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> baits and theyre leading away and it s once again as it s been many times the night <person player="vernon davis" race="nonwhite" position="TE">vernon davis</person> maybe not the big night catching the ball that <person player="jordan reed" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jordan reed</person> has had but he has had a real impact on this running game we talked about rogers with <person player="mack brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mack</person> his office trying to get going with the spate of injuries to green bay it s so difficult to deal with his <person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">hopkins</person> gets that one off the upright and no good as it was that wind is affected exactly i mean now youre sort of touched down an extra point twopoint conversion and a field goal right hey you dont need the two touchdowns down to the 11 point game the extra point on the first one you can see the movement and remember earlier we saw one going that <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> from <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> that hooked left and that one move right with the wind and that makes it 12 extra points that have been missed in the nfl today and you go to the year when the rec when the rule was changed to 2014 for the entirety of the season eight extra points were missed weve had 12 just in one week here one day really nothing was missed that thursday night are you guys had with carolina and new orleans here were the misses at it this is like a jim cantore just follow the weather although detroit minnesota you cant blame the weather but certainly in new york city cleveland weather was a factor was raining on the west coast in san francisco games stephen gostkowski missed an extra point it s like they moved the threepoint line back you know every now you can tell it s having an impact on these guys still plenty of time though for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> going this <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> with the wind theyve been explosive because we returned by <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> first contact to keep inside in the 20yard line that you write prison is <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> weve seen him do this magic plenty of time 347 left three timeouts but you can only do so much it s another game where theyve given up over 30 points all these injuries theyve given up a hundred and forty seven points rent on forty six hundred forty six points in the last four games they just going uphill you cannot do this as an offense and expect to be a winning team unless theyre keeping the ball away from <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> as theyre doing that but plenty of time here i mean obviously now big difference when you could settle for a field goal if you had to first you have to get across midfield 17 rogers retreat the pocket longus throwing there s a <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> in the vicinity tacklebox been complete <person player="preston smith" race="UNK" position="DE">preston smith</person> with the pressure so were talking about 146 points allowed last full games most of the fourgame span since 1958 we showed you the back earlier the pre lombardi days as the year before lombardi arrives and changed the fortunes of the packers first look not okay crossing his <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> in the 35 chase down the job i adam say him house almost turned it upfield he s in washington territory very quickly at the 46yard button well that was strictly a product of all the time that this offensive line gave you can see a little confusion on the outside <person player="kendall fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kendall fuller</person> tried to call a timeout but that took a <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> time for <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> get in there boy it s fun to watch <person player="davante adams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">davante adams</person> play with a healthy ankle never really looked himself last year 37 obligate <person player="sua cravens" race="nonwhite" position="LB">sua cravens</person> was slow to get up for washington that s why the game stopped for the moment he athletic training staff came to get him to be evaluated on the sidelines well you just have to go back to that decision by jay gruden to go for it exactly you know you could just see it s going to be difficult for his defense to ever stop <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> going this <person player="tress way" race="white" position="P">way</person> and im sure that s exactly why he did it with the three timeouts ideally youd like to get any sort of a score before the twominute warning leaves you some options that first score <person player="ty montgomery" race="nonwhite" position="RB">montgomery</person> on the screen he gently waited for the block run down as he gets around the 40yard lot <person player="preston smith" race="UNK" position="DE">preston smith</person> chased it down and threw him down gooden retracing of his steps by <person player="preston smith" race="UNK" position="DE">smith</person> lock turns pretend to go whered he go with lots of football washington has it recovered by <person player="will compton" race="white" position="LB">will compton</person> they look promising for cookie turns it upfield the game s first turn over it wont be the crushing blow to play by <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> watch this one it s a right hook from <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> that gets this thing out of there look how happy he is he just paid dividends on that 75 million watch this right hook from <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">norman</person> bang brain is heaven you got it peter tillman is exactly he s the guy that started doing it they were teammates west here in carolina wow didnt even really go for the tackle saw his opportunity got it out tremendous play the game s first turnover with 259 left but spell the end of the night could spell form straight losses for geordie mounts for the packers trying to stop washing you trying to get the ball out from robert kelly carries for a couple of yards to the 30 yard look right there muhammad ali just doctor down the impact for <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">norman</person> on this team and on the field tonight offensively <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> 375 tremendous quarterback rating to the <person player="max mccaffrey" race="white" position="WR">max</person> is 156 point 3 he s right under 146 right now <person player="jamison crowder" race="UNK" position="WR">crowder</person> and <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> each over 100 yards two of the three touchdowns thrown by <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person> and a half a yard away from that fourth touchdown pass in there but what a play though like <person player="josh norman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh norman</person> hey joe barry their defensive coordinator was saying that after he signed that 75 million dollar contract he went in and sort of hesitantly said when are we going to see you again he said when does ota start at monday morning 8 oclock ill be there never missed one the entire time set the standard from that day one for that entire defense with a tarot robert kelly he filled inside the 20 stays on his feet to the full yard love 66 yards longest run of his rookie season you just have to feel a little bit not only are they hurting in the secondary but they are down to their third and fourth team line comes up with a big block to redskins they are starting to feel it arent they i mean this is i know that green bay packers are struggling and but this is a huge win for this organization hey you know chris it s one maelys has to have because of the stretch minnesota here and other vikings are struggling on offense but their defense is still formidable it s a short week a tight turnaround from sunday night to on the road at dallas were not great the cowboys are this year and the history and legacy in that rivalry this is one you almost had it get to give yourself a chance and know when rodgers is coming in here throwing the ball all over the park 355 and three touchdowns he s went to them he s going to get the payoff with another rushing touchdown counting flag on the play think kelly s third rushing touchdown of the night will stand up no story this guy is too cool oh i love it i met this guy right here to their center <person player="spencer long" race="white" position="OG">spencer long</person> here s a guy that kind of thought maybe he might end up in medical school dad s a surgeon and brothers a surge or wanting to be a doctor he wants to be a doctor but right now i think he s carving up on the kickoff touchdown at day tone jones after the plate he shows right behind the camera here after the score right there oh and that with the foot got in secchia on the helmet stepped on them prepare well follow with a monopoly guys 4224 washington 226 to go and the cupboard was bare you just have to say that about the defense of the green bay packers say there s just there s just nothing left i mean you cant lose your top two quarterbacks your top two linebackers have played bath use basically playing on a lovely and sonny jurgensen up in the radio booth we were talking it s been a few years since youve been here for a redskins game ive seen a lot of them over the last couple years one of the first things you ask do they still have their band now this thing too but one of the few nfl teams weve seen a lot of shots taken in that booth over the years of a downcast dan schneider now popping his head to jump around the other job where we have the shot of the year kickoff will come from midfield after the 15yard penalty washington will do step 2 six three and one it s a half game behind the giants until guy who used to play for the reds gets mark murphy who was in the role of president ceo of the packers he ted <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> mike mccarthy <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> not going to be the greatest thanksgiving week in green bay as the packers try to pick up the pieces find some bodies to play and get ready to go to philadelphia to play the eagles on monday night well it s gonna be difficult for anybody to try and pin this one on <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> he was fantastic out there this offense did their job they scored at least 25 and all of their prior three losses sitting there at 24 they had simply run out of bodies on defense ive seen it happen in the nfl a few times when you get pounded at one position you just cant overcome it there arent any bodies out on the street the quarterback comes in for rogers to finish this off second to your man out of ucla they took him in the fifth round last year finally got in the game last week a four snaps against the titans left ucla with their touchdown passing records 75 he was the number three quarterback to scott towles een last year and theyll let it run twominute warning 4224 washington on its <person
