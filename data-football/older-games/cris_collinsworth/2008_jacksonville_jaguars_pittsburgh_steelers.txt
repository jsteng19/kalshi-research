best receivers theyve beaten them four straight times they beat them twice last week looting in the playoffs what has been the formula and what will the formula be tonight well i think because of those four games they come in here with a lot of confidence if they know that they can beat this team and they just play jack del rio football then theyre a real tough team and theyre going to run the ball and theyre gonna throw short quick passes those kinds of things and it s gonna be a little tough perform because theyve lost their center and both guards so the the interior of the offensive line of the jaguars is good trying to open holes for <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> and <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite"

valley <person player="joe zelenka" race="UNK" position="TE">joe</person> <person player="darnell stapleton" race="UNK" position="OG">stapleton</person> rutgers university across the university and a lot of eyes tonight will be placed on number 70 teeth <person player="darnell stapleton" race="UNK" position="OG">darnell stapleton</person> who makes his first start second year out of rutgers at white guard first and 10 the ball is at the 17yard wand and walk less berger will hand the ball off from a welding more and more well have a first down on his first carry and a lot more gain of 18 yards before <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> the left corner knocks him down and there s a flag on the play ron winter is the referee and a flag on the first offensive play hitting we know that though that the pittsburgh steelers were going to run the ball personal foul unnecessary roughness number 95 defense and a first down they are the pittsburgh steeler it s great everything that s the steelers if theyve done no but you mentioned franco harris the students have been a running team ever since franco harris and you see here they go to tight ends they get a pretty good lead theyre the welding more starts to the left sees a soft spot over on the right and he hits it perfectly and a penalty was on land e5 <person player="paul spicer" race="UNK" position="DE">paul spicer</person> with a personal foul and the steelers already have crossed the 50 yard line have it at the jacksonville 49 after one play by the way for the record miss berg did win the toss teams have been deferring about 50% of the time was here but tomlin won the toss and elected to receive <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> a threestep job lord and jeans will take him down but not till ward picks up a first down so they go right to work on the cornerback james taking the place of <person player="drayton florence" race="nonwhite" position="DB">drayton florence</person> in pittsburgh as you can see only two touchdowns in the last 38 drives that was one of the things that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> talked about last night he really hadnt thrown much all week and this was going to be the first time he was thrown so he wanted to start off with the shorter quicker too variety a pittsburgh doesnt do a lot of threestep rock that was the 3step drop since i then said feste burg employs a two or more tight end set more than any team in the league almost half the time 47% and over the middle the pass is incomplete he tried to get it to that number two tight end that s matt spate at six seven and <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> the safety provides the coverage second down at ten for the steelers you know so many more teams are doing that is playing with two tight ends and then having one of those tight ends that can be a move guy and in addition be the fullback so they dont have a fullback anymore and that s what the steelers are doing here theyll theyll have the tight end up on the lions by then but theyll also have him as a fullback and a lead blocker speaking of their fullback that would be carrie davis normally and he s another guy who is hurt <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> that s the second key fit but he does get in the way and thatll theyre going to say the play is over the play is over in the backfield because ron winter is going to say he was in the grasp and down he went and <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> number 98 will get credit for the sack the guy you have to get blocked on this jaguar line is <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> the big defensive tackle and you see he gets the penetration right there not only the penetration but he s the guy that gets the sack he takes big bend down good go right right right the knee was down ron winner the referee blew the whistle 18 they have to get to the 26 yard line the balls at the 44 here comes the blitz <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> steps a minute there s an interception of the 28 yard line roisin memphis who had two picks of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> last year in the playoff game and blocking go away for the touchdown roisin malthus always has big games against the pittsburgh steelers to see malthus is here he s playing off keep reading reading reading that s just a bad throw san antonio <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> is doing a hook he doesnt even look the ball goes over his head right to malthus <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> has no idea where the ball is that was a pretty good pass person who said they came out of blitz put the pressure on him made him throw again stole be for the point anchor malthus in his career now has picked off <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> three times in the regular season twice in the playoffs a 72 yard and just like that the jags lead seven to nothing sunday night football being brought to you by southwest airlines low fares no hidden fees by sprint get nfl mobile live only on the now network by nissan inviting you to shift the way you move through the world and by bud light the difference is drinkability look at that current speed it up about 30 times sage everyone that s right seven to nothing jacksonville after the interception returned bilby to kick off history to get the ball again is bagging for fields this man from the tree and his second back of the night itd be a little more successful in his first as he escapes a couple of wouldbe tacklers and picks it up to the 29 yard line and scobie along with <person player="brian witherspoon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">witherspoon</person> converge on the tackle dear is <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> in october of all five in their regular season game picking off wampus burger he does it again in o six and then he did it twice in the playoff game last january that wild one that the jaguars one and here is the last one for roisin who was born in georgia but grew up here in jacksonville and took a few bookman witches in daytona beach so he s a florida kid and he does it in front of the home folks tonight you think somewhere <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> would learn a lesson but stay away from that guy from the 29 yard line on first down that is war going nowhere let s take a look at the jags defense <person player="derek landri" race="white" position="DT">derek</person> <person player="derrick harvey" race="nonwhite" position="DE">harvey</person> florida rothmeyer washington state <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> tennessee <person player="paul spicer" race="UNK" position="DE">paul spicer</person> northwest high school planning university oklahoma mike beach at the universal floor darrell smith <person player="jordan black" race="white" position="OT">jordan</person> take christine <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> but dont cook in college <person player="gerald sensabaugh" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gerald sensabaugh</person> ava s been a high school <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> north carolina state dean james missy sensible taking the spots of it to injured secondary guys <person player="reggie nelson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nelson</person> and <person player="drayton florence" race="nonwhite" position="DB">florence</person> his ward coming across the formation and setting up on the left side on a wing <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> in phase a little short intended from that space and that s sensible covering on the play itll be third down and ten for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> remember he suffered the separated ac joint opening day then he had a sore hand going into the monday night game he s a guy you know who plays through a lot of pain but <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> he didnt practice very much this week and the thing that he s gonna have the problem with his velocity you know you can fight through pain laughs but can he get enough velocity on the ball because then you have those shoulder and hand injuries you lose strength three wide against the nickel on third down pan and then steps up into pressure and he lines up it in <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> who gets dropped by pearson three low up at the 45 yard line so a big first down on the third and long <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">quentin groves</person> came in in that time hit <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> as he released 16 yard game now you watch the jaguar defense here and you can see that theyre going to bring the blitz they do a pretty good job of picking it up but then had to take a hit he had to stand in there he s a tough guy and watch how he stands in there rose that ball does get some velocity on it but to do that he had to take that hit and there number 2 draft choice <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">quentin</person> grows out of auburn olympic <person player="derek landri" race="white" position="DT">derek</person> <person player="derrick harvey" race="nonwhite" position="DE">harvey</person> at a florida looking for his first sarah hello they across the line of scrimmage we stopped up at the 46 yard line genes games up to make the tackle be second down and nine that s that ball handling where they it s either gonna be a slant or a draw <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> comes up fakes the slant out to his left and then hands the draw from the walden war so here i was talking about the tight end now they use a tight end as a fullback have him in the backfield then they could move him up as a tight end which they just did they usually two tight ends or a two back wall second down ward s lot right there s more than is about a yard short of the first down gets taken down by <person player="mike peterson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mike peterson</person> the ex colt the middle linebacker setting up a third down and one at the jacksonville 46 yard line now you have to have it tight in right here make a block to set the edge to get that guy knocked off the line of scrimmage to give you a soft corner now once you get that end man knocked off the line of scrimmage you will have almost automatically a five yard game more with a couple of keys overtime last week who set up the win on monday night against <person player="greg warren" race="white" position="C">warren</person> <person player="greg warren" race="white" position="C">warren</person> in court in the backfield as the stroll back here and theyre going to give it to him and for a first down to the 42 yard line son i j <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> has had a lot of success through his career with pittsburgh and before that green bay on third and fourth and short comes in and makes his first carry of the season that emergency kinda came quickly didnt it andrea was saying the deal be an emergency short yardage back here he is on the first one now you know when <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> is out there he s a wide receiver who plays wide receiver like in those tackle or a linebacker there s always going to be physical contact and that s about 15 yards away from the ball sure and the side judge came in he could have thrown a flag but a would have an offsetting ball at the 43 time first time fake for more that buys time for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the state s attacker picks up a first down to the 31yard line breaking away from <person player="gerald sensabaugh" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gerald</person> sensible and moving the chains with a 40 to go in the period been likes to do that bootleg one way you know you you fake to the back going the right bootleg to the left and then throw back to the right say rough number 22 defense 15yard penalty first down that s <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> and that s the second 15 yard or the other was on <person player="paul spicer" race="UNK" position="DE">spicer</person> on the first drive let s as you see hell fake two more right here bootleg out to his left turn his hips and then throw it back to me well dewar <person player="mewelde moore" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moore</person> who he had just faked and here comes the personal foul james will come in there a little late and a <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> well james knows that <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> is always looking for him so whenever he can he s going to be war king said lay off from a man madness into causton 15ton the 15yard line sorry <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> so andrea talked about <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> we started the season on the active list even though he was inactive for the first two games then they put him on the practice squad and now with <person player="willie parker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">parker</person> out the willie is expected to play after the bye week next week and with <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> gone for the season you see <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> so already three steelers have carried the ball tonight as you look at <person player="willie parker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willie parker</person> that s what mike tomlin who s starting about last night you know you just have to plug guys in you said whatever happens with to continue playing and dont want <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> stays in he has to check with walk this burger for the call again as he came up to the line second down and six at the halfway mark of the quarter and they give it to <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> on <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> a bounce off the middle of the line the team hit to the outside is <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> clogged it up and that s six seven and 335 pounds of plugging and that s that s a real good six seven 335 pounds of player 2 i mean <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> is a heck of a player he hasnt been getting the the pass rush this year i mean he s been playing the run well and they said that they need a bigger pass rush from him this has been bugging to jack del rio the other they have problems with their patchwork problems with their third down defense and problems with their red zone defense they have all three going right now 37 for wide out of the shotgun here <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> time over the middle that s going to be a first down keith miller the tight end makes the catch stop by <person player="mike peterson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mike peterson</person> over the middle of the three yard line first and goal of coming hell have <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> being beaten up they have to have good pass protection you know that offensive line knows that they give them perfect protection and <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> just works the middle and knows where the first down marker is but this is what they have to do for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> tonight i mean they know their quarterbacks beaten up and they cant let him take a lot of hits jaguars at the secondworst red zone defense in the league this year 12th floor raised into their red but stands to the opponents this one tries to make it ten and there a yard signs <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">gary russell</person> pounds the ball to the oneyard line so we have already played over nine minutes in the jacksonville jaguars have yet to run an offensive play but they still have the lead seven nothing thanks thanks to <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> interception return del rio s defense tries to stiffen here on second and goal pittsburgh likes to do is they will power everywhere i mean theyll put up you know you know two or three tight ends theyll put any extra tackle like <person player="max starks" race="nonwhite" position="OT">max</person> parts partner started they have over here extra blocking on the forum and the play faith and the passion to the end zone is fought by miller for the touchdown so mother makes the play to set up the first and goal and then heat miller then number one vic in oh five out of virginia is into the end zone this is a heck of a play on goal line because you know that the defense has to sell out for the run and once they sell out for the run you give them a little playaction pass you bring the linemen the linebackers up to the line of scrimmage and get to tight end in behind them the seven and a half minute with 5:18 the point after so the score is now tied sevenseven and we will finally we think see <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> <person player="george wrighster" race="UNK" position="TE">george</person> when we come back to jacksonville on sunday night football you can experience sunday night football extra by logging onto nbc sportscom or nflcom live coverage of the game in all one war sunday night football extra check it out so weve played almost ten minutes 17 plays have been run by pittsburgh none by jacksonville the pittsburgh special teams the source of some consternation last year theyre better on coverage this year but still poor on returns as you look kind of coverage here is <person player="jeff reed" race="white" position="K">reed</person> well kick off and it s a low bouncer that s filled it up at these 15 maurice james we in shares time with <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred</person> sable in the backfield and drew will take the ball back out to the 26 yard line so the jaguars get to run their first offensive play of the night when we come back with five twelve to go in the quarter of the game five seven seven and a look finally at the jacksonville offense <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard in this seventh season but until last year mainly a backup to <person player="byron leftwich" race="nonwhite" position="QB">byron leftwich</person> who ironically is now with pittsburgh second year as a starter had a great year last year 18 touchdowns three interceptions and led them to a comefrombehind win if we expanded the big league in the 26yard on start by going to the ear as he can and then he shovels the ball off and it s incomplete intended for freddie taylor second down here s the jaguar offense <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage ecu pirates <person player="brad meester" race="white" position="OG">brad</person> taylor florida great jones he will respond gradually doing the university of washington <person player="matt jones" race="UNK" position="WR">matt jones</person> arkansas <person player="marcedes lewis" race="nonwhite" position="TE">marcedes lewis</person> ucla khalid <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">barnes</person> university walker luce one airy purdue university <person player="dennis norman" race="UNK" position="C">dennis norman</person> press the university milk for <person player="milford brown" race="UNK" position="OG">brown</person> florist and tony long live the chief and here s tale dont work on the outside and then cutting the back out of florida he s taken down at the 27 yard line by the everpresent one <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> another look and he s so good at that you know that s what he s doing he s taken away that cutback you see him come up here as taylor starts to go away he just waits for him and waits for that cutback and when he does he s right there in the hall and he bangs it wont be the last time you see a play like all night that s a tough play all the flow if you cut back side you got clarke calamari in the backfield is swinging out in the the past goes to the right and that will be a first down to mack jones was finally beginning to emerge college quarterback at arkansas victim number one in all five and he s been kind of disappointing as a receiver over the past three years but all of a sudden beginning weally to emerge now 15 yard gain here is <person player="matt jones" race="UNK" position="WR">matt jones</person> easy he s a slot receiver here he s just gonna run an out <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage said earlier i remembered to end the preseason we havent he said he doesnt have a goto guy and now he says he finally has one

<person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> louise am pulling mother s southern california brought me friday florida state the pittsburgh defense last 30 seconds rises just three touchdowns second and ten from the 42 wide lines go our and that s tipped by the shade <person player="deshea townsend" race="nonwhite" position="DB">townsend</person> on the pass intended for one of the new jaguars <person player="jerry porter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry</person> order the x raider who had hamstring surgery in training camp and is just trying to round back into form and made his first appearance as a jaguar last week <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> right then you hope that <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard was throwing that one away because just as he went to make us break <person player="jerry porter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry porter</person> fell down so that s either going to be an interception or incomplete pass and that choice was the better port around walker in gas into the slippery third down and ten against the mickler there come the state is putting the pressure on that the warrant steps away from it and finds the man and that is the aforementioned michael walker hurt last year in the second year of the central florida third round draft choice and an 18yard gain from mike walker you know were talking about <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage this was a situation he wanted to stay out of because when you get in third down you know that the steelers are going to have all their exotic defenses this is when they bring their blitzes like they just did but this is a perfect throw right there you know you look at what s watch a block right here by <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> i mean that

when they get in no huddle he calls the plays and he said this was going to be and they empty the backfield with a shotgun five receivers in the pattern here there s some movement on the left side this time and another flag so weve already had one false start and now we have another well start offense number 77 marvell smith with his lengthy read of arizona state so each tackle on this series has been guilty and it will be second down and 10 you know one of the things when you when you go no huddle and then you go empty backfield and you put the quarterback in shotgun like the roar that time you also have to go silent carroll second and ten more is the running back in this set who stays in the block in the office burgers passes too high intended for <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> a slant toward the middle third down and ten now was one of those things that was good coverage by the jaguars there was no place to go and this is a part of the defense that jack del rio was worried about he said we havent been good in this area again the the third down the third along our pass rush content manage our own court and we missed tackle we have to fix and clean up third down and 10 for the 21 out of the gun gregoire s our nickel defense five defensive backs here play loose fourman rush <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> guns it over the midlands gonna get the first down as ward makes his second catch of the game so pittsburgh converting again that s four out of five conversions on third down moved the change with a minute to go in the quarter and they did they played nickel five defensive backs but they were kind of kind of loose in here and you see <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate washington</person> he s just gonna come there and stop and he could have been thrown first in town without a puddle again nohuddle gotham spark the other night when they and then a sack come to touch down on the next series gave them the lead the outside in washington gets taken down by the ankles by <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> the ball we spotted at the 40yard london or a half minutes ago in the opening quarter bruce arians the offensive coordinator was saying last night they want to do a lot of those types of things you know just quick passes to the wide receivers squeeze screens to the wide receivers and tight ends those kinds of plays in the lieu of runs second down and four we get the play off before the end of the quarter and the pass was taken by ward s and he squad three warrant is not go too fast in a hundred and fiftyone consecutive games or in other words a

you look back to week three and you go that was gigantic yeah you always think okay the first couple of weeks third week theyre you know cant be a must game but close to muskie very maybe that was one for jacksonville especially against indianapolis and then followed up with an overtime win the last week and this is my well or breaking free the middle and picking up a first down before he s taken down by <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">quentin</person> grows at the 41 yard line yeah they were kind of worried about right gardellin art <person player="darnell stapleton" race="UNK" position="OG">darnell stapleton</person> you know who s gonna who s going to play that position and ill say so far both in pass protection as we just saw there and they on the run block he s doing a good job from the 41 yard line kindle <person player="kendall simmons" race="UNK" position="OG">simmons</person> lost to the season with an achilles tear the pass is thrown by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> into the arms award there s a flag down b find the play or b actually behind ward down at the 22 yard line he targeted jaguar defense they say we cant let <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> get out to the right contact the quarterback was out of the pocket at the time of the contact therefore is legal play results first down so give <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> another catch and he s already caught four balls in the first 16 minutes of the game but if <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> wants to get out to the right he s so big and so strong and you know so quick he s going to get out i mean you know it s a good in theory let s keep them in the pocket let s force him to go to his left every defense in the nfl wants to do that but they can coming into this game hed only been for 15 out of the pocket as <person player="mewelde moore" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moore</person> takes it to the left side and he gets about five but through the years <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> has a tremendous amount of success when he got out of the pocket very high rating and he s a guy who not only loves to get out of the pocket but gets contacted in fact more than any quarterback in the league over the first month of the season he has been either hit or sacked more than a third of the time you know he really believes that he can get away from sacks and he said that last night so i see a guy coming free and he s good i can get away from them second and five and that s a twoyard gaming to set up a third and three is more takes the ball to the 20yard line justin s a rant making the stop greg williams the defense report and enter the jaguars you know when you get down close like this and he s going to blitz and he just did blitz on that on that second down play i would anticipate that he would blitz again on this third down play williams one time head coach at buffalo last four years under <person player="joe zelenka" race="UNK" position="TE">joe</person> gibbs the defensive coordinator the washington redskins third and three because they do have to get some pressure on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> time out to set up with a bunch formation to the left and then well take a timeout with 12 49 to the half jaguars 14 stewart 7 a couple of moments ago talked about <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> getting contacted on pass plays and there it is he s been contacted more than any quarterback in the league thirty five point seven percent of the time gerard would be fourth the guy who has been least contacted through the first four weeks was jay cutler just to give you some perspective on and was contacted only about twelve percent of the time so then gets whacked once every three drop back in part of expense fall time he holds the ball and tries to keep the play alive part of it is a attacker a protection then part of it is the offensive line after the timeout that come up in that same formation out of the gun on third down and three and walkest were to go off his back the pass is incomplete beverages good we sent more out of the backfield that s there at barbie who came in their number one draft choice and the pants down the right side covered by <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> intended for mort s fourth down you can just see that you know <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> is looking out to his right he pumped fakes at first and it looks like he tried to draw get the linebacker man the man on the back and then just throw it up over his shoulder that wasnt a bad clam and he tried to you know pump it to him short and then let him go and throw it to him deep line back and justin duran covering its a 38 yard attempt

pocket passer out of their watch 76 he gets i pushed up there he takes <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> and knocks him right in the <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard bündchen i mean i mean he hits it there and that s that s how you get the pocket broken up both taking the spot of the pro bowler <person player="casey hampton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">casey hampton</person> <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> is right there on <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> is the one healthy lineman in this 3/4 and he s a good guy to have healthy in his tenth year at a northern colorado and one of the very best in the league right and chris hulk is playing well too and and and <person player="travis kirschke" race="white" position="DE">travis</person> percy i mean those guys that have gone in there have played well there s <person player="casey hampton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">casey hampton</person> theyd be starting those tackle but chris hope he be he went <person player="casey hampton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">casey hampton</person> as if chris hope still plays a lot he s not in there now the defensive linemen contain the pressure is on that was lying in <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> who came in couldnt get the sack there goes the ward and hell get taken down just before he gets out of bounds about six yards shy of the first down and the jaguars will punt for the first time in the game and that was the thing <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage was talking about you know you get third and long you know youre going to get this nickel defense and you know youre going to get exotic whistles and the exotic blitz the safety <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> coming and that s what broke the pocket up and made gerard take off no one in the history of the game has invented more exotic blitzes than dick lebeau is only in his 50th year in the sport fielded at the nine and <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> is outofbounds up near the 18 yard line yeah and that was the thing <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage was talking about because you know youre going to get that on third third and long that s why first and second down is so important you know you have to gain yard the per second to stay out of those situations because theyre so tough in them as you said i think i think dick lebeau was you know they had a hall of fame for assistant coaches to me this would be the first guy that should be in it i think as a defensive coordinator and he was the hit dose a few years ago the cincinnati bengals made his playing career is almost good enough to get him into the hole of any age 62 career interceptions for the 18 but slang homes their big play guy on the outside and <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> takes it up to the 38 yard line say antonio average 18 point one yards per reception last season and coming into the game tonight he s averaging 15 point eight you see <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> is looking into the backfield what he s doing is he s key had been on that threestep brach to try and get a jump on that play <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> got the jump on him gain of 19 his second grab of the game i was free by one this is free by one free on the left side one receiver on the right being the one the well day up to the 38 yard line itll be second down and nine and a half minutes to play in the opening half now were always talking about a threeman line you have to get that nose tackle in a fourman line you better get this guy blocked here <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> because if you dont it just forces a play right down the line there is no cutback at all and no soft spots <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">henderson</person> can be a very dominant defensive lineman second day in line to the outside and right on target to meet washington through a perfect pass to the outside <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> with the coverage on the play and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> you know johnny you look at him and you think about the shoulder and we talked about it on opening night the fact that he had the separated ac joint didnt throw in practice this week and he looks perfect it s amazing i mean i think i think there s no way you can do that i mean you have the injury youre not going to have velocity and you havent practiced that you didnt have the reps and he comes out here and looks almost perfect in those first half 48 yard line by his receivers spread out empty and then back there hannah costa that s the mattress and then wide open his leave washington for the touchdown free low came over with the coverage from the safety spot that he beat the corner down the sideline on a 48 yard touchdown reception to give pittsburgh the lead here we talked about empty backfield that means you have three receivers on this side here s <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate washington</person> here you get a short out he gives a little jab like he s gonna run a hook and then he runs a go he beats <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> we talked about <person player="drayton florence" race="nonwhite" position="DB">drayton florence</person> oh they picked up from san diego normally plays that corner and jeans just bit and gets burned the binder the pattern and was also bite of the pump by benoit breathe to the point after <person player="mitch berger" race="white" position="P">mitch berger</person> to do the holding and the pittsburgh steelers are on top 17 to 14 there s also great pass protection theyve washington tomorrow chuck is discovering a lot of perks to being an average guy spy on a few pitfalls that says here a new chuck tomorrow

looking at the 11yard line as he tumbles down at the 16 and slow and getting up rough ron went through it with the call wearing a return holding over 66 the return team and i was half the distance to the goal first down and back we go to the touchdown youre going to see <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate washington</person> is going to do a stop and go and at the same time the <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> when washington out there spock what s that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> pumps gone so that kind of holds everything and then theyre able to get behind <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> i mean he went he went for the fake of <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate washington</person> but he also went to the pump fake of smiling meet the great on the sidelines through the 7 yard line now down for the jaguars <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> that his college ball at ucla thirdyears drafted number two in oh six kind of a surprise to <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> at the time as it turns out this one two punch <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> might extend taylor s career another year or two it is i think there was something of <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> thought you know this could be a negative thing what are they trying to do run me out of here and then when he got <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> it you know that this can extend my career because he can do a lot of other things so there s plenty of work for both running that although they havent gotten started tonight nor lastly duty and have to go in the half lord swings it out to the right side and that is <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> paulo malo is right there along with <person player="james farrior" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james farrior</person> there isnt <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> stuff at any time that he gets around the ball that guy with the ball is going to go down and then he s to me he s the best packard football watch the way he tackles he never slows up he runs through everything you know a lot of guys will come up they come under control so they try and you bend their knees and wrap he just runs right through he s like a missile 37 ive started defense ive take him there he is up on the line back in the coverage he goes and right in the neighborhood and they throw it intended for more sadie s louis and that pass is incomplete shows fourth down and seven at <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> was going to be mantoman right here in mercedes lewis you see he starts here he starts on a bump was really a zone he started and bumped with him and then he was going to take away the slander the that s a little behind the what lewis has already dropped as many passes through mercer as he s caught parviz is partying goodbye <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> at the 39 down as <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> brings it back to the 45 to markers and shaking his head he he looked at that field position and he really liked it and then he saw he was going to lose it illegal block in the back number 22 of the return team send yard penalty first down and that is <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> backing beneflu about the 37 these great outside the pocket that s what makes him a special quarter packaging for receivers he is constantly working his opportunity for us to be able to make plays down the field for us like i said we need to give that opportunity we have to make the most of it and tonight <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> 13 out of 18 2 touchdowns one interception the ball is at the 31 yard line pittsburgh up 53 and theyve had the ball for 16 minutes jackson goes 6 that touchdown and in the half 236 yards for pittsburgh 41 the jags on the defensive change here greg williams have seen enough of james at right corner so what they do is they take <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> from safety back to corner he s played there a lot before in the past and pearson free low comes in and he will play the safety spot that had been occupied by williams and they probably saw a muscle <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> and felt it but he just wasnt competing second day and six from the 35 more right up the back of <person player="chris kemoeatu" race="nonwhite" position="OG">chris kemoeatu</person> get me out to a guy this youre doing a pretty good job he s remember they had alan s faneca the great goran faneca opted for the bigger contract with the new york jets and we talked about the fact you know last week losing another guy on the offensive wine and it s kind of a patchwork thing in that ten to <person player="kendall simmons" race="UNK" position="OG">simmons</person> and that was that was the big question about pittsburgh going into the season with the offense of wine writer but i think i think tonight theyre doing an excellent job against a struggling jacksonville pantsless here s raucous burgers steppin up <person player="travis kirschke" race="white" position="DE">travis</person> phone miller and he takes a couple of jaguars for a ride but youre gonna get a hold on a wooly cologne the right tackle here to negate the play he did that right in front of the referee holding offense number 74 compete there now and that s where <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> was escaping then started back in the union went back in the pocket then he started going to the right see now he starts coming out here to the right and willing cologne just tackled his guy that s one way to spring your quarterback back holy russia no one knows pass versus those lighter pass rushers they cry and dip that shoulder and get down low well faculty learn just to get both hands on him and push him into the ground and i think that s what willie claw was trying to do bob meyer defensive tackle limped off phone in the game in 96 face his spot here in a third down and 16 and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> will air it out on third passion is incomplete and getting up and that s <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> again who had moved over to the corner spot and then a flag is thrown at the end we as they started jawing at each other at that time that defensive move worked having williams covering the receiver who had gotten by james on the prior series right i think <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> was looking for <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> to still be out there and they were going to work that same play <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> would have no part of it after the play was over taunting number 29 defense 15yard penalty and that says it all on the face and the expression you just saw from del rio you make a play youre going to force a punt and then you get a taunting pole and that will make a coach let the air out of himself i mean it s it s great coverage there it s turned out now just get off the field you dont have to do anything you dont need that you know i know it s an emotional game and everyone s competing but flag on it youve done your job third down off the beat just leave so that verbiage takes into fourth and 16 to a first down with pittsburgh kills coaches cheap porn but it was pretty expensive for jackson day they gained four more second and ten and you talk about coaches and you know that that s one of their problems and jack del rio was saying that the other day we havent been a third down defense we havent been good on third down we havent been able to get our defense off the field and you finally get a play and then something like that happens and that defense has been on the field almost the entire half pittsburgh s run 35 plays the jags have run 13 second at 11 spread it out we go right to the left this burger throws in this incomplete that was <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> going down the sideline <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> was in the area second down third down finally on that one maybe they just lost confidence in there and their secondary <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> that it was a spread situation and the jaguars just stayed in regular defense so they had a third and 16 in the corn now it s a third at 11:00 no pressure well stop them as malthus comes up to stop more of it now you have another flag on this side of the field at the 33 yard line and you save us on this side of the field away fold and play offense number 72 colors define it support down by <person player="george wrighster" race="UNK" position="TE">george</person> <person player="darnell stapleton" race="UNK" position="OG">stapleton</person> theyll force the punt this is the thing we talked about the jaguars playing regular defense and not playing a nickel but if youre going to do that and if were gonna throw short into the end zone and the jaguars will take it at the 20 sunday night football from jacksonville florida brought to

knocked them out of bounds see they had that that bunch over here in the left side this is what i was talking about they can get power on the perimeter you know they put this in needed lockers over on that side and instead of getting you power inside or up the middle you put three blockers on the outside on the perimeter and then you run in behind that fourth down and a 43yard on forgiving of you then pleading a case with long winter not exactly sure what it is check in with andrea im not good news for defense that sporty exhausted joggers defensive tackle wrought iron is a right knee sprain they have them in the locker room theyre retaping in and you know how he is the iron man he has played in the third most games in team history the losing of both tackle and end and remember marcus trad went to buffalo some iron dangle take his spot there acclaimed at the moment 66 second down in santa the ball of the 44 yard line the 39yard line on the crowd getting very frustrated with his jaguar defense because theyre not getting to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> they know that you know that s the thing that that they have to get a pass rush and they also have to get some coverage because you know that in the middle you know on third down that s where theyre gonna go and it s going to be <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> when they did sit for a short guy and then they put him in behind him twominute warning pittsburgh live three at the half feet saw at the halftime show from new york the boys will take a look at all of the action today and one of the highlights of course was that amazing comeback by the indianapolis colts in houston they had a halftime that work one then tend to play in the half two time outs remaining for the steelers first down 15 yards <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> keeps on trucking and <person player="mike peterson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mike peterson</person> is there with the coverage you just have the feeling if the jaguars dont blitz and they can just throw the ball to heat miller in the middle all night because the linebackers arent getting there and covered we need to play in his own and the safeties beat and he s just running in between playing chess he s caught for passing time for 42 yards wards for washing to the outside and chemical <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> itll be second down and ten mike tomlin second year with the steelers after of course chuck noll and bill cowher for so many years and then mike tomlin who had been the defensive coordinator at minnesota for only a year before that had gotten his start and cut his eye teeth and pro football only under tony dungy going back to tampa bay the second row some art the third just the lone second down tanna for me three by two three the left to the right five yard line homes pays the price you got <person player="mike peterson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">peterson</person> there but waxham <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony mcdaniel</person> is also back in coverage and timeout is taken by pittsburgh their second first and goal the numbers he s never in his career had a more productive first to happen yardage 239 my god didnt practice all week hasnt thrown has a bag told about him for navajo out of boston he he has all the velocity he need maybe that s the way to the future course can go fake inside kid again protection rolling buying power for the back of the endzone juggled incomplete pines lord couldnt hang on to it and keep his speed in bounds at the same time thinking of ball pearson kilo with the coverage and again there s no pass rest there so so <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> is able to come here fake look out to his left punk to his left look to the middle and then run out here to the right before he finally throws it to <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> and that is way way too much time for any quarterback pantsless one sack time for jacksonville but in for the hamptons and have six sacks this year that s hit second and goal with a little bit only to the 4 yard line and now it will be third down and goal and a timeout taken here pittsburgh doesnt have a timeout what was surprising there is to take the time out of the situation we have a goal to go situation youre not going to get a first down youre not going to run out of time you might as well take all of the time he can off the clock but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> was quick on the trigger to call the timeout i better one of those predetermined thing <person player="joe zelenka" race="UNK" position="TE">joe</person> let s run the ball and if we break it for tv fine if we dont let s call a timeout and we get a pass play in two the third down didnt have to do it exactly sometime burdine available was at the 5yard line <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> laughing in another a fade and it was like clones and ward were each running routes but not in that ape review you wonder why they got away from work in the middle im in the middle had been so open that you know you know they could have worked that all night and why you thought they had to go to the outside im not exactly sure i saw it happen there with the mess up but that they could have worked im in the head they just have everything they want jeffrey chips got 23 wash sixpoint and he does but jacksonville is going to have a little bit of time because of that forgive im alcohol by pittsburgh the jaguars have 45 seconds and all of their timeouts here six point game pittsburgh up 22:14 <person player="jeff reed" race="white" position="K">jeff</person> weed short right there that was that was an excellent quiet and <person player="brian witherspoon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">witherspoon</person> downs it in the end zone so pittsburgh remember they had the ball for almost the first 10 minutes of the game you had <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> calling an interception which was run back for a touchdown by <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> then they had a long drive did pittsburgh to tie the game at 7 and gerard didnt even get the feeling there were about 5 minutes to play in the opening quarter defense no pass rust and the jaguars the boy a sixyard games with all of their timeouts and they spend their first one right here stopping the clock with 39 seconds you also have a penalty so the penalty would supersede the timeout personal foul grasping the facemask offense number 69 first down <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">khalif barnes</person> the left tackle he s blocking <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> right here one of the the most dominant and best pass rushers in the league i mean he has a great bull rush and that s exactly what it was there he just gets his head in there and pushes back cliff <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">barnes</person> trying to hold on he got straightened up he just grabbed <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> s face hands first in 20 the league apologized to the steelers last year after the wild card when <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">barnes</person> was holding on a play and they didnt call it on a gerard run in pittsburgh and now the jacksonville jaguars will just taking me and trot off the field a lot of terrible towels here tonight i noticed that in the pregame jaguar fans have a lot of crying towels the way theyre playing at this point theyre lucky to be down by only six 22:14 pittsburgh as we get to the half so coming up next the toyota halftime show on the other side of this break pittsburgh 20 jacksonville 14 back in jacksonville as you look at municipal stadium on the banks of the st johns river michael s with <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> maddinames kramer some of the action and this was the the biggest highlight by far for jacksonville the roisin <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> interception and run back for a touchdown apart from that it s been all pittsburgh there was a taylor interference call that lived in the other jacksonville touchdown <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> one of the backs for the the pittsburgh steelers weve seen some action tonight for carries 220 yards but for the most part it s been <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> through the year been 239 yards two touchdowns one interception they had the ball did the steelers for 21 minutes and 15 seconds theyve out gained jacksonville 300 yards 249 id been had his way with the jaguar defense they couldnt do anything about it they they tried blitzing and then that didnt work then they then they backed off they tried to play regular and they couldnt play their zones that didnt work and so they they really havent found an answer in this first half for the steelers and i think the jaguars on the other hand you know theyve been able to run the ball so maybe you have to throw the ball first in order to open up the running you know they tried to run it you know in france off and then maybe gets a pen that didnt work maybe go the opposite way throwing having mabel having been able to defend in the secondary to the 29yard line that s where the jaguars will start their first third quarter drive as we check in with andrea kramer andrea jack del rio was very i asked him what do you have to do to get your defense off the field he said or drd line is getting pressure we have to have better coverage now after three personal thousand one tony penalty he told the team just dont do it as for cornerback will james benched in the first half he said be a pro were going to have to cool down but im going to need you in the second half the sidelines that s great protection that the secondary goodness here canister shaking underneath roll to <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> before he gets tackled at the 34 yard line now last week against houston garage did a lot of 3step drop and a lot of slams and and it was pretty successful is a pretty good passing game and and they havent done much of that yet in this game and i wouldnt be surprised if that would be part of their plan in the second half because they have big receivers after you know <person player="reggie williams" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie williams</person> and <person player="matt jones" race="UNK" position="WR">matt jones</person> are big guys williams has not kata pascal our jones below visually changing his name williams as the intended receiver itll be third down and four <person player="reggie williams" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie williams</person> started on the right and started on a slant and he just kept them coming on across and <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> grunt was just waiting for a hole you see here he comes it across he s waiting for that for that second line to get by that linebacker to get between the two line that who are in the gun went by goons dude has to make a play that play is the pass is caught by mike walker his second grab of the night he s out of bounds moving the chains those spot the ball right on the 50 now that was the thing that they were concerned about the the jaguars about this third down and these exotic blitzing tight defenses but really in the first half they handled that part of it pretty well it s the other part that they havent been able to do offensive is but the third down third along the the witches theyve done a good job picking them up good job then they get the one in green keeps on pumping those legs before the whistle blows and mike tomlin looking around saying didnt you didnt you stop the play now that s <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> is one of those guys that that doesnt quit i mean he s always gonna pound for those extra yards always keep the feet going look he s going in backwards there then he gets spun around gets turned again but he never stops moving eleventh year floridian raised here let s go into games go spend his entire career with the jazz in 98 second down and six to the ball of the 1415 jones <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> started out when he was in pop warner and when foley was too small and as grandfather you said are you not too small and someone said you look like superman so he started he started since pop warner all the way through high school and college into the pros he wears a superman shirt underneath his jersey and he wears 32 because 32 teams passed on him in the first round in fact in the second round 27 more family is a sixtieth pick this time in the past he s drawn right into the hands and through the hands of <person player="matt jones" race="UNK" position="WR">matt jones</person> incomplete second down and ten <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> wouldnt light him here it is there s the superman shirt he s proud of that thing is he yeah and and that s just say one he s had since he s been in the nfl you know what i love when he when he received that pass crowd you look as they do guys they knew or whatever to get the job is to who you watch out for is incomplete mercedes lewis put in one hand is lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> put the pressure on gerard that time you got pressure right up the middle and it s going to force them out you see them in shotgun here comes a pressure right there from <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> as you say and that gets him out to the right he keeps the play alive makes a pretty good throw now this is where they get that nickel defense and get to defense four linebackers five defensive backs this is the one that they dürdane town she s gonna be completely short of the and then with a second effort that s my cds lewis who still cant get to the line to gain he takes it to the 27 yard line but there s a flag down now here back at the 40 yard line were on winter holding offense number 79 10yard penalty repeat theyre down right tackle tony packo s i was just going to say this is jack del rio and one of the things that he s known for is going for it on fourth down and had that been a completion not a penalty and been a fourth down im sure he would have gone for it see past shows there is a right tackle what s that left arm he s arguing that it s a camaro scared work the inside from his outside linebacker spot and sacrament youre right he comes from the outside linebacker spot and he s going to come right up the middle again two linemen extra linebackers and you see <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> just come right up the middle and that s when you get all those blitzes that s when you get all those different alignments that s when you get all those this time more makes the fair catch at the 21yard line early in the third steelers up by six in jacksonville then <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> tonight making the 60th start of his career how does he fare with some of these guys most wins by a quarterback in his first 60 starts brady mcmahon the 46 marino and repin 42 and been with 42 coming into tonight s game right now with the ball and a sixpoint lead leverage his bow welding more for no game itll be second down a change here we were wondering before the game as <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> was going to make all the throws at the angels to watch and then of course the pump and the a play in the middle a place to the outside or a deep pass <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> and the first half may tomorrow with no filling in practice asleep secondary that is incomplete was contacted as the ball hit there and it will be third down and nine for the steelers the women when we talked to benton last night he thought that no huddle in the spread was going to be a big part of their offense tonight and i think that he s doing so well the other way and that s been working so well there s no reason to go no hunter go to mine then snapshot he may have been across the pinchy before the other across the line regardless it s not enough for a first down he s babby he knows that when he extends a play you know he s he s moving to let the receivers get open and obviously he wants him to get open down the faster to first down he s healed at the 24 <person player="brian witherspoon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">witherspoon</person> said dont touch it he feels at the 24 in <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> fix the tackle there six when top government offered it to very different wives my own worst enemy as you go it s ours christian slater and a premieres next monday right here on nbc downtown jacksonville florida back to municipal stadium that was the venus drive their second okay and the pass is caught for a gain of 13 by mike walker take them down by farc and <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> it s a first down let s take a look at the the pressure put on by the outside backers and theyve been putting it on all night i think that you know <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> then the left is one of the top pass rushers right now in pro football talking to mike tomlin about him last night he says he s just longest player he s ever had like the modern <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> is seeing that seeing how <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> plays and he s becoming a lot a portable type of linebacker his <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> for the 40yard line you know when you when you can let a guy like joey <person player="jerry porter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">porter</person> go one of the reasons you can do it is because you know you got somebody like a <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> waiting in the wings yeah and that s what the steelers do so well is why while the have a player plane i have another one behind him that theyre developing and having him ready to go watching the lord steps away that shoulder turn and slide well should be a first down as a spot sattvam actually just short of the line of the 49 yard line so when he begins the slide he didnt have the first pound and that s gonna make a third down and a short one then this is where <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard is so tough on defenses you know that he can do this he can dodge and he can keep looking upfield and if there s nothing there he can run for almost the first down i think the longer the game goes the more he apt he is to do this yards very short stop them and when you see that here in the you know the <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> was right in the middle of the action yeah here s that fourth down situation that we talked about yeah i mean this is this is jack del rio and he s done it he s done it over a hundred times since he s been the head coach of the jaguar 107 times since he took over he s in his sixth season not only the most position took over but the highest rate before the century in the nfl so this is no surprise to anybody in the stadium jones who is the chair back there is the monkey man in a flower get that goes down and staying and jones therefore by <person player="greg jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">greg jones</person> doesnt carry the ball but he will receive it and hell receive it at very opportune times like this one and he will block i mean that s what <person player="greg jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">greg jones</person> is he said he s a tough guy he s a real good blocker and when you need a big play and this is a big one for the jaguars and for jack del rio you throw it to <person player="greg jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">greg jones</person> with playaction pass they got the steeler defense to to bite to come up and grape jones with a in the seventh nice bitto boy what would have been a lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> sacked and you just look at how strong that <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard is when we see it when he runs with it the watch right here i mean having someone hanging on him and being able to still look downfield throw the ball and complete the pass i saw a shot at him before before the game the biggest strongest was powerfullooking remember she found a quarterback ever if you had a cap on touch second and ten <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> there they are that s what im talking about ivan went as a quarterback let me put all this quarterbacks in the nfl in a contest that okay were gonna get who has the biggest cash he s the guy id take <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard and that s why he s so tough to get to the ground and that s why he s so tough to get on those third down runs and we have an injury timeout here with 447 to go in the third <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> had to be assisted off the field he s back on the bench he got enveloped by about 900 pounds of steelers hello intended for williams the cupboards on the play by brian <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> and now oldies fourth down and seven good coverage by <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> but that was a pattern that that i thought that they would run they had great success with this last week just coming off throwing the slant gerard putting it on him right there and so they went forward on fourth and one and right now then at least lineup to go forward on four thousand seven and i think theyll go for jack del rio says he has a plan for it remember asking them a couple times what is it and that one is deflected so that time it doesnt work out and it gives the steelers the ball at their own 34 yard line mike tomlin spending some time with his defense telling us yesterday said i have to make time for personal visits as a head coach you know youre consumed by so many things it s not like being on one side of the wall the 34 yard line for no gain so yes to work out it schedule and then spend some time with with each of the units when he can write because youre always going to have part of your team on the field so you you cant just ignore that but you also have to have some time to visit with your offense and your defense when theyre on the sidelines and that s what he said you yell and scream a lot that helps oh you dont have to turn your head and yell backwards event 2nd in town from the 34yard those are so <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> on a very link developing play short game here s andrea well 900 distillers that you said fella <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> gave him a right ankle sprain now who took the shoe off he was walking around with it sat back in the bench and now they are taping that ankle barrier and firstiy all on top of him boy at 3:30 13:12 and after a loss of coolness when stepping away from the pricer to him that s <person player="reggie hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DE">reggie hayward</person> and who blows the rookie the number two draft choice out of auburn who converge to the sack you know now he s part of their plan on defense has been usually wants to escape to his right make him escape his left because he has to come up before he can throw it and hold it a little longer then you have an opportunity to converge on and the defenseless each job now well take a look at the jax offense again with 218 to go in the third looks for advice six sunday night football being brought to you by toyota and the line of scrimmage and by wendy s it s way better than fast food it s wendy s doesnt it feel like pittsburgh s ahead like 4214 well one reason is theyve gained 300 yards to a hundred 19 mike walker walker tonight has caught all four times for 57 yards i think this is a pretty good plan now that jacksonville has is is instead of running on first down running on second down you know getting the third one youre throwing some on first down i think there s probably a lot more throws there closer on first down we picked up two that that s enough for a first down before he s tackled by the nose tackle chris oh yeah and that way this wouldnt have been a bad a bad down to throw on to you know to go playaction pass but watching chris mulkey i mean this this is what a nose tackle is supposed to do and he just gets into his guy their zone blocking he gets into the guard knocks him back gets off him get some penetration makes a dime that s a perfect nose tackle play against a zone some damping forces there koval knows contenders in the second straight 35 yard line and welcome to the 34yard line before m<person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> is able to run him down the walker s become his favorite carcass and ankle ours has sent in five times for 89 yards that s good for 32 you see mike walker here again a good passing now first down against the steelers is a good passing down because they sell out they really quite puff on the rock because you can get his peak digs our insider in by their linebackers better uptight to start <person player="orpheus roye" race="UNK" position="DT">orpheus</person> roy makes the hit braun winter what show you holding offense number 69 señor penalty the people s down these borns feelers say now you call the holding down him that last january huh right and that was on the backside too you know theyre trying to friend to get some of that cutback running the play wasnt the barns aside the play was to the right and pay were just cut it back to the left <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">barnes</person> was just trying to collapse that backside there goes smith marvelous minute going back on the court they wind the clock that s the end of the quarter we played three in jacksonville the pittsburgh steelers leaving the jacksonville jaguars 20 to 14 nbc s sunday night football contains a from your local nbc station and have come together once again to format the bushclinton recovery fund you can help those affected by the hurricanes along the gulf coast by going to that site listed right there but splinting close to fund orange fourth quarter begins al really ferrier yes as he reaches the 39 yard line thatll be a gain of four second down and 16 his ankle now heavily tape because this is where they need <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> you know when they get in this area they like to throw at him and ice i saw him go in on first down and i thought it would probably be a pass to jones grew and it was it was a screen pass and now i think somewhere on this drive i could see them they hear any outside pink when you think that second down and 16 with a jaguar the passes inconvenience eight back in a flag thrown yeah that s that shot on a defenseless receiver <person player="matt jones" race="UNK" position="WR">matt jones</person> wasnt even looking he was just running down the field he didnt see that thing coming at all tomlin saying the ball was tipped i dont think it makes any difference unnecessary roughness defense number 25 yeah and in a tip ball wouldnt take unnecessary roughness off and if you hit a guy who s just running down the field like this watches he s not even looking and you come up and hit him home at the helmet you not only get you know theyre not only going to get a penalty there so i guarantee youre gonna be fined on friday after they tipped by <person player="deshea townsend" race="nonwhite" position="DB">townsend</person> a tip ball does not give a safety a free headshot that was a second and 16 the turns into a first time at the 24yard line for the jaguar tight end unbelievable the jaguars tip it feels good i was at an extra point now and theyre hit 2120 this is amazing the steelers hang in there his mercedes lewis he s too tight in he just comes and runs at peepin hit him behind the linebackers in front of the safety good throw by <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard mercedes lewis is that a when youre dropping the ball lately but he had his eyes on hands and scaling to the point after their third lead of the game is in 147 another of 21 to 20 55 ticks sunday night football brought to you by frost brewed coors light on the mountains turn blue your beer is as bold as the rockies by campbell s chunky official soup and silly sponsor of the nfl by the entirely new audi a4 progress is beautiful and by mcdonald s that is forks fish camp seafood restaurant <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> and you just saw then preparing fried alligator what s that thing i just saw there was that that climber at about six johnny walkers and that s for another day were into return holding number 71 return to sending our penalty first down let s go back to the touchdown assume mercedes lewis is number 89 there he s a right tight end he just goes up and it s his own defense he gets behind the linebackers who runs it in right in front of the safety but it was set up by this point when there s is no no excuse for that i mean the guy s not looking he s defenseless and given him a shot like that was was a bad way for the pittsburgh steelers but it was a big game gray <person player="trai essex" race="nonwhite" position="OT">essex</person> comes in to spell <person player="marvel smith" race="UNK" position="OT">marvel smith</person> left tackle stephens will operate i appoint early fourth quarter then cassidy s way it s full <person player="paul spicer" race="UNK" position="DE">spicer</person> number 95 who drives into the curve now that jaguar defense is really getting that from you see <person player="paul spicer" race="UNK" position="DE">spicer</person> is going to come from this backside here he just keep working working working knowing that knowing that been close to keep the play sanic second in eighteen three sacks tied for the jaguars who came in with five in four games to the outside to get at the home see the 21 yard line we third down let s go to andrea betray us it s whom is subbing for left tackle marvell smith he s in the locker room with france theyre calling his return questionable and guys it is very muggy down here even some of the players who are not good at getting any action really sweating the temperature was only 73 at the start of the game with a pinga breeze were eating the jaguars every way and then theyre down by a point they go 5 wide on 3rd down and 7 <person player="dallas baker" race="UNK" position="WR">dallas baker</person> s even in the it s johnson and then throws it incomplete flag is wrong on the near side of the field of the 29 yard line the big thing now the jaguars have better coverage and and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s has to hold the ball a little longer and that s given the rushers more time to get there holding defense number 43 fiveyard penalty <person player="gerald sensabaugh" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gerald</person> sensible off holding so that was a third and seven that gets turned into a stealer first out of the 26 yard line you see jail censored was number 43 here he s covering right here on this deep the inside most receiver and he holds him right there virginia he can hit him in the first five yard nice name it s spun down a bit about the 39yard line and thatll be a first down wenton <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">groves</person> makes the tackle and mike tomlin has to be thinking right now they have to get back into that rhythm that they had in the second quarter and that was you know men throwing the <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> then throwing that <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> mixing in a run just like that get that me they kind of got away from it in the third quarter that s a pretty good halftime adjustment that s illustrated right there where s canton at the 39 yard line second down and ten you know youd think that they would get worn down a little in the pass rush which kind of slowed up but it looks like the jaguar is it s just the opposite that long time get more heated as much better pressure in the in the second half secondary channel a 22 the light going takes you to the 41 yard line third and long third and eight for tomlin steen this is where <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> is good job and this is where he likes to get back to the shotgun get a free read and then find where so and his side that he wants to though he has free receivers on this side one on the other side he s getting his another room yes here then stepping off the 44yard passing of jaguars first guy that hit him was <person player="reggie hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DE">reggie hayward</person> and that forces pittsburg to punt this is where this jaguar pass rest matters is is theyre getting three or four guys 13:15 just like that for games they got the interns everywhere but the 14 yard line by <person player="brian witherspoon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian witherspoon</person> and the jaguars take over at that spot ten and a half minutes to play in the fourth quarter in jacksonville the by appointment 21 to 20 the jacksonville jaguars leading the pittsburgh steelers 10 and a half minutes to go in the fourth quarter <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard leads his team up to the 14 yard line for you exact no real made a major major decision i mean it s a it s a job costing decision if it doesnt work last year in the training camp he made gerard his starter there is <person player="byron leftwich" race="nonwhite" position="QB">byron leftwich</person> who had been the starter here for years and not only did gerard get the job left which left went to atlanta was out of football after last season pittsburgh picks him up now there he is on the right on top backing up <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> but the a lot of guys changed it s stockton mogens honestly say when a coach goes to his owner and he went straight to wayne weaver and he said i want to make this move i have to have your blessing and weaver gave it to him if it works fantastic he got his extension if it doesnt work youre probably looking for a job yeah he would have been i mean that was the the situation he said im gonna go with nathan you are then he had no backup plan i was either gonna be glad or he was gonna fail and he pushed all his chips in put them all in <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard and you said the guy who goes to for thousands left as he does does go jane that s complete but ladies first down gents to flag down bbecause that was <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> who came in and may have gotten there late he s blonde winter threw the flag football roughing the passer fifteen yard penalty the first time was hey that s been the story of the game tonight those personal fouls yeah i may have been after third down plays do you know where you would be getting off the field and you see <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> that was pretty quotable that was very close he s coming and he hits garage just as a ball gets out of it that s about as close as you can get i agree because i mean they let that go 80% of the time because it wasnt to the knees and wasnt to the head so it wasnt im the crushing theyre going to get him lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> will get the sack but it was set up on the assist from kris over who got there first and slowed them up and got him off balance it s wendling back first hook he s one of those guys that has a motor that goes 110 miles an hour you see him here in the middle is a nose tackle he starts to get penetration there he gets just enough with garage legs to spin them around so that would we can get their second total against the sack hope doesnt even get an assist i mean like in hockey that would be like the perfect pass and the guy gets a a cheap gold grunts couple second came too that s taken down as they stop the swing as <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lawrence timmons</person> number lane before who comes in and it will be third down and 20 now i see they dont have the down and distance on their side when they when they had that on their side in pretty good field position i like the way that jaguars plan was going as throwing more on first half and suggested to in distance they cant do 30:20 passport big beam but not enough walker makes the catch they gave enough pushing underneath <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> and <person player="bryant mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcfadden</person> make the tackle and now it s gonna be fourth down we still a good play by by gerard there because they they did pick up about 15 yards of field position come up two yards shy of the first down mo ld more goes back to receive this tick the same dicks tyroon 6:30 to go and now you got a little fracas breaking out of the 14 yard line but no flags six and a half to go in a onepoint game with the jaguars leading the steelers in jacksonville jay leno this week he s got jenna fischer from the office <person player="george wrighster" race="UNK" position="TE">george</person> butler mark wahlberg leader dana carney terry bradshaw will be along with jaden it s a nitro carrie bradshaw the pittsburgh steelers cuz they took over the 20 yard line by a point sit still be free to go in the fourth <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> out of the gun the heat is on these steps away close thought turns into a game <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john henderson</person> had nine tenths of a sack and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> so strong in sixty five to forty one able to escape but watch what he does he kind of bends over there like he s going down and then he spins right out of it but the thing i like about <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> as he spins out of it he puts his head back up and he s looking upfield all the never whoops down he found ward was gift packs of the night how big is this game right now early in the season the afc south of all things who woulda guessed the undefeated tennessee titans are on to five and oh jacksonville two and two coming in india escaping today were their lives to go to two and two and the texans are all in for so jacksonville trying to keep pace now with tennessee something you never thought would be the situation second down and six five and watch this time and <person player="daryl smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">daryl smith</person> the line back there setting up third and fourth on the pittsburgh side the steelers leave their division theyre throwing in one baltimore losing today and losing of course to pittsburgh on monday to it to cleveland off today one and three bengals lose today to <person player="dallas baker" race="UNK" position="WR">dallas</person> since he is on five they do the toughest schedule according to last year s records in fact it s the toughest schedule in about a quarter century turn three since the 76 science pittsburgh willeth toughest schedule in the nfl washington earlier scored a touchdown <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> and a flag comes down at the end of the play williams who had moved from safety back to corner to supplant james is in on the tackle and with emphasis this call is being made right he s mad whateverwhatever call he made also made him mad that was the side judge unsportsmanlike conduct offense number 85 first down to town another bonehead plays weve had them on both sides multiple unite he again third down who gets the first down i just give the ball to the official they i mean he has to show it and i dont know i dont know who he s showing it well the bench maybe could have been showing it to williams there you know the nfl doesnt allow that stuff anymore and the only players that i used to you have to stop doing it back to the 40 now first containing stays in bounds inside the 30 and a 27yard gained with a 33 yard line before he s run down by pearson free low lily <person player="willie parker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">parker</person> s solution if <person player="trey darilek" race="UNK" position="OG">trey</person> <person player="trai essex" race="nonwhite" position="OT">essex</person> right here the left tackle doesnt does a good job here in the draw just bringing his guy up getting him hooked a little making him think it s past and the welding more just runs right around were gonna get him up there maybe holding a little but give him that edge give him that soft corner and that s message playing in place of wardo smith still commit to the 31yard three and a half ago looking down the line there each team with all of its time on us the film in the morning but you could get into a situation or long enough they have one of the great pressure fingers in recent years than jeffrey well that s what they want to do i think t the steelers want to slow this feeling down first get into field goal range milk the clock and growing second the name ten people on the play by <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> has done a good job i mean that was a heck of an adjustment when they took <person player="brian williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brian williams</person> and took him from safety put him out there corner for <person player="william james" race="UNK" position="DB">william james</person> this secondary has done a heck of a lot better job huh bro you know <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> heaps miller yeah that s kind of what the heck going in the sec <person player="jerry porter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">porter</person> i think they have to get back to that right now if they dont gain a you are on this plane we would be looking at a 49yard attempt third nate here comes the blitz <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> shirt gets it away lord will make that a person 10 invent is rolling over in agony so <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> able to escape it s an 18yard ii and form of the few times tonight it s a jail break blitz by jacksonville then theyve come in <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> again is a master at this stepping up stepping up running through something being so strong he doesnt always have to have his feet set properly and just make a throw like this to a receiver like kind boy that s pittsburgh steeler football 300 yard night for him and theyre going to let the clock tick all the way down <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> needs are a break here so theyre going to let the clock tick all the way down the 207 if nothing else remember if he takes himself out of the game he has to come out for at least one plate he didnt want to do that 207 to play a lot of stuff going on with with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> when he was getting up he put no pressure on the right arm or right shoulders he got swung to the turf we list and then let all the time though before they took a timeout with 207 just to buy him some time here im starting to roll to the right to give up couldnt do it had to go back to the roll to his left 207 and first down the clock is stopped at the twominute well within field goal range and that takes us unless jacksonville took a timeout which they could have done before the twominute warning about jacksonville and they did their first this would be a 30second timeout please reset the game clock the 202 right that s the best the important thing right there because either way at least it buys them a couple of extra seconds they aint gonna get the clock stopped at the twominute warning clearly <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> favoring his right arm and or a shoulder as he goes over things with bruce arians but right now timeout taken by jacksonville they have two left itll stop at the twominute warning then they can take another one and at worst pitch for it looking for a read field goal right and you know with with bench shoulder with this situation with the this has to be a running club and five is the tenth play of the drive <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> is the back lord is emotional the fake <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s going to kill and he frozen up on the back of the end zone you had homes and washington volt theyre odd pool that takes us to the twominute warning with officially 159 and a third and five coming up a onepoint game in jacksonville and back we come now to jacksonville the jaguars have two timeouts <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the chips outfield that love to get into the endzone to put jacksonville in a position where they couldnt win the game with a field goal because they have a great onetwo third and five from the eighth the welding more is the back and he goes in motion is the empty the backfield and tomlin says go for it s a fivepoint game right now at 26 to 21 on third down the feed to the corner of the endzone <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> who makes his seventh catch of the night and im sure when they need a big play you know theyre going to go <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> that s the second big play he made on this drive you think that you have him down there you double <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> everyone eight the steamers <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> is such a great player you know he does all those things to help you win games but he s also a very good block thing we do now were inside two minutes so the replay booth has stopped the game to look at it they must have thought that perhaps he was juggling it and didnt have possession he did juggle it with one foot down but i think he still got both feet in after he regained possession doesnt have it doesnt have it has it hmm i dont know that could be yeah it was like you said after he hasnt hazzard didnt theyre both feet in yet well the left foot he dragged the right here it is again right foot down left foot down doesnt have it right foot down left foot in i think it stands yeah it s a definition of when he has it does he have it yet no does he have it now yes right left and then the right foot is dragging there anyway yeah yeah right but they look at that shot and they would see that yeah but he does have it and did have both feet in right here s winter after you the field stay a singer had possession of all two feet inbounds visit touchdown <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> with a 309 yard passing light first time he s been over 300 since november of of oh six let a clutch player both <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> and <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> you just had to feeling that they had to get back to <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> and <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> and you know in this fourth quarter take kid and that quarter might have goodbye fingers on and then the play clock was down to zero he says wait a second away again okay but <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s contending when he came up to the line the after the review when the signal play is ready to resume the clock should have gone to 25 and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> and tomlin both feel hold on a second i got up there and it s down almost to zero blakelock lower left there it is it s already done aid so they must have thought they had more time when they came to the lawn trying to signal for time and couldnt get it back to the 7 yard line in this situation this is not that important jacksonville still is going to need to cut and they dont convert so it s a fivepoint game and they still have to get a touchdown and they have two timeouts remaining you dont forget robert downey jr if they ever read new iron man im putting <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> in the sequel i think he s been amazing you know we we talked about his not practicing all week and and that shoulder i mean you can just see him you wonder how he can even hold his right arm up and he comes out in plays like this it s amazing and you know i guess there were some people who think oh we all read ramat eyes is it no well you see the way he gets in he gets smacked around he we talked about it tonight he gets hit more than any quarterback in the league he s able to escape he s able to do what he does the separated ac joint his hand was so swollen last week he couldnt shake hands with people didnt throw a fancy practice all week as a 300yard night i know drama he s no drama he s a tough guy and and you know and then you know mike tomlin and his staff to have having confidence in that i mean as a as a coach that would be difficult for me to have a guy that i know was injured like that didnt practice didnt throw the ball all week and then count on him to come in here and win a game for you now youve got normally reid would kick off a <person player="mitch berger" race="white" position="P">mitch berger</person> is going to kick off for pittsburgh there is reid and burger burgers kicked off over 500 times and we were being told that weed was wants him to kick off in the second round and by us going over the back <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard in the past couple of weeks at indianapolis in the second half with scobie kicking a 51yard field goal and last week of course leading them into overtime and in a position where scobie could make the kickin overtime theyll have to do it again no he can do it with his left in the fuel rod out of the six mil up on the line for pittsburgh they rushed five incomplete intended for mike walker he s bought six balls tonight were down to 143 that jags with two timeouts the steelers are playing their nickel defense which means that they have two defensive linemen in there four linebackers five defensive backs because in these situations there lie because he cuts a wine second town that s where theyre given all of those that they want lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> makes the tackle yeah they tried to sneak <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> out they started him over here in the right and then he ran between <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">garrard</person> and the line of scrimmage out there to the left saving their timeouts tore down 26 yard line masses drop walker got his hands on it and couldnt hold on so it s going to be fourth down and nine with 115 to go and if it were shorter i mean this is fourth and nine and i think this is a situation where gerard has to throw the ball but if it were like fourth and two or three i would expect anticipate they not in this situation too much necessary up to the 36 yard line to keep the mail and the pass is caught the first path is jones <person player="deshea townsend" race="nonwhite" position="DB">townsend</person> and his arms around him and <person player="matt jones" race="UNK" position="WR">matt jones</person> is able to lean forward and get the first down we took that under a minute at great fast protection great for bike <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> got a hand on and jacksonville will have to spend it s the second time out with 47 seconds and a second and eight upcoming jack del rio shaking his head there that s one time he didnt want garage to run i mean there s going to be plenty of times in this season that he s going to need or want <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard to have to run but on first down terry thinks that he wished that he would have stayed in there hung in there maybe thrown the ball he had a short guy right there to the right he did have someone to throw to he he didnt really have to take off on that horses them too take the time out of there down the one second down steele is gonna cordially soft here with 47 seconds scarrans play this defense with only two defensive linemen they have a lot of quick tacos safiye in those <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> who came in to teach the book are you gonna say that he was down there s no fumble jacksonville is going to take its final timeout with 36 seconds so gerard gets sack loses the ball comes up with it at the 33 yard line <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> the guy who came in and made the play <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> again has great moves you know you youre waiting for that bull rush that s what the offensive lineman he s waiting here he knows that <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> bull rushes he s waiting he s waiting for the bull rush and <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> just takes the inside on it you know i dont think he was ever down i mean clearly he s not that that should be a fumble and then who comes up with the ball is the question cause a jaguar lucila neary now at the 33 third down 14 incomplete intended for jones and theyre down a fourth down with 30 seconds and no timeouts but badly with the coverage can i think wind me when the steelers play these deep zones that you can hit something in the middle you know theyre going to go and try and youll force you to the inside so that you cant we have to take that we have to take this way let s forget to the 47 yard line and the line came forward and lost the ball and <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> deflected it so garner with the arm coming forward <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> was able to deflect it they can wave the terrible towels in jacksonville and enjoy their trip back home because the pittsburgh steelers are going to get out of here with a victory one thing as they said they only have two defensive linemen in there but <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> is coming from that back side and you can just see <person player="aaron smith" race="white" position="DE">aaron smith</person> getting the pressure up the middle a darrin smith just getting in that lane taking the lane away from him getting his left hand up knocking the ball down and exciting the heck out of my top one kneel down away from a win so jacksonville tonight no rushing game <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> 309 yards and while nobody was looking will be more game landing than yours on the ground tonight but you just knew it s the pittsburgh steelers and theyre not going to go in to a football game and not run the ball theyd watch new career highs and catches and yards big early touchdown of the pittsburgh steelers go to 4 &amp; 1 the jaguars drop to two and three tennessee leading the jaguars now

been by himself he had a half a trailer in a week too so one and a half trailers this season for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> ou s down on the field with andrea then your first 300yard passing games since november of 2006 but how did you manage to do it with the shoulders especially we saw you go down with it just wincing and pain on that third down play well you know what it s a there s a lot of guys im not the only one that s hurt out here there s a lot of guys that and we knew it coming in it was gonna be a heavyweight fighting and it was that and there s a lot of banged up guys go check on a lot of people so im not the only one so i cant say anything about mine no it s certainly alan <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> just cant stop talking about you know how strong youve been to persevere with this kind of a game you know especially having a running back by committee that you that you have out there how did you manage three touchdowns well id say what we are earlier we went to the know model then ohana was good for us got to give our guys a lot of credit because we did a no huddle without using any cadence so that s really a big credit to the line the receivers tight ends running backs and you know im really just proud of the way the guys played all night tonight how did you manage to rebound from the <person player="rashean mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> 72 yard interception return for the touchdown i tell you back ill tell you bet that s a it s an unfortunate thing you know something something like that happens when the guy slips and it just it happens and you know our defense did a good job of standing up and i think i didnt feel like we got stopped at all that first half so good rebound by everybody how great is your bye week coming now let s say well we got a lot of guys beat up myself included it s gonna feel real good to get a little time off congratulations first time to be fed the jaguars in four tries thanks very much thanks andrew yeah great time for a bye week meanwhile jacksonville has to go to denver next week that s a tough one bob and chris in new york fastforward to week six coming up after this now that the evenings business has been concluded in jacksonville time on the wendy s postgame report to fast forward to a couple of next week s matchups cris collinsworth well start with baltimore at indianapolis both are two and two yeah and indianapolis pulled one out today it didnt look good down 27 to 10 but it was peyton manning as he often does bringing them back thanks to a couple of turnovers by sage rhodes and fells and but this is a team that easily could be owen for as we talked about and on the other side of baltimore ravens seem that could very easily be undefeated because of the close games that theyve been in and i think for baltimore this is a great matchup they run the football and indianapolis not so good at stopping the run and the kind of defensive pressure they can put on the quarterback may be a long day for peyton manning <person player="dallas baker" race="UNK" position="WR">dallas</person> is at arizona where a lot of points figured me scored yes indeed but for the <person player="dallas baker" race="UNK" position="WR">dallas</person> cowboys now backtoback games that they didnt really play very well the washington redskins they got beat at home a week ago they struggled today against the cincinnati bengals and if not for this big play by terrell <person player="montell owens" race="nonwhite" position="RB">owens</person> that may have ended up a loss there as well and for the arizona cardinals theyre now 8 and 2 at home under ken whisenhunt and this is a personal thing for the cardinals because typically in arizona when the cowboys come to town there s about 10,000 cardinal fans and about 70,000 cowboys and you wonder if that might be a little more blended this time all right we will find out come next sunday well also see you guys a week from tonight al and youll see us bob from san diego and that s quite a game that we have as well because i mean the way the afc has gone this year with you know brady obviously getting hurt on opening day and in indy getting off to a slow start and now all of a sudden the san diego chargers who lost to heartbreakers the first two weeks are 2 and 3 new england will stay out on the west coast this week after bidding san francisco training in northern california and then go to san diego and that s obviously a very big game for both teams yeah for both of them and i think you know the things that you just talked about with the with the patriots and with the colts and with san diego they were the three best teams in the air and then when they stumble that opens up everything for everyone else and i think that you know we watch pittsburgh tonight i mean pittsburgh is one of the teams you know you just see that the door has been open and if youre going to get some of these teams youre tennessee maybe this is a year to get them there five and on pittsburgh s like you know in a bloodbath every week but they right now are four and one in good position obviously in the afc north jacksonville now two and three and three games back of tennessee already so next week to san diego we go the chargers hosting the patriots for now al michaels <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> madden andrea kramer our producer <person player="fred
