with michelle well allen was week 14 when <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> injured a tendon in the middle finger of his throwing hand and since then he s thrown just three touchdown passes and five interceptions and his quarterback rating has plummeted <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> s been wearing a splint just like this one because without it he would not be able to straighten that finger completely on his own and he s got to wear 24/7 around the clock in order for that tendon to heal properly now tonight his starting right tackle <person player="riley reiff" race="UNK" position="OT">riley</person> reef will miss his second straight game with a hip injury hell be replaced by

has just four nfl games under his belt and hits first with seattle pound all right thank you heather a tradition here of course is the raising of the flag high above the stadium and it s normally somebody who s a blast from the past who gets the honor and tonight that is one steve hutchinson the outstanding guard with the seahawks 2001 through 2005 so he played in super bowl 41 the seahawks went into detroit and were beaten by the mitts burg steelers so they raised the flag the fireworks get shot off centurylink field always the case tonight once again 39 degrees clear skies maybe a

2010 on the seahawks sideline in this second down and seven this communication there as zener was going to get the handle if they faked the handoff and then it s bolden and jones both in the area third down and seven youve got both these corners out here theyre just going to jump all over that and the seattle seahawks tonight they know what the detroit lions are going to have to do theyre going to have to get the ball out of their hands quickly because theyve got a rookie at one tackle theyve got a third stringer at the right tackle not going to see <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> back there holding the football and do it with a decimal level to about a hundred and ten third down and seven <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> coming back to seattle started his career here spent four years here three with the detroit lions and it s a quick three and out to start for detroit

well <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s going to come out as they move the ball back to the 14 yard line correction it s got to go number 29 of the kicking team postseason debut oh that s the 20 yard difference there but the players theyre so fired up they didnt pay attention either they just sort of marched back and got ready for the first now so theyre gonna move it back to about the six or eight yard line instead it comes back out to the 26 <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> third qb in history joining otto graham and joe flacco to start a postseason game in each of their first five seasons and now theyre trying to figure out exactly where the ball should be yeah i think that s where it was originally now you got to take a ten yards yellow player hey there s a 20 yard difference the area marked it back ten so that s where <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> had brought it back to and now to get it figured out you know blocking the back you dont usually think about the kicking team at the block in the back and so a given a brights are where cool to begin with so wilson comes up in the shotgun from the 36yard line the fourman front commission that s thought short game <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> makes the caption let s take a look at the seattle offense <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> im a whole pack of bad news tom lazaro central mission <person player="marcel reece" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marcel reece</person> university of <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite"

on the offensive front as <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> takes the ball out to the 43 yard line itll be third down and three for the seahawks and this is a different looking seattle seahawks offense than what they had been in the past of course with marshawn lancers darrell bevell the offensive coordinator this is all about <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> now because youll see him get the ball out of his hands quickly but what becomes really exciting is when he starts all the scramble stuff last week the lions didnt do so well against bird is neat early in the season this is the first time he s had the brace off since september the third and three wilson is able to escape for the moment and then gets it away before he is he had ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> coming in and putting the pressure on carrie <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hyder</person> was next and it s fourth down well this is one that has to be won by the detroit lions ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> probably their best pass rusher on the outside against george fan a guy with no experience whatsoever and then it was carrie hider coming over to clean it up so a nice start there defensively for the lions john ryan is the punter <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">andre roberts</person> mentioned those two punt returns for touchdowns this season he sets up inside his 15 bring it out in this wildcard game this block our playoff is brought to you by chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row by verizon joined a better network because better matters and by amy federal credit union proudly serving the armed forces and their families chris that is donuts and maple bars and top pot doughnuts you wanted they do any business than we can ever everybody has it theyre dangerous is green dont scream in green with ego cards from the 23yard line <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> will take this snap out of the pistol the intended receiver that s incomplete intended for <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh</person> stanford dislocated that finger he s taken almost every snap either from the gun or from the pistol let s take a look see if he even gets that finger anywhere close to the snap no i mean you can tell right if youve got a bad finger youre kind of keeping it off and you dont want to jam it in any way shape or form i got a lot of respect for him i really do because he s playing it something less than his best with that thing on his finger no doubt disparate numbers before and after the injury on second down and 10 they gave the ball to zinner and there he goes again out to the 40yard line big splash against dallas a couple of weeks ago played well especially in the first half last week against green bay and off he goes tonight for a gain of 17 here not a bad start here for the third string right tackle youve got <person player="cornelius lucas" race="UNK" position="OT">cornelius lucas</person> out there they run right behind him and zip in behind it i tell you for <person player="zach zenner" race="white" position="RB">zach zenner</person> here s the first half wonder guy in the past two weeks 127 yards and three touchdowns in the first half just nine yards they need to stay close enough to let zags enter be a factor throughout and some some favorite runner/game which they havent had all season here s a flag will chug his way out to the 43 pending the call all side defense over seventy two five yard penalty remains first down something that happens with some frequency <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> trying to get the jump yeah no question about it right there he pushes the line of scrimmage and he every year will be close to the league lead in offsides but he also creates some real problems in the backfield he s a bit of a freelancer and that studies a lot of film they think he anticipates very well and theyre willing to let him take some chances for the graphic only adama could sue the next line now with miami penalized war this is enter to the outside up to the 47 played his college ball was south dakota state gain 2,000 or more yards and three of those seasons came in as a free agent boy he s really been a spark for them lately yeah i played a careerhigh 64 snaps against the green bay packers and the offensive running game has changed since he s come in there <person player="theo riddick" race="nonwhite" position="RB">theo riddick</person> was mr outside this guy s mr inside most of his runs are right there of guards and sinners right up the gut second read from the 47 yard line another flag and that play was blown dead before the snap just so hard think of his <person player="cornelius lucas" race="UNK" position="OT">lucas</person> ball start to the right tackle of jumping so you just cant hear but look at his head looking in here at the ball that s the only way that you can basically see the snap cap and <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> was missing with him a little bit it gave him that little flinch and out of the peripheral vision im sure that granese <person player="cornelius lucas" race="UNK" position="OT">lucas</person> saw that it s just a very difficult environment one of the things though the lions last year did was come in here and play and not have those penalties how much fun is that for a guy who gets the start because the the regular is hurt freeagent in the kansas state you line it up against <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> cynical second and eight from the 42 and <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> lined up in the backfield and they throw it to him it s been like that he s able to just make the catch and set up a third and one at the 49 yard line so take flaring out of the backfield to take the pass nice job here by this offensive line theyre going to end up with <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> doing some fancy stuff here looping around but on the left side so young and any time theyre trying to take advantage of all those new players dont forget <person player="graham glasgow" race="white" position="C">graham glasgow</person> he s a sinner playing as a rookie as well and he was a guard for most of the year so everything s shuffled around on this lions line theyre gonna try and confuse him tonight third and one for detroit venera he bronzed problems as he came into the league dropping passes he does here they cant convert fourth down and comes the punic group and im sure <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> is going come on both drives have basically been killed by drop passes right in their hands and that s been a bit of an issue all season long so now <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> came up as a rookie with the bears broke in with a splash returned the opening kickoff of the super bowl he played in for a tux goes to his lead to collect it at the 13 yard line 59 left in the quarter no score and she ever dont miss a moment of tonight s game when the nbc sports app you can watch the game anywhere live on your laptop tablet and connected tvs state of football roger goodell the commissioner of the nfl is in attendance tonight tries to get to as many playoff games as you can and across the country for this one from the 13 yard line second drive 13 and seattle has its first first down block from the fullback <person player="marcel reece" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reece</person> it sure did right there youre gonna see <person player="marcel reece" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marcel reece</person> who really he was a wide receiver in high school college and now he s playing the fullback position and that s helped with the dynamic of this offense they split him out a lot and theyre able to throw the ball there he goes again let his down it s football far from here at the university of <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> to split a mouth black please onehanded and pays the price so <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy</person> is down and writhing and rolling on the ground and try to get up the tight end and hell go over to the seattle bench you have a flag down before all of this happened davon wilson was the man who whacked gramm brad allen gives us the call illegal shift offense two players moving not set for a full second nobody misses previous five first down <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon wilson</person> is a big hitter former patriots let s see if there s anything illegal here you could argue a little late but nothing illegal it all got his shoulder in there he is the enforcer back there no question about it he is a big hitter a guy that i think is one of the more underrated safeties around he just got stuck and buried on that new england patriots roster and <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> knows all about how hard he can hit rusher him to the sideline here s a pass to the other side gets it to the 32 and will meet the lions defense now devon taylor south carolina asia robinson alabama a lot they got that orchid ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> you are you yeah theyre <person player="deandre levy" race="nonwhite" position="LB">levy</person> wisconsin sorry <person player="tahir whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="LB">whitehead</person> temple <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh</person> boz albarn place late mississippi state <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon wilson</person> illinois hello burke when you and them lobos <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nevin lawson</person> utah state so second down and five now wilson under pressure throws and that s <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> wilson and <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> out for the moment <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> wilson will have to do the heavy duty stuff he tried to roll for a first down comes up the yard short third and one it s pretty interesting play call there by darrell bevell theyve got the one receiver going across the formation first and <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> wilson just blocking and all of a sudden really late as an emergency situation get him out and set up this third ashore batum puts his head down takes it to the 40yard line what day the the seattle seahawks have had a few guys carry the ball this season 18 specifically 18 different men have carried the football for the seattle seahawks and of course one reason is one marshawn lynch retired youd have to go back to 1970 to find a team that had that many guys carry the ball the 1970 saints excluding the strike season of 87 my walls in the several games earlier this season effort he got hurt picks up about eight reese again leads the way second down in a deuce the big question <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> in seattle has been this offensive line as well but watch the block here by marc lewinsky he is a guy there are some guys on that offensive line that arent all that strong particularly these two tackles marc lewinsky though that s a man hell come pump the ball he doesnt always know what he s doing completely he s still young that was a good block secondyear man from west virginia wilson gets enveloped at the 41 yard line pressure was on to try to escape the pocket you get <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> and mata converging on the sack and that makes it third down and eight the really key part of this though is the contain now theyre going to bring some pressure off of this side but that containment on the outside really made this because <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is going to flush you know he s going to scramble against aaron rodgers they let him out so far theyre doing much better against <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and good news for the seahawks <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> s itll come back in a brief respite on the bench it stared down and eight another sack here in that time it is anza who s been playing on a bad ankle most of the year and only two saxes he gets a big one here fourth and 13 what s this little loop inside remember george phan is a guy that never played a snap of left tackle in his life until he got to the national football league when i looked at the matchup at this game i said ciggy anza if he doesnt have at least two sacks in this game there s no way the lions win he s off to a good start not healthy at the end of the year john ryan he s a line drive punt <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roberts</person> fields and drops it and recovers it at the 24 yard line so for 39 to play in the first quarter no score in this nfc wild card playoff game so <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> before he got hurt at the end of the first quarter against the bears week 14 his numbers were great rating is a hundred four to one touchdown to interception ratio completely more than twothirds of his passes and look at those numbers after the three tvs five picks they didnt win that chicago game but then they lost in new york they lost at allis and lost last week to green bay huge difference playing hurt for a better part of the season and i can tell you ive had a few games where basically the coach said hey just go out there somebody s going to have to cover you but you dont want to play because it s embarrassing to play it s something less than a hundred percent but at this time of year in the nashville everybody s dealing with something they have to have you here zener to the outside to the 26 and we check in with michelle well here s a closer look at <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> s injury and that s the joint of the knuckle located just below the fingernail of his middle finger on that throwing hand it s a tear of the extensor tendon which runs along the top of the finger and without the splint he wouldnt be able to completely straighten the finger he wears the split as i mentioned in the open around the clock if you removed it that healing process would have to start all over yeah michelle one one good thing for him tonight is it s not raining he s the ford guys was for the rain even snow showers which would have now it s bonedry second down and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> fires and that passes into puts he s off the marker that pass intended for me burn and behind him it s third down and nine well that pass is hard enough and you have a good finger but youre moving to your left and now youve got a bad finger and youre trying to turn back around and make that kind of throw but what weve seen so far we didnt see this release boy is that the seattle seahawks the wide receivers of the they are in their face theyre playing the run and of course bathroom staffer to find somebody that can win that s gonna shut down the place taffert said you know he was not unabated i had a free play and the umpire says sorry about i have to protect you that was <person player="cassius marsh" race="white" position="DE">cassius</person> moorish coming across the line neutral zone ian frye seat number 91 defense fiveyard penalty remains third down im sure he s the official said something like would you rather live get a free play i have seen both happen live or let die yeah announced this week that he was going to be back he has one more year remaining on his contract anyway but there s some speculation itll be lost we didnt get to the playoffs as was the case perhaps last week he wouldnt be back and they said hell definitely be back <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> is a lewis cage throw and the pass is caught for a first down nice play he brought a fter the 43 so when my slide step to his right by <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> and he completes the pass here for a gain of 13 oh man zac center is gonna get a whole lot more popular watch <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> come on the blitz and zener is going to see him at the last minute and just get him out of the way and that s allowed <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> to make that play down to feed there s a oneonone battle that they finally won down there nice job by <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">eric</person> eibar good job by senator taking out <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby</person> bowens had a tremendous year center again suzy for about a yard or so well is the only guy i mean he he s thinking about becoming a doctor man doctor dr zhivago there you go ah very good he s tops right oh come on he s fun his smart guy and with some work at the local hospital and medical research during the offseason second and eight two and a half to go in the core fake toss his bartman jones wrestling his way for a first down of the seattle 47 yard line nice job by <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> here understanding that he was looking at his own defense theyre coming over and just stopping because you dont want to keep running if there s somebody standing right there that s <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">stephen</person> terrill the safety and it s so many times young wide receivers theyll just keep coming across there and they get their head taken off it was a good job by <person player="marvin jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marvin jones</person> understanding the defense and theyre gonna walk carroll off the field and he s a very important guy because <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> got hurt broke his leg five weeks ago we were here on a sunday night so he s been the guy now keith tells him <person player="kelcie mccray" race="UNK" position="DB">mccray</person> has to come in fill that spot in the onetime legion of boom macray did start for camp <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> s week six through nine so he has two minutes to the end of the corner this time great protection but the secondary does he finds center who gets free at the 40yard line for me who s seven <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> makes the stop second and three youre gonna see <person player="cornelius lucas" race="UNK" position="OT">cornelius lucas</person> out here that the remember he s third string he s not second string and one of the reasons that <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> went down inside is because <person player="zach zenner" race="white" position="RB">zach</person> zener was sitting outside ready to chip him so the veteran goes down inside but were seeing a little bit of the mobility of <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> in this find some throwing lanes and putting this drive together second down and three toss that a <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> coming around but a razzledazzle and nothing to nothing to the 40yard line so tato began his career here has a super bowl ring took the money he went to detroit even the peat counts if we wanted to keep those a miscommunication when he could walk and he did and he winds up in detroit where he led the team in receptions this year with 90 solana trashtalking ustica <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> in the defense in practice <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> was so glad he finally got a chance to hit this guy third down and three by the end of the quarter it s racked by <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> at the ending short of the first down yet <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> coming in and almost had him behind the line of scrimmage and then <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> is able to pick up a couple making it fourth down and one and well see what caldwell decides but itll have the nice little break here to think about if he s that s going to take us to the end of the first quarter end of one with the score detroit nothing princey adil continues right after these messages and aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by geico what a sight the space needle which was constructed on there the world s fair here in 1962 flyonthewall second point around michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya and heather cox working the sidelines and at least for the moment the lions to go forth <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> in the backfield and they do indeed snap it and they roll a little pete and the pass is caught behind the line of scrimmage turn the ball over to the seahawks at about the 40 yard line <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> is there a little razzledazzle on that one turns out to be a pile of junk bases so our fourth that you get that you get bad let s see otherwise the ball will come back how about the lions when they come west who s 1983 detroit coming out to the west coast 4 and 24 during the regular season only wins and 93 the rams were in anaheim at that point seahawks here the raiders points are really in the mid eighteen hundred said the west young man but he wasnt talking to the lions from the 40yard line they begin this drive see how it s doing with a great that s a lynch like marshawn lynch like run by thomas rolls go back to the fourth that play now giving up the ball yeah youve got mathew <person player="matthew mulligan" race="white" position="TE">mulligan</person> right here who is going to basically be blocking i dont think he was intended to be a target at all but seattle did such a nice job covering the outside guy surprised me a little bit that <person player="zach zenner" race="white" position="RB">zach zenner</person> their power back wasnt in there was almost a little bit of a wart for me when it was dewayne <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> i was thinking but i must be doing something else and i think seattle was thinking the same thing for the 49 the outside those roles for a nineyard game so <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> he s gonna take over from marshawn lynch when lynch retired last year in fact he had taken over a good part of last season when lynch was hurt then he got hurt this year kristin michael became their guy when <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> got healthy michael went back to green bay so hell be in action for the packers tomorrow and as you can see tonight he s got already a total of 49 yards on six carries second down and long to the outside no get slowed down by <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> entry shine of the first third and that much yeah and for <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> theyve been waiting for this to happen of course he came out he had such a great year at the end of last year and came back and he looked great but the last three games averaging just 15 yards per carry and everybody s like what s up with this offensive line with this back and but pete carroll let us know he said hey were running the ball and were staying with it in this game i dont care what told me so far they they said the other day is in a good 20 categories tonight he s not a pace to do that put the ball down the 38yard line i suspect either if theyre short they will go for it official sticks on the far side and bringing them in much lutie nada right here jump around remaining fetty young rookie and get right in the backfield im just going to be brutally honest here we watched that game against green bay the other day and there werent star players on the field for the lions on defense and they have to make plays tonight like a lodi nada just made they have to come up and be better than what they were and what theyve been all season if theyre gonna knock off the seattle seahawks here and that was a that was a good start right there for loli not well you made a great point last night on meaning about theirs though you know really gamebreaking defensive player they need a guy to at least have a gamebreaking night to me somebody on that side john great <person player="deandre levy" race="nonwhite" position="LB">levy</person> used to be and he s coming back from injury there he is slave but 14 inches in the backfield he takes care of it he goes to the 35yard line to move the chains on his eighth carry the 90 already has 53 yards first man seahawks you can see <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon wilson</person> right over here watch him hesitate just for a minute because you got to play the possibility of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> pulling this out and running around the end and it creates just that moment of indecision enough to pick up the first down to the 30 egos so early on week one right high ankle sprain here against miami left mcl sprain at san francisco so in the 2016 season he only carried 444 yards in the first seven games in 215 in the last nine so overall still the lowest rushing total for <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> but he got healthier toward the end he takes the brace off tonight let s give a little credit to tom cable this offensive line coach as well because they are coming off the football right now double teams here double teams there let s go play a little power football and just see what the detroit lions have to offer here inside linebacker tire <person player="tahir whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="LB">whitehead</person> in behind that double time to get that kind of movement just cant get off and figure out which side with that backs coming to back in this time give it to ross again seattle has five first downs in the and <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> has picked up every one of them second down and six and the detroit lions have got to come up with an answer there s tom k boy he s got more than a few i think three different head coaching interviews coming up whenever the seahawks either get knocked out or next weekend i guess is the first time they can do it and he has been trying to work some magic with this berry group all season long second and six in big alex works his way to the 14 so they give rose a blow and <person player="alex collins" race="UNK" position="RB">collins</person> a rookie at am arkansas drafted in the fifth round as a third down and three <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> he s exhausted he didnt expect to get this much in for the detroit lions and allowed a touchdown ten consecutive opponent red zone drive so sure theyre getting a little winded out there themselves <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> is the defensive coordinator he s another guy who s gonna be getting some heat from using the forthcoming days third down i passed before if you eat yard line by <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> reaching up forming it in former university of <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> huskies sets up a first down and goal for the seahawks and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s happen to get this ball out of his hands really quickly youre gonna end up with ziggy <person player="ezekiel ansah" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ansah</person> taking fan right back into wilson in the 510 511 <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> had to throw right over the top of that mess stood in there delivered from the universe to go with <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> back in keeps on chugging it takes the ball to the two yard line so a dozen carries four rolls in 77 yards seahawks have run 21 plays the 14 of them on the ground watch what happens with these double teams here and watch what happens to the linebacker in behind you get the doubleteam push and it ends up enveloping the linebacker behind and there s nothing he can do once that movement starts the linebackers basically dead on this play and until they start winning some battles up front it s going to be a long night for this lions defense and he gets it to the one yard line with 8 minutes to go in half and a third and goal forthcoming a couple of people for an alliance pointing light there was a fumble on the tail end of that play the officials arent reacting at all though one of the lions comes away with it but after the play had been whistled dead let s remain as betty right there come back police step on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> foot yep love to make a handoff he s a flexible guy he s been through a lot this season but always by the way carrie hi nerd put the heat on wondered <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> was something along the silent richard didnt like in the rams game when they threw the ball from the oneyard line need we remind anybody what happened in the super bowl yeah and he referenced it as well and you have to wonder if that s somewhere in the back of daryl bevels mind and then as the defensive coordinator are you thinking theyre gonna run it are they really going to go for this here yeah let s 4th down and go at least for the moment theyre going to line up to go for it from the two yard line recovered emotion right there and senator <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> contracted the door davey wilson was even pete careless look up and watch this one on the big board first of all great job coming back through by <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> to make sure he got the penalties path interference defense number 32 the penalty its decline as the resulting flight the stanford thought i should have been offensive pass interference it was not not a chance there s the foul no question about it and didnt catch one hand hangs on goes to the ground and <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> he is relieved but theyre third at best wide receiver out there and boy that s a way to move up the depth chart he catch he moved to three one time on <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lockett</person> that hurts even high school for the point after and the seattle seahawks though 60 yards 14 plays 11 of those plays on the ground these seven others so tomorrow night it

a blocking tight in he is a receiving tight end against the safety even the best of safeties which <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> certainly is that s to their advantage they go spread they bring out people out all over the try and win some inside matchups stanford 6 of 11 to start 44 yards bhuvan takes the ball out to the 36 yard line and the seattle seahawks are always going to be a stop the run first kind of team and you can see what theyre doing with <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam

flag all the way back at the 20 the line of scrimmage where the lions are really just selfdestructing so far those two dropped passes early went for it on fourth down play got broken up theyve had their chances during the cape holding number 52 the receiving team that 10yard penalty is administered from the end of the cake it will be first down then lion defense allowing their opponents to complete 727% this year highest in nfl history league average around 63 64 percent or so but a lot of that is almost everybody we saw very short passes against the law completely go to the show well

position="DE">ansah</person> and he has now gained a hundred one yards in less than a hand twenty six year then excusable you really cant do this youre the containment on the outside when that thing bounces to you that has to be yours cannot let this outside every there s no help it has just been mistakes so far for the detroit lions theyre that simple easy defense i guarantee you theyre all awesome go crazy on that playaction that is <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> the touchdown <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> that s a gain of 19 the straight man to man coverage on the outside and <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> s the guy his first couple of years just had injuries ended up on ir both times and he s putting on a show he looks like odell beckham tonight out here making some of these catches shawn robinson you know weve been in seattle quite a bit this year and we got a chance to see <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> and practice and all the different things that he s been able to do for pete carroll that s the kind of elite quickness that he has been waiting to see once again been waiting to see this offensive line to come together theyve had moments where they were good at new england member in doing the in new england they got their running game going with <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> that there s so much we have an ezpass on the ferris wheel here s college to the 24yard line third down seahawks primarily a running team quick at marshawn lynch and the rookie wilson and then through the years and then marshawn retires then never running game speak of this year and they had a 60/40 ratio 60 past 40 run 25th in the league in rushing the season but you would never know if the way <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> is going tonight appreciation of our sun third downs for from the 25 and incomplete intended for <person player="tanner mcevoy" race="white" position="WR">tanner mcevoy</person> for them to linda warning field goal attempt will probably be the next play you will see after this break quickbase game two minutes to the half seattle leaving seven of kokoschka will try to make it intend to nothing when play resumes with what will be about a 43yard field goal at one block last week <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">stephen</person> said a lot of drama this year so the halftime is coming your way dantoni rodney back east to debbie a cloudy leading houston to a divisional round maybe that eli manning and aaron rodgers tomorrow at lambeau coming up a bass centurylink field beautifully lighted on this night the long snapper is tyler it s good to try to make a tender nothing from 43 are does 10 nothing seahawks in the nhl wednesday night is always rivalry night that means the penguins take on the capitals it s wednesday that these sidney crosby in alex ovechkin wednesday night on nbcsn at 7:00 eastern time 1:55 remaining in the opening half 10 to nothing is the score <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> 6 of 12 44 yards detroit only 72 total yards in this first half <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> has been good a little help from his friends drei <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roberts</person> back run it back down it there let s go back to the only touchdown of the game you can take a look at what could have been should have been might have been a facemask all here yeah and you can see inside the facemask where the fingers of <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> and pulling that head around he had no chance to even find the football should have definitely been offsetting penalties at that point and the touchdown come off the board and that was a fourth that play as well 10 nothing 155 detroit has all of its thomas to the 41yard line you know it s the one area that teams feel like they can take a little advantage of the seattle seahawks and that s those quick throws over the middle they have good receivers in there get the ball out of your hand quickly work there that s me brother that s another drop let s check it down to ten you know it s a big moment right there s a lot of pressure but you got to make those plays because now when you get the second and ten now the pass rushers and now the loops and now the stunts and now youre now the crowd all those things start coming into play because you dropped that ball right let s click abril the former costar liono he came across because he was drawn by <person player="larry warford" race="UNK" position="OG">larry warford</person> the guard <person player="larry warford" race="UNK" position="OG">larry warford</person> who is their best offensive lineman but the best of the best come in here and they came here and seattle is so good with those little twitches and you know they fake a snap count every once in a while because there s no umpire back there anymore gamze come into play now he farrell telling the crowd keep going get into it they hardly need any encouragement second and 15 greatgrand at the 34yard line good tight coverage and is able to keep both feet in against <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> this is a great catch this is an unbelievable throw an unbelievable throw there is no room whatsoever to get that throw in there that he wants a snack well there s no challenge within the last two minutes but the before they get the snap away im ruling on the field of completing path is under further review yeah it has to be stopped upstairs and it is with 122 to the half after reviewing the play the ruling on the field is confirmed it s completed pass first add detroit well this is some throwing some catch and walks away jones is able to keep both feet in yeah great job with his feet that foot clearly in there s a second but look how little room <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> had to get that ball in i mean <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> couldnt play that any better had him pinned all the way to the boundary and still <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> made the play from the 34yard line that s the coming in and knock them down 6yard shack and that s really <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person>e making this play right up the gut and then he had to try and scramble and get through but it was just too messy at that point second and 16 set up a screen for zener and hell get to the 84 taken down there by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> s to thee if nothing else you gotta get a field goal here because the hawks are going to get in the ball to start the second hand man blocker out there on him avoids it and saves the day throughout all of its time actually taking it down to less than a half a minute and stanford throws and that s incomplete just wash but the hit on <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> that time and it s fourth down watch <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> right here youre gonna get a man block on him on the screen which sometimes leads to huge plays <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> fights that one off and gets back in to make the stop and turn this into a long field goal so 51 yards for a guy who has the nfl record that freighter when he was with denver picked a 64 yarder wind it not a factor and craters kick is good and that is exactly what they need to make it a at least a onepossession need and to be able to get the ball but struck the circuit man 10 3 you know caress your fantasy league is never over never over the seasonlong nflcom playoff challenge sign up do it later tonight you do it for sure is it is it too late after they played these two games it s never too late it s never too late the day after the super bowl you can sign up for next year know what <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> says too late we asked the pete carroll of <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> has the green light on returning kickoffs he said absolutely not ill take that touch back anytime 20 seconds left see that was old it s tight last something that s gonna matter to that extent right now 18 yard line no you talked a little bit about <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> but what a year it has been for him leads the national football league in solo tackles out of 119 only eight missed tackles that s buist in the nfl and he is a pass rusher to 24 quarterback pressures that s the most by a linebacker inside four and a half sacks but it s this kind of play were so often he s the most athletic guy on the field many times to make that play get off the block there by lakyn <person player="laken tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">tomlinson</person> this guy will be a defensive mvp one day kneel down and that s the end of the first half in this nfc wildcard game with the seattle seahawks leading the detroit lions 10 to 3 coming up next on a halftime but first these messages from your nbc station seattle home of the 12 now michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya heather cox on this saturday night there s the 12 lighting up one of the buildings here the buzz <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> 97 yards detroit has only 119 total in the half <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> only ten throws theyve been doing all the damage on the ground that man right there 100 more rushing yards first player in the first half of a playoff game since colin kaepernick did it before the 49ers against the packers back in 13 and <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> with the only touchdown of the game and that was in dispute when you looked at the facemask on the other side but it was not cold only had one touchdown catch in the regular season so there is that catch the difference in the game right now is it s 10 to 3 as we start the second half <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">sam martin</person> to send it down to <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> had that one run back the end zone in the first half michelle well guys i talked to jim paula at halftime and i asked him about the <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> touchdown you just referred to and the facemask that wasnt called i asked him what the officials told him about that no call and he told me simply quote they said they got it wrong too late yep michelle so what do you you know this particular point by the way if youre wondering if that was reviewable it s not you cant review a penalty and of course that came in a situation where they could have stopped it but they did not score that s the scoring play exactly right stick them all up to the four white it makes the tackle im gonna tell you something now this marked lewinsky these guys right here are just doing a number over here on this side they are taking defensive linemen and driving them straight back that s a shaun robinson who s a second round pick good player and they are just physically winning the battle up front right now the seahawks are averaging almost 6 yards the rush was up us all of that different era by thomas walls wilson gets it away quickly it s tough on <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> takes it to the 42 first time we got a heather were talking about <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> he s actually the first seattle running back in franchise history run for over a hundred yards in a half and a playoff game pete carroll credits his success to the old lion crane and gaps and he said were finally giving thomas enough carries that he can get into the offensive flow and he s certainly allowing us to stick with our game plan here in the second half now for the lions perspective let s go to michelle yeah jim <person player="cole wick" race="white" position="TE">cole</person> well tell me told me that <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> is a major problem they lost contain a couple times he said most of that was our error but he s a heck of a player very much at this point yvonne wilson makes the tackle second down yeah im really surprised that the seahawks have not gone more to <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> one of the best slot players if not the best in the entire national football league and right now the lions their slot defender theyre down to their third strings theyre got don <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kerry</person> s been playing some in their first and <person player="crezdon butler" race="UNK" position="DB">butler</person> they decided <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius</person> <person player="adairius barnes" race="UNK" position="DB">barnes</person> so i thought that would be a focus of where they might try to attack that news falls here walls again crosses midfield takes the woman to detroit territory and that is a first down one of the unsung heroes of this game so far is this guy right here watch what <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> wilson has done he missed a few games with a knee injury knee surgery actually but since he has come back this is a different blocking team he is the guy that does all those little backside motions and blocks and he has been a major factor russian guards about a 5 to 1 ratio that s incomplete which it had to go to his knees again to set the scene here is they work on don <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kerry</person> on the sidelines if seattle wins they go to atlanta and that game would be played next saturday and if detroit wins they go to dallas dallas and atlanta the one or two seeds we cost to buy now president <person player="crezdon butler" race="UNK" position="DB">butler</person> in there wilson dancing to the bench and it will be third down to ten here comes <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> out around the outside and theyre just playing some basic zones out there as they probably now caribbean out down to there for spring died there so theyre just trying to keep everything in front of them but here s their moment if youre tara <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> this is what you live for is the defensive coordinator got third down and ten you have a chance to come after them if you want you can play zone this is the one time you can open up your playbook completely defensively we receivers to the 34yard line <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> they moved him to the inside worked them out of the slot picks up the first down here on a game of 14 yards and i think tara <person player="nevin lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawson</person> s feeling a little hamstrung here first of all they just come with a fourman rush drop back and play zones which is fine but if youre going to do that you have to sit down inside that 10 yard marker and not allow those kinds of easy so as you know that their targets are <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> the guard ball when you cant give them a few times tonight the thomas rules cannot get contract rules from flint michigan so facing the lions here play this college will initially at michigan and then wound up playing at central video that s been the guy that last year he got hurt he was the guy by the end of the season the primary guy was gonna be the primary guy this year until he suffered a shin injury missed about the first half of the season most of it anyway stuff up again back to back here and we third in our because now what theyre doing is theyre going to heck with this we are going to stop the run and take our chances with some oneonone coverage on the outside you just cant let a team plow through you the way that they have been and expect to win in a game like this so now theyre dropping that safety down theyre doing all that they can do to stop the run first third and 11 rolls is already carry the ball 19 times day for wide wilson it s smothered at the 40yard line and that s gonna probably take them out of field goal range as well as answer comes in for the sack yeah and this is terrific coverage so they still go back into some of those zone defenses but they took away earlier the big play threats of the seattle seahawks they didnt just sit back and wait on them and gave ciggy anza enough time to come up with another sack now they got a pun so we want to try to maybe 54yard house good but too late now is he sending the funny group right it s a little facts down and inside the 5yard line perfect 936 left in the quarter 10 3 this wildcard playoff game brought to you by southwest gets the low fares with nothing to hide that s transparency by pepsi freaking the pepsi by rocket mortgage by quicken loans push button get mortgage the new volkswagen top all track was for emotional that s the starbucks roastery rare very nice you think of green bay packers seattle starbucks center if youre a detroit fan youre sick but you know what the rest of the country probably doesnt know havent won a playoff game in 25 years havent want any road playoff game since 1957 not only was hike in the white house president eisenhower he s probably watching the game on a blackandwhite set with rabbit ears and tinfoil and perry mason afterwards right that s how long it has been it s been a long long long drought for the lions theyve lost eight consecutive playoff games and desperately trying to avoid a ninth tonight it s a onepossession game at second down and six <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> buying it said of bounds at about the 11 yard line speaking of the eisenhower presidential library you go back to it s in san francisco and it was a big comeback the last time this team won a road playoff game when you look at films from that era it doesnt even look like the cd the goalposts are on the goal line or the firestone ford on the the owner of the team widow of the late william <person player="clay harbor" race="UNK" position="TE">clay</person> ford and she really shook things up last year she got involved theyre able to pick up the big first down here getting out of the shadow of the gold coast is gold and tape makes to catch the quiet the ground it wasnt the prettiest thing in the world but that was the one he dropped earlier and then game to kill the opening drive come out and just motion him out and then bring him back inside here but enough to pick up that first down so at least they get out of that loudest part of the stadium jim bob jr took over in midseason last year as the offensive coordinator halfway through the third quarter take the center and he flag warming jones had got very free but there s a penalty marker man we heard the line of scrimmage lions fans have got to be sick illegal use of the hands hands to the face number 35 defense fiveyard penalty automatic first down but it s such a great call there by jim bob cooter end up coming right across the middle here after the playaction there s the penalty on the outside against the shawn shed but theyve been dropping balls like that all night and it s a beautiful night here to play football just we just play off nerves first down from the 20 just past the line of scrimmage now the detroit lions they have been the kings of the second half comeback this season eight of them eight fourthquarter rallies but in the last three weeks against the giants just the field goal at dallas zip and last week ten points that touchdown coming on a hail mary that meant next to nothing at the end of the game second down and nine let me 21 stanford throws and zener makes a jingling cats and cheddar patched the 40 before <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> rides him down at the 44 yard line circus guys are there to get out and block the guy that s in man coverage so theyre going with the screen they bring pressure if you can block the guy that s in main coverage down the field we saw <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> avoid one of those earlier and thank goodness zack zener hung on to that one because they needed that play the lions have moved from their own floor to the 44 <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> taking the ball into seattle territory that was a big shot by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> theyre coming back underneath on the coverage and i thought there was a chance that <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> would follow <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> in this game he has not <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> when you leave him alone at the left cornerback position he is the ultimate shutdown guy only one guy with a better quarterback rating against when he s playing this position and they have left him here all night long with press coverage on jones zero center to the 41yard line this is what chris was referring to here <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> on the left side the rating is close to 70 which is still low on the right side 40 which is terrific right and that is as the offense looks at it on the right side over there weve painted that for a while today which way to write that look down the <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> on this side gives up very little if you want to try deep on this side gives up next and nothing on the left defensive side jones you got a second down and eight makes the catch and he gets written on the bass about two yards shy <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> covering on the play <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> did he get a face well he did not the center thinking that maybe he did and it will be third down 32 were starting to get a little creative with this offense now that was nicely done zack center the receiver now a major impact that s the reason i was surprised when they took him out on that fourth down play because he is such a good receipt i ran pass to the tight end <person player="matthew mulligan" race="white" position="TE">mulligan</person> and had to turn the ball nine clear the drive coming four runs four passes thirtytwo completed the 20 yard line and jumping up his <person player="golden tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">golden tate</person> flooring one of the officials to throw a flag there is none see

position="WR">marcel reece</person> but theyre gonna say i think that he stepped out of bounds at the 32 yard line so that s going to be about a six yard game the carroll is going to examine it closely here to make sure weve got a few tight rope there it is right there definitely out nicely done by the officials saima first tremendous first half for this seattle seahawks offensive line that s taken a lot of heat this year some of it for me too ill tell you that but it has been the guys inside justin brett and <person player="sam martin" race="white" position="P">martin</person> go in ski has simply played the best game that ive seen him play for <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine</person> and betty the rookie that s what he wants to do he wants to

for 150 for that 7 yards per carry yes catch made 19 yardline wars takes it in there comes in at the end of the play we approach the final minute of the third quarter brad alan to make the call the play was over personal foul unnecessary roughness number 92 defense well okay not well after the play there s a little scuffling and then you see the forearm shiver there under the chin of a fetty and rightly thrown there lodi nada this has been not his best he s got the shoulder injury the guy who probably has a case for the hall of fame but not quite up to his usual standard this season well that makes it a first and goal position six yard line by <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> movie second down and goal team on wilson makes the stop and were down to the final 30 seconds of the quarter theyre doing all they can to try and help protect on the left side they are two different tight ends on that side of the formation now just trying to make

player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> has to do too much on this one over quinn s going to jump right inside here and make this play this is it remember it was fourth down when they hit the touchdown pass top traversal touchdown pass but there they go this is <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> time right here is at the bottom <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> s right next to her left side purse in the slot <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> farting sound on the left is to go three by one intended for a curse in the end zone let s go over quit who is that miss they snap all seasons but everyone breaking it up or down nicely done youre gonna get the little cross and route coming right here liber quentin s going to come in and jump all over he has been watch <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> on the other side think they thought he might get the ball three guys on him it but what a stand that is because that now is going to keep this thing pashka 27yard field goal and that detroit defense needing to hold and they do it s thirteen six fourteen twelve looked at the board well coming up on tuesday they show this cap do it a a lot of people and the audience this is us tuesday night returning with an allnew episode right here on nbc man they drive fast and see i dont know i was gonna kick off with 1412 remaining in the fourth quarter one thing about the playoffs and overtime not like the wreck of the season you can play it till the week well end in a tie too at the 17yard line it is geron johnson planting it let s go to heather see how flying back our club behavioral repo to school and pledged to build a home in haiti for every snack he records the seasons a careerhigh 12 and a half and april is the scene for the walter payton man of the year presented by nationwide which will be presented weekend at the animal joining the lions in oe on 16 so he played another 16 team and has a super bowl removal from the 16 a late flag were not going to beat seattle running the ball on first down that cam <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> is just going to be there one guy unblocked and almost every single snap is <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> after the play was over personal foul unnecessary roughness cooperate second down well that s the second foul on bolden you know and he s a tough in a physical and he played with a broken jaw and all that kind of stuff but and you got a chance to move on into playoffs here and he s a veteran guy that s his second personal foul which even though allen didnt announce it should mean he s done they take them out they have to think about be it a foul of a sideline earlier and in this one that means <person player="tj jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tj jones</person> comes in to take his place 2nd down and 17 stanford agent grayson is the flag and the shan shed was covering on the play and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> is exercised it was so strange the official rhinos on the field as the past was not catchable by rule uncatchable pass that s when is the wide receiver you say well if he hadnt grabbed me i would have been diving right there i had a chance to make that catch so third and 17 bold in his packet it s 2004 on scores felt like both of the one of them was a personal foul it was a different different situation third and 17 the bounds at the 17yard while investing the vacant floor down there was a little chatter at the tail end of that when <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> hit and quan bouldin they had a little conversation as he went off the field that hurts so i mean you only get what ten eleven possessions twelve possessions per game and those personal fouls basically in those possessions right and it makes you pumped from deep in your own territory and send it down samar s kick mr tells everybody to stay away from it bounce off of one of the seattle players very close and another flag down with a moment the ball rolled dead at the 28 yard line flag his flag is down at the 50 on the other side of the field and one hat off sometimes means you ran illegally out of bounds something like that during the cake illegal block in the back number 27 and the receiving team at 10yard penalty is the minister from the end of the cake first out and that comes on top of a it s the playoffs this wildcard playoff game being brought to you by the 2017 kia sorento learn more at kia com my team almost which to the network built for unlimited data by the new dq deluxe bacon cheeseburger 5 buck lunch by geico 15 minutes could save you 50% on car insurance take a look at the ceilings and fc tonight s game featuring three against six this drought starts back at the eighteen fiftyfive just cleaning up the antwon bolden thing both penalties against him have been for unnecessary roughness you get thrown out of the game with two unsportsmanlike calls against you so even though he said to penalties run necessary roughness he could still have an unsportsmanlike and still not be thrown out of the game you tell me right okay all right either very helpful second down and ten from the 18 yard line wasun for the moment steps out of bounds at about the 12 for yard line and that s gonna make it third down in five new in the backfield <person player="jd mckissic" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jd mckissic</person>k former wide receiver who is one of those lightningquick we saw in the first game of preseason this year he returned one over a hundred yards for a touchdown for the atlanta falcons he s flanked out there practice was picked up by seattle a couple of weeks back first down and they all become big at this point anytime you got your nose tackle trying to defend a hook zone usually it doesnt work right in behind a lodi nada and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> saw that one all the way and that is the basic mo of this detroit lions defense theyre going to give you a few things underneath i hope to never give you one over the top is the question and the official is looking in each other at the 23yard line theyre going to call the completion 42 yards any time youre asking a safety like <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon wilson</person> the cover <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> out of the slot all the way down the field watch this catch get those feet down spectacular he is one of the great fighters in the league <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> the fact that he s become the star little request is from there to take him down after a gain of a you talk about that combination of wilson took : how effective have these guys been close it s 2015 the beginning of last season 75 % 20 tds only for fitters and you go to the passer rating 120 63 there s only one combo better you got it breathing at <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock</person> cows key second and it s good stopping thomas rolls at the 15yard line setting up a third down and one a jean robinson with the tackle so youve got to be able to stop the run right so watch what <person player="kerry hyder" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kerry</person> haider does here comes down hard then they try and loop things around they have to do something to disrupt the flow of this running game of the seattle seahawks expect more of that right now they have got to start attacking here because the time is moving quickly on <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> third and one it is easy and well system to take a timeout play clock was down to three back at 30 seconds so third down and one up coming here nine and a half to go in the fourth quarter against seattle with a wind makes on the falcons next saturday that game in atlanta and if detroit wins the six goes to 1 and the 1 is at down other of course then if she playoff game is tomorrow to wrap up wildcard weekend with the giants taking on the packers at lambeau field all the tight ends pull back power football time here third and one unless they shift out and go empty if they do look at that at the 5yard line the ball may have come out as <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> is able to hang on to it keeps possession first and goal it s such a great ball because you go in you bring all these big guys in and they bring their big guys in and then <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> is covered by a linebacker <person player="josh bynes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">josh bynes</person> that s what youre looking for youre looking for the mismatches your best guy against the linebacker you take it all day nice call there by darrell bevell burst out of goal from the four for the texture two yards plays to turn it into a twopossession lead to get that block is so tough then you get to turn out right there but watch <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> he played tackle he played guard and now he plays center they have been looking for an answer at center since max unger left and they have founded this season and <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> great command up front top cable saying that young man <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> is the dynamic leader weve been waiting for look at pete carril pounding on darrell bevels back that was a great call on that next the point by houska is off the upright and no good system he s missed a few this season the 13point lead who enjoys himself on the sidelines more than pete carroll wilson to forward big play this is our game on nbc next sunday beginning at noon eastern time it s in kansas city and they will meet either the steelers or the texans and the steelers beat miami tomorrow it s pittsburgh if miami wins miami would go to new england at houston would go to kansas city so well be there at our head take it out of bounds of morality with 70 yard line with 843 left and a 13point seahawk lead the season the lions the comeback kings in the fourth quarter <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> guiding eight game winning drives the most in nfl history defense six takeaways in the final five minutes they trailed in every game this season except at the wallens <person player="matt prater" race="white" position="K">matt prater</person> for four for a 20 the temps so eight of their nine wins fourthquarter comebacks only one that wasnt was in new orleans can they pull off another one tonight and extend their season we think about like <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> im not tell you what the detroit lions for having some backup players in the game are doing a fantastic job this pass protection only allowed one sack against he s lucky that wasnt picked off that s <person player="deshawn shead" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deshawn</person> dead had it dropped it second down <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> got faked out by his own guy <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">anquan boldin</person> started to sit down and then made a late move and <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> threw it right to shed who dropped it on the inside receiver youll see it watch this late move and threw it right to second and ten works until we see who s that see mary there he brought and jones was together third down that s a battle <person player="eric ebron" race="nonwhite" position="TE">ebron</person> has to win it just has to win that battle this protection has been so good so amazingly good tonight he brings oneonone against <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> we got him rate of is the number one safety of football i get that but uber and past the windows back once again <person player="anquan boldin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">boldin</person> covered by shed <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> gets popped by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> fourth down here s what they do to set this up here s <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> so theyre gonna bring everybody this way and then <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> around the top he gets a good shot on <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> theyre one of the better blitzing rushing linebackers that there is to accept the kick to or pods averaging 48 per punt and makes it at the 16yard line so seattle play a little oclock movie with 751 to go in the fourth look at the nfc bracket or score on the left giants packers at lambeau tomorrow next week box well have it at 4:40 eastern time cowboys hosting the lowest remaining seed in the top khun s the highest where they exceed earlier that afternoon and it s real simple seattle we go to atlanta mrs rolls taking it up to the 21 yard line tremendous night he s carrying the ball 25 161 yards now this has been the one play the entire night im just trying to figure out where i am here this doubleteam coming right back in here to tie air <person player="tahir whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="LB">whitehead</person> there s just no way for him to get around that you know it s just you cant lose that badly on those double teams and the hard part for seattle fans has to be okay is this real or is this the detroit lions defense who struggled badly against green bay a week ago so the question it s a short game here rolls of nothing i was taking some time off the clock tackled air by taylor as we tick down under seven minutes to go in regulation you know and how good has this rushing game been the night for seattle <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> has one kneel down i mean this is a guy who when he runs the football makes huge differences in the game and theyve basically given him the night off which im sure is okay with him in the middle of this playoff run no doubt the walls to the bench we said the backfield flanking wilson well be another first down and more time will come off the clock <person player="crezdon butler" race="UNK" position="DB">butler</person> makes the tackle just so easy and <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> who s had a really nice game watch out casually he does this doesnt actually make contact to set up for the first down round on the outside dont run into him dont draw the foul worse that got to go around the top president <person player="crezdon butler" race="UNK" position="DB">butler</person> couldnt get there now for the 28 yard line on first down about that stiffarm knocked on carried to his backside <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> thought the biggest guy in the world watch this one like an alley jab 510 190 pounds undrafted out of stanford <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> he says sometimes he loves football so much it messes with personal relationships they have some intensity in this locker second college to the 33 we spent a lot of time here the seahawks weve covered him so much chris through the years you know there is there s a lot of intensity a lot of really smart guys a lot of guys who say a lot of stuff but there s a great vibe around the seahawks and has been for years you know and probably the thing i enjoy watching the most is we have the good fortune of getting to watch them practice on fridays these guys are practicing around the league it s not always that intense on friday in seattle on friday theyre getting out and of course there s the man he brings the play list it s very lively in any seahawks practice music is great thrown <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> with the ball bending the flag wash it covering did they trade for odell beckham fussier is unbelievable it s 27 years defense for 24 and so many times now you see these receivers doing this using their inside arm to hold off the defender and making the catch with one hand watch this tv does that just sort of hold them off on that backside didnt get any facemask or anything on it look at him snap his head down to the ball and make that catch they may have found a factor here you go back to the first touchdown of the game yeah one hand on the ball one hand on the face mask and that one worked right got away with it got to be happy for <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> though his first two years acl issue had the hamstring issue but now healthy and doing exactly what they thought he might do as a secondround draft pick from colorado start of the years number four he s now number three flag is down <person player="tahir whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="LB">whitehead</person> at <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> wilson were there twisting roughing the passer were 32 first down and that is <person player="tavon wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tavon wilson</person> of the safety <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bush</person> yeah we just talked about a nollie jab well this was a joe frazier a hook here watch this one whack doesnt have to necessarily be the head at her neck area muscle olsen like hair give me 15 yards you know yet i know weve talked about it but <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> what he did this year he had so many different injuries this season they were waking him up every hour and a half all through the night so he could get treatment so he didnt have to miss any games you never see him show much emotion on the field he just keeps delivered very underrated <person player="alex collins" race="UNK" position="RB">alex collins</person> again he was a gem they picked him in the third round looks like there might be columns whose still down it is and hell need some attention but every second at 7:00 when we come back <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> has written his name into the seahawk record book 163 yards breaking the old <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> of 157 set by marshawn lynch averaging 63 for carrion tell me i mean 34 looks like the old 24 breaking tackles tough running big night great offensive line play pete carroll give him credit he knew they were going to come out ill grant you the detroit lions has been on the short end of the stick on some calls tonight but that s not why theyre losing this time theyre losing this game too they couldnt stop the run couldnt stop the run 80 yards running versus lose a couple of yards here to the 24 yard line some big holes no question about it for <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> tonight but he has also taken advantage of some of these opportunities spun out made some nice plays a little more sun lynch like exactly what youre talking about guy with a big heart really does in the fact that able to come back i had to be so disappointed after he worked his way back from injury last year comes back breaks his leg early in the year and now here he is on the playoff run a healthy rose makes a big difference detroit by the way just took a timeout i mentioned before 18 different guys carried the ball for seattle is here randall some kept getting hurt kristen michael came in kirsten michael winds up as the leading rusher for the team this year now mercy s at green bay on our vacation towards a this sweet handle to get rid of the weak to conceive disappear tomorrow thirtyfive incomplete and getting up his <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> said he goes right over to carroll he says challenge that i caught it you know peep might he s got the flag pete sometimes let s see what happens he gets a little bit of proof i think that i dont think that ball over hit the ground now could you overturn it is there enough there to overturn it pete carroll i guarantee it gives us a try yeah he s got a pin i think it s a catch i do too i mean i havent seen anything yet he s joking he s controlling it scandal he s challenging the ruling on the field and complete pass well review the play you know how fast that ball would bounce up so bran allen goes under the hood we think that pete carroll is going to win this challenge and it s going to be a catch and now where exactly will they spot the ball because it s very close to what they call the line to gain that s the first down here comes brad allen to tell us about it battle like this coach wouldnt i tell you yeah it doesnt matter what you pin it against these on the ground and the ball is secure pretty amazing really but he knew right away didnt he he bounced right up now all receivers do that but it is a first down and a <person player="darius slay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius</person> lake gamble oh yeah been one of those kind of nights seems like the calls that could go their way didnt and the calls that they wanted to go the way didnt either so pete carroll is one of the most interesting head coaches ive ever been around he encourages guys to be themselves so anytime you see something on the seattle sideline or their locker room and you go that s crazy that s not what vince lombardi would do well that s right pete carroll says be yourself have some fun and when we were there to call the but fumble a few years ago and this was the fun reception now there s definitely been a few scenes on the sidelines so and everybody will tell you <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> can be the most intelligent clever guy in the world and then sometimes he goes the other way and open discussion on the sidelines sometimes leads to that but somehow it all kind of works doesnt it absolutely you know it s it s one thing to go off the reservation but you know these guys go off the reservation and then they come back on ya and pete every once awhile i look over and the <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> thing earlier this year he would look over and he goes camp <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> s got this and he turned back around and not worried about it because he has guys on the sidelines and they all love each other anytime you talk to them they go my brother this and i love that guy and that s what they talk about around seattle and it s mostly because pete carroll gives them a genius so 343 second down and nine detroit took its last timeout then i challenge it you get three receivers he stole absolutely two receivers person <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> to get there before curse cookers have a walkin standup touchdown right here and watch <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> steal it from them well it has been a onehanded catch show tonight for the seattle seahawks you got it i cant remember seeing a play like that can you did the two guys are right there well you dont design plays for two receivers to be in the exact same spot but when youre hot youre hot certainly not vertically that s 11 catches four pole with 104 yards to the point after and the seattle seahawks stamp their ticket to georgia that s gonna be a show let s go to my show well i know you guys have been waiting for your wildcard memes and here they are frigid temps expected in green bay tomorrow but when youre so hot the temperature does not matter it wont be much warmer in pittsburgh but abb says no worries cold never bothered me anyway meanwhile this is what it feels like when you just want to know who youre playing next and how about a little matt will fire + ice equals mvp for atlanta s bat ryan in the hut yeah im thinking you know if you gotta vote for mvp it s it s a close contest but you can make a case for a ton of guys but i thought its matt ryan s i went it was the hard i hated voting this year i really did matt ryan unbelievable year tom brady 28 touchdowns two interceptions unbelievable year what aaron rodgers did to lead his team back to the playoffs we saw him last unbelievable year i ultimately i voted for tom brady but i was tortured by it i really was i i dont know what else tom brady could have done this season missed the four games you factor that in and but he didnt register thomas rules mr like marshawn lynch around here right yeah my comments are earthquakes oh your beloved in every city why do you hate whitey right why do you hate everybody now it s gonna kick off <person player="andre roberts" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roberts</person> talk to the fans and mothers and listen to the radio etc etc and theyre all talking about the way it s ended with alternating wins and losses and never quite being right that you know maybe this is not the year gonna be too tough tell you what you come back to 2013 when they won the super bowl they were 2 &amp; 2 in their last four games and our guys theyll be able to pull this up but there s an amazing streak going of teams that have bad streaks to end the season that ended up doing great in the playoffs go back to baltimore ravens the whirling saint there s a bunch of them if everybody s talking but you have to be hot at the end of the year well yeah normally you want to be sometimes it doesnt matter here s snapper running out of us kenny hurt is telling me the last of the last ten super bowl winners these team here comes is going to come on a graphic they were 21 and 19 in well done their last four regular season games to the first forty super bowls almost all of those teams finished last ten not so much first out up at the 27yard line there s the lions that will go into the offseason then again futility you still cant win a postseason game longest championship droughts the lions 58 seasons but the cardinals and that encompasses chicago st louis and arizona 69 the cleveland indians 68 the sacramento kings 65 years is <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> throw by gelatin magnetic boots rochester cincinnati kansas city and sacramento so they had to keep moving out of town still after one you know it s hard to believe is how well this lions offensive line is played tonight and they havent scored any points you put the kibosh under snapper needs a little assistance in getting a <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> and <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> a roll with two guys with doubledigit sacks the season will maybe collect the half each they do <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">clark</person> it s a little shaken up the attend shacks during the regular year well play before the twominute warning on a second you see out of 49 the twominute warning comes with 156 remaining on this saturday night in the pacific northwest 66 see box postseason history the longest home winning streaks the packers between 39 and o2 on 13th strain the patriots between 97 to 2008 111 the seahawks will make it 10 so this is an ongoing streak and the bills won nine straight in buffalo between this week ten consecutive home game playoff wins for seattle volkswagen postgame report michelle them feel stars of the game mike tirico breaking down the brackets and well take a look ahead to tomorrow s wildcard matchups from the 49yard line stanford tonight 18 is 31 205 the big difference the one game between these two teams and that he will get <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> and uh one thing chris is we look at the sack again it s all coverage sacks it s really what it is this offensive lines done a nice job were going to get some garbage time sacks here at the end of this thing but whose coverage downfield much more and forth and thirteen nothing go for it <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">stafford</person> fires than a field talk about so much as made of getting the by in the playoffs and where you are in terms of seating you go back to three weeks before the season was ending and detroit was the number two seed number two stanford had the finger injury in chicago to go to new york and lose to the giants to go to dallas and if <person player="dwayne washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> wins last week it beats the giants theyre out of the playoffs period but they get in as the number 60 you know but they had a tough stretch there too but one of the reasons they had that good record is they had not played the giants or the cowboys or the packers yet so and all the other teams had in that division so tough jim caldwell though im telling ya i think theyve got something going on they have to be better though stopping the run they it s really what cost in the last couple of weeks 179 yards for seattle tonight on the ground huge night for <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> 161 <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> pitch the shutout i dont remember hardly anything going that way i mean basically once they left him on one side of the field you could see <person player="matthew stafford" race="white" position="QB">matthew stafford</person> said to heck with that side ill try the other way talking the seahawk facility today meeting with pete carril the lashing said to us he says i got to get to <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rawls</person> the ball 20 times you know we hear a lot of stuff and sometimes you have to leave it and sometimes you dont believe it at all it wasnt formed were able to do this without putting <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> in any kind of jeopardy here tonight couple of sacks but no big hits on him though russia s just had one kneel down and the seattle seahawks are moving on and the detroit lions go into the offseason to atlanta is the giant packer winter tomorrow goes to dallas the game is over final score 26 volkswagen postgame report coming right up you
